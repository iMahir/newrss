      "summary": "- The Netflix show *Adolescence* has renewed calls for social media bans globally, particularly in the UK, urging similar measures as Australia.\n- Australia's government describes its under-16 social media ban as “world-leading,” receiving praise from major media outlets like *Time*.\n- Critics, including mental health and LGBTQ+ groups, raised concerns during the bill's rushed review process, which lasted only one day despite over 15,000 submissions.\n- The ban is set to come into effect in December 2025, but details on its implementation remain unclear as trials of age-assurance technology are ongoing.\n- A major report by Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) is due soon, but preliminary findings will not be released publicly.\n- The government faces challenges regarding compliance from social media platforms, particularly regarding exemptions for YouTube that have created discontent among other platforms like TikTok and Meta.\n- Approximately 80% of children under 13 use social media, mostly through YouTube, complicating the understanding of platform usage among this age group.\n- Digital rights groups are notably absent from the advisory board overseeing the trial, raising further questions about the trial's integrity and execution.",

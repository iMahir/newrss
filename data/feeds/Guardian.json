      "summary": "- Daveed Diggs, winner of a Tony Award, explores sci-fi themes in underground rap as part of the trio Clipping.\n- Their new album, [Dead Channel Sky](https://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/dead-channel-sky), addresses issues like racial violence and capitalism.\n- The trio's music avoids first-person lyrics, allowing listeners to engage more personally with the characters in their songs.\n- They critique mainstream hip-hop for its narrow definitions of authenticity and linear storytelling.\n- The album features diverse musical styles, drawing influences from various dance sub-genres like big-beat and acid house.\n- Diggs cites William Gibson's [Neuromancer](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/26/william-gibson-neuromancer-book-club) as a major influence, framing their work within a critique of modern corporatism and its impact on society.\n- The album’s storytelling touches on colonialist wars as an analogy for contemporary societal issues, with reflections on how technology facilitates exploitation.",

      "summary": "- Derek Harris, an 89-year-old resident of Sharrington, is leading a campaign to save a historic phone box threatened by BT's closure plans.\n- The phone box is the last in the area and has been part of the village for over 50 years, facing previous threats of removal.\n- Harris argues that the box is vital for locals without mobile phone access, especially in emergencies when mobile signals are unreliable.\n- There are regulations that protect phone boxes, especially if they are the last available in an area or frequently used for emergency calls.\n- Sharrington’s phone box has seen fewer than 10 calls in the past year, but it is considered a heritage asset and a community resource.\n- Harris aims to connect the box to fibre optics as part of a modernization effort before the analog network is phased out in 2027.",

      "summary": "- Bitcoin experienced a 17.5% decline in February, marking its largest monthly loss since June 2022.\n- The price ended the month at approximately $84,252, hitting a three-month low of about $78,273.\n- This drop signifies a technical bear market, with prices now over 20% below the record high of $109,071 set in mid-January.\n- The decline is attributed to rising market volatility and concerns over a potential global trade war following Donald Trump's tariff announcements.\n- Negative sentiment among traders has been exacerbated by a cyber-attack on the Bybit exchange, resulting in the theft of $1.5 billion in digital assets.\n- Experts predict that without concrete regulatory support for cryptocurrencies from the Trump administration, negative market sentiment may persist.",

      "summary": "- New tariffs in the US are expected to increase costs for new smartphones and repairs.\n- Repair companies, like iFixit, anticipate higher parts prices but repairs will still be cheaper than buying new devices.\n- Major smartphone parts are largely sourced from outside the US, triggering significant tariff costs of over 100% for China and up to 26% for India.\n- Tariffs may increase demand for repairs and refurbishment, making repair more viable due to high new device costs.\n- Repair shops are preparing for a 20% increase in parts costs.\n- Secondhand device marketplaces like Swappa are likely to see increased sales as consumers look for alternatives to new devices.",

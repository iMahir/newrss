      "summary": "- The value of Elon Musk’s platform X has soared back to the $44bn he purchased it for.  \n- Investors valued it at $44bn in a secondary deal, a significant increase from a $10bn valuation by Fidelity in September.  \n- X is attempting to raise $2bn in new equity as it faces over $1bn in junior debt.  \n- Musk has faced declining revenue since acquiring the platform but reported adjusted profits of $1.2bn last year.  \n- The valuation rebound is attributed to a secondary deal that will help set a price for the primary funding round.",

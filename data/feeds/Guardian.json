      "summary": "- Noise-cancelling headphones are valued for reducing background noise but may impair auditory skills.\n- Audiologists report an increase in adults with auditory processing issues, not due to ear health but brain function.\n- Concerns arise that excessive use of noise-cancelling tech could weaken the brain’s ability to process multiple sound sources.\n- The condition known as auditory processing disorder (APD) traditionally diagnosed in children is now seen in adults, possibly due to technology use.\n- Lack of scientific evidence linking headphones to APD raises the need for further studies, especially on impacts of long-term use in younger users.\n- APD affects about 3-5% of children, linked to issues like low birth weight and chronic ear infections.\n- Experts suggest that while benefits of noise-cancelling are recognized, risks warrant more in-depth research, especially regarding impact on children’s auditory skills.",

      "summary": "- Security and privacy advocates are preparing against Microsoft's Recall feature in Windows 11, which captures user activity every three seconds.\n- Recall was initially criticized for potential misuse by malicious actors and risks in sensitive situations.\n- After a suspension due to backlash, Microsoft announced the reintroduction of Recall, available first to insiders in Windows 11 Build 26100.3902, with plans for broader rollout later.\n- Microsoft emphasizes user control with opt-in for snapshots and the ability to pause the feature, though skepticism remains about its acceptance among users.",

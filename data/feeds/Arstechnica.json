      "summary": "- Extracting usable data from PDFs remains challenging for businesses, governments, and researchers due to their rigid format.\n- Many PDFs contain images of text, requiring Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert them into machine-readable data.\n- Traditional OCR has limitations with complex layouts, unusual fonts, and poor image quality.\n- Approximately 80-90% of organizational data is unstructured and locked in documents like PDFs.\n- The issue severely impacts industries relying on documentation like insurance and journalism, especially for information older than 20 years.\n- AI advancements are providing new solutions but come with drawbacks such as hallucinations and misinterpretation of data.\n- Models like Google's Gemini 2.0 currently excel in document processing, handling diverse text and layouts with fewer errors.",

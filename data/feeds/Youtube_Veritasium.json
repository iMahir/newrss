      "summary": "This analysis reveals that even Tom Brady's throws are not perfect spirals but include a slight wobble and curve essential for optimal flight. The spin stabilizes the football in flight, reducing drag and increasing accuracy, which is a fundamental but often misunderstood principle crucial for players and fans alike.",

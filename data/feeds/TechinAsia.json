      "summary": "- Scientists are using AI to enhance animal welfare by detecting facial expressions that indicate stress, pain, or discomfort.\n- The notable system, Intellipig, was developed by researchers from the University of the West of England Bristol (UWE) and Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC).\n- Intellipig uses cameras to analyze pigs’ facial features as they enter feeding stalls, alerting farmers to signs of distress.\n- AI applications in animal welfare extend to various species, including horses, cats, and sheep.\n- Researchers have developed algorithms that detect pain or stress by identifying facial points such as the edges of the eyes and nostrils.\n- These systems can perform tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, detecting subtle facial movements that might go unnoticed.\n- Experts emphasize the need for oversight and continued refinement to capture more complex aspects of animal emotions.",

      "summary": "- [Shein](https://pollinations.ai/referral?topic=shein) has requested key suppliers in China to set up production in Vietnam due to new US tariffs on imports from China.\n- This move aims to mitigate the impact of the eliminated \"de minimis\" rule that previously exempted low-value shipments from tariffs.\n- Shein is allowing longer production timelines for suppliers but clarifies it has no plans to increase production capacity in Vietnam significantly.",

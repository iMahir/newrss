      "summary": "- Steven Adler, an AI researcher and safety officer at OpenAI, resigned due to concerns about the rapid pace of AI development.\n- He worked at OpenAI since March 2022, eight months before the launch of ChatGPT, and is worried about artificial general intelligence (AGI) potentially exceeding human intelligence.\n- Adler warned that the global race to achieve AGI is a 'very risky gamble' and that the urgency could compromise vital safety measures.\n- He emphasized the difficulties in ensuring AI systems' goals align with human values, highlighting the challenges of AI alignment.\n- Despite assurances from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that AGI should benefit humanity, Adler hopes AI labs will adopt stronger safety regulations.\n- He pointed out the increasing competition with the launch of DeepSeek by a Chinese startup and stressed the need for collaboration to mitigate AI risks.",

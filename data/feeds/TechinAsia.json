      "summary": "- Bizcap, an Australian non-bank lender, has launched in Singapore, its fourth market after Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.\n- The company has funded over SG$6 million (US$4.46 million) since its entry and partnered with over 100 local brokers.\n- Loans range from SG$5,000 (US$3,720) to SG$500,000 (US$372,051) with assessments taking under four hours and plans for same-day funding.\n- New products, including caveat-secured loans and a revolving line of credit, will be introduced within 6 to 12 months.\n- Bizcap aims to expand into other Asian markets in the next three years while enhancing tools for brokers and growing its local team.\n- The alternative lending market in Singapore is projected to grow from US$2.90 billion in 2023 to US$6.78 billion by 2028, driven by a financing gap for SMEs.\n- Bizcap's use of automated bank statement aggregation and open banking for credit assessment reflects a shift in evaluating SME creditworthiness.\n- Rapid assessment times and same-day funding are key competitive advantages for Bizcap in the crowded alternative lending market.",

      "summary": "- A US District Court judge allows most of the New York Times’ lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft to proceed.\n- The lawsuit, filed in late 2023, claims copyright infringement for using Times’ content to train AI models.\n- Judge Sidney Stein rejected motions to dismiss related to indirect liability and older copyrighted works, but partially dismissed claims on copyright management information.\n- The case represents a significant legal challenge by a news publisher against AI companies, with other publishers joining the lawsuit.\n- The ruling occurs amid debates on whether AI's use of publicly available data qualifies as \"fair use\"; a court decision on a jury trial will follow discovery.",

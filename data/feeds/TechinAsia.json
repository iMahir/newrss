      "summary": "- Delivery of BYD Korea’s Atto 3 electric SUV has been delayed due to non-compliance with updated subsidy requirements from South Korea’s Ministry of Environment.\n- Over 1,000 preordered units are currently stored at a port in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, pending approval.\n- The ministry's revised rules mandate a battery state of charge (SoC) function for electric vehicles, which allows drivers to monitor battery energy levels.\n- BYD Korea plans to update the Atto 3’s software to meet this requirement within a year, but approval of this adjustment is still pending.",

      "summary": "- Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dropped over 2,900 points on April 7, an 8.8% decline, marking its third-largest intraday drop on record.\n- The fall was triggered by rising US-China trade tensions and the possibility of a 24% tariff on Japanese goods.\n- This decline reflects similar losses in the US market, where the Dow Jones fell 5.5% on April 4, its third-largest one-day drop in history.\n- Experts caution that if tariff conflicts persist, the Nikkei may drop below 30,000, further straining Japan’s fragile economy.",

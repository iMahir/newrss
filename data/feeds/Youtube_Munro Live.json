      "summary": "- Serve Robotics, founded by Ali Kashani after a spin-off from Uber/Postmates, builds autonomous delivery robots operating in cities like Los Angeles, Miami, and Dallas, already completing deliveries from 1,500 restaurants.\n- Their robots use *embodied AI* to navigate unpredictable urban environments, handling obstacles like uneven sidewalks and even unexpected events such as goats on sidewalks, achieving 99.8% delivery reliability—much higher than human drivers.\n- The company aims to reduce delivery costs from about $10 to $1 by automating last-mile delivery, leveraging AI both for real-time navigation and for off-robot decision-making, while anticipating further integration of generative AI and advanced models as technology evolves.",

      "summary": "- *Private equity* has grown massively over the past 20 years, fueled by extensive borrowing and complex financial structures involving *leverage on leverage*.  \n- Despite its growth, private equity investments face increasing challenges: *harder-to-find deals*, *high fees*, and *returns not justifying the risks*, plus growing exposure to bad loans affecting wider markets.  \n- Originally successful by improving small businesses directly, private equity now suffers as the industry ballooned, becoming a *debt-driven, opaque system* that primarily benefits insiders at the expense of average investors.",

      "summary": "- The 'Bank of Mom and Dad' has become a major financial lender, with parents funding adult children's housing and living costs, often more than their own retirement savings.\n- This parental financial support creates disparities, disadvantaging those without family funds and often leaving parents financially strained.\n- Reverse mortgages and early inheritance trends illustrate complex financial strategies families use, highlighting systemic issues around wealth, debt, and opportunity.\n",

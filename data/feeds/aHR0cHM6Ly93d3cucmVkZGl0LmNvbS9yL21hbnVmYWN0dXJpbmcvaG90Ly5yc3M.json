It advocates continuous, system-driven compliance using SOPs, ERP-like tools, and EHS platforms to prevent crisis updates while noting investment barriers when leadership does not see immediate value. The discussion highlights drift in training records and inventories, the difficulty of locating documents, and recommends internal audits 30–60 days before external reviews to address issues early. Larger organizations tend to keep up-to-date documentation; smaller firms often scramble. Overall, audits are described as largely about paperwork, underscoring the need for persistent maintenance over last-minute tidying to achieve real compliance and avoid costly failures.",

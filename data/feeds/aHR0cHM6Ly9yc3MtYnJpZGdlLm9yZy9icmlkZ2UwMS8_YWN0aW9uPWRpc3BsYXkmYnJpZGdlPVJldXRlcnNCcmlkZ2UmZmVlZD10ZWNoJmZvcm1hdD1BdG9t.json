      "summary": "Switzerland’s Interior Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider signaled openness to restricting social media for minors, saying she would study measures inspired by Australia’s under-16 ban and EU debates. A report will guide next steps, with options including a full ban on social platforms for children, limits on harmful content, and curbing algorithmic targeting of youth; platforms could also be held responsible for what children consume. The discussion follows a separate move by the canton of Fribourg to bar mobile phones for students until around age 15 to reduce youth device use.",

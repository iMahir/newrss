      "summary": "- Q2 earnings are expected to have peaked as cement prices stay largely flat and *capacity additions* push up costs, capping gains.\n- GST reduction to 18% is driving *price moderation*; experts expect the next price uptick only in Q1FY27E, while higher *petcoke* costs and rising fuel prices weigh on margins.\n- UltraTech Cement and Adani Cement may post *double-digit volume growth*, with *EBITDA per tonne* seen at ₹850–1,150; profits could double on a low base, though EBITDA per tonne may be lower sequentially for the first time in three quarters.",

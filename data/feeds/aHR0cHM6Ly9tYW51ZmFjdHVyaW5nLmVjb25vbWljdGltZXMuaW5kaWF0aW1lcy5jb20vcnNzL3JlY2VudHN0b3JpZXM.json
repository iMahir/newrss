      "summary": "- AI-driven data center demand is lifting electricity use and prices in PJM, reviving older oil- and gas-fired peaker plants such as Fisk in Houston.\n- Utilities have postponed retirements for many peaker units as demand spikes, raising pollution and costs per kilowatt-hour while helping avert blackouts.\n- The Fisk site sits on a former coal plant site, illustrating a broader trend of delaying retirements in PJM across legacy plants.",

      "summary": "- The ISS orbits Earth at 28,000 km/h, acting as a **fragile, multinational research outpost** where astronauts face extreme conditions and razor-thin margins for error.  \n- Inside, the crew manages complex life support and power systems, including a thermal control system maintaining temperatures between **18°C and 24°C** and solar panels generating essential electricity.  \n- Critical moments include high-risk spacewalks to repair damaged solar arrays with makeshift tools and welcome new modules, all while conducting innovative experiments that could benefit life on Earth.",

      "summary": "- In 1983, Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov prevented a potential nuclear war by correctly identifying a false alarm generated by the Soviet early warning satellite system, Oko, which mistook sunlight reflections for missile launches.  \n- Despite immense pressure and the high stakes of mutually assured destruction during a tense period of the Cold War, Petrov relied on his instincts and knowledge instead of blindly following protocols, thereby averting a catastrophic retaliatory strike.  \n- Petrov was never publicly recognized or honored by the Soviet military for his courageous decision; instead, he faced reprimand and later quietly left the military, with his heroic act remaining largely unknown for years.",

      "summary": "- Digit, a *humanoid robot*, has moved over 100,000 totes at GXO’s Flowery Branch facility, proving it can operate in existing facilities without major infrastructure changes and handle varied tasks in the same workflow.\n- Agility uses a practical AI pipeline—combining traditional control, teleoperation, reinforcement learning, and simulation—to enable *dynamic balancing* and *vision-driven grasping* that adapt to changing environments and real-world workflows.\n- **Safety** and **trust** are prioritized as Digit stays in long-term production settings, building a model for safe human–robot collaboration and enabling scalable adoption of humanoid automation.",

Razer’s Cooling Pad may provide additional performance but adds cost and noise.  \n- The RTX 5090 shows about 20% more efficiency compared to the 4090, but the reviewer found battery performance disappointing under light workloads, struggling to last a full workday.  \n- Overall, while the laptop has attractive features for gaming and productivity, its high price and technical reliability issues raise concerns for potential buyers.",

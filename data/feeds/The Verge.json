      "summary": "- President Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported vehicles have taken effect, causing panic in the auto industry.\n- Analysts predict price hikes of $5,000 to $10,000 on new cars, complicating the already challenging affordability for consumers.\n- The tariffs will disrupt a complex supply chain, raising manufacturing costs significantly, especially for battery-electric crossover SUVs.\n- Many affordable cars are produced outside the US, meaning the tariffs will hit consumers hardest in the budget segment.\n- Consumers are experiencing financial stress with extended loans, and panic shopping is rising as people rush to buy cars before prices increase.\n- Automakers are responding with discounts and temporary layoffs to manage the fallout from the tariffs.\n- The Trump administration is exploring tax breaks and deregulation as potential relief measures for car buyers.",

      "summary": "- President Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports into the US, including from uninhabited islands, leading to confusion and negative reactions.\n- The tariff calculations reportedly mirror a simplified formula recommended by several major AI chatbots, dividing a country's trade deficit by total exports to the US and halving it for a 'discounted reciprocal tariff.'\n- Stock markets dropped sharply due to the announcement, and consumers are bracing for price increases.\n- The White House published its own calculation method in response to critiques but resembles the aforementioned AI-recommended formula, sparking debate on its validity and consequences for global trade starting April 5th.",

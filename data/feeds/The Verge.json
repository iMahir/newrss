      "summary": "- ChatGPT's image generator spurred a new LinkedIn trend of users creating AI-generated toy versions of themselves.\n- The “AI Action Figure” variant has become popular, featuring users as toys in blister packs with accessories like laptops and coffee cups.\n- The trend has spread to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, but is not as popular as the previous Studio Ghibli art trend.\n- Concerns over copyright and ethical issues noted with the Ghibli trend have yet to arise with this new trend.\n- While LinkedIn is the primary platform for this trend, engagement is low, with brands like Mac and NYX jumping in, but no major celebrities have participated.",

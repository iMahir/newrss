      "summary": "- President Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports into the US, including from uninhabited islands, leading to confusion and negative reactions.\n- The tariff calculations reportedly mirror a simplified formula recommended by several major AI chatbots, dividing a country's trade deficit by total exports to the US and halving it for a 'discounted reciprocal tariff.'\n- Stock markets dropped sharply due to the announcement, and consumers are bracing for price increases.\n- The White House published its own calculation method in response to critiques but resembles the aforementioned AI-recommended formula, sparking debate on its validity and consequences for global trade starting April 5th.",

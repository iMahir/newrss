      "summary": "- The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation reveals Apple and Google hinder competition in mobile browsers.\n- Apple requires all iOS browsers to use its WebKit engine, limiting competition, while Google’s Android also restricts options.\n- Concerns include Safari being default on iPhones and Chrome on Android, reducing user awareness of alternatives.\n- Both companies made some changes to improve browser choice since the provisional findings in November.\n- CMA suggests remedies including allowing alternative engines on iOS and a browser choice screen at setup, though currently unenforceable.\n- Separate CMA investigations into Apple and Google’s ecosystems are ongoing, with potential to designate them as having strategic market status (SMS).",

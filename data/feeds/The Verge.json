      "summary": "- US residents are part of what’s been called the \"dumbest trade war in history\" due to tariffs imposed by Trump on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico.\n- A 10% tax on Chinese goods took effect in February, with an additional 10% added recently; a 25% tax on Canadian and Mexican goods began on March 4th.\n- Tariffs, defined as taxes on imported goods, are mainly paid by the importers but are likely to be passed on to consumers.\n- Economists assert that tariffs ultimately burden consumers and have noted that previous tariffs led to increased prices for goods like washing machines.\n- Trump's approach to tariffs, including questioning their legality under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, has drawn criticism from experts.\n- There is skepticism about whether tariffs truly lead to job creation in the US, with evidence suggesting that costs associated with tariffs often outweigh job gains.",

      "summary": "- Hulu cut off its live feed before the Best Actress and Best Picture winners were announced during the Oscars.\n- Viewers received a message stating \"the live event has now ended,\" prompting complaints on social media.\n- The premature end likely resulted from an incorrectly set broadcast end time of 10:32 PM, coinciding with the planned conclusion of the event.\n- Earlier, Hulu acknowledged login issues for some users which were resolved shortly before 9 PM ET.\n- Unlike Hulu viewers, cable viewers and those using TV antennas did not face this streaming issue as they received the uninterrupted broadcast.",

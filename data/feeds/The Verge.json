      "summary": "- The Casio Ring Watch, priced at $120, is designed to celebrate Casio's 50th anniversary.\n- It is a tiny watch that fits on a finger, reminiscent of vintage watch rings from the '80s and '90s.\n- The watch offers features like a stopwatch, alarm, and dual timezone but lacks fitness tracking.\n- Currently, the ring watch is hard to find on the market, with prices exceeding $300 on eBay.\n- Available only in a single size (10.5), it includes spacers for smaller fingers, but larger sizes are not accommodated.\n- Users report receiving numerous compliments on the watch, enhancing its appeal beyond practicality.\n- The battery lasts around two years without needing charging, making it low maintenance.\n- The watch has quirky functionality, allowing discreet time-checking during conversations without being rude.",

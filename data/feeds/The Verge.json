      "summary": "- The Jakcom N3 Smart Nail Chip uses NFC technology to allow users to send data to their phone by tapping it to the nail.\n- It is inexpensive, with prices ranging around $20 for sets of chips.\n- Users can program the chip to link to social media, e-commerce, and other functions, though the data storage interface is described as confusing.\n- The chip's application can be challenging; it requires precise placement and may not be durable in wet conditions.\n- After several trials, the best placement was found to be under the edge of medium-to-long press-on nails for optimal scanning.\n- Using Apple’s Shortcuts app expands the chip's functions significantly, allowing automation like sending messages or performing tasks with a quick scan.",

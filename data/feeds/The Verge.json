      "summary": "- Garmin has introduced a new subscription for the Garmin Connect app, adding premium features that were previously free.\n- Polar has also launched a premium subscription called Polar Fitness Plan, requiring long-time users to pay for previously free training plans.\n- The trend towards subscriptions in the wearable technology sector has been influenced by the shift from hardware to services, starting with events like Apple’s in 2019.\n- Experts suggest that rising hardware costs due to tariffs may push companies to increase subscription services as a revenue model.\n- There is consumer resistance to paying for previously free features, as evidenced by backlash against subscription models from various tech companies.",

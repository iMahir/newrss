      "summary": "- President Trump announced a 75-day delay on TikTok's sale-or-ban deadline, prompting criticism from Senate Intelligence Committee members.\n- Senator Mark Warner described the delay as illegal and a sham if the app‚Äôs algorithm remains under Beijing's control.\n- House Republicans emphasized the urgency of adhering to U.S. law to prevent Chinese access to American user data.\n- Previous bipartisan legislation aimed to address security risks related to TikTok, upheld by the Supreme Court, faced new legal uncertainty due to Trump's actions.\n- Democrats in Congress are urging Trump to seek collaboration rather than unilaterally extending deadlines to avoid legal complications for tech companies.",

      "summary": "- Citibank revealed that the FBI, EPA, and Treasury requested freezing accounts of nonprofits and state agencies associated with the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.\n- The freezes took place in February, and court documents recently disclosed details, including which nonprofits are under scrutiny.\n- The funding comes from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allocated funds for clean technology projects, with Citibank administering the financing.\n- Agencies like Habitat for Humanity and United Way have been affected, and some nonprofits have sued Citibank to unfreeze their accounts.\n- EPA administrator Lee Zeldin raised concerns about fraud related to the funds without providing evidence, leading to court questioning about the legitimacy of the accusations.",

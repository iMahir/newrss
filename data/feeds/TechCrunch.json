      "summary": "- The Trump administration directed the NIH to limit specific types of funding for research institutions.\n- A federal judge temporarily blocked this policy change, but funding for early-stage biotech startups may still be delayed or eliminated.\n- In response to this uncertainty, a new pre-seed venture fund called Altitude Lab Pre-seed Venture Fund has been launched.\n- The fund aims to invest $100,000 to $250,000 in 10 to 15 biotech companies, especially those qualified for NIH's SBIR grants.\n- The fund will be managed by Altitude Lab, a non-profit life sciences accelerator established by Recursion.\n- Recursion's CEO, Chris Gibson, emphasizes the importance of SBIR funding for biotech startups and their chances of raising private money.\n- The fund will also provide office and lab space for a year to supported startups in Salt Lake City, aspiring to create a biotech ecosystem.",

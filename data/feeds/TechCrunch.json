      "summary": "- JetBrains launched a new AI coding agent named [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/) for its IDEs.\n- Junie is designed to handle routine development tasks and understand existing projects for feature extensions.\n- It scored 53.6% on the SWEBench Verified benchmark of 500 developer tasks, which is considered promising, though lower than top competitors.\n- The service is tightly integrated with JetBrains IDEs, maintains human control, and aims to improve code quality.\n- Currently in an early access program, Junie is available only on Linux and Mac for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and PyCharm Professional, with WebStorm support coming soon.",

      "summary": "- Didi is seeking new funding for its autonomous vehicle unit, potentially valuing it at $5 billion.\n- High investor interest in self-driving technology is noted, influenced by recent IPOs from WeRide and Pony AI.\n- Didi's self-driving unit has raised $1.55 billion to date and is in discussions to raise more funds.\n- Currently testing around 200 autonomous vehicles in major Chinese cities but has not yet launched commercial operations.\n- Funds may aid in further development of AV technology and mass production of electric robotaxis, expected to begin in 2025.",

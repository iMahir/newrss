      "summary": "- The U.S. may unlock 76 GW of new power capacity by slightly reducing data center power consumption for a few hours annually.\n- By limiting usage to 90% of maximum draw, data centers can contribute significantly to managing peak electricity demand.\n- Flexible power use strategies, such as shifting tasks to off-peak hours or using alternative power sources like batteries, can enhance demand response capabilities.",

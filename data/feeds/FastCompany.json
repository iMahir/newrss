Sam Liccardo sponsors a bill targeting President Trump's meme coin.\n- The bill, called the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, seeks to prohibit the president and senior officials from issuing or sponsoring meme coins.\n- Meme coins, initially starting as jokes, have raised concerns regarding ethics, transparency, and insider trading in the crypto market.\n- Liccardo's bill is symbolic, as it is unlikely to pass in the current Republican-controlled Congress, but he believes it addresses corruption.\n- The value of Trump's meme coin surged initially but dropped significantly, affecting many investors, raising complaints about potential Ponzi-like characteristics.",

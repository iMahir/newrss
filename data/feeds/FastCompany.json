      "summary": "- NATO increases surveillance in the Baltic Sea due to rising concerns over damaged underwater cables and pipelines.\n- A new mission named “Baltic Sentry” is launched to protect critical underwater infrastructure.\n- 11 cables have been reported damaged since October 2023, raising suspicions of deliberate sabotage amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.\n- Investigations suggest recent damage may be accidental, caused by ships and anchors, rather than deliberate attacks.",

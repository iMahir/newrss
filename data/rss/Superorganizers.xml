<figcaption>Image illustrating the business acquisition process.</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses the experience of acquiring a business with little to no upfront cash by leveraging negotiation skills and understanding business dynamics.</p>
<ul>
<li>The author, Justin Mares, shares his journey of buying a SaaS business called Notify.</li>
<li>He outlines the criteria for a potential acquisition: solving existing problems, profitability, and maintainability.</li>
<li>Mares and his partner identified Notify as a promising opportunity after experiencing a significant uplift in sales from its usage.</li>
<li>They negotiated to purchase the business with payments structured to begin after the acquisition, allowing them to use the business's revenue for payment.</li>
<li>Notify eventually rebranded as Fomo and has since become a successful software company.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"You can actually buy some of them for $0 up front, if you negotiate properly and find a motivated seller."</blockquote>
<p>This story illustrates that with the right approach, buying a business doesn't necessarily require substantial initial capital, but rather a strategic mindset and willingness to negotiate effectively.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Effective altruism and rationality</figcaption>
<p>This article explores the current crisis facing effective altruism and the philosophical implications of its failure, especially in the context of recent controversies involving high-profile figures.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Effective altruism is challenged by the actions of individuals who appeared to embody its principles, yet strayed into fraud.</li>
  <li>The failure raises questions about the philosophical underpinnings of effective altruism and rationality.</li>
  <li>Utilitarianism, which drives effective altruism, can lead to morally questionable outcomes (repugnant conclusions).</li>
  <li>There is a need for frameworks that prevent ethical systems from being exploited for harmful purposes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“How much good is it if it keeps being co-opted by stupid people to do bad things?”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the article asserts the importance of reflecting on philosophical commitments and their real-world consequences to avoid repeating failures in ethical thinking and practice.</p>]]></description>

<p>This essay discusses the transformative power of courage in the face of fear, illustrated through the story of Nike's Phil Knight, who overcame significant challenges to pursue his dream.</p>
<img src='link_to_image_if_available' alt='Nike logo' />
<figcaption>Nike logo representing the brand's journey</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>Phil Knight started with a booming sneaker business but faced a major setback with a letter claiming his exclusive rights to sell shoes.</li>
  <li>In a moment of despair, he chose to confront his fears instead of giving up, flying back to Japan to negotiate for rights.</li>
  <li>This determination led to the establishment of Nike, illustrating the importance of facing fears to achieve success.</li>
  <li>The essay emphasizes that people often avoid fear rather than confront it, hindering potential successes.</li>
  <li>It suggests methods to cultivate courage and effectively handle anxiety and fears.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Avoidance of fear is one of the biggest things holding all of us back in our lives.”</blockquote>

<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creative processes should embrace all outputs, not just those deemed beautiful.</li>
  <li>Annie Dillard’s work illustrates how nature's beauty emerges from its complexity and variety.</li>
  <li>Creation exists through evolution, which values freedom, death, and time.</li>
  <li>We often judge our creations too harshly, stifling our ability to explore and innovate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Evolution loves death, more than it loves you and me.”</blockquote>

<p>Brian Rutenberg is a celebrated abstract painter whose daily routines reflect both discipline and chaos. He follows a strict schedule every day, yet his creative process is profoundly messy, highlighting the contrasts between routine and artistic freedom.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rutenberg wakes up at 7:10 AM, starting his day with a consistent routine that includes gym time and breakfast.</li>
  <li>He creates his art in what he describes as a 'festering hellhole,' underscoring the notion that creativity can thrive in disorder.</li>
  <li>Rutenberg emphasizes hard work and discipline above inspiration, stating that 'life's only commodity is time.'</li>
  <li>He uses unconventional methods to stay organized, including using a lamp as a reminder system for his tasks.</li>
  <li>Despite the chaos, he maintains that his studio operates like a well-oiled machine, completing projects on time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All the talent in the world is meaningless without an atomic work ethic.”</blockquote>
<p>Rutenberg’s reflections on routine and creativity serve as inspiration for both artists and those navigating their own professional paths.</p>]]></description>

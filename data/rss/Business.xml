<p>The unstoppable ascent of Apple in India reaches a new milestone. For the first time, Apple has broken into India's top five smartphone brands, achieving a remarkable 9–10% market share during the festive September–December period of 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple achieved a historic market share of 9–10% during the September-December 2024 period.</li>
<li>This marks Apple's first entry into the top five smartphone brands in India since launching iPhones.</li>
<li>Promotions like festive discounts and no-cost EMIs boosted sales significantly.</li>
<li>Older-generation models, particularly the iPhone 15 and iPhone 13, played a key role in this growth.</li>
<li>IDC research director Upasana Joshi noted that e-tailer deals contributed to high growth for Apple over the year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Apple set a record by entering the top five vendor list for the Indian smartphone market in Q4 2024 with a market share exceeding 9%.” - Upasana Joshi, Research Director at IDC</blockquote>
<p>This achievement reflects Apple's increasing popularity and strategic marketing efforts in the Indian smartphone market.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>‘India Has Missed the GenAI Bus and No Amount of Funds Can Cover it’</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Analytics India Magazine</p>
<p>India is struggling to catch up in the generative AI landscape dominated by global players despite significant investment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India raised $11.3 billion in tech funding in 2024, significantly less than the West’s $184 billion.</li>
  <li>HCLTech aims to implement AI services for 100 clients by FY26. The cost of using LLMs has dropped 85% since early 2023.</li>
  <li>Experts highlight that India lacks foundational research in crucial AI technologies.</li>
  <li>Predictions suggest India may have around 100 AI unicorns in the next decade, but funding remains drastically lower than international counterparts.</li>
  <li>Calls for increasing government investment in AI research have been made, advocating for a shift from short-term gains to long-term innovation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The pace of AI progress is so rapid that we simply cannot catch up by relying on engineers and researchers alone.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, unless India enhances its investment and shifts focus towards foundational AI research, it risks falling further behind in the global AI race.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 16, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>Adani Wilmar's stock remained flat following the announcement of a 13.51 percent stake sale by Adani Commodities LLP, reflecting cautious investor sentiment despite gains in other Adani Group stocks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adani Commodities LLP sold 17,56,01,314 equity shares.</li>
  <li>The stake sale was conducted on January 10 and 13, 2025, via an OFS mechanism.</li>
  <li>Despite the sale, Adani Wilmar's shares did not respond well, dropping below recent highs.</li>
  <li>Other Adani Group companies saw increase in stock prices after Hindenburg Research ceased operations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As I’ve shared with family, friends, and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research.” - Nathan Anderson</blockquote>
<p>The sale indicates a strategic move amidst regulatory compliance, but highlights challenges in Adani Wilmar’s market performance.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Tata Motors share price has seen a significant decline recently.</figcaption>
<p>Tata Motors shares have seen a strong correction, crashing over 37% in the past five months from their all-time high level, returning to levels not seen in a year. Investors are speculating on the stock's future performance as it currently trades below major moving averages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tata Motors yielded a negative return of nearly 6% in 2024, contrasting with the Sensex's 8.6% gain.</li>
<li>The significant decline is attributed to weak performance in commercial vehicles and EV sales, alongside pressures from Jaguar Land Rover.</li>
<li>Analysts suggest a potential bounce back may occur, fueled by favorable candlestick patterns and chart support.</li>
<li>Current trading at Rs 745.70, with recommendations to buy, maintaining a stop loss at Rs 717.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is a good expectation of a bounce back in Tata Motors.” - ET NOW Analyst</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Gold Outshines Equities in 2024: A Look at the Drivers Behind the Divergence</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 24, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Upstox</p>
<img src="https://assets.upstox.com/content/assets/images/cms/20241224/unnamed.webp" alt="Gold performance chart">
<figcaption>Gold's impressive return compared to equities in 2024.</figcaption>
<p>The year 2024 has seen a stark difference in performance between gold and equities, with gold delivering 20.5% YTD returns while equities produced a modest 8.9% YTD. This article explores the reasons behind these diverging trends.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gold's Safe-Haven Appeal:</strong> Gold acted as a refuge during market uncertainty, resulting in higher demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> Increased consumer demand, particularly in India and China, has supported gold prices.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy Support:</strong> Changes to long-term capital gains tax have made gold investments more attractive.</li>
  <li><strong>Equities Underperform:</strong> Equities faced challenges like earnings slowdowns and inflation issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Market Outlook:</strong> Future performance for both asset classes is influenced by economic and geopolitical factors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“2024 was a year in which gold proved its worth, emerging as one of the top-performing assets amid uncertainty.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, despite gold's outperformance, there is a potential for equities to recover if economic conditions improve. Investors should remain vigilant and consider diversification in their portfolios as the market evolves.</p>]]></description>

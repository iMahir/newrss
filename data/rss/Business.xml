<p>An Indian entrepreneur's story of how his thriving business was allegedly destroyed by e-commerce giant Amazon has gone viral on social media, shedding light on the challenges faced by small businesses competing against the dominance of larger corporations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The founder, Saumil Tripathi, of Grapevine, shared the story of a startup that made Rs 20 lakh daily before its downfall.</li>
  <li>The startup offered affordable home storage solutions, sourcing products that were significantly cheaper than those on Amazon.</li>
  <li>After declining a nine-figure acquisition offer from Amazon, the startup faced fierce competition when Amazon launched a competing private-label brand.</li>
  <li>The entrepreneur's efforts to cut prices were ineffective against Amazon's ability to undercut further, leading to financial losses.</li>
  <li>Despite challenges, the founder retains financial security but has lost his vision of creating generational wealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I went from selling 20L of products per day to watching my generational-wealth dream crumble." — Saumil Tripathi</blockquote>
<p>The narrative illustrates the overwhelming challenges small businesses face in the e-commerce landscape dominated by giants like Amazon, raising questions about fair competition and market practices.</p>]]></description>

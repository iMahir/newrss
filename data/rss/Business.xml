            <description><![CDATA[<h1>EPFO Withdrawal from ATMs Set to Launch Soon</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Recent <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>Good news for over seven crore of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscribers. Members of the retirement fund body EPFO may soon be able to withdraw their provident fund (PF) money directly from ATMs after the settlement.</p>
<h2>EPFO ATM Card Launch Date</h2>
<p>EPFO will introduce its cutting-edge software system by June of this year, EPFO 3.0, according to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. Following the release of EPFO 3.0, EPFO will also provide ATM cards to its members.</p>
<h2>EPFO ATM Card Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li>EPFO subscribers will receive dedicated cards that can be used at ATMs to withdraw savings.</li>
  <li>The new system allows claimants, beneficiaries, or insured individuals to access their claim amounts through ATMs.</li>
  <li>Under the EPFO's Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme, heirs of deceased subscribers are provided with a maximum of ₹7 lakh.</li>
  <li>In the new system, the heir of the deceased EPFO subscriber may also be able to use ATMs to withdraw money after claim settlement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Current Challenges for EPFO Subscribers</h2>
<p>Currently, subscribers of EPFO have to wait 7-10 days for their claims to be settled online, after which the money is transferred to their bank accounts.</p>
<p>The Centralised Pension Payments System (CPPS) has been fully rolled out across all EPFO regional offices. Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya celebrated the launch, calling it a 'historic milestone'.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"This transformative initiative allows pensioners to access their pensions easily from any bank, any branch, anywhere in the country. It removes the need for physical verification visits and streamlines the pension disbursement process," Mandaviya said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rollout sets a new standard in pension service delivery, aligning with our vision of a tech-enabled, member-centric EPFO.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date: January 17, 2023 | Source: Supreme Court proceedings</strong></p>
<p>Additional Solicitor General SV Raju raised concerns regarding a counter-affidavit filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), claiming it was submitted without proper verification and consultation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SV Raju describes the ED's affidavit as "half-baked" and questions its legitimacy.</li>
  <li>He accuses the ED of filing the affidavit without verifying facts or consulting the investigatory agency.</li>
  <li>The Supreme Court bench, comprising Justices Oka and Bhuyan, expressed surprise at these claims.</li>
  <li>The ASG intends to investigate further and has requested a departmental inquiry into the matter.</li>
  <li>Justice Oka questioned how the affidavit could be filed without proper instructions from the ED.</li>

<p>Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded Tata Group's Trent Ltd. to a 'sell' rating, citing that the expected revenue and EPS growth is already priced into the stock.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kotak downgraded Trent's rating from 'add' to 'sell'.</li>
  <li>New price target set at ₹5,850, down from ₹6,800, implying a 6% downside.</li>
  <li>Trent's shares have corrected 25% from their all-time high of ₹8,345.</li>
  <li>Analyst warns about potential revenue cannibalization from closely located Zudio stores.</li>
  <li>Revenue and EPS estimates cut by 1-2% and 9-14% respectively for FY 2025-2027.</li>
  <li>Trent shares have consistently provided positive returns every calendar year for the last decade.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"After the fantastic run-up in the stock price, it may be time to book profits," - Kotak Institutional Equities</blockquote>
<p>Shares of Trent rose 0.8% on Friday, currently at ₹6,259, but have fallen 10% in the past month.</p>
<p>Despite the downgrade, Trent is expected to maintain a healthy revenue CAGR of 29% and EPS CAGR of 35% over the next few years, but Kotak believes these figures are already accounted for in the stock price.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Gold price rally leads to new heights.</figcaption>
<p>Gold prices surged above $2,700 as the market responded to a combination of weaker retail sales and dovish remarks from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting potential rate cuts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold rallies driven by disappointing US retail sales and rising jobless claims.</li>
<li>Fed's Waller indicates that the Central Bank might lower rates sooner if disinflation continues.</li>
<li>The current price of Gold (XAU/USD) is $2,715, marking a 0.72% increase.</li>
<li>Initial Jobless Claims reported an unexpected increase to 217K, impacting the US Dollar negatively.</li>
<li>Economic outlook remains uncertain, with traders watching upcoming housing data.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the disinflation process evolves, we could lower borrowing costs sooner and faster,” said Fed Governor Waller.</blockquote>
<p>This rally in Gold reflects broader economic anxieties and investor sentiment leaning towards safe-haven assets amid fluctuating economic data.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Hindenburg report significantly affected Adani's market cap.</figcaption>
<p>The investigative firm Hindenburg, known for its critical reports on major corporations, has announced its decision to disband. This decision follows the fallout after their report on the Adani Group, which resulted in a staggering $140 billion drop in market capitalization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hindenburg's report accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud.</li>
<li>The impact led to heightened scrutiny of corporate governance in India.</li>
<li>Adani Group has vehemently denied the allegations made by Hindenburg.</li>
<li>The disbandment reflects the controversial nature of Hindenburg's investigative practices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The consequences of our findings have created a wave of skepticism regarding corporate practices in India," commented a spokesperson for Hindenburg.</blockquote>
<p>The Hindenburg case highlights the profound effects that investigative journalism can have on global business practices and raises concerns about corporate transparency.</p>]]></description>

<p>Several high-street banks in India are contemplating legal action in the Supreme Court after a ruling barred them from lending against properties that lack completion and occupancy certificates. This has raised concerns for older and heritage properties.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court ruling prohibits banks from providing loans without completion and occupancy certificates.</li>
  <li>There are challenges regarding older buildings and states where such certificates are not issued.</li>
  <li>Banks are seeking clarification on the ruling's implications for properties under construction.</li>
  <li>Some banks have referred the matter to the Indian Banks' Association.</li>
  <li>Loan against property (LAP), a crucial financial product for many businesses, may be impacted significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The intent of the court is right and was driven by larger public interest, but the ruling has thrown up practical challenges." - A banker</blockquote>
<p>Banks are exploring legal avenues to amend the ruling's effects, highlighting the need for clarity in the lending framework.</p>]]></description>

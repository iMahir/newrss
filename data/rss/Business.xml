<figcaption>NIFTY50 rebounds from its 200 EMA.</figcaption>
<p>The NIFTY50 index began the week positively after ending a five-day losing streak, yet it displayed signs of indecision with a doji candlestick pattern. Traders should keep an eye on the levels from December 20 to determine future direction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asian markets showed minor gains in the morning.</li>
  <li>U.S. indices continued to rise, particularly driven by semiconductor stocks.</li>
  <li>NIFTY50 closed above 200 day EMA, but formed a doji pattern suggesting indecision.</li>

  <li>FIIs sold shares worth ₹168 crore; DIIs bought shares worth ₹2,227 crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The trend may remain range-bound unless the index breaks this range.”</blockquote>
<p>This analysis highlights the indecisiveness in the market while suggesting that crucial levels from recent sessions must be monitored for decisive movements.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Photo: Canva</figcaption>
<p>The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has updated its tariff rules, allowing mobile service providers to offer separate plans for voice calls and SMS for customers who do not utilize data services. The validity of these special recharge coupons has been extended to a maximum of 365 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>TRAI mandates at least one Special Tariff Voucher (STV) exclusively for voice calls and SMS with validity not exceeding 365 days.</li>
<li>The cap on special recharge coupon validity has been removed.</li>
<li>The decision aims to accommodate customers like senior citizens and families who may not require data services.</li>
<li>Telecom operators can now issue recharge vouchers of any value, including a minimum of Rs 10.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Authority is of the view that reserving of denomination of 210 and multiple thereof only for top-up voucher be done away with." - TRAI</blockquote>
<p>This regulatory change is expected to benefit consumers by allowing them to pay for the services they actually use, promoting transparency and consumer choice in mobile service plans.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Bloomberg</p>
<p>The Chilean telecommunications company WOM has been granted court approval to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, following a takeover and restructuring agreement with a group of creditors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>WOM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy eight months ago.</li>
  <li>A takeover bid from a group of bondholders valued WOM at $1.6 billion.</li>
  <li>The agreement includes a $500 million investment and a net debt reduction of $650 million.</li>
  <li>The decision was made by a US bankruptcy judge, rejecting a rival creditor's objection.</li>
  <li>WOM has approximately 20% of the mobile market share in Chile, ranking third behind Telefonica's Movistar and Entel.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The decision is a landmark in the Chapter 11 process and the efforts we have made as a team to financially restructure the company.” - Martín Vaca Narvaja, WOM’s CEO</blockquote>
<p>This restructuring plan ensures the operational continuity of WOM Chile and sets the stage for its future growth.</p>]]></description>

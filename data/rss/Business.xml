<p>The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has revised down the gold import figures for November by $5 billion, highlighting a likely counting error.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Facebook, fact-checkers and IFCN: Meta's new move sets off alarm bells</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 23, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> OpIndia</p>
<p>Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced the discontinuation of the company's established fact-checking program and will implement a community-based system instead, leading to significant concerns among fact-checkers in India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meta will phase out its collaboration with third-party fact-checking organizations, starting in the U.S. and potentially extending to other countries like India.</li>
  <li>This change is seen as a move to promote free speech and simplify content moderation.</li>
  <li>Fact-checking organizations in India are worried about their financial viability due to dependency on Meta's funding.</li>
  <li>The transition could impact their reach as they rely on Meta platforms to direct traffic to their sites.</li>
  <li>Meta's shift is interpreted as preparing for the incoming Trump presidency, indicating a long-term strategy.</li>
  <li>New Community Notes system will empower users to rate content and provide context instead of relying on third-party fact-checkers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is possibly the biggest existential threat many fact-checkers will have to contend with.” - Senior Executive, Fact-Checking Organization</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Meta's overhaul of its fact-checking approach raises concerns over misinformation and the sustainability of fact-checking entities, particularly in emerging markets like India.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>EatSure becomes first platform to launch multi-restaurant ordering</figcaption>
<p>The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has raised strong concerns against Zomato and Swiggy's entry into private-label food delivery, arguing it threatens restaurant survival and violates marketplace neutrality.</p>
<ul>
<li>NRAI represents over 500,000 restaurants in India.</li>
<li>They claim that Zomato and Swiggy are abusing their market power to launch competing food products.</li>
<li>The NRAI stresses that this strategy undermines fair competition and could violate copyright laws.</li>
<li>The NRAI's President, Sagar Daryani, expressed disappointment over broken assurances from food aggregators.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about consumer data access and the potential for conflict of interest.</li>
<li>The NRAI plans to seek legal remedies and engage regulators.</li>
<li>They emphasize the need for collaboration to sustain the restaurant industry's growth, valued at ₹5.69 lakh crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We were always given verbal assurances by the aggregators that they would never resort to private labelling. This is a breach of trust.” - Sagar Daryani</blockquote>
<p>The NRAI's actions reflect significant apprehensions regarding competition and consumer protection in the food delivery sector.</p>]]></description>

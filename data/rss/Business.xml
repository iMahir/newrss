<figcaption>This will be a feature-loaded compact SUV with relatively more space in second row.</figcaption>
<p>The compact SUV segment is seeing new entrants as Kia prepares to launch its latest model, the Syros, which aims to compete with established players like Brezza, Nexon, and Venue. The global debut is scheduled for December 19, 2024.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Kia Syros is the third SUV from Kia India, following the Seltos and Sonet.</li>
    <li>It will feature a boxy design with a bold grille and vertically stacked LED headlights.</li>
    <li>The upcoming SUV includes advanced safety features, such as ADAS and a 360-degree camera.</li>
    <li>Powertrain options are expected to include a 1.0-litre turbo petrol engine and a 1.5-litre diesel engine.</li>
    <li>The expected price range for the Syros is between Rs 9 lakh and Rs 17 lakh (ex-showroom).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“The Syros will compete against the Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue, Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3X0.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of the Kia Syros could significantly shake up the compact SUV market, posing a challenge to existing models with its feature-rich design and competitive pricing.]]></description>

<p>A section of Akasa Air pilots has raised concerns about alleged training and safety issues at the airline and sought the intervention of the civil aviation ministry, while the carrier termed the allegations as untrue.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Akasa Air faces allegations of training lapses and safety issues, with pilots requesting a probe.</li>
    <li>The airline disputes these claims, stating that 324 pilots have joined since October 2023 and attrition is below 1%.</li>
    <li>84 pilots reportedly resigned on short notice, prompting concerns among remaining staff.</li>
    <li>The DGCA imposed a Rs 30 lakh fine on Akasa Air for previous training lapses.</li>
    <li>The airline operates 26 planes and serves 27 destinations, including five overseas cities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "We categorically deny these allegations as baseless and untrue. Nor do they represent the views of Akasa pilots," - Airline spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the concerns raised, Akasa Air maintains that its monthly employee surveys indicate high job satisfaction among pilots, countering the allegations about unfair practices.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SARFAESI | Confirmed Sale Can't Be Set Aside For Mere Irregularities Except Fraud, Collusion, Inadequate...</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>The Supreme Court recently clarified the grounds under which a sale of property under the SARFAESI Act can be challenged after confirmation, emphasizing that only fundamental errors like fraud or collusion are valid reasons for setting aside a sale.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Court held that procedural irregularities alone cannot invalidate a confirmed sale.</li>
    <li>Only substantial procedural errors such as fraud, collusion, or inadequate pricing warrant intervention.</li>
    <li>Legal challenges should ideally be raised before the confirmation of the sale.</li>
    <li>The judgment referenced V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, reinforcing that courts should avoid setting aside auctions unless serious flaws are identified.</li>
    <li>The case involved a minor procedural point regarding the gap between sale and auction notices, which was insufficient for a successful challenge.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Any sale by auction or other public procurement methods once already confirmed or concluded ought not to be set-aside or interfered with lightly except on grounds that go to the core of such sale process, such as either being collusive, fraudulent or vitiated by inadequate pricing or underbidding."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the Supreme Court reinforced the stability of confirmed sales under the SARFAESI Act, allowing challenges only in cases of significant procedural shortcomings. This ruling aims to maintain confidence in auction processes and avoid unnecessary disruptions. </p>]]></description>

<p>Supreme Court judge Justice KV Viswanathan emphasized the importance of considering the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in society, stating that it should not be outrightly rejected during a recent event.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Justice Viswanathan spoke at the Delhi High Court during the launch of a commentary on Patent Law by advocate Adarsh Ramanujan.</li>
    <li>He highlighted the commentary's intriguing analysis of AI's relationship with patent law.</li>
    <li>Justice Manmohan also attended, noting an increase in patent applications at the Indian Patent Office as an encouraging trend.</li>
    <li>The event included discussions on the significance of identifying invention origins through patenting and the need for better training for patent examiners.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“I don't think that AI should be outrightly rejected. It calls for a certain amount of thought before we take a final call on it,” - Justice KV Viswanathan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Patent law is where future lies. It is a growing field that puts the lawyer first,” - Justice Manmohan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This discussion reflects a growing recognition of the potential and challenges of integrating AI into legal frameworks, while also encouraging innovation in patent law practices in India.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Nifty closed the week with a modest gain, finishing above the critical 24700 resistance level. The continuation of this upward trajectory is dependent on maintaining this level, with a possibility of further gains if sustained.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Nifty had a volatile trading week, ending with a net gain of 90.50 points (+0.37%).</li>
    <li>India VIX fell by 7.69% to close at 13.05.</li>
    <li>Key resistance levels for the Nifty are 24790 and 25000, while supports are at 24590 and 24400.</li>
    <li>Sector performance indicates strong potential for Bank, Financial Services, Private Banks, and IT sectors.</li>
    <li>The Nifty must hold above 24700 to avoid re-entering a consolidation phase.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “The longer the Nifty stays above 24700, the greater the possibility of this upmove extending itself.”
</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming week is expected to be cautious; however, maintaining positions in stronger sectors is advisable as the market may continue to show volatility.]]></description>

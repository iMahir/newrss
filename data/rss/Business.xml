<figcaption>Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai was travelling from Bengaluru to Coimbatore when the incident happened.</figcaption>
<p>Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai expressed his discontent with IndiGo's service after being left waiting on the tarmac in Bengaluru without air conditioning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Passengers were left on the hot tarmac in Bengaluru, with the air conditioning reportedly non-operational.</li>
  <li>Pai shared his experience on social media, prompting others to share similar complaints.</li>
  <li>After a passenger protest, IndiGo staff used a generator to power the air conditioning.</li>
  <li>Pai called on IndiGo to change their protocols to prevent future incidents.</li>
  <li>IndiGo responded to his post, assuring that customer comfort is a priority and that they value feedback.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Indigo treats its passengers badly. Sitting in 6E 7407 without AC on hot tarmac in Bengaluru. No way to treat passengers. Only after protest staff using tarmac generator for AC...” — Mohandas Pai</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights ongoing issues with passenger treatment in airlines and brings attention to the need for better customer service practices.</p>]]></description>

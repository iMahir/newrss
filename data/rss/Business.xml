<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Date Not Specified <strong>Source:</strong> Xinhua News Agency</p>
<img src="https://www.greatandhra.com/newphotos10/newyork11736072256.jpg" alt="New York imposes first ever congestion pricing plan in US">
<figcaption>A congestion pricing plan covering Lower and Midtown Manhattan took effect on Sunday.</figcaption>
<p>A congestion pricing plan has been initiated in Manhattan, making New York City the first in the United States to adopt such a system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vehicles entering the congestion relief zone will be tolled based on vehicle type, time of day, and payment method.</li>
  <li>This plan aims to reduce the number of vehicles in the zone by an estimated 10%.</li>
  <li>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) anticipates generating $1 billion annually from this plan.</li>
  <li>Controversy surrounding the plan has resulted in multiple lawsuits, though implementation proceeded.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The tolls would be adjusted upward in 2028 and 2031, phasing out 40% of initial discounts."</blockquote>
<p>This congestion pricing initiative marks a significant shift in urban traffic management and aims to fund public transportation while reducing congestion in Manhattan.</p>]]></description>

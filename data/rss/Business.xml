            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The ‘new car’ of the future isn’t from a showroom—it’s your old one updated like an iPhone</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A | <strong>Source:</strong> N/A</p>
<p>This article discusses the evolution of vehicles towards becoming 'software-defined vehicles' (SDVs), where old cars can be updated like smartphones through software upgrades, potentially re-defining what constitutes a 'new' car.</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the ICOTY award event, three out of eight shortlisted vehicles were pure electric.</li>
  <li>The concept of 'software-defined vehicles' means an old car can gain new functionalities via software updates.</li>
  <li>Updates can significantly change performance, similar to mobile operating system upgrades.</li>
  <li>Subscription services for features like performance modes and heated seats are becoming common.</li>
  <li>The digitization of cars is leading to discussions on the future role of AI in automotive technology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The very concept of a car is evolving. And that both excites and worries me all at once.”</blockquote>
<p>This evolution in automotive technology has implications for how cars are manufactured, sold, and maintained, raising important questions about the future of ownership and automotive design.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>WhatsApp wins lawsuit against NSO Group (AFP Image)</figcaption>
<p>WhatsApp has achieved a legal victory against the NSO Group, which is known for developing the Pegasus spyware. A US judge ruled that NSO Group violated US hacking laws and WhatsApp's terms of service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>WhatsApp filed the lawsuit accusing NSO of hacking 1,400 individuals in May 2019.</li>
  <li>The judge ruled in favor of WhatsApp, stating that NSO's actions were illegal.</li>
  <li>A jury trial is scheduled for March 2025 to determine the damages owed to WhatsApp.</li>
  <li>WhatsApp emphasized the need for accountability for spyware companies targeting vulnerable groups.</li>
  <li>NSO was found to be non-cooperative during the case and faced sanctions for not providing necessary information.</li>
  <li>The US government blacklisted NSO in 2021, prohibiting its agencies from utilizing its products.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>NSO must be held accountable for targeting journalists, human rights activists, and civil society groups.</blockquote>
<p>This ruling marks a significant win for WhatsApp in its ongoing battle against spyware and underscores the rising scrutiny on tech companies involved in such practices.</p>]]></description>

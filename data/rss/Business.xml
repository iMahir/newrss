            <description><![CDATA[<h1>RBI Allows Rupee to Depreciate Against US Dollar in Strategic Shift</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 13, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> The Indian Express</p>
<p>In a notable change, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has relaxed its stringent control over the rupee, permitting its depreciation against the US dollar.</p>
<img src="URL_TO_IMAGE" alt="RBI Depreciation" />
<figcaption>RBI's decision to allow rupee depreciation reflects a shift in currency management strategy.</figcaption>
<p>The rupee experienced a significant single-day fall, hitting a historic low as market reactions to the RBI's new strategy unfold.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The rupee logged its biggest drop in nearly two years, falling to 86.70 against the dollar.</li>
    <li>Since November 1, 2024, the rupee has depreciated by 2.6%.</li>
    <li>This shift in strategy has been interpreted as a more flexible approach in currency management.</li>
    <li>Experts caution it is too early to attribute this change solely to the new RBI Governor, Sanjay Malhotra.</li>
    <li>The decline in reserves was accompanied by notable dollar sales to manage currency fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The RBI’s new approach is a prudent one. If you bind the rupee to a very tight range, you also end up spending a lot of energy and resources.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the RBI's decision reflects a willingness to adapt to market conditions, potentially reshaping its long-term currency strategy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>PM Modi during his speech at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo.</figcaption>
<p>On January 17, PM Modi inaugurated the Bharat Mobility Global Expo, discussing India’s vehicle manufacturing growth and emphasizing the sale of 2.5 crore vehicles. Following his speech, misreporting led to online outrage over the claim that he implied India's sale consisted solely of cars.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PM Modi highlighted India’s achievements in vehicle sales, asserting sales surpassing 2.5 crore annually.</li>
  <li>Misinterpreted quotes circulated claiming he said "cars" rather than "vehicles".</li>
  <li>Social media backlash included political attacks and misinformation about his statements.</li>
  <li>Fact-checking revealed he referred to total vehicle sales including two-wheelers and other types.</li>
  <li>Statista reported approximately 2.38 crore vehicles sold in the previous financial year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The population of many countries of the world is not as much as the number of vehicles being sold in India every year.” — PM Modi</blockquote>
<p>The incident highlights the challenges of accurate media reporting and the rapid spread of misinformation online.</p>]]></description>

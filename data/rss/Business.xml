<figcaption>Honda Amaze 2024 Right Rear Three Quarter</figcaption>
<p>The third-generation Honda Amaze has unveiled its base variant, the V MT, which is priced at Rs. 8.04 lakh. This variant offers essential features while still maintaining some attractive aesthetics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The V MT variant is available with both manual and automatic transmission options.</li>
  <li>Exterior features include LED headlamps and a chrome strip above the grille.</li>
  <li>The interior retains design elements from higher-spec models but lacks some features like climate control and a wireless charger.</li>
  <li>The powertrain includes a 1.2-litre i-VTEC petrol engine, and a CNG option is available as a dealer-fitment.</li>
  <li>Competition includes the Maruti Dzire, Hyundai Aura, and Tata Tigor, with similar feature levels at varying prices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The CNG kit is priced at Rs. 1 lakh but is variant agnostic and can be fitted to any MT variant.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the third-gen Honda Amaze’s base variant is designed to appeal to budget-conscious consumers while still featuring Honda's recognized quality and design.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Suchir Balaji, 26, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment.</figcaption>
<p>The AI industry is in shock following the death of 26-year-old Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI employee and whistleblower, found in his apartment. His allegations of copyright violations against OpenAI were pivotal in ongoing legal disputes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Balaji was discovered during a welfare check; authorities have ruled out foul play.</li>
<li>He accused OpenAI of using copyrighted material to train its AI systems.</li>
<li>His critic of OpenAI claimed it created unfair advantages and inflated valuations.</li>
<li>Balaji's insights were anticipated to impact legal cases against OpenAI.</li>
<li>Elon Musk's reaction to the news has sparked further speculation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The current model is unsustainable for the internet ecosystem as a whole,” Balaji said.</blockquote>
<p>The loss of Balaji underscores the challenges faced by whistleblowers in the tech industry, emphasizing the need for transparent investigations into such incidents.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The ‘new car’ of the future isn’t from a showroom—it’s your old one updated like an iPhone</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A | <strong>Source:</strong> N/A</p>
<p>This article discusses the evolution of vehicles towards becoming 'software-defined vehicles' (SDVs), where old cars can be updated like smartphones through software upgrades, potentially re-defining what constitutes a 'new' car.</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the ICOTY award event, three out of eight shortlisted vehicles were pure electric.</li>
  <li>The concept of 'software-defined vehicles' means an old car can gain new functionalities via software updates.</li>
  <li>Updates can significantly change performance, similar to mobile operating system upgrades.</li>
  <li>Subscription services for features like performance modes and heated seats are becoming common.</li>
  <li>The digitization of cars is leading to discussions on the future role of AI in automotive technology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The very concept of a car is evolving. And that both excites and worries me all at once.”</blockquote>
<p>This evolution in automotive technology has implications for how cars are manufactured, sold, and maintained, raising important questions about the future of ownership and automotive design.</p>]]></description>

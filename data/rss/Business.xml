            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Qualcomm prevails on key issues in Arm suit</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>Mobile-phone chip giant Qualcomm largely prevailed Friday in a licensing dispute with chip design firm Arm Holdings.</p>
<img src="https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/subscription/onepagecheckout/lm/staging/extensivepaywall/computer.png" alt="Qualcomm Image">
<figcaption>Image showcasing Qualcomm's technology.</figcaption>
<p>A Delaware jury ruled that Qualcomm had a valid license to use Arm’s basic chip architecture for central processors it developed with the acquisition of a startup called Nuvia in 2021. The ruling paved the way for Qualcomm to continue selling those chips, which are at the heart of a range of devices including Microsoft Surface laptops.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Qualcomm won a significant jury ruling in their licensing dispute.</li>
  <li>The jury confirmed Qualcomm's valid license with Arm Holdings.</li>
  <li>This ruling allows Qualcomm to keep selling central processors stemming from their acquisition of Nuvia.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The ruling paved the way for Qualcomm to continue selling those chips.”</blockquote>
<p>This verdict is a crucial win for Qualcomm, ensuring their ongoing product offerings remain legally compliant and operational following the dispute.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption><em>Split decision</em></figcaption>
<p>A federal jury has ruled that Qualcomm’s acquisition of Nuvia did not breach its licensing agreement with Arm, though the issue regarding Nuvia's compliance remains unresolved.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A jury in Delaware found no breach by Qualcomm in its agreement with Arm regarding the Nuvia acquisition.</li>
  <li>The case has been ongoing for two years, arising from Arm's allegations of misuse of chip designs licensed to Nuvia.</li>
  <li>The jury could not decide on Nuvia’s potential breach, allowing for future litigation.</li>
  <li>Qualcomm acquired Nuvia for $1.4 billion to enhance its chip offerings.</li>
  <li>Internal documents suggested Qualcomm may save $1.4 billion annually in Arm royalty payments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The jury has vindicated Qualcomm’s right to innovate...” - Ann Chaplin, Qualcomm’s General Counsel</blockquote>
<p>This ruling marks a pivotal moment for Qualcomm, reaffirming its licensing strategies while leaving some legal questions open for further examination.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Stock market highlights as of December 20.</figcaption>
<p>This week, the equity markets experienced a significant downturn, marked by a 5% decline in benchmark indices SENSEX and NIFTY, totaling the largest weekly loss in two years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The NIFTY IT index dropped 4.8% after reaching a lifetime high the previous week.</li>
  <li>BSE-listed companies lost nearly ₹17 lakh crore in market capitalization.</li>
  <li>Despite the downturn, the NIFTY Pharma index saw a modest increase of 1.6%.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The correction was triggered by cautious trading ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy decisions.”</blockquote>
<p>The correction is attributed to investor jitters stemming from the US Federal Reserve's anticipated changes in interest rate policies, leading to a global sell-off.</p>
<p>Analysts suggest a potential pull-back rally in the coming week, anticipating a possible “Santa rally” during the holiday season.</p>]]></description>

<img src="/sites/default/files/styles/736/public/2024-12/54856.jpg" alt="No, MicroStrategy Not Selling 10 Billion Shares to Buy Bitcoin">
<figcaption>Cover image via <a href="https://www.freepik.com/ai">www.freepik.com</a></figcaption>
<p>Amid speculations, MicroStrategy is not issuing 10 billion shares to purchase $3 trillion worth of Bitcoin, as clarified by analyst Jeff Park.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rumors suggested MicroStrategy would issue shares to buy an extravagant amount of Bitcoin.</li>
  <li>Jeff Park called the speculation unrealistic, emphasizing that Bitcoin's total market cap is under $2 trillion.</li>
  <li>MicroStrategy's share value is closely tied to Bitcoin, but a collapse in Bitcoin won't lead to MSTR's complete failure.</li>
  <li>Park reassured investors not to panic sell when Bitcoin prices fluctuate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"$MSTR is not issuing 10 billion shares to buy $3 trillion worth of Bitcoin. I can’t believe I’m tweeting this on Christmas Eve." — Jeff Park</blockquote>
<p>Park highlighted MicroStrategy's robust financial strategies, echoing sentiments from experts who see MSTR shares as undervalued.</p>]]></description>

<p>American Airlines briefly grounded all its flights in the U.S. on December 24, 2024, due to an unspecified technical issue, disrupting travel plans for many passengers ahead of Christmas Eve.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ground stop lasted for about an hour, according to the U.S. aviation regulator.</li>
<li>Passengers reported being stuck on runways and flights returning to gates.</li>
<li>American Airlines provided no clear communication regarding the issue or estimated time for resolution.</li>
<li>Company shares fell by 3.8% as a reaction to the disruption.</li>
<li>The incident echoed a previous software outage that affected airlines globally.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We're currently experiencing a technical issue with all American Airlines flights. Your safety is our utmost priority; once this is rectified, we'll have you safely on your way to your destination." — americanair (@AmericanAir) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmericanAir/status/1871520528206295120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
<p>The event raises concerns about the reliability of airline systems, especially during peak travel periods.</p>]]></description>

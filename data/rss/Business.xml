<figcaption>Table 1: GDP Trends Analysis</figcaption>
<p>The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released the First Advance Estimates (FAEs) of India’s GDP growth for the financial year 2024-25. These estimates suggest that India's nominal GDP is projected to reach Rs 324 lakh crores, growing 9.7% over the previous financial year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The estimated nominal GDP for FY25 is $3.8 trillion at the exchange rate of 85 rupees to a dollar.</li>
  <li>Real GDP is expected to be Rs 184.9 lakh crores, accounting for 57% of nominal GDP, indicating a growth deceleration.</li>
  <li>Private consumption demand (PFCE) plays a crucial role, contributing almost 60% to GDP.</li>
  <li>Government spending growth has been slow, averaging just 4.2% for the current year.</li>
  <li>Investments have stalled since 2014, leading to reduced productive capacity growth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"When one considers a slightly longer period, it becomes clear that India’s real economy is growing at less than 5% per annum."
</blockquote>
<p>The latest GDP figures serve as a reality check, revealing that while India's growth appears strong, much of this is boosted by a low base effect from the pandemic's economic contraction.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article discusses the importance of comparing fixed deposit interest rates across banks to maximize savings. An increase of just 50 basis points can lead to significant savings over time, especially for long-term deposits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HDFC and ICICI Banks lead with 7% rates for regular citizens.</li>
  <li>Yes Bank offers the highest rate of 8% for senior citizens.</li>
  <li>SBI and PNB provide lower rates compared to private banks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"An extra 50 basis points on a two-year FD of ₹5 lakh can enable you to save an extra ₹5,000."</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Meta drops fact-checking, loosens its content moderation rules</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> TechCrunch</p>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has announced significant changes to its content moderation policies, including the end of its third-party fact-checking program.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The third-party fact-checking program will be replaced by a Community Notes model.</li>
  <li>Restrictions on mainstream discussion topics will be lifted, focusing instead on illegal and severe violations.</li>
  <li>Users will be encouraged to personalize their political content, allowing for more opinion-based feeds.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Meta’s platforms are built to be places where people can express themselves freely.” - Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer</blockquote>
<p>These changes come as Meta adjusts to a new political landscape in the U.S., aiming to balance free expression with moderation while responding to public criticism of its previous policies.</p>]]></description>

<p>Bajaj Finance share price surged over 5 percent in Thursday's trade after analysts at the brokerage Citi reiterated its 'Buy' rating on the stock. The stock climbed to an intraday high of Rs 7,306.05, marking a 5.34 percent gain from its previous close.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Citi has set a price target of Rs 8,150 for Bajaj Finance, indicating a potential upside of 17.51 percent from Wednesday's closing price.</li>
  <li>The brokerage highlighted expectations of loan growth stability and a positive bias in net interest margins.</li>
  <li>Key support is coming from segments like mortgage financing and sales financing.</li>
  <li>A marginal rise in credit costs is estimated between 2.2 to 2.5 percent.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Key support is coming from segments like mortgage financing, sales financing, and new business ventures," Citi noted in its report.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2, 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> CNBC-TV18</p>
<img alt="CreditAccess Grameen, Spandana Sphoorty shares gain up to 9% on this MFIN decision" title="CreditAccess Grameen, Spandana Sphoorty shares gain up to 9% on this MFIN decision" loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/default.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=360">
<figcaption>Shares of CreditAccess Grameen see significant gains following MFIN's decision.</figcaption>
<p>On January 2, 2025, stocks in the microfinance segment, such as CreditAccess Grameen and Spandana Sphoorty, saw gains of up to 9% after the MicroFinance Institute Network (MFIN) announced a three-month delay in the implementation of new lending caps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microfinance stocks gained after MFIN's announcement.</li>
  <li>The MFIN delay allows more time for lenders managing their stress and delinquencies.</li>
  <li>New lending caps will now be implemented by April 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>Industries related to microfinance were under stress, with overdues on the rise.</li>
  <li>Shares of CreditAccess Grameen rose 9.3% to ₹973.55, while Spandana Sphoorty increased by 2.5% to ₹337.3.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Microfinance overdues are up 110 basis points on a month-on-month basis in November 2024,” - UBS report.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the MFIN's decision to delay the caps offers relief to microfinance companies amidst rising defaults and stress in the sector.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NEFT, RTGS update: RBI introduces name lookup facility to verify beneficiaries</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 30, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is implementing a new facility that allows remitters to verify the beneficiary's account name before transferring funds via NEFT and RTGS. This aims to reduce incorrect money transfers and enhance user confidence.</p>
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="RBI introduces new feature"/>
<figcaption>The RBI's new facility aims to prevent fraud in electronic transactions.</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>The RBI will enable a name lookup facility for NEFT and RTGS systems.</li>
  <li>This facility will help prevent incorrect transactions by verifying beneficiary names.</li>
  <li>It is similar to existing features in UPI and IMPS systems that allow name verification.</li>
  <li>The facility will be available through internet and mobile banking, as well as in branches.</li>
  <li>All banks are required to implement this by April 1, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Remitters can input the account number and the branch IFSC code of the beneficiary, following which the name of the beneficiary will be displayed.” - RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of this facility is expected to significantly improve the accuracy of electronic fund transfers and enhances customer trust in the systems.</p>]]></description>

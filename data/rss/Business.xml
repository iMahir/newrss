<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Currently Unavailable <strong>Source:</strong> FXStreet</p>

<figcaption>Gold Price Daily Chart</figcaption>
<p>Gold prices are experiencing a decline despite safe-haven demand as traders anticipate signals from the US economy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold price decreases as traders await clues about the US economy.</li>
<li>The metal finds support from increased expectations of Fed rate cuts due to US PCE inflation data.</li>
<li>The ongoing geopolitical tensions may further boost gold prices.</li>
<li>Gold has a remarkable 27% annual gain, its best performance since 2010.</li>
<li>Gold's price remains under pressure from a strengthening US dollar.</li>
<li>Geopolitical developments, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and recent airstrikes in Gaza, are impacting prices.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve's cautious stance on rate cuts also influences market sentiment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during turbulent times.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while gold faces downward pressure from a strong dollar, its safe-haven appeal remains significant amid geopolitical uncertainties and potential monetary easing from the Federal Reserve.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian benchmark equity indices, Sensex and Nifty, experienced a significant decline on January 6, 2025, due to a selloff linked to concerns over third-quarter earnings and the outflow of foreign capital amid fears surrounding the HMP virus.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sensex dropped by 1,258.12 points (1.59%) closing at 77,964.99.</li>
  <li>Nifty fell by 388.70 points (1.62%) to end at 23,616.05.</li>
  <li>Sectoral losses primarily affected companies like Tata Steel, NTPC, and Reliance Industries.</li>
  <li>Only Titan and Sun Pharma gained in the market.</li>
  <li>Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹4,227.25 crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The sell-off can be attributed to a rise in Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling and concerns surrounding the upcoming Q3 earnings season." - Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart</blockquote>
<p>The significant downturn reflects the increasing negative sentiment in the market driven by external factors and investor concerns.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>BlazePod: Train better, feel stronger, and see real results in 2025</figcaption>
<p>Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has a different perspective on the rising talent migration from India. He believes it's not a sign of desperation, but rather an indication of the global demand for Indian talent and skills.</p>
<ol>
<li>Vembu sees the migration as a positive outcome of India's education system and the global recognition of Indian talent.</li>
<li>He argues that the migration is not due to lack of opportunities in India but because better opportunities exist elsewhere.</li>
<li>Vembu also notes that many migrants eventually return to India, bringing back valuable experience and investment.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"Rising talent migration from India is not a symptom of hopelessness, it is an indicator of the global demand for Indian talent and skills." - Sridhar Vembu</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu's perspective on Indian talent migration challenges the common narrative, highlighting the global demand for Indian skills and the potential benefits of this migration.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>New Delhi, Dec 30 (PTI)</strong></p>
<img src='https://example.com/image.jpg' alt='DGTR Logo' width='200'><figcaption>DGTR Logo</figcaption>
<p>India has started a countervailing duty investigation into increased imports of Calcium Carbonate Filler Masterbatch, a chemical used in the plastic industry, from Vietnam. The move follows a complaint from domestic manufacturers who allege that the increased imports are subsidized, causing material injury to their businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has initiated the probe.</li>
<li>Domestic manufacturers have alleged that producers/exporters in Vietnam have received actionable subsidies from various levels of the Vietnamese government.</li>
<li>Countervailing duties are country-specific duties imposed to safeguard domestic industries against unfair trade subsidies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"On the basis of the duly substantiated written application filed by the domestic industry...on the basis of the prima facie evidence submitted by the domestic industry, about the subsidization of the product...the authority, hereby, initiates an investigation."</blockquote>
<p>Vietnam is a key trading partner of India, with exports and imports reaching USD 5.47 billion and USD 9.34 billion respectively in 2023-24.</p>]]></description>

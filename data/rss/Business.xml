            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Bank of Japan Maintains Interest Rate Steady for December</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 18, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> FXStreet</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to keep its short-term interest rate target in the range of 0.15%-0.25%, aligning with market expectations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decision marked the third consecutive meeting without a rate change.</li>
  <li>Board member Naoki Tamura dissented, suggesting a rate increase to 0.5% due to rising inflationary risks.</li>
  <li>Japan's economy shows moderate recovery, with private consumption and heightening inflation expectations.</li>
  <li>High uncertainty remains regarding economic and price outlooks in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The two-day Bank of Japan meeting ends Thursday with a widely expected hold.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bank's policy will be closely monitored for implications on future interest rate hikes and the performance of the Japanese Yen.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>IndiGo's response to the DGCA regarding night flying regulations.</figcaption>
<p>The proposal to alter night flying regulations has met with opposition from IndiGo and Air India Group, citing potential operational impacts. Both airlines have expressed concerns over changes that could impact pilot fatigue management.</p>
<ul>
  <li>IndiGo rejected the suggestion to extend the night flying definition to include flying until 6 a.m., arguing it would have a severe operational impact.</li>
  <li>Air India stated that changes could only be implemented after the introduction of a fatigue management system.</li>
  <li>Airlines are also opposing an increase in weekly pilot rest from 36 to 48 hours, with IndiGo suggesting a staggered implementation.</li>
  <li>Both airlines argue that expanding the night flying definition would lead to decreased night flying hours.</li>
  <li>SpiceJet requested to defer rule implementation until March 2026, highlighting staffing concerns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The body repairs itself during a period of 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. when a person is sleeping...” - Captain Amit Singh, aviation safety expert.</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing debate over night flying regulations underscores the challenges of balancing safety, operational efficiency, and pilot wellbeing in the aviation industry.</p>]]></description>

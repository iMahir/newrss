<p>Microsoft is introducing its AI assistant, Copilot, to customers who may not want it, along with an increase in subscription fees for its Microsoft 365 services in certain regions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copilot is now part of the Microsoft 365 subscription in Australia and Southeast Asia.</li>
  <li>Microsoft has raised prices for users of the subscription service as part of this rollout.</li>
  <li>This move is part of Microsoft's strategy to boost excitement for its AI products.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Microsoft is trying a new approach to build excitement for its artificial-intelligence assistant Copilot: Give it to customers whether they want it or not.”</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Tata Motors Share Price: A 37% Decline from All-Time High - Investor Insights for 2025</h1>
<p><strong>Updated Dec 26, 2024</strong> from ET NOW News</p>
<img src="https://etstatic.tnn.in/photo/msid-116676923,updatedat-1735200506047,width-200,height-200,resizemode-75/116676923.jpg" alt="Tata Motors share price">
<figcaption>Tata Motors share price has seen a significant decline recently.</figcaption>
<p>Tata Motors shares have seen a strong correction, crashing over 37% in the past five months from their all-time high level, returning to levels not seen in a year. Investors are speculating on the stock's future performance as it currently trades below major moving averages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tata Motors yielded a negative return of nearly 6% in 2024, contrasting with the Sensex's 8.6% gain.</li>
<li>The significant decline is attributed to weak performance in commercial vehicles and EV sales, alongside pressures from Jaguar Land Rover.</li>
<li>Analysts suggest a potential bounce back may occur, fueled by favorable candlestick patterns and chart support.</li>
<li>Current trading at Rs 745.70, with recommendations to buy, maintaining a stop loss at Rs 717.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is a good expectation of a bounce back in Tata Motors.” - ET NOW Analyst</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Tata Motors has faced challenges, analysts remain optimistic about a potential recovery in share price moving into 2025.</p>]]></description>

  <li>From 2000 to present, PMGSY has constructed approximately 769,284 km of roads, improving rural connectivity significantly.</li>
  <li>The fourth phase of PMGSY aims to connect 25,000 habitations through 62,500 km of new roads.</li>

  <li>Improved roads are expected to boost rural consumption, job creation, and financial inclusion.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Rural roads are more than just physical infrastructure; they are enablers of social and economic mobility.”</blockquote>

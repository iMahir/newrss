<figcaption>PM Modi during his speech at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo.</figcaption>
<p>On January 17, PM Modi inaugurated the Bharat Mobility Global Expo, discussing India’s vehicle manufacturing growth and emphasizing the sale of 2.5 crore vehicles. Following his speech, misreporting led to online outrage over the claim that he implied India's sale consisted solely of cars.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PM Modi highlighted India’s achievements in vehicle sales, asserting sales surpassing 2.5 crore annually.</li>
  <li>Misinterpreted quotes circulated claiming he said "cars" rather than "vehicles".</li>
  <li>Social media backlash included political attacks and misinformation about his statements.</li>
  <li>Fact-checking revealed he referred to total vehicle sales including two-wheelers and other types.</li>
  <li>Statista reported approximately 2.38 crore vehicles sold in the previous financial year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The population of many countries of the world is not as much as the number of vehicles being sold in India every year.” — PM Modi</blockquote>
<p>The incident highlights the challenges of accurate media reporting and the rapid spread of misinformation online.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Job hiring in the IT sector.</figcaption>
<p>India’s top five IT firms witnessed a reduction of 2,587 employees in Q3FY25 after a strong hiring quarter, signaling ongoing challenges in the sector despite a cautious revival.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The top five IT services companies are Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra.</li>
  <li>This quarter marked a seasonal dip in hiring due to typical furloughs.</li>
  <li>In Q2FY25, these firms had added 15,033 employees, contrasting with the current job cuts.</li>
  <li>HCLTech and Infosys were the only companies to report an increase in headcount during this quarter.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"On a positive note, these firms added 10,412 employees in 9MFY25, marking a cautious revival after losing over 57,608 employees during the same period in FY24."</blockquote>
<p>This current trend highlights the volatility in the IT job market and the need for firms to adapt to changing demands.</p>]]></description>

<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has recently raised its inflation outlook while signaling fewer rate cuts in the upcoming year, thereby affecting global interest rates.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fed's adjustments have led to significant volatility in global markets.</li>
<li>Jerome Powell indicated that the bank may only cut rates twice in 2025, which is less than previously anticipated.</li>
<li>A stronger U.S. dollar is anticipated as a result of the Fed's hawkish stance.</li>
<li>Emerging markets could face tougher financial conditions due to dollar strength.</li>
<li>Asian currencies, including the Japanese yen and Indian rupee, have been adversely affected.</li>
<li>Global central banks are reassessing their policies in light of the Fed's new outlook.</li>
</ul>

<p>The U.S. government has issued a warning for senior officials to improve the security of their mobile devices due to significant breaches involving Chinese cyber activities targeting major telecom companies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advised officials to activate enhanced security settings, such as Apple’s Lockdown Mode.</li>
  <li>Officials are encouraged to use end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms like Signal to protect sensitive communications.</li>
  <li>CISA emphasized the importance of encryption, stating it protects data even if breached.</li>
  <li>Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication and telecom-level account PINs are recommended to defend against SIM-swapping attacks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Encryption is your friend — it makes your data unreadable, even if the adversary were to compromise it,” said CISA executive assistant director Jeff Greene.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the U.S. government highlights the necessity for heightened security measures among key officials to mitigate ongoing risks associated with cyber threats.</p>]]></description>

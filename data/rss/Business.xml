<figcaption>Stock Market Crash</figcaption>
<p>Indian equity indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, experienced a severe drop in the market, affecting investor sentiment due to several underlying economic factors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BSE Sensex fell by more than 1,100 points, reaching a low of 76,250.</li>
  <li>Nifty50 lost 350 points, sliding to 23,047.</li>
  <li>Market capitalization of BSE-listed companies declined by Rs 14.54 lakh crore.</li>
  <li>The US jobs report indicated strong employment growth, impacting expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.</li>
  <li>Persistent foreign selling was noted, with FPIs offloading equities worth over Rs 21,350 crore in January.</li>
  <li>Global crude oil prices surged due to geopolitical tensions, straining India's fiscal health.</li>
  <li>The Indian rupee hit an all-time low of Rs 86.27 against the US dollar.</li>
  <li>Analysts project downgrades in corporate earnings growth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Markets are under pressure due to multiple headwinds. The strong US jobs data has reduced expectations of rate cuts by the Fed in 2025,” said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the market's significant fall illustrates the interconnected nature of global economic data and the impacts on local markets. Investors are advised to stay informed about these dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>Hyundai Motor India anticipates significant growth in the passenger electric vehicle market, projecting the volumes to double over the next two years due to new launches by major manufacturers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Launch of the Creta Electric SUV at the Bharat Mobility Global Auto Expo.</li>

  <li>Hyundai plans to launch three additional EV models after the Creta EV.</li>
  <li>Production capacity aims to increase to 1.1 million units by 2028.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you look at the EV wholesale numbers, they will broadly be around 106,000 in 2023… I personally feel that EV volumes can double in the next two years.” - Tarun Garg</blockquote>
<p>The Creta Electric will compete with other models such as the Maruti Suzuki e-Vitara and Tata Curvv, featuring impressive ranges of up to 473 kilometers on a single charge.</p>

<figcaption>Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) benchmark Sensex tanked by 1,048.90 points to close at 76,330. (Niharika Kulkarni/Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>On January 13, 2025, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) saw a significant drop in the Sensex index, falling by over 1,000 points due to various negative market influences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The crash was largely attributed to unfavorable global market cues.</li>
  <li>Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold off equities worth ₹2,254.68 crore.</li>
  <li>The rupee fell to a historic low against the US dollar, exacerbating market conditions.</li>
  <li>Brent crude oil prices surged above $80 a barrel, raising inflation concerns.</li>
  <li>Upcoming budget expectations contributed to a restrained market sentiment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Rising crude oil prices would raise concerns of a spike in domestic inflation, which could further delay any rate cut hopes from the RBI in the near to medium term.” – Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd</blockquote>
<p>This dramatic drop in the stock market reflects broader economic uncertainties and highlights the interconnectedness of global events affecting domestic markets.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rupee Inflation Trends</figcaption>
<p>The Indian rupee has depreciated by 3.2% against the US dollar, which may hinder the country’s disinflationary progress, leading to higher import costs and inflation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Indian rupee has faced a notable depreciation, becoming the second least volatile currency after the Hong Kong dollar.</li>
  <li>Experts warn that increased import costs may translate into imported inflation.</li>
  <li>Economists indicate that sectors reliant on imported raw materials will face escalating costs, impacting consumer prices and spending.</li>
  <li>Retail inflation in India saw a decline to 5.22% in December, thanks to easing food prices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Aditi Gupta, Economist at Bank of Baroda: “Sectors heavily dependent on imported raw materials are likely to witness escalation in costs due to higher input prices, impacting margins.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The sharp depreciation of the rupee poses significant challenges to India's economic stability, making it essential for policymakers to address the potential inflationary pressures while supporting growth.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri Advocates for Employee Empowerment Amid 90-Hour Workweek Debate</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 14, 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>In light of the recent 90-hour workweek controversy, ITC Ltd Chairman Sanjiv Puri emphasized the importance of aligning employees with the company's vision rather than focusing strictly on work hours. He highlighted the company's flexible work environment, including work-from-home options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sanjiv Puri remarked that ITC would not enforce strict work hour limits.</li>
  <li>The focus should be on employee engagement and contribution to the company's goals.</li>
  <li>Puri described a vision analogy, comparing workers’ perspectives to builders constructing a castle.</li>
  <li>He mentioned the flexibility offered by ITC, including two work-from-home days per week.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What do you do sitting at home? How long can you stare at your wife, and how long can the wife stare at the husband.” - Sanjiv Puri</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Puri advocates that organizations should enable individuals to fulfill their potential rather than merely track hours worked.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>UK’s CMA slaps Google Search and its 90%+ market share with an antitrust investigation</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 1, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> TechCrunch</p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK has launched its first antitrust investigation of 2025, focusing on Google's dominance in the search market and AI search initiatives. Stakeholders have until February 3 to respond to the investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The CMA will explore Google's market dominance, particularly in search and advertising.</li>
<li>This investigation is one of two that the CMA plans to conduct this month targeting Big Tech.</li>
<li>Google currently accounts for over 90% of all general search queries in the UK, impacting over 200,000 businesses that advertise on its platform.</li>
<li>Potential outcomes could include conduct requirements or pro-competition actions.</li>
<li>The CMA is assessing whether Google suppresses competition and uses consumer data without consent.</li>
<li>Concerns over Google's preference for its own services and the impact of AI technologies are also under scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Millions of people and businesses across the UK rely on Google’s search and advertising services.” - Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA</blockquote>
<p>The investigation could usher in significant changes to ensure a competitive landscape in online search, reflecting broader challenges posed by AI innovations in the tech industry.</p>]]></description>

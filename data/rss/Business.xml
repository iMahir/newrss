            <description><![CDATA[<h1>RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra's New Year Message: Emphasize Customer Centricity</h1>
<p><strong>Date: 2025-01-01 | Source: Business Standard</strong></p>
<img src='' alt='RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra' style='max-width: 300px;'>
<p>In his New Year message to RBI employees, Governor Sanjay Malhotra stressed the importance of customer centricity in their endeavors for 2025, an 'exciting and challenging' year ahead.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Malhotra asked staff to focus on providing seamless and user-friendly services.</li>
  <li>The Indian rupee depreciated nearly 3% in 2024, touching an all-time low, and has been under pressure for the last three months.</li>
  <li>Economic growth slowed, with GDP growth in Q2 at 5.4%, and retail inflation fell to 5.5%.</li>
  <li>Malhotra will chair his first MPC meeting in February, with the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% for nearly two years.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  “Let us keep customer centricity at the heart of our endeavours and work towards providing seamless and user-friendly services.” – Sanjay Malhotra, RBI Governor
</blockquote>
<p>Malhotra took charge in December 2024, succeeding Shaktikanta Das, and highlighted the RBI's achievements in 2024, including enhancing customer protection, promoting financial literacy, and encouraging innovation.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Updated: January 1, 2025</strong> | <strong>Source: ET NOW</strong></p>
<img src="https://etstatic.tnn.in/photo/msid-95598012,width-200,height-200,resizemode-75/95598012.jpg" alt="IRFC Share Price railway stock" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>IRFC Share Price: Check make-or-break level for darling railway stock (Pic: ET NOW)</figcaption>
<p>After a strong rally in 2024, IRFC shares experienced profit booking, leading to a 49% gain for the year. The stock is currently trading at a 35% discount from its 52-week high, and investors are keenly watching its performance as the Union Budget approaches.</p>
<ul>
    <li>IRFC shares experienced a strong performance but faced profit booking.</li>
    <li>The stock has support at Rs 144 and resistance at Rs 153.</li>
    <li>Long term outlook remains strong, with a potential upward move towards Rs 170-175 if certain levels are crossed.</li>
    <li>IRFC has yielded impressive returns of 362% over the last two years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I have two suggestions for IRFC investors - if the view is long, then HOLD the position and if the view is short, then maintain a stop loss at Rs 144,” said Kunal Parar of Choice Equity.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while IRFC's outlook is solid, investors should be mindful of stop-loss levels as the stock is experiencing sideways movements.</p>]]></description>

<p>Indo Farm Equipment IPO has entered its second day of bidding, with the issue subscribed over 46 times so far. The tractor manufacturer aims to raise ₹260.15 crore from its book-built issue. The price band has been set at ₹204 to ₹215 per share.</p>
<ol>

  <li>The global agriculture equipment market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period.</li>
  <li>The company plans to use the net issue proceeds for expanding its pick & carry cranes manufacturing capacity, repayment of borrowings, investment in its NBFC subsidiary, and general corporate purposes.</li>
  <li>Analysts have given mixed ratings to the IPO, with some recommending a 'subscribe' for long-term investment and others citing high valuation.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"The company is priced at a P/E ratio of 65x times which is fully priced.

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Stock to buy: After eroding 55% of investor wealth in 2024, Vodafone Idea could rise 64%, suggests Citi’s target price</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2024-XX-XX <strong>Source:</strong> LiveMint</p>
<p>Vodafone Idea shares have seen a significant drop in 2024, yet Citi has upgraded the stock to 'buy' with a target price of ₹13, suggesting a 64% upside. The upgrade follows the government's approval of a bank guarantee waiver for spectrum payments, providing much-needed relief for the financially struggling telecom operator.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Vodafone Idea's stock lost nearly 50% of its value in 2024.</li>
  <li>Citi has set a target price of ₹13, indicating a potential increase of 64% from its last closing price.</li>
  <li>The Department of Telecommunications waived bank guarantees for significant spectrum dues.</li>
  <li>This waiver is seen as a major relief, addressing a critical funding hurdle for the telecom operator.</li>
  <li>The waiver will also positively impact related entities like Indus Towers.</li>
  <li>Vodafone Idea's shares are currently valued at ₹7.94, significantly below their 52-week high.</li>
  <li>The firm continues to face challenges from outstanding payments related to past spectrum auctions.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>“This step of bank guarantee waiver is a clear indication of the government's continued support to the telecom industry.” - Vodafone Idea</blockquote>
<p>The bank guarantee waiver signifies a pivotal moment for Vodafone Idea, though securing further debt funding remains crucial for its recovery and broader telecom sector implications.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>IndiGo has rejected the DGCA’s suggestion to raise the definition of night flying.</figcaption>
<p>IndiGo and Air India Group have opposed the DGCA’s proposal to extend the definition of night flying, citing operational impacts and the need for an advanced fatigue management system. Airlines are also resisting changes to weekly rest periods for pilots.</p>
<ul>
<li>IndiGo rejected the proposal to raise the night flying definition to include 6 a.m.</li>
<li>Air India argues they need a fatigue management system before implementing changes.</li>
<li>Airlines delayed responses on proposed rest periods for pilots.</li>
<li>Proposals include the restriction of landings during night flying.</li>
<li>Aviation expert highlights the health implications of night flying on pilots.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The body repairs itself during a period of 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. when a person is sleeping. But if the person is awake that repair is not happening, since it disturbs the circadian rhythm.” - Captain Amit Singh</blockquote>
<p>The opposition from airlines raises concerns about pilot fatigue and operational safety, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive fatigue management system before new regulations are enforced.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Vodafone Idea share price target cut (Pic: Shutterstock/ ET NOW)</figcaption>
<p>Leading brokerage firm Geojit Financial Services has cut the target for Vodafone Idea shares by more than 50%, maintaining a HOLD rating.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The revised target is set at Rs 8.6, down from Rs 17.</li>
    <li>Recent tariff hikes have marginally increased Vodafone Idea's average revenue per user (ARPU).</li>
    <li>The company's subscriber base is expected to grow with 4G and 5G expansion from Q4 FY2025 onwards.</li>
    <li>Vodafone Idea plans to raise up to Rs 1,980 crore through preferential shares, with major investments from Vodafone Group entities.</li>
    <li>Share prices have significantly decreased, with a 39% drop in the last 3 months and over 90% in the last 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The announcement follows Vodafone Idea's Rs 18,000 crore fundraise through Follow-on Public Offer (FPO).”</blockquote>
<p>The brokerage's target revision reflects considerations of Vodafone Idea's financial viability and growth prospects amid recent challenges.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Mark Zuckerberg claimed that officials from the Biden administration pressured Meta executives to remove posts regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. He described the conversations as “brutal” and criticized the government's approach towards tech companies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zuckerberg alleges Biden officials “screamed” at Meta, demanding the removal of negative vaccine posts.</li>
  <li>He stated that they also pressured Meta to censor accurate information about vaccine side effects.</li>
  <li>Zuckerberg expressed regret over past decisions made under government pressure.</li>
  <li>He noted a shift in Meta's fact-checking policy to a user-driven “community notes” system.</li>
  <li>Biden previously criticized Meta's decision not to fact-check under its new policy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The US government should be defending its companies, not be at the tip of the spear attacking its companies.” - Mark Zuckerberg</blockquote>
<p>This controversy underscores ongoing tensions between government authorities and social media platforms regarding the management of public health information.</p>]]></description>

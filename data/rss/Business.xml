<figcaption>Rupee Inflation Trends</figcaption>
<p>The Indian rupee has depreciated by 3.2% against the US dollar, which may hinder the country’s disinflationary progress, leading to higher import costs and inflation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Indian rupee has faced a notable depreciation, becoming the second least volatile currency after the Hong Kong dollar.</li>
  <li>Experts warn that increased import costs may translate into imported inflation.</li>
  <li>Economists indicate that sectors reliant on imported raw materials will face escalating costs, impacting consumer prices and spending.</li>
  <li>Retail inflation in India saw a decline to 5.22% in December, thanks to easing food prices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Aditi Gupta, Economist at Bank of Baroda: “Sectors heavily dependent on imported raw materials are likely to witness escalation in costs due to higher input prices, impacting margins.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The sharp depreciation of the rupee poses significant challenges to India's economic stability, making it essential for policymakers to address the potential inflationary pressures while supporting growth.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 14, 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>In light of the recent 90-hour workweek controversy, ITC Ltd Chairman Sanjiv Puri emphasized the importance of aligning employees with the company's vision rather than focusing strictly on work hours. He highlighted the company's flexible work environment, including work-from-home options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sanjiv Puri remarked that ITC would not enforce strict work hour limits.</li>
  <li>The focus should be on employee engagement and contribution to the company's goals.</li>
  <li>Puri described a vision analogy, comparing workers’ perspectives to builders constructing a castle.</li>
  <li>He mentioned the flexibility offered by ITC, including two work-from-home days per week.</li>

<blockquote>“What do you do sitting at home? How long can you stare at your wife, and how long can the wife stare at the husband.” - Sanjiv Puri</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Bernstein's portfolio adds IndusInd Bank, Coforge, Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports, and Jubilant Foodworks.</li>
  <li>Stocks excluded include Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, REC, and Zomato.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How China wants to press pause on India's Apple success story</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date Here] <strong>Source:</strong> Economic Times</p>
<p>China is taking steps to stifle India’s burgeoning Apple manufacturing sector amid concerns over its rapid progress in the domestic electronics industry, which relies heavily on Chinese machinery and components.</p>
<ul>
<li>India's Apple manufacturing relies on equipment and components from China.</li>
<li>China is reportedly halting the supply of crucial high-tech machinery needed for production.</li>
<li>Foxconn, a major supplier, faces challenges in relocating staff and equipment from China.</li>
<li>India's local value addition in manufacturing has increased significantly, reaching 15-20% in various models.</li>
<li>Despite delays, India aims to improve its production capabilities and attract other manufacturers.</li>
<li>Strategic geopolitical tensions between India and China may further complicate the situation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Apple’s achievement remains unparalleled in a year for any single product export from India,” a government official stated.</blockquote>
<p>China's actions to curtail the supply of essential manufacturing resources could pose significant challenges to India's ambitions in electronics manufacturing. However, with ongoing efforts to localize production, India may still find pathways for success in this competitive landscape.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2025<br><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/TABLE-1.jpg?resize=600,266" alt="GDP Trends">
<figcaption>Table 1: GDP Trends Analysis</figcaption>
<p>The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released the First Advance Estimates (FAEs) of India’s GDP growth for the financial year 2024-25. These estimates suggest that India's nominal GDP is projected to reach Rs 324 lakh crores, growing 9.7% over the previous financial year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The estimated nominal GDP for FY25 is $3.8 trillion at the exchange rate of 85 rupees to a dollar.</li>
  <li>Real GDP is expected to be Rs 184.9 lakh crores, accounting for 57% of nominal GDP, indicating a growth deceleration.</li>
  <li>Private consumption demand (PFCE) plays a crucial role, contributing almost 60% to GDP.</li>
  <li>Government spending growth has been slow, averaging just 4.2% for the current year.</li>
  <li>Investments have stalled since 2014, leading to reduced productive capacity growth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"When one considers a slightly longer period, it becomes clear that India’s real economy is growing at less than 5% per annum."
</blockquote>
<p>The latest GDP figures serve as a reality check, revealing that while India's growth appears strong, much of this is boosted by a low base effect from the pandemic's economic contraction.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>XAU/USD: Daily Chart</figcaption>
<p>Gold price sees upward momentum as markets react to increasing concerns over US debt issuances and inflation following a strong ISM Services report.</p>
<ul>
  <li>US markets are preparing for substantial debt issuances, raising concerns about potential increases in interest rates.</li>
  <li>The ISM Services sector report indicated inflationary pressures, which negatively affected expectations for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.</li>
  <li>Gold prices are stabilizing within a tactical formation, with upward and downward trends noted.</li>
  <li>The US 10-year yield has reached an eight-month high due to inflation concerns.</li>
  <li>Market speculations suggest that significant reactions to the new administration's tariff plans could influence gold prices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"A stronger position for gold can be expected if patterns become clearer amid the ongoing economic tensions."</blockquote>
<p>The article emphasizes the uncertainty in financial markets and the pivotal role of gold as a hedge against inflation in turbulent economic times.</p>]]></description>

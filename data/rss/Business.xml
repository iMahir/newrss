<p>Salesforce, a leading software company, announced it will not hire engineers this year due to significant productivity gains from its AI technologies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CEO Marc Benioff stated the company will focus on its AI product, Agentforce, which has increased engineering productivity by over 30%.</li>
  <li>Salesforce plans to add 1,000 to 2,000 salespeople to meet demand for AI solutions.</li>
  <li>There will be a reduction in the number of support engineers due to the efficiency brought by AI.</li>
  <li>Salesforce has reportedly doubled its workforce in India over recent years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“We have increased the productivity this year with Agentforce and with other AI technology that we're using for engineering teams…” – Marc Benioff</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision reflects a broader shift in the tech industry where AI is reshaping workforce requirements.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Meta transitions to community-based fact-checking.</figcaption>
<p>Meta's recent decision to eliminate third-party fact-checking in the US in favor of a community-based model has raised alarms about the potential spread of misinformation, especially in diverse markets like India.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta will now rely on user-generated content for fact-checking, following the community notes model popularized by Twitter.</li>
<li>Experts warn this change may exacerbate misinformation and disinformation on Meta platforms.</li>
<li>Prominent voices, including Phil Bloomer and Angie Drobnic Holan, express concern over the implications for accurate information in social media.</li>
<li>The decision is perceived as a reaction to political pressures and is likely to extend to other regions, including India.</li>
<li>In India, a transition away from established fact-checking could have severe consequences, given the country's diversity and reliance on accurate content.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“India is a diverse country and with diversity, the understanding of the same situation or content could vary.” - Pratishtha Arora</blockquote>
<p>This strategic shift by Meta indicates potential risks for information integrity globally, as it may set a precedent for other countries.</p>]]></description>

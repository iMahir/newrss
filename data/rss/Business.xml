            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Sebi May Revise ₹500 Cr Derivative Exposure Limit for Institutional Investors</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is contemplating changes to the ₹500-crore exposure limit for institutional investors in derivatives, which was implemented post the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. The proposed revisions aim to refine how open interest is measured and link market-wide position limits to actual delivery volumes of stocks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sebi is considering revising the exposure limit for foreign portfolio investors and mutual funds.</li>
<li>The changes address market manipulation risks and excessive volatility in derivatives trading.</li>
<li>Current limits include a cumulative cap of ₹7,500 crore on index futures and options trades.</li>
<li>Following a study, individual traders reportedly lost ₹1.8 trillion trading index options.</li>
<li>The new methodology will focus on a delta-based metric for measuring open interest, aligning with global best practices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Moving to a delta-based metric would ensure that we are actually measuring risk the correct way,” - Ananth Narayan, Sebi Whole-Time Member.</blockquote>
<p>The adjustments are set to enhance market stability and better reflect actual trading risks, ensuring investor protection and more informed trading practices.</p>]]></description>

<p>Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticized the current government for the rupee reaching its lowest value against the US dollar, demanding accountability from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rupee declined 18 paise to settle at 86.04 against the US dollar.</li>
  <li>Priyanka recalled PM Modi's past statements during UPA's tenure linking rupee value with government prestige.</li>
  <li>She emphasized that Modi should explain the current situation to the public.</li>
  <li>Contributing factors include global crude oil prices and foreign funds outflow.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Today he himself is the prime minister and all the records on the fall of the rupee have been broken. He should answer to the people of the country," Priyanka Gandhi stated.</blockquote>
<p>This situation emphasizes the need for the government to respond effectively to economic challenges amidst changing global dynamics.</p>]]></description>

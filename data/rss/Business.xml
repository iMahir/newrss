<p>The Indian rupee is expected to remain under pressure in 2025 due to a strong dollar along with geopolitical tensions and central bank interventions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Reserve Bank of India is likely to intervene in the currency market to mitigate volatility.</li>
  <li>Expectations of a strong dollar are arising from US economic policies under the new administration.</li>
  <li>Geopolitical factors and the upcoming Indian Union Budget are crucial for the rupee's movement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Exogenous factors are likely to play a greater role in the rupee’s weakness going ahead, particularly the Fed’s trajectory and the US government policies under the new President will be important.” - Aditi Gupta, economist at Bank of Baroda</blockquote>
<p>The outlook for the Indian rupee indicates a challenging environment influenced by global economic factors and domestic policy decisions.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[WhatsApp permitted to expand WhatsApp Pay to all users in India - TechCrunch]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>WhatsApp Granted Approval to Offer Payments to All Users in India</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, [publication date unknown]<br><strong>Source:</strong> TechCrunch</p>
<p>India has lifted restrictions on WhatsApp’s payment service, paving the way for the app's expansion in its largest market.</p>
<ul>
<li>The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has allowed WhatsApp to roll out its payment service to all users.</li>
<li>The previous limit of 100 million users has been removed, enhancing WhatsApp's competition against fintech rivals.</li>
<li>India's UPI platform processes over 13 billion transactions monthly but is largely dominated by Google Pay and PhonePe.</li>
<li>The NPCI has postponed implementing a 30% transaction cap for two years, staving off further market regulation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our goal is to add value and convenience to users’ lives through various use-cases like bill payments, ticket booking, and shopping.” - WhatsApp spokesperson</blockquote>
<p>This approval marks a significant move in WhatsApp's efforts to establish itself in India's rapidly growing digital payment landscape.</p>]]></description>

<p>Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are powering the next wave of software job creation, outpacing the traditional information technology (IT) sector in 2024...</p>
<ul>
  <li>India has added over three lakh employees and nearly $20 billion in market capitalization in 2024.</li>
  <li>IT companies have added less than a lakh in headcount and just $6 billion in market value during the same period.</li>
  <li>The IT industry is facing demand pressure due to a macroeconomic slowdown in North America and Europe.</li>
  <li>Nilesh Thakker from Zinnov emphasizes India's solidification as the 'GCC Hotspot of the World.'</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"India today has solidified its position as the 'GCC Hotspot of the World.'" - Nilesh Thakker</blockquote>
<p>This shift marks a significant transformation in the job market, indicating a robust growth trajectory for GCCs despite challenges faced by the IT sector.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NCLAT Approves Merger of Equinox India and Embassy Group</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> <time datetime="2025-01-07T14:08:12.720Z" title="2025-01-07 14:08">07 Jan 2025, 2:08 pm</time></p>
<p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has approved the merger between Equinox India Developments and Embassy Group, overturning a previous NCLT ruling that halted the merger.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The NCLAT ruled against objections raised by a minor shareholder regarding the merger.</li>
  <li>The process received overwhelming support from 99.9987% of equity shareholders.</li>
  <li>The merger was assessed and approved by the Competition Commission of India.</li>
  <li>Valuation discrepancies raised by the Income Tax Department were addressed satisfactorily.</li>
  <li>The NCLAT emphasized the judicial wisdom of shareholders and creditors in approving the scheme.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“After going through the facts and circumstances... we hold that Ld. NCLT, Chandigarh has erred in interfering in the Scheme ignoring the commercial wisdom of shareholders...”</blockquote>
<p>The ruling allows the merger to proceed while stating that the Income Tax Department can still take action to protect revenue interests.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Meta drops fact-checking, loosens its content moderation rules</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> TechCrunch</p>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has announced significant changes to its content moderation policies, including the end of its third-party fact-checking program.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The third-party fact-checking program will be replaced by a Community Notes model.</li>
  <li>Restrictions on mainstream discussion topics will be lifted, focusing instead on illegal and severe violations.</li>
  <li>Users will be encouraged to personalize their political content, allowing for more opinion-based feeds.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Meta’s platforms are built to be places where people can express themselves freely.” - Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer</blockquote>
<p>These changes come as Meta adjusts to a new political landscape in the U.S., aiming to balance free expression with moderation while responding to public criticism of its previous policies.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Outlook 2025: Tata Steel, JSW, JSPL, SAIL others; Improvement in domestic steel prices hold key</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 23, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>As steel prices remain largely stable, the performance of major steel stocks has varied throughout 2024. While Jindal Steel & Power has shown substantial returns, other players like Tata Steel and SAIL face challenges.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jindal Steel & Power Ltd recorded a 27% return this year.</li>
    <li>Tata Steel and JSW Steel have seen gains up to 5%; SAIL's shares have declined by 4-5%.</li>
    <li>Factors impacting steel prices include flat domestic prices and increased imports due to weak global demand, particularly from China.</li>
    <li>Concerns about rising input costs, particularly iron ore, due to proposed mining taxes in Karnataka.</li>
    <li>Domestic steel demand is expected to remain resilient, but the capacity utilization of the steel industry may drop below 80%.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Finished steel imports into India are poised to grow by 30%, touching 10 million tonne in CY2024." - Ritabrata Ghosh, ICRA Limited</blockquote>
<p>The outlook for domestic steel prices in 2025 hinges on multiple factors, including international market conditions and government trade policies affecting steel imports.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Foreign institutional investors and domestic institutions are showing contrasting trends in market activity.</figcaption>
<p>The Nifty experienced a volatile trading session, closing below 23,800 due to emerging selling pressure. Despite an optimistic start, the market shifted to a sideways-to-bearish trajectory as the December expiry approaches. Metal stocks emerged as key losers, while Tata Group stocks witnessed a significant surge.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Nifty closed at 23,727.65, down 0.11%, indicating a pause in the uptrend.</li>
<li>Selling pressure was prominent near the 23,900 level, leading to a range-bound movement.</li>
<li>Tata Capital's potential IPO is anticipated to significantly impact the market.</li>
<li>Concerns over a strong dollar and high bond yields contribute to market caution.</li>
<li>Key resistance levels for the Nifty are at 23,900-24,000.</li>
<li>The Nifty Bank index showed consolidation, with key support at 50,750.</li>
<li>Market players should watch for a recovery in stocks such as Nalco India and BPCL.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The market remains cautious due to various macroeconomic factors affecting investor sentiment.” - Vinod Nair, Geojit Financial Services</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as the final trading session of December approaches, traders should remain alert to potential movements influenced by upcoming earnings results and budget announcements.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Tata Capital IPO Date Another IPO in the works from Tata Group</figcaption>
<p>A new IPO from Tata Group is on the horizon, with preparations underway for the Tata Capital IPO expected to launch by mid-2025.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tata Capital, a leading non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India, is poised to initiate its IPO.</li>
    <li>The Tata Group has begun discussions with bankers for a projected $2 billion IPO.</li>
    <li>The RBI classifies Tata Capital as an upper-layer NBFC, necessitating a share listing by September 2025.</li>
    <li>Current market valuation of Tata Capital is around Rs 3.5 lakh crore, with shares trading in the unlisted market.</li>
    <li>If successful, this will mark Tata Group's second IPO in the last two decades, following Tata Technologies' IPO in 2023.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Tata Technologies shares were issued at Rs 500 in IPO and made a bumper listing at Rs 1200.”</blockquote>
<p>This IPO could significantly enhance Tata Capital's market presence and expand Tata Group's portfolio in the financial sector.</p>]]></description>

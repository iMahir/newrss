<figcaption>Cover image via <a href="https://www.freepik.com/ai">www.freepik.com</a></figcaption>
<p>Amid speculations, MicroStrategy is not issuing 10 billion shares to purchase $3 trillion worth of Bitcoin, as clarified by analyst Jeff Park.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rumors suggested MicroStrategy would issue shares to buy an extravagant amount of Bitcoin.</li>
  <li>Jeff Park called the speculation unrealistic, emphasizing that Bitcoin's total market cap is under $2 trillion.</li>
  <li>MicroStrategy's share value is closely tied to Bitcoin, but a collapse in Bitcoin won't lead to MSTR's complete failure.</li>
  <li>Park reassured investors not to panic sell when Bitcoin prices fluctuate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"$MSTR is not issuing 10 billion shares to buy $3 trillion worth of Bitcoin. I can’t believe I’m tweeting this on Christmas Eve." — Jeff Park</blockquote>
<p>Park highlighted MicroStrategy's robust financial strategies, echoing sentiments from experts who see MSTR shares as undervalued.</p>]]></description>

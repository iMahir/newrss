            <description><![CDATA[<h1>US Tightens AI Chip Exports Restrictions Ahead of Trump's Inauguration</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 13, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> White House Briefing Room</p>
<p>On Monday, the Biden administration unveiled sweeping restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips and related technologies as President Joe Biden prepares to leave office.</p>
<p>The “Interim Final Rule on Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” seeks to maintain U.S. dominance in AI while preventing adversaries from exploiting advanced systems for malicious purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The restrictions impose caps on advanced graphics processing units exports to most countries.</li>
  <li>U.S. and 18 allies are exempt; countries like China and Russia face strict bans.</li>
  <li>New licensing requirements introduced for exports to over 120 nations.</li>
  <li>Entities meeting security standards can gain special statuses for more favorable export terms.</li>
  <li>Chip exports to non-allied nations are capped at 50,000 GPUs per country.</li>
  <li>The rules will take effect mid-May 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To enhance U.S. national security and economic strength, it is essential that we do not offshore this critical technology.” - White House statement</blockquote>
<p>The announcement has generated a mix of support and pushback, particularly from tech firms like Nvidia, which criticized the policy as potentially undermining U.S. innovation.</p>
<p>This move represents a significant shift in U.S. export policy concerning AI technologies, set against a backdrop of increasing global competition in the AI space.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>TikTok dismissed the claim as "pure fiction."(X)</figcaption>
<p>A report suggesting that China might sell TikTok’s U.S. operations to Elon Musk ignited discussions online. TikTok has officially dismissed the claim as untrue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Bloomberg report suggested that Chinese officials considered selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to Elon Musk.</li>
  <li>This move is linked to potential decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding a ban on TikTok.</li>
  <li>TikTok denied the claim, labeling it as “pure fiction.”</li>
  <li>Former President Trump has urged the Supreme Court to delay its decision on the app.</li>
  <li>Bipartisan calls in Congress are pushing for an extension of the January 19 deadline for negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We can’t be expected to comment on pure fiction,” a TikTok spokesperson told BBC News.</blockquote>
<p>As the debate continues, the fate of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain amidst national security concerns.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>HCL stock performance chart</figcaption>
<p>Shares of India's third largest IT company, HCLTech plummeted over 9 percent on January 14, driven by updated revenue guidance indicating weaker growth for Q4, revealing a surprising shift in market sentiment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HCLTech shares fell 9% following the release of its Q3 performance.</li>
  <li>The company's earnings were in-line, but the guidance hinted at a weaker performance for Q4.</li>
  <li>Current share price stands at Rs 1,804.65, marking the biggest single-day decline in nearly a decade.</li>
  <li>Revenue growth guidance for fiscal year 2025 was adjusted to 4.5-5%, an upgrade of 100 basis points on the lower end.</li>
  <li>CEO C Vijayakumar noted challenges including a telecom deal scale-down and delays in project ramp-ups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Brokerages pointed out that the updated guidance suggested weaker growth for Q4, which came as a disappointment, especially with improved discretionary demand.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the volatility of the tech stock market and investor reactions to earnings forecasts.</p>]]></description>

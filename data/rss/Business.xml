<figcaption>Rupee Inflation Trends</figcaption>
<p>The Indian rupee has depreciated by 3.2% against the US dollar, which may hinder the country’s disinflationary progress, leading to higher import costs and inflation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Indian rupee has faced a notable depreciation, becoming the second least volatile currency after the Hong Kong dollar.</li>
  <li>Experts warn that increased import costs may translate into imported inflation.</li>
  <li>Economists indicate that sectors reliant on imported raw materials will face escalating costs, impacting consumer prices and spending.</li>
  <li>Retail inflation in India saw a decline to 5.22% in December, thanks to easing food prices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Aditi Gupta, Economist at Bank of Baroda: “Sectors heavily dependent on imported raw materials are likely to witness escalation in costs due to higher input prices, impacting margins.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The sharp depreciation of the rupee poses significant challenges to India's economic stability, making it essential for policymakers to address the potential inflationary pressures while supporting growth.</p>]]></description>

<p>Bernstein, a well-known brokerage firm, has revised its model portfolio for India in 2025, introducing five new stocks while excluding four others. The updates aim to provide investors with insights into market opportunities.</p>
<img src='https://example.com/main-image.jpg' alt='Bernstein Model Portfolio 2025' />
<figcaption>Bernstein's Model Portfolio for 2025</figcaption>
<p>This update includes stocks like IndusInd Bank and Bharti Airtel, highlighting renewed opportunities even for those that experienced significant declines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bernstein's portfolio adds IndusInd Bank, Coforge, Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports, and Jubilant Foodworks.</li>
  <li>Stocks excluded include Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, REC, and Zomato.</li>
  <li>IndusInd Bank is noted for its recovery potential despite recent poor performance.</li>
  <li>Coforge has shown strong growth potential, particularly following acquisitions.</li>
  <li>Bernstein's strategy focuses on stocks with clearer recovery paths in a volatile market.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How China wants to press pause on India's Apple success story</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date Here] <strong>Source:</strong> Economic Times</p>
<p>China is taking steps to stifle India’s burgeoning Apple manufacturing sector amid concerns over its rapid progress in the domestic electronics industry, which relies heavily on Chinese machinery and components.</p>
<ul>
<li>India's Apple manufacturing relies on equipment and components from China.</li>
<li>China is reportedly halting the supply of crucial high-tech machinery needed for production.</li>
<li>Foxconn, a major supplier, faces challenges in relocating staff and equipment from China.</li>
<li>India's local value addition in manufacturing has increased significantly, reaching 15-20% in various models.</li>
<li>Despite delays, India aims to improve its production capabilities and attract other manufacturers.</li>
<li>Strategic geopolitical tensions between India and China may further complicate the situation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Apple’s achievement remains unparalleled in a year for any single product export from India,” a government official stated.</blockquote>
<p>China's actions to curtail the supply of essential manufacturing resources could pose significant challenges to India's ambitions in electronics manufacturing. However, with ongoing efforts to localize production, India may still find pathways for success in this competitive landscape.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>US Tightens AI Chip Exports Restrictions Ahead of Trump's Inauguration</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 13, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> White House Briefing Room</p>
<p>On Monday, the Biden administration unveiled sweeping restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips and related technologies as President Joe Biden prepares to leave office.</p>
<p>The “Interim Final Rule on Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” seeks to maintain U.S. dominance in AI while preventing adversaries from exploiting advanced systems for malicious purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The restrictions impose caps on advanced graphics processing units exports to most countries.</li>
  <li>U.S. and 18 allies are exempt; countries like China and Russia face strict bans.</li>
  <li>New licensing requirements introduced for exports to over 120 nations.</li>
  <li>Entities meeting security standards can gain special statuses for more favorable export terms.</li>
  <li>Chip exports to non-allied nations are capped at 50,000 GPUs per country.</li>
  <li>The rules will take effect mid-May 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To enhance U.S. national security and economic strength, it is essential that we do not offshore this critical technology.” - White House statement</blockquote>
<p>The announcement has generated a mix of support and pushback, particularly from tech firms like Nvidia, which criticized the policy as potentially undermining U.S. innovation.</p>
<p>This move represents a significant shift in U.S. export policy concerning AI technologies, set against a backdrop of increasing global competition in the AI space.</p>]]></description>

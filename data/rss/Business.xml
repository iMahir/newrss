<figcaption>During an employee interaction, Subrahmanyan lamented over not being able to make staff work seven days a week. (Screengrab)</figcaption>
<p>In a now-viral video, Larsen & Toubro Chairman SN Subrahmanyan has ignited a storm of criticism for suggesting employees should work 90 hours a week, including Sundays.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subrahmanyan joked about employees staring at their wives instead of working and criticized the inability to require Sunday work.</li>
<li>Comments drew backlash and comparisons to Narayana Murthy’s controversial 70-hour workweek suggestion.</li>
<li>Critics highlighted L&T's corporate culture, questioning the treatment of employees and work-life balance in India.</li>
<li>The debate ties into broader discussions on work expectations in India's private sector, with contrasting views from leaders like Infosys founder Narayana Murthy and Swiggy CEO Rohit Kapoor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“How long will you stare at your wife?” L&T chairman wants you to work on Sundays also!</blockquote>
<p>This comment has reinvigorated conversations about the need for a healthy work-life balance amid growing pressures on employees in corporate settings.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Sensex, Nifty 50 fall for second consecutive session. What is driving Indian stock market down? Explained with 5 factors</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 9<br /><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>In a continuation of a downward trend, the Indian stock market's benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty 50, have declined in response to a combination of weak global cues and internal economic challenges.</p>
<img src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Indian stock market decline" />
<figcaption>Illustration depicting recent stock market trends.</figcaption>
<p>The recent decline can be attributed to five key factors impacting investor sentiment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q3 earnings in focus:</strong> Investors await upcoming earnings reports, creating caution in the markets.</li>
<li><strong>Rising US bond yields and dollar:</strong> Increased bond yields are steering foreign capital away from emerging markets.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy selling by FPIs:</strong> Foreign portfolio investors are retreating amid concerns over trade policies and interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Macro jitters:</strong> Economic growth concerns are significantly affecting investor risk appetite.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty over US Federal Reserve policies:</strong> Speculations about inflation and policy adjustments are causing apprehension.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The recent fall in the Indian stock market can be attributed to several interconnected factors..." - Atul Parakh, CEO of Bigul</blockquote>
<p>As the situation unfolds, investors are advised to be cautious due to the prevailing market uncertainties.</p>]]></description>

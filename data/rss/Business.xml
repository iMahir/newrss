<p>A section of Akasa Air pilots has raised concerns about alleged training and safety issues at the airline and sought the intervention of the civil aviation ministry, while the carrier termed the allegations as untrue.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Akasa Air faces allegations of training lapses and safety issues, with pilots requesting a probe.</li>
    <li>The airline disputes these claims, stating that 324 pilots have joined since October 2023 and attrition is below 1%.</li>
    <li>84 pilots reportedly resigned on short notice, prompting concerns among remaining staff.</li>
    <li>The DGCA imposed a Rs 30 lakh fine on Akasa Air for previous training lapses.</li>
    <li>The airline operates 26 planes and serves 27 destinations, including five overseas cities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "We categorically deny these allegations as baseless and untrue. Nor do they represent the views of Akasa pilots," - Airline spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the concerns raised, Akasa Air maintains that its monthly employee surveys indicate high job satisfaction among pilots, countering the allegations about unfair practices.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SARFAESI | Confirmed Sale Can't Be Set Aside For Mere Irregularities Except Fraud, Collusion, Inadequate...</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>The Supreme Court recently clarified the grounds under which a sale of property under the SARFAESI Act can be challenged after confirmation, emphasizing that only fundamental errors like fraud or collusion are valid reasons for setting aside a sale.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Court held that procedural irregularities alone cannot invalidate a confirmed sale.</li>
    <li>Only substantial procedural errors such as fraud, collusion, or inadequate pricing warrant intervention.</li>
    <li>Legal challenges should ideally be raised before the confirmation of the sale.</li>
    <li>The judgment referenced V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, reinforcing that courts should avoid setting aside auctions unless serious flaws are identified.</li>
    <li>The case involved a minor procedural point regarding the gap between sale and auction notices, which was insufficient for a successful challenge.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Any sale by auction or other public procurement methods once already confirmed or concluded ought not to be set-aside or interfered with lightly except on grounds that go to the core of such sale process, such as either being collusive, fraudulent or vitiated by inadequate pricing or underbidding."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the Supreme Court reinforced the stability of confirmed sales under the SARFAESI Act, allowing challenges only in cases of significant procedural shortcomings. This ruling aims to maintain confidence in auction processes and avoid unnecessary disruptions. </p>]]></description>

<p>Supreme Court judge Justice KV Viswanathan emphasized the importance of considering the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in society, stating that it should not be outrightly rejected during a recent event.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Justice Viswanathan spoke at the Delhi High Court during the launch of a commentary on Patent Law by advocate Adarsh Ramanujan.</li>
    <li>He highlighted the commentary's intriguing analysis of AI's relationship with patent law.</li>
    <li>Justice Manmohan also attended, noting an increase in patent applications at the Indian Patent Office as an encouraging trend.</li>
    <li>The event included discussions on the significance of identifying invention origins through patenting and the need for better training for patent examiners.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“I don't think that AI should be outrightly rejected. It calls for a certain amount of thought before we take a final call on it,” - Justice KV Viswanathan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Patent law is where future lies. It is a growing field that puts the lawyer first,” - Justice Manmohan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This discussion reflects a growing recognition of the potential and challenges of integrating AI into legal frameworks, while also encouraging innovation in patent law practices in India.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://www.greatandhra.com/newphotos10/newyork11736072256.jpg" alt="New York imposes first ever congestion pricing plan in US">
<figcaption>A congestion pricing plan covering Lower and Midtown Manhattan took effect on Sunday.</figcaption>
<p>A congestion pricing plan has been initiated in Manhattan, making New York City the first in the United States to adopt such a system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vehicles entering the congestion relief zone will be tolled based on vehicle type, time of day, and payment method.</li>
  <li>This plan aims to reduce the number of vehicles in the zone by an estimated 10%.</li>
  <li>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) anticipates generating $1 billion annually from this plan.</li>
  <li>Controversy surrounding the plan has resulted in multiple lawsuits, though implementation proceeded.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The tolls would be adjusted upward in 2028 and 2031, phasing out 40% of initial discounts."</blockquote>
<p>This congestion pricing initiative marks a significant shift in urban traffic management and aims to fund public transportation while reducing congestion in Manhattan.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, attributed mainly to foreign investor withdrawals and prevailing economic conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rupee breached the 85 mark against the U.S. dollar, reaching an all-time low of 85.81.</li>
<li>Factors affecting currency depreciation include monetary policy, foreign demand for goods, and inflation rates.</li>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has intervened to support the rupee but foreign exchange reserves are at an eight-month low of $640 billion.</li>
<li>Long-term trends show the rupee's gradual depreciation is tied to high inflation rates compared to the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Analysts believe the rupee’s depreciation would have been far worse if not for the RBI’s intervention to support the rupee against the dollar.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the rupee's current depreciation reflects broader economic trends, investor behavior, and international monetary policy shifts, with implications for India's economic stability.</p>]]></description>

<p>Indian-origin CEO Aravind Srinivas, who has been waiting three years for US citizenship, asked on X whether he should apply for a green card. Elon Musk responded with a simple “Yes,” igniting discussions on the platform.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aravind Srinivas is the CEO of Perplexity AI, a company he founded in 2022.</li>
    <li>He sought advice on whether to file for a green card due to his lengthy waiting period for citizenship.</li>
    <li>Musk's reply received significant attention and support from social media users.</li>
    <li>Days prior, Musk commented on the challenges posed by the US immigration system, highlighting the irony of criminal versus intellectual entry.</li>
    <li>Srinivas has a strong academic background and experience at leading tech companies like Google and OpenAI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The system makes it easier for criminals to enter the country than it does for intellectuals or Nobel Laureates.” - Elon Musk</blockquote>
<p>This interaction underscores ongoing concerns regarding the US immigration process, particularly for talented individuals. Musk's support may amplify discussions around reforming the system to benefit skilled immigrants. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Bhushan Power Insolvency: ED concedes appeal against JSW Steel; Supreme Court orders restitution of attached properties</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 15 Dec 2024, 4:35 am</p>
<div>
    <p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has opted not to pursue its appeal against JSW Steel's takeover of Bhushan Power and Steel, resulting in the restitution of assets valued at ₹4,025 crore to JSW Steel under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>ED decided against appealing to the Supreme Court regarding JSW Steel's acquisition of Bhushan Power.</li>
    <li>Assets worth ₹4,025 crore were returned to JSW Steel after the Supreme Court’s directive on December 11.</li>
    <li>Section 32A of the IBC offers immunity from asset attachment if a resolution plan is approved.</li>
    <li>The ED's previous stance argued that this immunity should not apply retroactively to Bhushan Power.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court allowed JSW Steel to take control of the properties while ED retains the right to investigate the former promoters of Bhushan Power.</li>
    <li>The court clarified that its decision is specific to this case and does not set a precedent for future cases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“It is further clarified that the Court has not expressed any opinion on the interpretation of Section 32A (2) of IBC or on the powers of the E.D. to attach the property of the Corporate Debtor which is undergoing the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The settlement allows JSW Steel to take control of the assets while the ED continues its investigations into the actions of Bhushan Power’s former promoters, highlighting the complexities of insolvency proceedings and asset attachment under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).]]></description>

<figcaption>Union Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra appointed as the new RBI Governor.</figcaption>
<p>On December 9, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Governorship changed hands, with Union Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra stepping into the role as Shaktikanta Das prepares to exit. Malhotra's appointment surprised many, marking a departure from traditional appointments within the Finance Ministry.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sanjay Malhotra, a 1990-batch IAS officer, is the new RBI Governor for a three-year term.</li>
    <li>He holds a degree in computer engineering from IIT Kanpur and a Master’s in Public Policy from Princeton University.</li>
    <li>Malhotra is described as soft-spoken, affable, and inquisitive, known for engaging conversations about economic issues.</li>
    <li>Upon taking office, he emphasized a balanced approach to economic issues, prioritizing public interest, growth, stability, certainty, and trust.</li>
    <li>His previous roles give him insights into taxation and economic trends, suggesting he may approach monetary policy with a unique perspective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I do not like to start playing my shots from the first ball of a match... I will put the best foot forward in public interest." - Sanjay Malhotra</blockquote>
<p>As a relatively unknown figure in economic circles, Sanjay Malhotra's governance is anticipated to bring new perspectives to the RBI, particularly amidst ongoing challenges in economic growth and inflation management.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India Initiates Countervailing Duty Probe on Subsidized Vietnamese Chemical Imports</h1>
<p><strong>New Delhi, Dec 30 (PTI)</strong></p>
<img src='https://example.com/image.jpg' alt='DGTR Logo' width='200'><figcaption>DGTR Logo</figcaption>
<p>India has started a countervailing duty investigation into increased imports of Calcium Carbonate Filler Masterbatch, a chemical used in the plastic industry, from Vietnam. The move follows a complaint from domestic manufacturers who allege that the increased imports are subsidized, causing material injury to their businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has initiated the probe.</li>
<li>Domestic manufacturers have alleged that producers/exporters in Vietnam have received actionable subsidies from various levels of the Vietnamese government.</li>
<li>Countervailing duties are country-specific duties imposed to safeguard domestic industries against unfair trade subsidies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"On the basis of the duly substantiated written application filed by the domestic industry...on the basis of the prima facie evidence submitted by the domestic industry, about the subsidization of the product...the authority, hereby, initiates an investigation."</blockquote>
<p>Vietnam is a key trading partner of India, with exports and imports reaching USD 5.47 billion and USD 9.34 billion respectively in 2023-24.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Gold Price Recovers Recent Losses</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 31, 2022
<strong>Source:</strong> FXStreet</p>
<img src="https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/image-638711237254973322.png" alt="Gold Price Chart" width="500" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><figcaption>Gold Price Chart</figcaption>
<p>The Gold price (XAU/USD) has recovered its recent losses, currently trading near $2,620.00, as markets anticipate signals regarding the United States (US) economy and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate outlook under the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold gains support due to increased risk aversion and potential trade conflicts.</li>
<li>The outlook for fewer Fed rate cuts in 2025 might cap the upside for Gold.</li>
<li>Geopolitical risks, including Israeli attacks on Gaza hospitals, also support Gold prices.</li>
<li>Gold is set to finish the year with a 27% gain, its strongest annual performance since 2010.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gold prices are influenced by the US Dollar Index (DXY), US Treasury bond yields, and geopolitical tensions. The Fed's recent hawkish pivot and the anticipated economic strategies of the incoming Trump administration are also key factors affecting Gold prices.</p>
<p>The daily chart indicates a consolidation phase for Gold, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering just below the 50 mark. Key resistances and supports are identified for potential future price movements.</p>

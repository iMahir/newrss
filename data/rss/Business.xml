<p>India may soon face increased inflation and oil supply challenges due to U.S. sanctions targeting Russian energy companies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>U.S. sanctions on Russian oil transport may impact India's oil imports significantly.</li>
  <li>India imported 40% of its oil from Russia, with expectations of price increases due to limited supply.</li>
  <li>Impact on Indian refiners is likely to be severe, given the dependency on Russian crude.</li>
  <li>India's oil consumption is projected to surpass China's by 2025, adding urgency to the situation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If India were to fully comply with U.S. sanctions, we could see a sharp decline in Russian crude arrivals in February and potentially March.” - Muyu Xu, Kpler</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing situation highlights India's vulnerability to fluctuations in global oil markets and the potential for domestic economic strain.</p>]]></description>

<p>Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded Tata Group's Trent Ltd. to a 'sell' rating, citing that the expected revenue and EPS growth is already priced into the stock.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kotak downgraded Trent's rating from 'add' to 'sell'.</li>
  <li>New price target set at ₹5,850, down from ₹6,800, implying a 6% downside.</li>
  <li>Trent's shares have corrected 25% from their all-time high of ₹8,345.</li>
  <li>Analyst warns about potential revenue cannibalization from closely located Zudio stores.</li>
  <li>Revenue and EPS estimates cut by 1-2% and 9-14% respectively for FY 2025-2027.</li>
  <li>Trent shares have consistently provided positive returns every calendar year for the last decade.</li>

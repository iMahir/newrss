<figcaption>Shares of CreditAccess Grameen see significant gains following MFIN's decision.</figcaption>
<p>On January 2, 2025, stocks in the microfinance segment, such as CreditAccess Grameen and Spandana Sphoorty, saw gains of up to 9% after the MicroFinance Institute Network (MFIN) announced a three-month delay in the implementation of new lending caps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microfinance stocks gained after MFIN's announcement.</li>
  <li>The MFIN delay allows more time for lenders managing their stress and delinquencies.</li>
  <li>New lending caps will now be implemented by April 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>Industries related to microfinance were under stress, with overdues on the rise.</li>
  <li>Shares of CreditAccess Grameen rose 9.3% to ₹973.55, while Spandana Sphoorty increased by 2.5% to ₹337.3.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Microfinance overdues are up 110 basis points on a month-on-month basis in November 2024,” - UBS report.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the MFIN's decision to delay the caps offers relief to microfinance companies amidst rising defaults and stress in the sector.</p>]]></description>

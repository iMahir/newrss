            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Breakout stocks to buy or sell: Sumeet Bagadia recommends five shares to buy today</h1><p><strong>Date:</strong> 7 January 2025</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p><p>On 7 January 2025, the Indian stock market experienced a bearish trend, with the Nifty 50 index dropping significantly. Sumeet Bagadia from Choice Broking has recommended five breakout stocks for investors to consider amidst the current market conditions.</p><h2>Sumeet Bagadia's breakout stock recommendations</h2><ul><li>PNGS Gargi Fashion Jewellery: Buy at ₹1372.20, target ₹1470, stop loss ₹1320.</li><li>PTC Industries: Buy at ₹15500, target ₹17000, stop loss ₹15000.</li><li>JTL Industries: Buy at ₹104.25, target ₹111, stop loss ₹100.</li><li>NDR Auto Components: Buy at ₹795, target ₹850, stop loss ₹770.</li><li>Vijaya Diagnostic Centre: Buy at ₹1126.30, target ₹1212, stop loss ₹1085.</li></ul><blockquote>“The Indian stock market trend has turned weak after sharp selling on Monday. The Nifty 50 index has closed near the 23,600 mark, and it may try to test 23,300 levels if its current support placed at 23,500 is breached.” - Sumeet Bagadia</blockquote><p>Investors are advised to take a stock-specific approach given the uncertain market conditions and the upcoming Q3 2024-25 results.</p>]]></description>

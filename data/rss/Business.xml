<figcaption>WhatsApp wins lawsuit against NSO Group (AFP Image)</figcaption>
<p>WhatsApp has achieved a legal victory against the NSO Group, which is known for developing the Pegasus spyware. A US judge ruled that NSO Group violated US hacking laws and WhatsApp's terms of service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>WhatsApp filed the lawsuit accusing NSO of hacking 1,400 individuals in May 2019.</li>
  <li>The judge ruled in favor of WhatsApp, stating that NSO's actions were illegal.</li>
  <li>A jury trial is scheduled for March 2025 to determine the damages owed to WhatsApp.</li>
  <li>WhatsApp emphasized the need for accountability for spyware companies targeting vulnerable groups.</li>
  <li>NSO was found to be non-cooperative during the case and faced sanctions for not providing necessary information.</li>
  <li>The US government blacklisted NSO in 2021, prohibiting its agencies from utilizing its products.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>NSO must be held accountable for targeting journalists, human rights activists, and civil society groups.</blockquote>
<p>This ruling marks a significant win for WhatsApp in its ongoing battle against spyware and underscores the rising scrutiny on tech companies involved in such practices.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Failure To Hand Over Commercial Space To Purchasers Is 'Deficiency In Service': Delhi State Commission</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 09.12.2024  |  <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<p>The Delhi State Commission has declared a failure to deliver commercial space by Parsvnath developers as 'deficiency in service,' emphasizing that purchasers cannot be indefinitely delayed in receiving their property.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complainants booked office space in Parsvnath City Center Bhiwadi.</li>
  <li>Contract stipulated completion within 30 months, but the project was abandoned.</li>
  <li>After a nine-year delay and no response from the developer, the complainants sought compensation.</li>
  <li>The Commission ruled in favor of the complainants, citing Consumer Protection Act.</li>
  <li>Reliefs granted include full refund with interest, compensation for mental agony, and litigation costs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Purchasers cannot be made to wait for an indefinite period of time.”</blockquote>
<p>The ruling reinforces consumer rights in property agreements and the obligation of developers to fulfill contractual obligations.</p>]]></description>

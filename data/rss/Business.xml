<figcaption>IndiGo's response to the DGCA regarding night flying regulations.</figcaption>
<p>The proposal to alter night flying regulations has met with opposition from IndiGo and Air India Group, citing potential operational impacts. Both airlines have expressed concerns over changes that could impact pilot fatigue management.</p>
<ul>
  <li>IndiGo rejected the suggestion to extend the night flying definition to include flying until 6 a.m., arguing it would have a severe operational impact.</li>
  <li>Air India stated that changes could only be implemented after the introduction of a fatigue management system.</li>
  <li>Airlines are also opposing an increase in weekly pilot rest from 36 to 48 hours, with IndiGo suggesting a staggered implementation.</li>
  <li>Both airlines argue that expanding the night flying definition would lead to decreased night flying hours.</li>
  <li>SpiceJet requested to defer rule implementation until March 2026, highlighting staffing concerns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The body repairs itself during a period of 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. when a person is sleeping...” - Captain Amit Singh, aviation safety expert.</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing debate over night flying regulations underscores the challenges of balancing safety, operational efficiency, and pilot wellbeing in the aviation industry.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Analysis of gold market trends in light of Federal Reserve decisions.</figcaption>
<p>Gold prices fell sharply after the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut in interest rates, which traders perceived as hawkish. The Fed's projections indicate constrained rate cuts for the coming years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold has fallen over 1% following the Fed's decision.</li>
<li>The Fed's dot plot indicates 50 basis points of rate cuts in both 2025 and 2026.</li>
<li>Traders are focusing on upcoming US GDP data and core PCE inflation metrics.</li>
<li>Gold prices have dropped to volatile ranges between $2,610 and $2,630.</li>
<li>Historical comparisons reveal minimal changes in the Fed's statements.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Gold prices plunged sharply as traders assessed the cut as hawkish, with just 100 basis points of easing for the next two years.”</blockquote>

<figcaption>IndiGo has rejected the DGCA’s suggestion to raise the definition of night flying.</figcaption>
<p>IndiGo and Air India Group have opposed the DGCA’s proposal to extend the definition of night flying, citing operational impacts and the need for an advanced fatigue management system. Airlines are also resisting changes to weekly rest periods for pilots.</p>
<ul>
<li>IndiGo rejected the proposal to raise the night flying definition to include 6 a.m.</li>
<li>Air India argues they need a fatigue management system before implementing changes.</li>
<li>Airlines delayed responses on proposed rest periods for pilots.</li>
<li>Proposals include the restriction of landings during night flying.</li>
<li>Aviation expert highlights the health implications of night flying on pilots.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The body repairs itself during a period of 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. when a person is sleeping. But if the person is awake that repair is not happening, since it disturbs the circadian rhythm.” - Captain Amit Singh</blockquote>
<p>The opposition from airlines raises concerns about pilot fatigue and operational safety, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive fatigue management system before new regulations are enforced.</p>]]></description>

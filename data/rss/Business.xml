<figcaption>Elon Musk supporters, on the other hand, welcomed Sweet's account suspension, claiming that her reporting violated ethical bounds by releasing personal information about Dittmann.(AP/X)</figcaption>
<p>A conspiracy theory suggesting that Elon Musk uses a fake account to promote himself took a strange twist when journalist Jacqueline Sweet was banned from X after revealing that Adrian Dittmann is a real person living in Fiji.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The controversy began when Jacqueline Sweet's report identified Adrian Dittmann as a German businessman.</li>
  <li>Following the publication, Musk cryptically stated, “I am Adrian Dittmann. It's time the world knew.”</li>
  <li>Sweet's account was suspended for 30 days after mentioning Dittmann, which was subsequently flagged as containing “violent or misleading content.”</li>
  <li>Supporters of Musk celebrated Sweet's suspension, arguing that she breached ethical boundaries by exposing personal details about Dittmann.</li>
  <li>Critics of Musk claim the suspension stifled journalistic freedom and attacked press rights.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This is a direct assault on press freedom.</blockquote>
<p>The Twitter-like platform’s actions have raised alarms about the suppression of journalism in favor of maintaining Musk's public image.</p>]]></description>

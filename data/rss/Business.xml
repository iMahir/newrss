<p>In a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Mark Zuckerberg claimed that officials from the Biden administration pressured Meta executives to remove posts regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. He described the conversations as “brutal” and criticized the government's approach towards tech companies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zuckerberg alleges Biden officials “screamed” at Meta, demanding the removal of negative vaccine posts.</li>

  <li>Zuckerberg expressed regret over past decisions made under government pressure.</li>
  <li>He noted a shift in Meta's fact-checking policy to a user-driven “community notes” system.</li>
  <li>Biden previously criticized Meta's decision not to fact-check under its new policy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The US government should be defending its companies, not be at the tip of the spear attacking its companies.” - Mark Zuckerberg</blockquote>

<p>The Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) is taking action against food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato for alleged unfair practices regarding their private labels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>FHRAI plans to approach the Ministry of Commerce and Industry regarding quick food delivery apps.</li>
  <li>The organization accuses aggregator platforms of misusing their market dominance to promote private labels like Blinkit’s Bistro and Swiggy’s Snacc.</li>
  <li>They are seeking meetings with commerce officials to enforce e-commerce regulations.</li>
  <li>FHRAI represents around 60,000 hotels and 500,000 restaurants across India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We will be requesting the implementation of the e-commerce rules and strongly argue that these quick commerce players cannot have their own private labels.” - Pradeep Shetty, Vice President of FHRAI</blockquote>
<p>This initiative highlights the ongoing tension between traditional restaurants and online food delivery services in India.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Deloitte, PWC, EY, and KPMG aim to cut costs and reduce carbon footprints.</figcaption>
<p>The Big Four consultancies have implemented measures to limit work-related travel, encouraging employees to utilize virtual meetings and public transportation to reduce costs and support sustainability goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees are encouraged to minimize travel for client visits.</li>
<li>When travel is necessary, public transport is recommended.</li>
<li>These directives have been issued in the past few months in response to carbon footprint targets.</li>
<li>Recent client engagements have seen fewer employees traveling, advocating for remote coordination instead.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“But the firm took a view that it was sufficient for one partner to travel, and the rest could be coordinated online.”</blockquote>
<p>This move reflects the consultancies' commitment to environmental responsibility while balancing operational effectiveness.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 3, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> CNBC TV18</p>
<p>Brokerage firm Emkay Global has initiated coverage on shares of state-run power financing companies REC Ltd. and Power Finance Corporation (PFC), assigning both a 'Buy' rating.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Emkay has set a price target of ₹650 for REC and ₹600 for PFC, suggesting potential upsides of 25% and 31%, respectively.</li>
    <li>Both REC and PFC have decreased more than 20% from their record highs in July 2024.</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>“The controlled upcycle in power capital expenditure and lending is here to stay, and both REC and PFC offer an optimal pathway to capitalise on this trend.”</blockquote>
<p>The brokerage projects robust growth for both firms, driven by strong credit demand and favorable economic conditions.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ketan Parekh, the infamous scamster, has been banned from the market.</figcaption>
<p>Ketan Parekh, a notorious figure in Indian stock market history, has found himself once again in the regulatory spotlight as he faces a ban from the market imposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). This development highlights ongoing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parekh is a key figure in a major stock market scam that erupted in 2001.</li>
  <li>The ban comes amidst efforts by Sebi to clean up the financial markets and safeguard investor interests.</li>
  <li>Parekh is accused of stock price manipulation and fraudulent trading activities.</li>
  <li>This renewed scrutiny raises questions about the integrity of the Indian financial system.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are committed to ensuring a fair and transparent trading environment in the stock market,” said a Sebi spokesperson.</blockquote>
<p>This action against Parekh signals a stricter regulatory approach to market misconduct, aiming to enhance overall market integrity.</p>]]></description>

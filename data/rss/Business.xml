            <title><![CDATA[The most underrated SIP hack for a bigger mutual fund corpus | Mint - Mint]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Most Underrated SIP Hack for a Bigger Mutual Fund Corpus</h1><p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not provided<br><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p><p>Investors often pursue high returns by chasing top-performing mutual funds, but this strategy may not be the best way to build a significant corpus.</p><h2>Top Performing Mutual Funds Keep Changing</h2><p>It's important to realize that past performance does not guarantee future results. For instance, mutual funds that excelled in a bull market may not perform well in a bear market and vice versa. Here are the top 3 flexicap funds for two different 3-year periods:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>3 Year Period Ended 26 Dec 2022</th><th>3 Year Period Ended 26 Dec 2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Quant Flexicap (37.58%)</td><td>JM Flexicap (28.46%)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>PGIM India Flexicap (24.58%)</td><td>HDFC Flexicap (25.59%)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Parag Parikh Flexicap (24.32%)</td><td>Motilal Oswal Flexicap (24.32%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Source: AMFI</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>So, What Should You Do?</h2><p>Instead of chasing the highest returns, consider increasing your Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) amount. Consistently raising your SIP can have a profound impact due to the power of compounding. For example, JM Flexicap Fund delivered a 28.46% return; a ₹10,000 SIP over three years could yield a corpus of ₹5.72 lakh. In comparison, an ₹12,000 SIP in HDFC Flexicap Fund, with a 24.32% return, could accumulate a corpus of ₹6.40 lakh.</p><blockquote>“A steady increase in your SIP can have a much more profound effect over time due to the power of compounding,” said Dr. Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research, Religare Broking Ltd.</blockquote><p>Over the long term, even small differences in return can result in significant changes in your corpus.</p><p><i>Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, not of Mint.

<p>An Indian startup founder shared his journey from earning Rs 20 lakh daily to a complete business collapse. His home organizer company faced fierce competition when Amazon launched a competing brand, disrupting his successful venture.</p>
<ul>
<li>The founder initially achieved significant sales success on Amazon and Flipkart, generating Rs 20 lakh daily.</li>
<li>After a promising start, Amazon's entry into the market with a similar product caused his revenues to plummet.</li>
<li>He reflects on his experience and emphasizes the importance of diversifying sales platforms and being wary of large corporations.</li>
<li>The founder highlights the urgency of adapting to market changes, warning against over-reliance on one sales platform.</li>
<li>Despite setbacks, he remains optimistic about his future and learned valuable lessons about business resilience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I went from selling 20L of products per day to watching my generational-wealth dream crumble under Amazon.”</blockquote>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Dec 27, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Reuters</p>
<p>OpenAI announced plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation to attract more capital for advancing AI development amidst intense competition.</p>
<ul>
  <li>OpenAI aims to create a public benefit corporation to facilitate funding.</li>
  <li>The move comes amid criticism from Elon Musk and Meta regarding OpenAI's for-profit shift.</li>
  <li>The nonprofit arm will retain a significant interest in the new structure as shares.</li>
  <li>The switch reflects a growing need for investment in AI development.</li>
  <li>The restructuring may raise questions about balancing profit and social good.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness." - OpenAI Statement</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI's transformation to a public benefit corporation represents a critical strategy to secure necessary funding as competition in AI escalates.</p>]]></description>

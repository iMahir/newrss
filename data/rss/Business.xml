            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Databricks CEO Waiting Until 2025 for IPO Due to Market Conditions</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 17, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> TechCrunch</p>
<p>Databricks recently raised $10 billion and feels it's unwise to proceed with an IPO in 2024 due to market instability. CEO Ali Ghodsi states that the economic environment, influenced by interest rates and inflation, makes now an unsuitable time for going public.</p>
<ul>
<li>Databricks closed one of the largest funding rounds ever, raising $10 billion.</li>
<li>Ghodsi claims it's unwise to pursue an IPO during an election year and cites market instability.</li>
<li>While Databricks considers going public in 2025, CEO highlights that it may also extend to 2026.</li>
<li>The company aims for liquidity for employees but prioritizes market conditions over urgency to IPO.</li>
<li>Ghodsi points out that current valuations in the AI sector are part of an 'AI bubble'.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It’s dumb to IPO this year,” said Ghodsi. “You get billion-dollar valuations on these startups that have nothing – that’s a bubble.”</blockquote>
<p>Databricks is focused on positioning itself for future growth rather than rushing into an IPO under current conditions.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bailout of Yes Bank has made its turnaround a focal point for investors and traders. Few turnaround stocks have successfully delivered returns to shareholders who bought the dip—Yes Bank being one of them.</p>
<ul>

  <li>The RBI intervened, took over the bank, and initiated a reconstruction plan.</li>
  <li>The significant volatility of Yes Bank's stock attracted traders and short-term investors.</li>
  <li>Technical analysts have extensively covered Yes Bank during its tumultuous period.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Few turnaround stocks have successfully delivered returns to shareholders who bought the dip—Yes Bank being one of them.”</blockquote>
<p>The future performance of Yes Bank remains uncertain as the market watches its recovery closely.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Adani Wilmar to Expand FMCG Portfolio, Emulating ITC Post-Adani Group Exit</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A <strong>Source:</strong> Business Standard</p>
<p>Adani Wilmar Ltd (AWL), India's largest edible oil company, is adopting a strategy akin to ITC's to bolster its FMCG portfolio following the exit of the Adani group. By leveraging its dominant edible oil business and extensive distribution network, AWL aims to achieve growth in high-margin FMCG products.</p>
<ul>
<li>AWL's FMCG segment achieved a 24% year-on-year growth in volume in the December quarter.</li>
<li>The overall share of food and FMCG in volumes increased to 20%, and in revenues to 9%.</li>
<li>Key packaged products in the food category saw robust double-digit growth.</li>
<li>AWL's significant distribution network reaches 2.1 million outlets.</li>
<li>Due to higher oil prices, revenue from the edible oil segment increased by 39% year-on-year.</li>
<li>AWL's total revenues grew by 33%, surpassing analysts' expectations.</li>
<li>Gautam Adani's group sold its entire stake in AWL for over USD 2 billion.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our integrated distribution model is helping us capitalise on the strength of our oil distribution network to expand the reach of our food products, particularly in urban markets.”</blockquote>
<p>With these strategic moves, AWL plans to introduce global FMCG brands into the Indian market, following the exit of the Adani Group.</p>]]></description>

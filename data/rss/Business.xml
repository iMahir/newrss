            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nandini Launches Whey Protein-Infused Idli and Dosa Batter</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 25 December 2024<br><strong>Source:</strong> Deccan Herald</p>
<p>Bengaluru's Nandini brand has launched a ready-to-cook idli and dosa batter blended with whey protein, targeting a more nutritious traditional South Indian breakfast option.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The product was launched at Vidhana Soudha by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.</li>
  <li>The batter is available in 450g and 900g packs priced at Rs 40 and Rs 80, respectively.</li>
  <li>The Karnataka Milk Federation aims to sell 3-4 tonnes of batter daily.</li>
  <li>This batter is the first of its kind, aiming to add protein to traditionally carbohydrate-heavy meals.</li>
  <li>The product will initially be tested in Bengaluru before expanding to other markets.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Traditional South Indian breakfasts like idli, dosa and upma only have carbohydrates and lack protein, which is an important nutrient." - KMF Official</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of whey protein to idli and dosa batter represents a significant innovation in the realm of traditional South Indian cuisine, emphasizing nutritional value for busy consumers.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NCDRC Holds Fortis Hospital Doctors Liable for Medical Negligence</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> Published on [Publication Date], Live Law</p>
<img src="[Image_URL]" alt="Fortis Hospital"><figcaption>Fortis Hospital, where the incident took place.</figcaption>
<p>An appeal by Fortis Hospital was dismissed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which held that the hospital and two of its doctors were liable for medical negligence leading to the death of a patient. The commission observed that the hospital failed to meet the required standard of care and established negligence under the principles laid down in <i>Jacob Mathew</i>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The patient, suffering from a spinal condition, was admitted to Fortis Hospital for surgery.</li>
  <li>Post-surgery complications arose, including a collapsed lung and quadriplegia, and the patient died.</li>
  <li>The complainant argued that the hospital was negligent in its treatment, and the NCDRC agreed, upholding the state commission's order.</li>
  <li>However, the specific liability of two doctors was not sufficiently proven, and their appeal was allowed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The commission observed that the hospital performed surgeries without adequate pre-operative tests or proper informed consent, leading to the patient's condition worsening post-surgery.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NCDRC upheld the state commission's order, finding Fortis Hospital and two of its doctors liable for compensation. The case highlights the importance of standard medical practice and the burden of proof in medical negligence cases.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Outlook 2025: Tata Steel, JSW, JSPL, SAIL others; Improvement in domestic steel prices hold key</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 23, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>As steel prices remain largely stable, the performance of major steel stocks has varied throughout 2024. While Jindal Steel & Power has shown substantial returns, other players like Tata Steel and SAIL face challenges.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jindal Steel & Power Ltd recorded a 27% return this year.</li>
    <li>Tata Steel and JSW Steel have seen gains up to 5%; SAIL's shares have declined by 4-5%.</li>
    <li>Factors impacting steel prices include flat domestic prices and increased imports due to weak global demand, particularly from China.</li>
    <li>Concerns about rising input costs, particularly iron ore, due to proposed mining taxes in Karnataka.</li>
    <li>Domestic steel demand is expected to remain resilient, but the capacity utilization of the steel industry may drop below 80%.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Finished steel imports into India are poised to grow by 30%, touching 10 million tonne in CY2024." - Ritabrata Ghosh, ICRA Limited</blockquote>
<p>The outlook for domestic steel prices in 2025 hinges on multiple factors, including international market conditions and government trade policies affecting steel imports.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Foreign institutional investors and domestic institutions are showing contrasting trends in market activity.</figcaption>
<p>The Nifty experienced a volatile trading session, closing below 23,800 due to emerging selling pressure. Despite an optimistic start, the market shifted to a sideways-to-bearish trajectory as the December expiry approaches. Metal stocks emerged as key losers, while Tata Group stocks witnessed a significant surge.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Nifty closed at 23,727.65, down 0.11%, indicating a pause in the uptrend.</li>
<li>Selling pressure was prominent near the 23,900 level, leading to a range-bound movement.</li>
<li>Tata Capital's potential IPO is anticipated to significantly impact the market.</li>
<li>Concerns over a strong dollar and high bond yields contribute to market caution.</li>
<li>Key resistance levels for the Nifty are at 23,900-24,000.</li>
<li>The Nifty Bank index showed consolidation, with key support at 50,750.</li>
<li>Market players should watch for a recovery in stocks such as Nalco India and BPCL.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The market remains cautious due to various macroeconomic factors affecting investor sentiment.” - Vinod Nair, Geojit Financial Services</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as the final trading session of December approaches, traders should remain alert to potential movements influenced by upcoming earnings results and budget announcements.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Will Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Share Price surge in 2025? (Pic: ET NOW)</figcaption>
<p>Reliance Industries shares recently peaked at Rs 1,608.95, but have since dropped by 23%, raising questions about their future performance in 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliance shares are down 5.52% year-to-date and 4.59% over the past year.</li>
<li>Sandip Sabharwal suggests the stock may be nearing a bottom due to historical valuation corrections.</li>
<li>Expectations are set for shares to bottom around Rs 1300, despite continued corrections.</li>
<li>The company's debt levels raise concerns, with significant investments not yielding free cash flow.</li>
<li>Adverse profitability stresses are now reflected in share prices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"When the performance bottoms out, the stock should ideally outperform." - Sandip Sabharwal</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while current trends show a decline, there may be potential for recovery and growth in Reliance Industries' stock value by 2025 as market conditions stabilize.</p>]]></description>

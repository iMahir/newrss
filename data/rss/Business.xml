<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> NDTV</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook and Instagram, has made a surprising pivot toward the political right, criticizing censorship and ending fact-checking in the U.S., claims that align him with Trump and Elon Musk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zuckerberg asserts that Facebook's focus will return to "free expression." </li>
<li>The platform is ending its content fact-checking program in the U.S. after prior initiatives following various scandals.</li>
<li>This move has drawn criticism and raised questions about Zuckerberg's motives, potentially reflecting a desire to avoid governmental scrutiny.</li>
<li>He aims to align himself with Trump, who has publicly criticized him, and the change indicates a significant political realignment.</li>
<li>The announcement is seen in the context of Zuckerberg's efforts to strengthen ties with influential figures in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li>Tech analysts suggest this may stem from competition with Elon Musk and fears of being sidelined in the tech landscape.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is a case of kissing the ring," said tech analyst Carolina Milanesi.</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Manappuram Finance Shares Rise 6% After RBI Lifts Restrictions on Asirvad Micro Finance</h1>
<p><strong>Date: January 9, 2024</strong> | <strong>Source: Upstox</strong></p>
<p>Manappuram Finance's shares surged by 6.4% following the Reserve Bank of India's decision to lift supervisory restrictions on its subsidiary, Asirvad Micro Finance. This comes after the RBI confirmed compliance with regulatory guidelines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manappuram Finance shares reached ₹191.50 on the NSE.</li>
  <li>The RBI previously restricted loan sanctions due to serious supervisory concerns in October 2024.</li>
  <li>The lifted restrictions come as both Asirvad Micro Finance and DMI Finance have revamped their loan pricing processes.</li>
  <li>Manappuram Finance showed a surprising 2% rise in Q2 FY25 profit, which reached ₹571 crore.</li>
  <li>Domestic gold prices surged during the quarter, boosting demand for gold loans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Now, having satisfied itself based on companies’ submissions, and in view of their adoption of revamped processes and systems...the Reserve Bank has decided to lift the aforementioned restrictions.”</blockquote>
<p>The lifting of restrictions is expected to enhance Manappuram Finance's operational capabilities and market trust.</p>]]></description>

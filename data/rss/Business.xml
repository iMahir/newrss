<figcaption>Gold price rises as geopolitical tensions escalate</figcaption>
<p>Gold prices are on the rise, buoyed by safe-haven demand in light of increasing geopolitical tensions, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions and other global conflicts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold price benefits from safe-haven flows amid Biden's discussions around striking Iran’s nuclear facilities.</li>
<li>Gold struggles as US Dollar Index remains high, impacting dollar-denominated prices.</li>
<li>US Treasury yields remain low, making gold an attractive investment option.</li>
<li>Record purchases by central banks are likely to increase demand for gold.</li>
<li>Market reactions closely monitor China's economic recovery and its implications for gold demand.</li>
<li>Geopolitical events, including conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, further influence gold demand.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Gold could face challenges as the Federal Reserve signals a cautious stance on rate cuts for 2025.”</blockquote>
<p>This increase in gold prices reflects the ongoing concern in the global community regarding geopolitical stability and its effect on financial markets.</p>]]></description>

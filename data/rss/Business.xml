<p>Once among the richest men in the UK, Pramod Mittal, brother of billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, spent Rs 550 crore on his daughter's wedding in 2013. However, a series of unfortunate events led to his bankruptcy in 2020, forcing him to depend on his wife and kids for daily expenses.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Guarantor for a loan taken by GIKIL, a metallurgical company based in Bosnia</li>
  <li>Arrested in Bosnia in 2019 on charges of fraud</li>
  <li>Declared bankrupt in the UK in 2020</li>
  <li>Faces money laundering charges in India</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Mittal was offering his creditors to pay just 0.18 paise in exchange of every one pound of loan taken by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite his downfall, Pramod Mittal once hosted a lavish wedding for his daughter, spending around Rs 550 crore, more than his brother Lakshmi Mittal's daughter's wedding in 2004.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra's New Year Message: Emphasize Customer Centricity</h1>
<p><strong>Date: 2025-01-01 | Source: Business Standard</strong></p>
<img src='' alt='RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra' style='max-width: 300px;'>
<p>In his New Year message to RBI employees, Governor Sanjay Malhotra stressed the importance of customer centricity in their endeavors for 2025, an 'exciting and challenging' year ahead.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Malhotra asked staff to focus on providing seamless and user-friendly services.</li>
  <li>The Indian rupee depreciated nearly 3% in 2024, touching an all-time low, and has been under pressure for the last three months.</li>
  <li>Economic growth slowed, with GDP growth in Q2 at 5.4%, and retail inflation fell to 5.5%.</li>
  <li>Malhotra will chair his first MPC meeting in February, with the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% for nearly two years.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  “Let us keep customer centricity at the heart of our endeavours and work towards providing seamless and user-friendly services.” – Sanjay Malhotra, RBI Governor
</blockquote>
<p>Malhotra took charge in December 2024, succeeding Shaktikanta Das, and highlighted the RBI's achievements in 2024, including enhancing customer protection, promoting financial literacy, and encouraging innovation.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>IRFC Share Price: Check make-or-break level for darling railway stock (Pic: ET NOW)</figcaption>
<p>After a strong rally in 2024, IRFC shares experienced profit booking, leading to a 49% gain for the year. The stock is currently trading at a 35% discount from its 52-week high, and investors are keenly watching its performance as the Union Budget approaches.</p>
<ul>
    <li>IRFC shares experienced a strong performance but faced profit booking.</li>
    <li>The stock has support at Rs 144 and resistance at Rs 153.</li>
    <li>Long term outlook remains strong, with a potential upward move towards Rs 170-175 if certain levels are crossed.</li>
    <li>IRFC has yielded impressive returns of 362% over the last two years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I have two suggestions for IRFC investors - if the view is long, then HOLD the position and if the view is short, then maintain a stop loss at Rs 144,” said Kunal Parar of Choice Equity.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while IRFC's outlook is solid, investors should be mindful of stop-loss levels as the stock is experiencing sideways movements.</p>]]></description>

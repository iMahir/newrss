<figcaption>Drew Binsky said he was travelling from London to Amritsar on an Air India flight and described it as "pathetic".(Instagram/drewbinksy)</figcaption>
<p>A travel influencer, Drew Binsky, criticized Air India for a disastrous business class flight experience that he labeled the worst of his life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Binsky traveled from London to Amritsar, paying $750 for the business class upgrade.</li>
<li>He faced issues such as a broken seat, cramped space, and a dirty meal setting.</li>
<li>The in-flight entertainment was outdated, and WiFi connectivity was poor.</li>
<li>He found the amenities lacking, comparing them to those of a one-star motel.</li>
<li>Despite the complaints, Air India has not yet responded to his criticisms.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Thank you Air India for this miserable nine-hour experience which I spent $750 to upgrade for.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights ongoing concerns about airline service quality, especially in premium offerings, and emphasizes the need for airlines to maintain standards.</p>]]></description>

<p>Leading brokerage firm Geojit Financial Services has cut the target for Vodafone Idea shares by more than 50%, maintaining a HOLD rating.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The revised target is set at Rs 8.6, down from Rs 17.</li>
    <li>Recent tariff hikes have marginally increased Vodafone Idea's average revenue per user (ARPU).</li>
    <li>The company's subscriber base is expected to grow with 4G and 5G expansion from Q4 FY2025 onwards.</li>
    <li>Vodafone Idea plans to raise up to Rs 1,980 crore through preferential shares, with major investments from Vodafone Group entities.</li>
    <li>Share prices have significantly decreased, with a 39% drop in the last 3 months and over 90% in the last 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The announcement follows Vodafone Idea's Rs 18,000 crore fundraise through Follow-on Public Offer (FPO).”</blockquote>
<p>The brokerage's target revision reflects considerations of Vodafone Idea's financial viability and growth prospects amid recent challenges.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Gold price rises as geopolitical tensions escalate</figcaption>
<p>Gold prices are on the rise, buoyed by safe-haven demand in light of increasing geopolitical tensions, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions and other global conflicts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold price benefits from safe-haven flows amid Biden's discussions around striking Iran’s nuclear facilities.</li>
<li>Gold struggles as US Dollar Index remains high, impacting dollar-denominated prices.</li>
<li>US Treasury yields remain low, making gold an attractive investment option.</li>
<li>Record purchases by central banks are likely to increase demand for gold.</li>
<li>Market reactions closely monitor China's economic recovery and its implications for gold demand.</li>
<li>Geopolitical events, including conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, further influence gold demand.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Gold could face challenges as the Federal Reserve signals a cautious stance on rate cuts for 2025.”</blockquote>
<p>This increase in gold prices reflects the ongoing concern in the global community regarding geopolitical stability and its effect on financial markets.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 3, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> CNBC TV18</p>
<p>Brokerage firm Emkay Global has initiated coverage on shares of state-run power financing companies REC Ltd. and Power Finance Corporation (PFC), assigning both a 'Buy' rating.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Emkay has set a price target of ₹650 for REC and ₹600 for PFC, suggesting potential upsides of 25% and 31%, respectively.</li>
    <li>Both REC and PFC have decreased more than 20% from their record highs in July 2024.</li>
    <li>Emkay cites sustained double-digit loan growth and strong asset quality as key factors for their positive outlook.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The controlled upcycle in power capital expenditure and lending is here to stay, and both REC and PFC offer an optimal pathway to capitalise on this trend.”</blockquote>
<p>The brokerage projects robust growth for both firms, driven by strong credit demand and favorable economic conditions.</p>]]></description>

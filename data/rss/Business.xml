            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why is the rupee weakening against the dollar?: Explained</h1>
<p><strong>Published: January 04, 2025, 11:05 pm IST</strong></p>
<img src="https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png" alt="The current bout of rupee depreciation is seen as driven primarily by the exit of foreign investors from India, which has put pressure on the rupee." title="The current bout of rupee depreciation is seen as driven primarily by the exit of foreign investors from India, which has put pressure on the rupee."> 
<figcaption>Photo Credit: Reuters</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, attributed mainly to foreign investor withdrawals and prevailing economic conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rupee breached the 85 mark against the U.S. dollar, reaching an all-time low of 85.81.</li>
<li>Factors affecting currency depreciation include monetary policy, foreign demand for goods, and inflation rates.</li>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has intervened to support the rupee but foreign exchange reserves are at an eight-month low of $640 billion.</li>
<li>Long-term trends show the rupee's gradual depreciation is tied to high inflation rates compared to the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Analysts believe the rupee’s depreciation would have been far worse if not for the RBI’s intervention to support the rupee against the dollar.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the rupee's current depreciation reflects broader economic trends, investor behavior, and international monetary policy shifts, with implications for India's economic stability.</p>]]></description>

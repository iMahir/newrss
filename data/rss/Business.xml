<figcaption>Ketan Parekh, the infamous scamster, has been banned from the market.</figcaption>
<p>Ketan Parekh, a notorious figure in Indian stock market history, has found himself once again in the regulatory spotlight as he faces a ban from the market imposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). This development highlights ongoing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parekh is a key figure in a major stock market scam that erupted in 2001.</li>
  <li>The ban comes amidst efforts by Sebi to clean up the financial markets and safeguard investor interests.</li>
  <li>Parekh is accused of stock price manipulation and fraudulent trading activities.</li>
  <li>This renewed scrutiny raises questions about the integrity of the Indian financial system.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are committed to ensuring a fair and transparent trading environment in the stock market,” said a Sebi spokesperson.</blockquote>
<p>This action against Parekh signals a stricter regulatory approach to market misconduct, aiming to enhance overall market integrity.</p>]]></description>

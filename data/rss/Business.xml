<p>Google Pixel is finally gaining traction in India’s premium smartphone market, as the brand managed to grow while OnePlus took a nosedive.</p>
<ul>
    <li>India saw 6.5 million premium smartphone shipments from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, up from 4.2 million the previous year.</li>
    <li>OnePlus's market share fell from 21% to just 6% in a year, while Samsung maintained a 30% share.</li>
    <li>Google Pixel's growth jumped from 1% in 2023 to 5% in 2024, significantly due to the Pixel 8 being manufactured in India.</li>
    <li>Apple holds a dominant position with roughly 56% market share in the premium segment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All the while, Apple continues to take up the bulk of the premium smartphone segment in India.”</blockquote>
<p>This shift in market dynamics indicates a growing acceptance of Google Pixel among Indian consumers and highlights the declining popularity of OnePlus in the premium segment.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Thailand Moves to Seize Tycoon’s Assets in $350 Million Scam</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Bloomberg</p>
<p>Thai authorities are taking action to seize assets of Boon Vanasin, a hospital tycoon accused of defrauding investors out of over 12 billion baht ($350 million) through fake medical projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boon Vanasin, the founder of Thonburi Healthcare Group, is wanted on charges of fraud and money laundering.</li>
<li>He allegedly misled hundreds of investors into believing in nonexistent medical projects across Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam.</li>
<li>Thirteen suspects, including Boon’s family members, have been arrested, while Boon remains at large after fleeing to China.</li>
<li>Shares of Thonburi Healthcare have sharply declined, reflecting the impact of the scandal.</li>
<li>Authorities are coordinating with Interpol to track down Boon's location for an arrest.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is a special case due to its complexities and the number of victims and economic value,” said Wisanu Chimtrakool, deputy director-general of the DSI.</blockquote>
<p>Boon and his family members deny the allegations, claiming forgery of signatures on related documents, while investigations continue.</p>]]></description>

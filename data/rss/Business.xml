<p>The Indian market is anticipated to open lower, influenced by weak global cues and bearish sentiment in the derivatives market, as experts advise a "sell on rise" strategy for short-term traders.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The index shows strong resistance at 24,500 and support at 24,000, with key trading suggestions provided by Rajesh Palviya, Kunal Bothra, and Nooresh Merani.</li>
  <li>India VIX decreased by 0.78% to 14.37, indicating trader apprehension.</li>
  <li>Heavy call writing suggests a bearish trend; the put-call ratio declined to 0.37.</li>
  <li>Traders are recommended to focus on stocks like KFin Technologies, Gravita India, Universal Cables, Tata Motors, and Muthoot Finance with specific targets and stop-loss measures.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Bank of Japan Maintains Interest Rate Steady for December</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 18, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> FXStreet</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to keep its short-term interest rate target in the range of 0.15%-0.25%, aligning with market expectations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decision marked the third consecutive meeting without a rate change.</li>
  <li>Board member Naoki Tamura dissented, suggesting a rate increase to 0.5% due to rising inflationary risks.</li>
  <li>Japan's economy shows moderate recovery, with private consumption and heightening inflation expectations.</li>
  <li>High uncertainty remains regarding economic and price outlooks in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The two-day Bank of Japan meeting ends Thursday with a widely expected hold.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bank's policy will be closely monitored for implications on future interest rate hikes and the performance of the Japanese Yen.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[BoJ keeps interest rate steady in December - FXStreet]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Bank of Japan Maintains Interest Rate Steady for December</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 18, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> FXStreet</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to keep its short-term interest rate target in the range of 0.15%-0.25%, aligning with market expectations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decision marked the third consecutive meeting without a rate change.</li>
  <li>Board member Naoki Tamura dissented, suggesting a rate increase to 0.5% due to rising inflationary risks.</li>
  <li>Japan's economy shows moderate recovery, with private consumption and heightening inflation expectations.</li>
  <li>High uncertainty remains regarding economic and price outlooks in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The two-day Bank of Japan meeting ends Thursday with a widely expected hold.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bank's policy will be closely monitored for implications on future interest rate hikes and the performance of the Japanese Yen.</p>]]></description>

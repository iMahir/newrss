<p>Comedian Kunal Kamra has criticized quick commerce platforms for exploiting gig workers, highlighting the dark side of convenience. These platforms, such as Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, deliver groceries and other household goods to customers' doorsteps in minutes. However, Kamra points out the unfair wages and long working hours of gig workers in the industry.</p>
<h2>Key Points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kamra criticized quick commerce platforms for low wages and long hours of gig workers.</li>
<li>He specifically targeted Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa, asking him to reveal the average wages of delivery partners.</li>
<li>Kamra likened the CEOs of these companies to 'thugs' for exploiting gig workers without proper regulations.</li>
<li>Social media users supported Kamra's views, with many agreeing that these platforms exploit workers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"They are thugs that are using data as oil without paying for the oil fields. Someday there will be regulation that humbles them..." - Kunal Kamra</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra's New Year Message: Emphasize Customer Centricity</h1>
<p><strong>Date: 2025-01-01 | Source: Business Standard</strong></p>
<img src='' alt='RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra' style='max-width: 300px;'>
<p>In his New Year message to RBI employees, Governor Sanjay Malhotra stressed the importance of customer centricity in their endeavors for 2025, an 'exciting and challenging' year ahead.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Malhotra asked staff to focus on providing seamless and user-friendly services.</li>
  <li>The Indian rupee depreciated nearly 3% in 2024, touching an all-time low, and has been under pressure for the last three months.</li>
  <li>Economic growth slowed, with GDP growth in Q2 at 5.4%, and retail inflation fell to 5.5%.</li>
  <li>Malhotra will chair his first MPC meeting in February, with the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% for nearly two years.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  “Let us keep customer centricity at the heart of our endeavours and work towards providing seamless and user-friendly services.” – Sanjay Malhotra, RBI Governor
</blockquote>
<p>Malhotra took charge in December 2024, succeeding Shaktikanta Das, and highlighted the RBI's achievements in 2024, including enhancing customer protection, promoting financial literacy, and encouraging innovation.</p>]]></description>

<p>Car sales in India witnessed a remarkable surge in December, culminating in a record-breaking annual volume of 4.3 million units in 2024. This significant growth was driven by robust retail sales during the festive season and a strong recovery in the second half of the fiscal year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maruti Suzuki, the market leader, saw a 24% increase in wholesale volumes and recorded its highest-ever annual sales.</li>
<li>Hyundai Motor India sustained sales momentum despite industry challenges, with SUVs contributing significantly to overall sales.</li>
<li>Tata Motors outpaced Hyundai in monthly sales and closed the year at 565,000 units, with a strong performance in the SUV segment and emission-friendly powertrains.</li>
<li>Toyota Kirloskar Motor achieved a 40% year-on-year growth, with SUVs and MPVs being key contributors.</li>
<li>In the commercial vehicle segment, demand remained subdued, but Tata Motors reported a sequential increase of 24% in December sales.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Sabari Manohar, Vice President, Sales-Service-Used Car Business, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said, "We are immensely proud to close 2024 with a record-breaking performance... The SUV and MPV segments being key contributors grew at 20% over the same period last year."</blockquote>

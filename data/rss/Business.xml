<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 13, 2025 / <strong>Source:</strong> Moneycontrol</p>
<img src="https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/03/IndusInd1.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=770&amp;height=431" alt="indusind" width="770" height="431">
<figcaption>IndusInd Bank stock performance</figcaption>
<p>IndusInd Bank shares rose by 4% to Rs 973, becoming the top gainer on the Nifty 50 index, following an increase in foreign headroom after a recent FII sell-off.</p>
<ul>
  <li>FII stake decreased from 55.5% to 46.6% in December.</li>
  <li>Foreign headroom now exceeds the 25% threshold.</li>
  <li>Potential doubling of MSCI weight anticipated to attract inflows of $250 million to $300 million.</li>
  <li>The effects of this change are expected over the next 3 to 5 trading days.</li>
  <li>The rebalancing and inflows will be seen on February 28, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“MSCI weight doubling is expected to attract inflows of around $250 million to $300 million.”</blockquote>
<p>The surge in IndusInd Bank's stock is primarily due to the expected increase in MSCI weight stemming from a significant change in shareholding. This could lead to considerable investor interest and further stock performance in the near term.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>HPCL shares fell 7% due to rising crude oil prices.</figcaption>
<p>Shares of India's Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL) have dropped 7% as crude oil prices surge, impacting other oil marketing companies and related sectors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HPCL shares are down 7%, with Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOC) down 3% and 4%, respectively.</li>
  <li>Brent crude has risen above $81 a barrel to its highest price in over four months.</li>
  <li>The increases are linked to new US sanctions on Russian oil, affecting exports to top importers like China and India.</li>
  <li>Other sectors, such as paints and tyres, also experienced stock declines due to rising oil prices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The new Russian sanctions... are a net addition to at-risk supply, adding more uncertainty to the (first quarter) outlook," - RBC Capital analysts.</blockquote>
<p>The recent rise in crude oil prices and significant sanctions against Russian oil will likely have ongoing implications for the global oil market, particularly affecting major importers like India and China.</p>]]></description>

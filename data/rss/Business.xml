<figcaption>Swiggy and Zomato butt heads with restaurants over private labels</figcaption>
<p>The Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) is taking action against food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato for alleged unfair practices regarding their private labels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>FHRAI plans to approach the Ministry of Commerce and Industry regarding quick food delivery apps.</li>
  <li>The organization accuses aggregator platforms of misusing their market dominance to promote private labels like Blinkit’s Bistro and Swiggy’s Snacc.</li>
  <li>They are seeking meetings with commerce officials to enforce e-commerce regulations.</li>
  <li>FHRAI represents around 60,000 hotels and 500,000 restaurants across India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We will be requesting the implementation of the e-commerce rules and strongly argue that these quick commerce players cannot have their own private labels.” - Pradeep Shetty, Vice President of FHRAI</blockquote>
<p>This initiative highlights the ongoing tension between traditional restaurants and online food delivery services in India.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rajiv Bajaj also said that if one wants 90-hour work week, it should start from the top.</h1><p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Jan 11, 2025</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p><img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/10/550x309/rajiv_bajaj_1736522661139_1736522661421.png" alt="Bajaj Auto's managing director Rajiv Bajaj.(Bajaj Group)" title="Bajaj Auto's managing director Rajiv Bajaj.(Bajaj Group)"><figcaption>Bajaj Auto's managing director Rajiv Bajaj.(Bajaj Group)</figcaption><p>Amid an online outrage over Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) chairperson's “90-hour work week” remarks, Bajaj Auto's managing director Rajiv Bajaj has said that the quality of work done matters much more than the hours.</p><p>In an interview with CNBC TV18, Rajiv Bajaj emphasized that if there is to be a 90-hour work week, it should originate from the leadership. He stated, "Number of hours of work doesn't matter, the quality of work does. We need a kinder, gentler world more than ever before."</p><h2><strong>Key Points:</strong></h2><ul><li>Rajiv Bajaj argues that quality of work is more important than the number of hours worked.</li><li>Bajaj suggests that the idea of a 90-hour work week should start from company leaders.</li><li>He stresses the importance of work-life balance and the consequences of long working hours.</li><li>The controversy originated from remarks made by L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyan advocating for longer work hours.</li></ul><blockquote>"Even if someone works 70 or 90 hours a week, their life remains interconnected with other aspects - family, health, and well-being. Ignoring this interconnectedness will come at a cost."</blockquote><p>In conclusion, Bajaj calls for a shift away from rigid work hours towards a more flexible approach that values quality and interconnectedness in life.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> ESPN Cricinfo</p>
<p>Australia's cricket team is optimistic about Travis Head's fitness for the upcoming Boxing Day Test against India, following concerns over a tight quad he experienced during the previous match.</p>
<img src="https://wassets.hscicdn.com/static/images/lazyimage-noaspect.svg" alt="Australia Cricket" />
<figcaption>Australia's cricket team discusses fitness ahead of the Boxing Day Test.</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>Travis Head is expected to play despite recent tightness in his quad.</li>
  <li>Captain Pat Cummins stated, "Trav, he'll be fine, it's a bit of a tight quad, he'll be fine for Melbourne."</li>
  <li>Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out for the remainder of the series due to a calf strain.</li>
  <li>Despite concerns, Head's performance has been vital, having scored consecutive centuries.</li>
  <li>The selectors are set to meet to finalize the team ahead of the Test.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"It's really tough," Cummins said regarding Hazlewood's multiple injuries. "He's probably one of the most disciplined, professional sportspeople you could meet."</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Australia's focus remains on ensuring Head's recovery while managing the squad dynamics in the absence of Hazlewood.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Akash Deep, third left, celebrates with teammates after the dismissal of Australia's Mitchell Marsh during play on day five of the third cricket test between India and Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane(AP)</figcaption>
<p>The draw at the Gabba keeps India in the third spot of the World Test Championship (WTC) points table with a PCT of 58.88 after 17 matches. Persistent rain forced the match to conclude in a draw, impacting India's chances for the WTC final.</p>
<ul>
<li>The match ended in a draw due to rain after India began their chase of 275 runs.</li>
<li>India cannot afford another draw or loss in their remaining two matches to stay in contention for the WTC final.</li>
<li>Winning 3-1 in the remaining series would ensure India's qualification without depending on other results.</li>
<li>The draw maintains tight competition in the WTC standings, with Australia and South Africa also in contention.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The draw did keep India still in the hunt for a spot in the WTC final, but they have now entered a must-win territory.</blockquote>
<p>Overall, while India remains in contention for the World Test Championship final, they must secure victories in their upcoming matches to guarantee qualification.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The players had to come off several times a day during to rain. (Photo by Chris Hyde/Getty Images)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses how Cricket Australia should have heeded the advice of the late Shane Warne regarding scheduling Tests in Australia during the summer. Poor weather led to significant delays in the third Test, and Warne had previously suggested moving the Brisbane Test to avoid rain issues.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The third Test in Brisbane faced numerous rain delays, likely ending in a draw.</li>
  <li>Shane Warne had advocated for scheduling changes to avoid bad weather impacting Test matches.</li>
  <li>The Sydney Test has historically suffered from rain, with calls to move it to earlier in the summer.</li>
  <li>Cricket Australia announced the SCG Test schedule won't change until 2030.</li>
  <li>Gabba will not host a Test in the 2026-27 summer for the first time in decades.</li>
  <li>Warne's predictions in cricket often prove accurate, highlighting his insightful understanding of the game.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It’s better weather (at the start of the season) than it is in the first week of January,” - Shane Warne</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the article emphasizes the foresight of Warne and the ongoing challenges faced by Cricket Australia in scheduling Tests to ensure a fair and uninterrupted game.</p>]]></description>

<p>The legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has claimed that Rohit Sharma may resign as India's cricket captain following the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia if his performance does not improve.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma has scored only 152 runs in his last 13 innings, averaging 11.83.</li>
  <li>He has faced criticism for a lack of runs against Bangladesh and New Zealand.</li>
  <li>With moves to bat at No. 6, he managed just 19 runs in the ongoing series against Australia.</li>
  <li>Gavaskar suggests Rohit may proactively step down if form does not improve in the next matches.</li>
  <li>Rohit's possible retirement from the format has been a topic of speculation among fans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“He’s a very conscientious cricketer, he will not want to be a burden on the team.” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>The future of Rohit Sharma as captain hangs in the balance as he faces a crucial series of performances ahead.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Temba Bavuma urges ICC to end 'disparity' among teams: 'England played 22 Tests last year, South Africa just 12'</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> February 2024</p>

<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/15/550x309/CRICKET-RSA-PAK-81_1736933693929_1736933708071.jpg" alt="Temba Bavuma has led South Africa admirably(AFP)" title="Temba Bavuma has led South Africa admirably(AFP)">
<figcaption>Temba Bavuma has led South Africa admirably(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>South Africa's cricket team, led by Temba Bavuma, has made a remarkable resurgence, having progressed to the World Test Championship (WTC) final despite facing criticism over their previous performances. Bavuma emphasizes the need for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to address disparities in the number of Tests played by different nations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>South Africa lost 0-2 to New Zealand in February 2024, raising questions about their capabilities.</li>
  <li>Under Bavuma's leadership, the team has won 7 consecutive Tests, securing their place in the WTC final against Australia.</li>
  <li>Bavuma has scored over 500 runs in his last four Tests and expresses confidence in his form and the team's potential.</li>
  <li>He advocates for more Test matches, noting that South Africa played only 12 Tests last year compared to England's 22.</li>
  <li>Bavuma acknowledges their underdog status but believes in the team's strength despite challenges.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think England played about 22 Tests last year. We played 12, that’s almost 50 percent.”</blockquote>
<p>This event highlights the need for reform in international cricket scheduling and aims to elevate the visibility and competitiveness of Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

  <li>For long tours, players can have family with them for a maximum of 14 days.</li>

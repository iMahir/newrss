<p>Legendary batter Sunil Gavaskar has shared a candid review of pacer Mohammed Siraj's performance, urging that he be dropped from the Indian team due to his poor form in the ongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy series.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gavaskar highlights Siraj's disappointing performance, having taken only 13 wickets in seven innings.</li>
  <li>Siraj has the highest runs conceded per over among frontline pacers in the series, averaging 4.07 runs per over.</li>
  <li>Gavaskar argues for a direct approach in communicating performance issues to Siraj.</li>
  <li>He suggests bringing back Harshit Rana or introducing Prasidh Krishna for the fifth Test in Sydney.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You need to be brutally upfront and say 'look, your performance has not been up to scratch, and therefore you are being dropped.'” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Gavaskar emphasizes the need for clear communication regarding performance expectations for players in the team.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Sanjay Manjrekar and Irfan Pathan had a heated argument on Live TV.</figcaption>
<p>During a live discussion, former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar and Irfan Pathan engaged in a heated debate over a controversial run-out incident involving Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli during a Test match against Australia.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incident occurred on Day 4 of the 4th Test, where Jaiswal and Kohli built a significant partnership of 102 runs.</li>
    <li>A mix-up between the two players led to Jaiswal's dismissal, with differing opinions on who was at fault.</li>
    <li>Manjrekar defended Jaiswal, stating Kohli should have responded to his call for a run, while Pathan argued Kohli acted rightly given the ball's speed.</li>
    <li>The debate escalated, with Manjrekar claiming that if Kohli didn't want to let him talk, then that was acceptable.</li>
    <li>Manjrekar later suggested that Kohli's own dismissal was influenced by guilt over the run-out incident involving Jaiswal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Kohli's dismissal probably also down to the guilt he had inside his heart over Jaiswal's run-out.” — Sanjay Manjrekar</blockquote>
<p>This spirited discussion highlighted the tensions and varying perspectives among cricketers regarding crucial moments in the game.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article discusses the criticism faced by Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma regarding his shot selection during a Test match against Australia, particularly focusing on an ineffective pull shot that led to his early dismissal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma attempted a pull shot that resulted in his dismissal for just 3 runs during the Boxing Day Test.</li>
  <li>His performance has been under scrutiny due to a significant slump in form, with only 22 runs in the series so far.</li>
  <li>Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting criticized Sharma's lack of focus and decision-making at the crease.</li>
  <li>Darren Lehmann and Michael Vaughan echoed similar sentiments, pointing out that Rohit needs to be more aggressive and committed in his play.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“That's just a lazy, not switched on, not up for the moment type of shot.” - Ricky Ponting</blockquote>
<p>The critique from former players highlights the pressures on Rohit Sharma as a captain and his need to adapt and recover in the ongoing series against Australia.</p>]]></description>

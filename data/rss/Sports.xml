<p>Out-of-form all-rounder Mitch Marsh was axed from Australia's team for the series-deciding fifth Test against India in Sydney with Beau Webster set to make his debut. Fast bowler Mitchell Starc retained his place despite a rib niggle.</p>
<ul>
<li> Mitch Marsh dropped after poor series</li>
<li> Beau Webster to debut</li>
<li> Mitchell Starc retains place despite injury</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Mitchy obviously hasn't quite got the runs or wickets he would have liked this series and felt like it was time for a freshen up," said skipper Pat Cummins.</blockquote>
<p>Australia are 2-1 up and will regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy if they win or draw the Test.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rishabh Pant Likely to Be Dropped from India XI for Sydney Test</h1>

<figcaption>Rishabh Pant had stitched a 88-run partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal to provide the team with some hope before India collapsed after Tea (HT_PRINT)</figcaption>
<p>India is expected to make changes to their playing XI as they aim to save the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in the upcoming match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Rishabh Pant's poor performance may lead to his exclusion from the team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Akash Deep is likely out of the Sydney Test due to a back injury.</li>
<li>Rishabh Pant has faced criticism for his recent batting displays, scoring only 154 runs in seven innings at an average of 22.</li>
<li>The team may rely on Dhruv Jurel if Pant is benched, who has had limited game time in this series.</li>
<li>Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma are deliberating over team changes to improve performance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Stupid, stupid, stupid,” commented Sunil Gavaskar on Pant's dismissals at the MCG, highlighting the pressure on the young player.</blockquote>
<p>The decision to change the lineup reflects India's struggles in the current Test series and may impact their approach to future games as they seek to regain momentum.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma faced intense criticism following India's defeat to Australia in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with former cricketer Basit Ali questioning Sharma's captaincy decisions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma's decision to open batting despite poor form was criticized, affecting the team's confidence.</li>
  <li>Basit Ali highlighted the detrimental impact on KL Rahul after demoting him in favor of Sharma.</li>
  <li>Criticism extended to Gautam Gambhir for his game management decisions.</li>
  <li>Rohit and Virat Kohli were both dismissed cheaply, contributing to the team's struggles.</li>
  <li>Ali suggested a captaincy change for the final Test, proposing Jasprit Bumrah take over leadership.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“One decision: 'I will open', that affected India. You (Rohit) completely shattered the confidence of the team,” said Basit Ali.</blockquote>
<p>Ali's remarks underscore the dissatisfaction with Rohit Sharma's leadership and decision-making during a critical match, calling for immediate changes in captaincy and strategy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Virat Kohli gestures to the crowd on the second day of the fourth cricket Test match between Australia and India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses Aaron Finch's perspective that Virat Kohli is deliberately creating tension to regain his rhythm during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Kohli has been struggling recently, showcasing a decline in form and a tendency to edge balls outside off-stump.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finch suggests Kohli is trying to be antagonistic to bring out the best in himself.</li>
  <li>Kohli's batting average dropped significantly in 2024, indicating a troubling decline.</li>
  <li>Finch noted a specific on-field confrontation involving Kohli during the Boxing Day Test.</li>
  <li>According to Finch, Kohli thrives under pressure but hasn't performed at his peak in this series yet.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Virat's someone who's always thrived on pressure… he's trying to almost pick a fight because that's when he plays when he feels like someone's coming at him.” - Aaron Finch</blockquote>
<p>This commentary sheds light on the psychological aspects of Kohli's game and his approach to overcoming current challenges in his performance.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> India faces a crucial decision in the must-win fifth Test against Australia in Sydney, with the future of young batsman Shubman Gill hanging in the balance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gill's form and role in the team have been a topic of discussion after a promising start to the tour.</li>
  <li>Head coach Gautam Gambhir's preference for Cheteshwar Pujara and Gill's technical vulnerabilities have raised questions about his spot in the playing XI.</li>
  <li>India's batting order has been shuffled, with Rohit Sharma opening and Gill finding himself in and out of the team.</li>
  <li>The team management's decision to bench Gill for the Melbourne Test has further complicated his situation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> With the series on the line, India must decide whether to stick with Gill at No.3 or bring back Pujara, potentially strengthening their bowling attack at the cost of Gill's batting spot.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rohit Sharma's Three Options In Do-Or-Die Sydney Test: Step Aside Or...</figcaption>
<p>As India prepares for a must-win Test match against Australia, captain Rohit Sharma faces crucial decisions regarding team selection, especially concerning the inclusion of Shubman Gill.</p>
<ul>
<li>India lost the Boxing Day Test by 184 runs, putting pressure on the team.</li>
<li>Shubman Gill, a top run-scorer, may return to the playing XI in place of a bowler.</li>
<li>Washington Sundar’s performance in the previous match complicates team balance.</li>
<li>Rohit has three options: include Gill by dropping a bowler, shift his position, or step aside himself.</li>
<li>Rohit’s own poor form raises questions about his role in the squad.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Taking a back seat to allow the team to move forward is a call that can only be taken if the heart is in the right place.”</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of the Sydney Test is critical for India's chances in the World Test Championship, making Sharma's decisions pivotal for the team's future.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rohit Sharma could quit Test cricket after the Australia series</figcaption></p>
<p>The discussions surrounding India captain Rohit Sharma's potential retirement from Test cricket have intensified following a significant loss to Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rohit Sharma's performance and emotional state during the recent Test match raise questions about his future in the longest format of the game.</li>
<li>Justin Langer observed Rohit displaying unusual emotions on the field, suggesting that he may be considering retirement.</li>
<li>Langer noted the stress Rohit faces as captain when team performance falters and personal runs are lacking.</li>
<li>Contrastingly, Langer believes Virat Kohli still has years of top-level cricket ahead of him.</li>
<li>Both Langer and Ravi Shastri agree that this could be the end of Rohit's Test career but see a different trajectory for Kohli.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Rohit Sharma looks very tired to me. I saw him quite emotional on the field yesterday. That's unusual for us to see Rohit like that." - Justin Langer</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the ongoing discussions indicate a pivotal moment for Rohit Sharma as he contemplates his career while Virat Kohli seems to have more time left in international cricket.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Mohammad Abbas shows Pakistan there's more to pace bowling than pace</h1><p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> [Date not provided] - ESPNcricinfo</p><p>Mohammad Abbas, a medium-fast bowler from Pakistan, challenges the conventional norms of pace bowling in a cricketing culture that often idolizes speed over technique and precision. Despite facing skepticism and exclusion due to his modest pace, he has shown remarkable skill and control, proving that accuracy can be just as effective as raw speed.</p><ul><li>Abbas has averaged 23 runs per wicket in his early career, comparable only to Imran Khan's records.</li><li>His exclusion from the national team for nearly four years was partly due to performance challenges in fast-paced environments, such as South Africa.</li><li>Abbas's accuracy and ability to move the ball off the seam have allowed him to outperform faster bowlers, particularly in domestic cricket.</li><li>He demonstrated adaptability and growth by incorporating physical training into his regimen, catering to his aging body to enhance performance.</li><li>The ongoing evolution of his bowling technique highlights the importance of various styles in cricket, pushing against traditional views in Pakistani cricket.</li></ul><blockquote><p>“He may never be able to fit the Pakistani mould, but he appears on the right track to ensure the Pakistani mould can expand wide enough to include him.”</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion, Abbas's journey serves as a testament to the idea that pace is not the only determinant of a bowler's effectiveness. His achievements may inspire future generations of bowlers to embrace diverse skills and strategies that stray from the mainstream.</p>]]></description>

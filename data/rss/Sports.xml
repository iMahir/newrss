<p>Former India coach Ravi Shastri has advised struggling cricketers Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to return to domestic cricket as they face challenges in their careers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli and Rohit have had disappointing performances in 2024, particularly in Test matches.</li>
  <li>Shastri believes they should play domestic cricket to regain form and contribute to younger players.</li>
  <li>Rohit has not played a domestic match since 2016; Kohli since 2012.</li>
  <li>Playing domestic cricket would help them improve their playing against spin, an area of struggle for India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If there's a gap for them, I think they should go back and play some domestic cricket and see how it is.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri emphasizes the importance of playing domestic cricket not just for personal revival but for the future of Indian cricket, highlighting the need for engagement with the current generation.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses how top Indian cricketers, including Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, have not participated in domestic red-ball cricket for several years, impacting the Test team's performance. Following losses to Australia and New Zealand, there's a call for players to engage more in domestic competitions to regain their form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virat Kohli last played a domestic game in 2012, Rohit Sharma in 2016.</li>
  <li>In the last four years, key players have played only four long-format domestic games.</li>
  <li>Indian team lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia.</li>
  <li>Players are urged to participate in the Ranji Trophy for better rhythm and game time.</li>
  <li>The lack of domestic play affects players' readiness for Test matches.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Without game time in the middle, their game will stagnate…”</blockquote>
<p>This trend of avoiding domestic cricket has raised concerns about the future of Indian cricket, with calls for a cultural change where even stars prioritize domestic matches.</p>]]></description>

<p>Chelsea is reportedly leading the pursuit of Manchester United's young talent Kobbie Mainoo, as talks over a new contract for the 19-year-old have stalled.</p>

<li>Mainoo has emerged as a crucial player for Manchester United, making his mark as a standout academy graduate.</li>

<li>Despite injury setbacks, Mainoo's recent displays, especially against Liverpool, have drawn attention to his potential.</li>
<li>Chelsea's strategic focus on acquiring young players may appeal to Mainoo, given their commitment to long-term development.</li>
<li>Manchester United is aiming to secure their promising players like Mainoo, but without clear progress on contract negotiations.</li>

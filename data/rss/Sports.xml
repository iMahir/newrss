<figcaption>Sunil Gavaskar weighed in on Virat Kohli-Yashasvi Jaiswal blunder [Source: @justnowofficial/X.com]</figcaption>
<p>After a dramatic mix-up leading to Yashasvi Jaiswal's run out during the fourth Test against Australia, cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar weighs in on the incident, highlighting the miscommunication between Jaiswal and Virat Kohli.</p>
<ul>
<li>India was in a challenging position after early wickets, but Jaiswal and Kohli formed a 100-run partnership.</li>
<li>Jaiswal was run out for 82 due to a miscommunication with Kohli.</li>
<li>Gavaskar believes Kohli should have reacted quicker to Jaiswal's call.</li>
<li>He also suggests that the run taken was risky and unnecessary given the context of the match.</li>
<li>India has since regained control on Day 3, with key performances from Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>‚ÄúIt could have been a quick single, and someone like Virat Kohli would likely have made it. However, the issue was that he glanced at the fielder. When you do that, you lose that crucial second.‚Äù - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Gavaskar criticized the mix-up, he acknowledged Kohli's running abilities and the unnecessary risk taken during the run.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the concerns regarding Jasprit Bumrah's heavy bowling load during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he bowled over 150 overs. Former Indian pacer Balwinder Sandhu critiques the concept of workload management in cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah bowled 151.2 overs and took 32 wickets during the series.</li>
  <li>Concerns were raised about his physical limits due to the workload.</li>
  <li>Sandhu argues that workload management is a concept created by Australians and insists that bowlers should listen to their bodies.</li>
  <li>He emphasizes that bowlers are capable of managing such workloads with proper conditioning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Workload management is bull****. These are Australian terms, created by Australians. I don’t agree with this at all," said Balwinder Sandhu.</blockquote>
<p>The article highlights an ongoing debate in cricket regarding player workload and the expectations placed on bowlers in Test matches.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Shan Masood in action for Pakistan against South Africa. © AFP</figcaption>
<p>Pakistan fought valiantly but ultimately lost to South Africa in the second Test at Cape Town, despite a remarkable 478 runs in the second innings while following on, led by captain Shan Masood's 145.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pakistan set a record total of 478 while following on, the highest by a visiting team in South Africa in 136 years.</li>
  <li>The previous record for the highest follow-on total was 372/7 by Australia in 1902.</li>
  <li>Shan Masood's innings of 145 was pivotal along with significant contributions from Babar Azam (81) and other batsmen.</li>
  <li>Despite the impressive total, South Africa chased down a target of 58 runs comfortably.</li>
  <li>The win secured South Africa's top position in the World Test Championship table.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It surpasses the previous best follow-on total of 372/7 set by Australia in Johannesburg in 1902.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Pakistan put up a historic performance, South Africa confirmed their dominance by clinching the series 2-0 and setting their sights on the upcoming World Test Championship final.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>“Everything was fine when Rahul Dravid was there”: Harbhajan Singh suprised by Team India’s downfall under Gautam Gambhir</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Publication Date Here] <strong>Source:</strong> [Insert Source Here]</p>

<figcaption>Former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh</figcaption>
<p>Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh questioned the team’s decline following Rahul Dravid's tenure as head coach. India recently lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia by a score of 1-3, marking a significant downturn since Dravid's departure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India celebrated success under Dravid, winning the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.</li>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir took over as head coach but has seen disappointing results since.</li>
  <li>India lost their ODI series against Sri Lanka (0-2) and struggled in Test series against New Zealand (0-3).</li>
  <li>Harbhajan Singh advocates for selecting players based on current form, criticizing reliance on past reputations.</li>
  <li>Notable struggles from key players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in recent series.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“In the past six months, we lost to Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia. Everything was fine till Rahul Dravid was our coach. We won the T20 World Cup and everything was looking good.”</blockquote>
<p>The commentary from Harbhajan highlights the urgency for the selectors to move away from a “superstar culture” and focus on deserving players.</p>]]></description>

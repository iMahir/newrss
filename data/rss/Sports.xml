            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Ajit Agarkar to Reveal India's Champions Trophy Squad by January 12; Hardik, KL Rahul Ignored for Vice-Captaincy</h1>
<p><strong>January 06, 2025</strong> - <strong>Hindustan Times</strong></p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/06/550x309/PTI10-08-2023-000578B-0_1696786834289_1736147275513.jpg" alt="KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya with Adam Zampa at the end of ICC Men's Cricket World Cup match between India and Australia(PTI)" title="KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya with Adam Zampa at the end of ICC Men's Cricket World Cup match between India and Australia(PTI)">
<figcaption>KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya with Adam Zampa at the end of ICC Men's Cricket World Cup match between India and Australia(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>The focus for the Indian team will shift to white-ball cricket, with the ICC Champions Trophy set to begin on February 19. The squad announcement by Ajit Agarkar is expected by January 12.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India's recent Test calendar ended poorly, losing seven of their last eight matches.</li>
  <li>The ICC Champions Trophy begins on February 19, with India scheduled to play England beforehand.</li>
  <li>Ajit Agarkar will lead the selection committee for the squad announcement.</li>
  <li>Jasprit Bumrah is likely to be named vice-captain, overlooking Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"All teams need to submit their provisional squads by January 12 but allowed to make changes till February 13," said an ICC official.</blockquote>
<p>The Indian cricket team is gearing up for a pivotal tournament as it seeks to rebound in the white-ball format after disappointing Test performances.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Jasprit Bumrah reacts as he walks past the trophy during an official ceremony after the fifth cricket Test match between Australia and India at The SCG in Sydney on January 5(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah is set to miss the upcoming white-ball series against England due to an injury, with the grade of the injury yet to be ascertained.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah missed the final innings of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy due to a back injury.</li>
  <li>The ODI series against England starts on February 6, before the Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>If Bumrah has a grade 2 injury, recovery might take up to six weeks.</li>
  <li>Over the series, he bowled more than 150 overs, picking up 32 wickets, which may have contributed to his injury.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If Bumrah’s injury is in grade 1 category, it will take a minimum of two to three weeks of rehabilitation before Return to Play (RTP)."</blockquote>
<p>This decision to rest Bumrah is strategically aimed at ensuring he is fully fit for the Champions Trophy starting February 19.</p>]]></description>

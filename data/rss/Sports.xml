            <title><![CDATA[While Rohit Sharma has decided to retire after Sydney Test, shouldn't he be saying goodbye right away? - The Times of India]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rohit Sharma's Test Retirement: Should He Step Down Immediately?</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source: Melbourne, Dec 31, 2024 - <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">The Times of India</a></strong></p>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116788985,imgsize-76074,width-400,resizemode-4/116788985.jpg" alt="Rohit Sharma walks back after being dismissed cheaply in the second innings at Melbourne Cricket Ground. (Getty Images)" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high">
<figcaption>Rohit Sharma walks back after being dismissed cheaply in the second innings at Melbourne Cricket Ground. (Getty Images)</figcaption>
<p>Rohit Sharma's dismal performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has brought into question his future in Test cricket. With just 31 runs in three Tests, his batting average in 2024 has been in the mid-20s. This, combined with his tactics as captain, has raised concerns about his continuity in the team.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rohit's batting struggles: Only 619 runs in 14 Tests, with just two centuries and two half-centuries.</li>
  <li>Captaincy and reputation: Despite poor form, Rohit has been retained due to his captaincy and reputation.</li>
  <li>Experimentation in Melbourne: Playing Rohit at the top, KL Rahul at No. 3, and benching Shubman Gill did not yield positive results.</li>
  <li>Transition to next generation: Delaying Shubman Gill's opportunities and KL Rahul's return to a familiar batting position hinders the team's progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<blockquote>Will Rohit follow suit (retiring mid-series like MS Dhoni) or wait for the 'why nots' to get louder?</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: With Rohit's retirement seemingly imminent, the focus should be on a smooth transition to the next generation of players.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rohit Sharma batting on the final day of the fourth test match between Australia and India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</figcaption>
<p>It's no longer a case of if, but when will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma call it a day? After a disappointing series against Australia, speculation is rife about the retirement of these two cricket legends.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The 50-over Champions Trophy is just 50 days away, and their decision might come before or after that.</li>
  <li>There's also the possibility of an announcement during the fifth and final Test in Sydney.</li>
  <li>Rohit Sharma's performance in the fourth Test was a mix of promise and disappointment, raising questions about his future in Test cricket.</li>
  <li>Virat Kohli's mental discipline and form have been a talking point throughout the series, with the Australian crowd even booing him during the fourth Test.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>"There has been a shoulder barge, luckily there was a hundred at Perth, but my takeaway of Kohli isn’t anything from this series; I shall happily takeaway memories from what he has done here in the past. We Australians haven’t seen the best of Rohit in Tests, but as said, he seems past it." - Jim Maxwell, ABC radio commentator</p></blockquote>
<p>Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been stalwarts of the Indian cricket team for years, and their retirement would mark a significant change in the team's dynamics. The cricket fraternity and fans worldwide await their decision with bated breath.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ricky Ponting shocked at Australia's decision at MCG(Getty)</figcaption>
<p>In the final day of the fourth Test match at the MCG, questions arose around Australia’s strategy as Ricky Ponting expressed his confusion regarding Pat Cummins' decision-making amidst a delicate chase scenario for India.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia set India a target of 340 runs after a quick end to their second innings.</li>
<li>Jasprit Bumrah achieved a five-wicket haul, becoming the first fast bowler to claim 30 wickets in a single Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.</li>
<li>Former captain Ponting expected a declaration from Cummins to maximize Australia’s chances but was surprised by the approach taken.</li>
<li>Commentator Tim Lane noted that the decision has resolved a lingering question regarding Australia’s strategy ahead of the final day.</li>
<li>The upcoming Test in Sydney poses additional pressure, with weather concerns threatening play conditions.</li>
<li>History shows a successful chase of over 300 runs at the MCG is rare, underscoring the challenge ahead for India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I thought Australia would have pulled the pin and declared and got as much at India as they could today give themselves the best chance of winning the game.” - Ricky Ponting</blockquote>
<p>As both teams prepare for the upcoming match in Sydney, the uncertainty around conditions adds another layer of complexity to the series.</p>]]></description>

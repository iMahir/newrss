<p>Manchester United is reportedly determined to sign Paris Saint-Germain's outcast, Randal Kolo Muani, this winter as they seek to reinforce their attack.</p>
<ul>
  <li>With Marcus Rashford likely leaving, United is in dire need of attacking options.</li>
  <li>Kolo Muani is seen as a potentially attainable target after falling out of favor at PSG.</li>
  <li>Manchester United aims to secure him on an initial loan with an option to buy.</li>
  <li>Competition from clubs like Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Tottenham adds complexity.</li>
  <li>Kolo Muani has a history of success at Nantes and Frankfurt but struggled at PSG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“United are determined to do everything possible to land the 26-year-old this winter.” - Florian Plettenberg</blockquote>
<p>The push to acquire Kolo Muani reflects United's strategy to strengthen their squad amid ongoing challenges in their attacking lineup.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Barcelona could be set to 'exile' star midfielder Frenkie De Jong following ongoing issues during contract negotiations.</figcaption>
<p>Barcelona is facing a crucial time during the January transfer window, with ongoing contract negotiations for Frenkie De Jong. De Jong's contract runs until summer 2026, and the club is desperate for cash due to financial struggles. If he does not agree to a new contract or transfer, he may be 'exiled' from the team.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Barcelona struggling with off-field issues during the January transfer window.</li>
  <li>De Jong's contract negotiation has faced silence from the player.</li>
  <li>High-profile players like Ronald Araujo may also leave.</li>
  <li>De Jong is among the top earners at Barcelona, with a weekly salary of €365,385.</li>
  <li>Flick may not rely on De Jong, with younger players ahead in the selection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the 27-year-old fails to leave the club or sign an extension he could be exiled from the squad”</blockquote>
<p>This situation underscores Barcelona's challenging financial predicament and their need to make tough decisions regarding player contracts and squad management.</p>]]></description>

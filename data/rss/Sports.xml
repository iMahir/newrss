<ul>
<li>Carlsen finished the rapid tournament with a score of 5/8.</li>
<li>This exit guarantees the crowning of new champions in both rapid and blitz formats.</li>
<li>Four players, including <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/volodar-murzin" target="_blank">Volodar Murzin</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/jan-krzysztof-duda" target="_blank">Jan-Krzysztof Duda</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/arjun-erigaisi" target="_blank">Arjun Erigaisi</a>, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/alexander-grischuk" target="_blank">Alexander Grischuk</a>, lead the open championship with scores of 7/9.</li>

</ul>

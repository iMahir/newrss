<figcaption>Image credit: X (Formerly Twitter)</figcaption>
<p>In this article, we explore the pension disparity faced by former Indian cricketer Vinod Kambli in comparison to the fathers of young cricket stars like Samit Dravid and Arjun Tendulkar.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vinod Kambli's pension is lower than that of cricketers' fathers.</li>
    <li>Arjun Tendulkar's father, Sachin Tendulkar, receives Rs 70,000 per month.</li>
    <li>Kambli has faced health challenges including two heart attacks.</li>
    <li>Despite a net worth of Rs 13 crore in the past, Kambli's financial situation seems dire.</li>
    <li>Rahul Dravid, Samit Dravid's father, also receives a pension of Rs 70,000.</li>
    <li>The disparity raises questions about support for former cricketers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The pension disparity highlights the need for a review of BCCI's support for retired players."</blockquote>
<p>This situation emphasizes the broader issues of financial support for retired athletes and raises awareness regarding the treatment of former players by governing bodies.</p>]]></description>

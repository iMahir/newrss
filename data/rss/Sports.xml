            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Mohammad Abbas shows Pakistan there's more to pace bowling than pace</h1><p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> [Date not provided] - ESPNcricinfo</p><p>Mohammad Abbas, a medium-fast bowler from Pakistan, challenges the conventional norms of pace bowling in a cricketing culture that often idolizes speed over technique and precision. Despite facing skepticism and exclusion due to his modest pace, he has shown remarkable skill and control, proving that accuracy can be just as effective as raw speed.</p><ul><li>Abbas has averaged 23 runs per wicket in his early career, comparable only to Imran Khan's records.</li><li>His exclusion from the national team for nearly four years was partly due to performance challenges in fast-paced environments, such as South Africa.</li><li>Abbas's accuracy and ability to move the ball off the seam have allowed him to outperform faster bowlers, particularly in domestic cricket.</li><li>He demonstrated adaptability and growth by incorporating physical training into his regimen, catering to his aging body to enhance performance.</li><li>The ongoing evolution of his bowling technique highlights the importance of various styles in cricket, pushing against traditional views in Pakistani cricket.</li></ul><blockquote><p>“He may never be able to fit the Pakistani mould, but he appears on the right track to ensure the Pakistani mould can expand wide enough to include him.”</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion, Abbas's journey serves as a testament to the idea that pace is not the only determinant of a bowler's effectiveness. His achievements may inspire future generations of bowlers to embrace diverse skills and strategies that stray from the mainstream.</p>]]></description>

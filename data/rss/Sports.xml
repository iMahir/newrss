<ul>
<li>Perez had been struggling with performance after a strong start to the 2024 season.</li>
<li>Despite having a contract extension, Perez and Red Bull agreed to part ways.</li>
<li>Liam Lawson is set to replace Perez as Max Verstappen’s teammate in 2025.</li>
<li>Horner emphasizes Perez’s positive contributions to the team, including his role in previous championships.</li>
<li>Perez ended the season eighth in the drivers' championship, significantly behind Verstappen.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We’re sad to see him leave the team, but obviously it’s time for him to spend with his young family as well and reflect on what he wants to do for the future.” - Christian Horner</blockquote>
<p>This exit marks a significant change for Red Bull, with the team now looking ahead to the 2025 season without Perez.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption><small>Real Madrid has decided to make a surprise signing according to SPORT, citing anonymous sources, which would see a "prodigal" son return to the Bernabeu if the transfer is really completed.</small></figcaption>
<p>Real Madrid is reportedly looking to sign back Rafa Marin, who was sold to Napoli. This potential transfer is part of their ongoing strategy to strengthen the squad amidst injury challenges.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rafa Marin was sold to Napoli for €12 million, with potential increases to €22 million based on conditions.</li>
  <li>The deal included a buyback clause, a common practice for players from Madrid's academy.</li>
  <li>Marin's return could happen as soon as January 2025 due to the club's defensive injuries.</li>
  <li>The buyback clause is structured with escalating costs depending on the timing of the exercise.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Madrid made sure to include a $27.1 million (€25 million) buy back clause which can be exercised in 2026.”</blockquote>
<p>This strategic move indicates Madrid's confidence in Marin's potential and necessity in addressing current team deficiencies.</p>]]></description>

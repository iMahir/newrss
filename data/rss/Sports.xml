<p>Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden expressed surprise at Rohit Sharma's bold decision to bowl first on the opening day of the Gabba Test, given that the pitch conditions seemed more suited for batting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hayden was taken aback by Rohit's toss decision, stating that the pitch favored batters.</li>
    <li>He noted that the groundsman had likely prepared the pitch earlier due to recent rain, affecting its behavior.</li>
    <li>India's bowlers struggled against Australia, who ended the day at 28/0 in 13.2 overs.</li>
    <li>Hayden believes that the pitch will deteriorate over the next couple of days, making spinners more effective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I was really surprised that actually, Rohit won the toss and decided to bowl, because I felt like it was over-prepared... Almost 12 inches of rain in the past two weeks." - Matthew Hayden</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Hayden emphasized that opting to bat first would have been a wiser choice, considering the expected changes in pitch conditions over the course of the match.]]></description>

<figcaption>Ruslan Ponomariov or D Gukesh, who is the youngest chess world champion?</figcaption>
<p>Former FIDE champion Ruslan Ponomariov, who won his title in 2002, is often overshadowed by D Gukesh, the current undisputed youngest world champion. This article explores the historical context and implications of their respective victories.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ponomariov became the FIDE World Champion in 2002 at just 18 years old, making him the youngest to do so at the time.</li>
    <li>The chess world saw a split between the classical title and the FIDE title from 1993 to 2006, leading to two recognized champions.</li>
    <li>D Gukesh became the youngest undisputed FIDE world champion at 18 years and six months.</li>
    <li>Ponomariov's victory is often not recognized as Undisputed, which is key for the title debate.</li>
    <li>Despite the split, Ponomariov continued to have a successful career, remaining active in high-level competitions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Ever since 1993, there have been two titles, the phoney one controlled and organised by FIDE and the real one organised outside FIDE’s control.” - IM David Levy</blockquote>
<p>In summary, while D Gukesh is officially recognized as the youngest world champion, Ruslan Ponomariov's achievement in a challenging format highlights the complexities of chess titles during a divided era in the sport.]]></description>

<p>In the third Test against Australia at the Gabba, Indian captain Rohit Sharma opted to bowl first under cloudy conditions. However, Jasprit Bumrah expressed his frustration over the lack of swing during the early overs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rohit Sharma chose to bowl first despite expectations of a favorable pitch for fast bowlers.</li>
    <li>Bumrah was heard on the stump microphone saying, "Nahin ho raha swing aise bhi; kahin bhi kar lo", indicating the ball was not swinging.</li>
    <li>The first day was disrupted by rain, with only 13.2 overs bowled, leaving Australia at 28 for 0 by the end.</li>
    <li>Indian bowlers experimented with different lines but failed to get swing or seam movement.</li>
    <li>Former players and commentators expressed concerns about the decision to bowl first at the Gabba, citing historical context.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"You bat at the Gabba. If you face Australia, you want them to bat second and fourth." - Kerry O'Keeffe</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights ongoing challenges for India in the Test series and raises questions about their bowling strategy in conditions that did not provide the expected advantages.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rain disrupted Day 1 of the third Test between India and Australia at the Gabba, allowing only 13.2 overs of play. The highlight was a moment captured on the stump mic featuring Jasprit Bumrah expressing his frustration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl first under overcast conditions.</li>
    <li>Jasprit Bumrah struggled to find swing and indicated to Shubman Gill during play that the ball wasn't swinging as expected.</li>
    <li>Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney faced the Indian bowlers comfortably, contributing to Australia's score of 28/0 before rain halted play.</li>
    <li>The play is scheduled to resume with adjusted timings at 5:20 AM IST, contingent on weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Nahi ho raha swing aise bhi (The ball isn't swinging),” Jasprit Bumrah expressed to Shubman Gill after his delivery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As both teams prepare for the resumption, memories of India's historic win at the Gabba in 2020-21 loom large, with Rishabh Pant sharing his positive outlook about returning to the venue.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Image credit: X</figcaption>
<p>Vinod Kambli and Yuvraj Singh, both retired cricket players, receive different pensions from BCCI, with Kambli earning significantly more despite his financial challenges.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Yuvraj Singh receives a pension of ₹22,500 from the BCCI post-retirement.</li>
    <li>Vinod Kambli earns ₹30,000 as a pension, which is his sole source of income.</li>
    <li>Kambli's cricket career spanned from 1991 to 2000, playing in 17 Tests and 104 ODIs.</li>
    <li>Yuvraj Singh had a successful career from 2000 to 2017, known for his contributions to India's T20 and ODI World Cup victories.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "According to media reports, Vinod Kambli, who has no savings, relies completely on his pension from the BCCI."
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> ESPN Cricinfo</p>
<p>Opener Shafali Verma continues to miss out from both squads after being dropped for the ODIs against Australia, and several new players have been called up for the upcoming West Indies series.</p>
<ul>
    <li>D Hemalatha out from the T20I squad, Radha Yadav misses out in ODIs despite being the highest wicket-taker against New Zealand.</li>

    <li>Nandini Kashyap, Raghvi Bist, and Pratika Rawal receive their first call-ups.</li>

    <li>Bist impressed with consistent performances in domestic cricket and India A series.</li>
    <li>Rawal made headlines with an unbeaten 161 runs in a domestic one-day match.</li>
    <li>The West Indies series consists of three T20Is and three ODIs starting December 15.</li>

<p>India is poised to make significant changes to their playing XI ahead of the third Test against Australia at the Gabba, Brisbane.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin may be replaced by Washington Sundar.</li>
    <li>Pacer Akash Deep could come in for Harshit Rana, depending on the pitch conditions.</li>
    <li>Josh Hazlewood returns to Australia’s side for the Gabba Test after missing the previous game.</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
    “Rana returned figures of 3/48 and 1/69 on his debut in Perth, before going wicketless across both innings in Adelaide.”

<figcaption>Champions Trophy 2025 Hybrid Model</figcaption>
<p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) has approved a hybrid model for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, allowing matches to be played in both Pakistan and Dubai, addressing logistical challenges between Pakistan and India.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ten matches will be hosted in Pakistan, including group-stage games.</li>
    <li>India's three league-stage matches will be held in Dubai, including the India-Pakistan match.</li>
    <li>Semifinals and the final will take place in Dubai.</li>
    <li>Pakistan will not travel to India for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, with matches in Colombo instead.</li>
    <li>Pakistan secures the right to host an ICC Women's tournament after 2027.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The decision to adopt the hybrid hosting model for the Champions Trophy 2025 is seen as a compromise that allows both Pakistan and India to participate in the event while addressing sensitive issues related to travel and political tensions.”</blockquote>
<p>This innovative approach reflects a pragmatic shift in international cricket, with stakeholders working towards smooth operations of major tournaments despite political hurdles.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Virat Kohli was dismissed cheaply yet again.</figcaption>
<p>Virat Kohli faced yet another disappointing dismissal during India’s tour of Australia, falling for just three runs as he chased an outside-off delivery from Josh Hazlewood.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli continues to struggle with his form in Australia, often getting out to deliveries outside off stump.</li>
  <li>This dismissal marks a continuation of his issues throughout the series.</li>
  <li>Despite his poor run, fans have taken to social media to humorously critique his performances.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the innings, India faced a challenging situation at 22 for three, following a strong Australian first innings score of 445.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rain has interrupted the third day of the Test match between India and Australia multiple times, impacting the flow of play as both teams battle for supremacy in the series.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India was reduced to 22/3 at lunch, trailing by 423 runs.</li>
  <li>Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill both fell early, with poor shot selection being a critical factor.</li>
  <li>Australia scored a total of 445 runs, with Travis Head and Steve Smith dominating on Day 2.</li>
  <li>Alex Carey was key to Australia's innings, securing a half-century efficiently.</li>
  <li>Multiple rain delays have disrupted both innings, with players forced off the field repeatedly.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the match progresses, the focus falls on India's performance in batting to recover from a fragile position.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to find a new treasurer as Ashish Shelar, currently in the position, will step down after taking a ministerial role in the Maharashtra Cabinet, which is against BCCI’s constitutional rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shelar has served as treasurer since September 2022.</li>
<li>His resignation is the second departure of a BCCI office-bearer in two weeks.</li>
<li>The BCCI constitution disqualifies individuals from office if they hold a ministerial position.</li>
<li>Shelar previously confirmed he would not be taking on a more demanding role within BCCI due to his political commitments.</li>
<li>Questions remain on whether BCCI will elect a new treasurer or if responsibilities will be delegated.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A person shall be disqualified from being an office-bearer... if he or she is: a Minister or a Government Servant.”</blockquote>
<p>This transition within the BCCI comes at a pivotal time, influencing its governance as it navigates future leadership and responsibilities.</p>]]></description>

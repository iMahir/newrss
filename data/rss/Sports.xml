            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why is Boxing Day Test not a sacred tradition, but reflects power of marketing and Kerry Packer</h1><p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 25, 2023</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p><p>In Melbourne City, the festive atmosphere is vibrant as people prepare for the Boxing Day Test, yet beneath the excitement lies the truth: this event is shaped by marketing rather than tradition. Dr. Thomas Heenan from Monash University explains how the Boxing Day Test gained prominence only after Kerry Packer revolutionized cricket broadcasts.</p><ul><li>The Boxing Day Test has become a staple of Australian culture but lacks historical tradition.</li><li>It was only after 1979, with Kerry Packer acquiring broadcast rights, that the event surged in popularity.</li><li>Initially, the day was reserved for other cricketing events, with minimal attendance until marketing strategies changed public perception.</li><li>The significance of Australia's historical oppponents, such as the West Indies and England, has evolved with the growing presence of Indian players.</li><li>Current team performance raises questions on batsmen's capabilities, highlighted by rookie challenges and pitch conditions.</li></ul><blockquote>“Boxing Day Test is a perfect example of the power of marketing,” says Dr Thomas Heenan.</blockquote><p>This reflection on the Boxing Day Test reveals how cultural events can be crafted through marketing, showing that traditions can be shaped in modern times rather than handed down through generations.</p>]]></description>

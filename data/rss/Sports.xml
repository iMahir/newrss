    <li>The PCB is behind schedule on the renovation of National Stadium in Karachi, Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, and Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.</li>
    <li>Developers face challenges with incomplete seating, floodlights, facilities, and playing surfaces.</li>
    <li>Concerns from the ICC have led to potential taskforce interventions for status checks.</li>
    <li>The PCB intends to complete the work by the January 25 deadline, as announced in their press release.</li>
    <li>Upcoming matches in a tri-nation series are planned to aid the preparations.</li>
</ul>

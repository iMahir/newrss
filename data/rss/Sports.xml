<figcaption>Gautam Gambhir (L) and Rohit Sharma</figcaption>
<p>In a bizarre turn of events at the Sydney Cricket Ground, communication seemingly broke down between coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma as they prepared for the final Test. Reports indicate a split in their relationship, exacerbated by Sharma's poor performance this season.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gambhir and Sharma showed little communication during practice sessions.</li>
  <li>Gambhir did not confirm Sharma's place in the playing eleven.</li>
  <li>There are rumors of Sharma being “rested,” indicating a possible drop from the team.</li>
  <li>Sharma appeared uncomfortable and isolated during practice and discussions.</li>
  <li>Gambhir emphasized “honesty” and “performance” as key criteria for team selection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We will look at the pitch and decide,” - Gautam Gambhir on Rohit's inclusion.</blockquote>
<p>The dynamic between coach and captain raises concerns about team morale and performance heading towards a critical match.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ravi Shastri didn't mince his words as he talked about Rohit Sharma's future (Files/AP)</figcaption>
<p>The speculation surrounding Rohit Sharma's Test career has intensified due to his poor form and questions about his captaincy. Shastri advises him to play aggressively as the team prepares for a crucial match in Sydney.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma has registered four single-digit scores in five innings during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</li>
  <li>His captaincy is under scrutiny as India trails 1-2 in the series against Australia.</li>
  <li>Shastri suggests that if Rohit does not improve, retirement could be a possibility.</li>
  <li>He emphasizes the need for Rohit to play freely and aggressively to regain form.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If I was anywhere near Rohit Sharma, I'll tell him, ‘Just go and smash it. Just go out there and have a blast,’” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri's insights point to the urgency for Rohit to reconsider his approach as the team faces critical matches ahead.</p>]]></description>

<p>Gautam Gambhir, the Indian cricket team coach, is under scrutiny following a series of poor performances by the team. After his appointment, India has struggled significantly, raising concerns about player communication and team stability.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gambhir took over as head coach expecting to lead a transition in the team.</li>
  <li>The team suffered losses against Sri Lanka and New Zealand, and is trailing in the ongoing Test series against Australia.</li>
  <li>Reports indicate that players feel insecure due to constant lineup experimentation by Gambhir.</li>
  <li>There are concerns about communication issues between Gambhir and the players, especially compared to previous coaches like Ravi Shastri.</li>
  <li>With the upcoming Champions Trophy, Gambhir's position may be in jeopardy if performances do not improve.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If the performance doesn't improve, even Gautam Gambhir's position wouldn't be safe," a senior BCCI official stated.</blockquote>
<p>This situation raises questions about the future of the Indian cricket team under Gambhir as tension mounts ahead of critical tournaments.</p>]]></description>

<p>India aims to end a 46-year wait for a Test match victory in Sydney as they prepare for the final match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy at the SCG, which historically favors spin bowlers.</p>
<ul>
<li>India's last win at the SCG was in January 1978.</li>
<li>They currently trail the series 2-1 after winning one match and losing two.</li>
<li>The upcoming match's result will impact the retention of the Border Gavaskar Trophy.</li>
<li>Ravichandran Ashwin's absence puts pressure on spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar.</li>
<li>Statistics highlight Kumble’s prowess at the SCG with match figures of 12 for 279 runs.</li>
<li>Sachin Tendulkar boasts an impressive record, averaging 157.00 at SCG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Will one of them do a Kumble for India? Time will tell.”</blockquote>
<p>The significance of this match lies not only in historical statistics against Australia but also in the opportunity for India’s spin attack to shine and potentially reshape the series outcome.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Jasprit Bumrah (L), Rohit Sharma (C) and Gautam Gambhir (R) find themselves in the middle of a controversy at a time when India have a Test match to win(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In an unexpected turn of events, leaks from within the Indian cricket team following a disappointing defeat against Australia have raised concerns about the sanctity of the dressing room. This breach of confidentiality has drawn parallels to past controversies involving high-profile figures in Indian cricket.</p>
<ul>
<li>The dressing room is traditionally a private space for players to express themselves freely.</li>
<li>Recent alleged leaks come just before a crucial Test match, highlighting the timing's unfortunate nature.</li>
<li>Historical precedents show detrimental effects of such leaks on team dynamics and morale.</li>
<li>The head coach has publicly addressed the situation, emphasizing the need for honesty and integrity among players.</li>
<li>Drawing from past resilience, the team aims to overcome adversity and focus on performance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Those are just reports. That's not the truth... Honesty is extremely important if you want to go on and achieve some great things.” - Head Coach Gautam Gambhir</blockquote>
<p>This situation underscores the challenges faced by the team but also serves as a reminder of their capacity to rally together and perform against the odds.</p>]]></description>

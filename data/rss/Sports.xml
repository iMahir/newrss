(AP Photo)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses how top Indian cricketers, including Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, have not participated in domestic red-ball cricket for several years, impacting the Test team's performance. Following losses to Australia and New Zealand, there's a call for players to engage more in domestic competitions to regain their form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virat Kohli last played a domestic game in 2012, Rohit Sharma in 2016.</li>
  <li>In the last four years, key players have played only four long-format domestic games.</li>
  <li>Indian team lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia.</li>
  <li>Players are urged to participate in the Ranji Trophy for better rhythm and game time.</li>
  <li>The lack of domestic play affects players' readiness for Test matches.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Without game time in the middle, their game will stagnate…”</blockquote>
<p>This trend of avoiding domestic cricket has raised concerns about the future of Indian cricket, with calls for a cultural change where even stars prioritize domestic matches.</p>]]></description>

<p>Chelsea is reportedly leading the pursuit of Manchester United's young talent Kobbie Mainoo, as talks over a new contract for the 19-year-old have stalled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainoo has emerged as a crucial player for Manchester United, making his mark as a standout academy graduate.</li>

<li>Despite injury setbacks, Mainoo's recent displays, especially against Liverpool, have drawn attention to his potential.</li>
<li>Chelsea's strategic focus on acquiring young players may appeal to Mainoo, given their commitment to long-term development.</li>
<li>Manchester United is aiming to secure their promising players like Mainoo, but without clear progress on contract negotiations.</li>

<figcaption>Rashford linked with a move amid controversies.</figcaption>
<p>Teddy Sheringham believes Marcus Rashford needs to apologize to Manchester United after expressing a desire for a “new challenge,” following his omission from a match against Manchester City.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rashford's comments have led to speculation about his future with the club.</li>
  <li>He remains connected to clubs such as Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, but staying at United is possible due to his wage demands.</li>
  <li>Sheringham says Rashford's comments reflect a lack of focus, impacting his performance.</li>
  <li>Rashford indicated he wants to leave with “no hard feelings” towards United.</li>
  <li>Former players suggest a transfer could benefit Rashford’s confidence.</li>

<blockquote>“If I know that a situation is already bad I’m not going to make it worse.” - Marcus Rashford</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rashford’s future at Manchester United remains uncertain as he reflects on his position within the club, with calls for an apology looming over him.</p>]]></description>

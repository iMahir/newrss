While Rohit Sharma remains in the captaincy conversation, the former star cricketer Sunil Gavaskar hints that Jasprit Bumrah could be the ideal candidate for the role.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma voluntarily stepped down from the last Test, leading to speculation about his future as captain.</li>
  <li>Mohammad Kaif advises against making Bumrah captain, suggesting it may jeopardize his performance due to added pressure.</li>
  <li>Gavaskar believes Bumrah's leadership qualities make him a suitable candidate, highlighting his calm demeanor.</li>
  <li>Bumrah had an outstanding tour with 32 wickets in five matches and won the Player of the Series award.</li>
  <li>Gavaskar reflects on Bumrah's absence during a crucial match against Australia and its impact on the game's outcome.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“With Bumrah you can see that he expects the others to do what their job is, but he doesn't seem to pressurise anybody.” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Gavaskar's commentary suggests a potential shift in leadership as the team prepares for upcoming Tests, possibly under Bumrah's guidance.</p>]]></description>

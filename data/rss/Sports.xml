<p>Manchester United, currently 15th in the Premier League, has seen a rise in optimism among fans due to manager Ruben Amorim's implementation of a new style of play. Recent comments from Amorim about the need for leadership in the squad have sparked notable improvements, particularly from Harry Maguire, who has responded positively to these challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruben Amorim seeks more leaders in the Man Utd dressing room.</li>
<li>Harry Maguire recently had his contract option extended and has shown improved performances.</li>
<li>Maguire is now viewed as a leader again under Amorim's guidance.</li>
<li>Amorim emphasizes Maguire's change in self-perception as key to his revival.</li>
<li>Despite past adversity, Maguire has regained his place as an integral player.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You can see now the way he plays is different. He feels like a more important player in the team and as a leader, I feel he’s a leader again.” – Ruben Amorim</blockquote>
<p>This turnaround by Maguire not only enhances his own career but also serves as an example for his teammates, highlighting the potential for growth and resilience within the squad.</p>]]></description>

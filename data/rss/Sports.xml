<figcaption>PM Modi with chess world champion Gukesh</figcaption>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with newly-crowned chess world champion D Gukesh and praised the 18-year-old for his determination, dedication, and humility.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gukesh became the youngest chess world champion, surpassing Garry Kasparov's record.</li>
<li>PM Modi met with Gukesh and his parents, commending their efforts in his journey to the world title.</li>
<li>Gukesh gifted PM Modi the chessboard used in his winning game.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p dir='ltr' lang='en'>Had an excellent interaction with chess champion and India’s pride, <a href='https://twitter.com/DGukesh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>@DGukesh</a>!<small>&nbsp;</small> I have been closely interacting with him for a few years now, and what strikes me most about him is his determination and dedication. His confidence is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>In fact, I recall seeing a video of his few years ago where he had said he would become the youngest world champion - a prediction that has now clearly come true thanks to his own efforts.</p>
<p>Along with confidence, Gukesh embodies calmness and humility. Upon winning, he was composed, basking in his glory while fully understanding how to process this hard-earned victory. Our conversation today revolved around the transformative potential of yoga and meditation.</p>
<p>In the success of every athlete, their parents play a pivotal role. I complimented Gukesh's parents for supporting him through thick and thin. Their dedication will inspire countless parents of young aspirants who dream of pursuing sports as a career.</p>
<p>I am also delighted to have received from Gukesh the original chessboard from the game he won. The chessboard, autographed by both him and Ding Liren, is a cherished memento.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the meeting, Gukesh expressed his gratitude and humility towards the PM's support and encouragement.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, GM <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/magnus-carlsen" target="_blank">Magnus Carlsen</a> announced he will no longer compete in the <a href="https://www.chess.com/events/info/2024-fide-world-rapid-chess-championships" target="_blank">2024 FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship</a> due to a disagreement with the dress code enforced by FIDE. This decision ensures new champions will be crowned this year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carlsen's Withdrawal:</strong> The reigning champion received a $200 fine for wearing jeans and faced an ultimatum to change his attire.</li>
<li><strong>Open Championship Leaders:</strong> GMs <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/volodar-murzin" target="_blank">Volodar Murzin</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/jan-krzysztof-duda" target="_blank">Jan-Krzysztof Duda</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/arjun-erigaisi" target="_blank">Arjun Erigaisi</a>, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/alexander-grischuk" target="_blank">Alexander Grischuk</a> currently lead the Open championship with a score of 7/9.</li>
<li><strong>Women’s Championship:</strong> In the <a href="https://www.chess.com/events/2024-fide-world-rapid-chess-championship-women" target="_blank">2024 FIDE Women's World Rapid Chess Championship</a>, GMs <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/ju-wenjun" target="_blank">Ju Wenjun</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/harika-dronavalli" target="_blank">Harika Dronavalli</a>, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/koneru-humpy" target="_blank">Koneru Humpy</a> share the lead with 6.5/8.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of the Dress Code:</strong> Carlsen’s exit raises questions regarding FIDE’s strict enforcement of dress codes and its implications for player participation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I said I'll change tomorrow... but they said you have to change now & it became a matter of principle for me so here we are!" — <cite>Magnus Carlsen</cite></blockquote>
<p>This incident not only affects the current tournaments but also highlights the ongoing tensions between players and regulatory bodies in professional chess.</p>]]></description>

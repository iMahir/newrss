<p>Sanju Samson, the captain of Rajasthan Royals, is considering giving up his wicketkeeping duties in IPL 2025, allowing young Dhruv Jurel to take over the role.</p>
<ul>
<li>Samson was retained by RR for Rs 18 crore.</li>
<li>He acknowledges Jurel's capabilities, especially after Jurel's recent promotion as India's second-choice Test keeper.</li>
<li>Both players discussed potentially sharing wicketkeeping responsibilities during the season.</li>
<li>Samson emphasizes the importance of team priorities over individual roles.</li>
<li>Jurel made his Test debut earlier this year but has lost some competition to Rishabh Pant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The team should come first and the individual must be given importance,” said Sanju Samson.</blockquote>
<p>This decision highlights Samson's strategic thinking as he balances team dynamics while nurturing younger talent like Jurel.</p>]]></description>

<p>The BCCI is instituting strict new rules for the Indian cricket team's travel following a disappointing tour of Australia, which resulted in a 1-3 series loss. Key changes include restrictions on family members’ attendance and luggage weight limits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limitations on the presence of spouses during tours: two weeks for tours over 45 days, one week for shorter tours.</li>
  <li>Mandatory use of team bus for all players and support staff during tours.</li>
  <li>Players to bear costs for any luggage exceeding 150 kg; BCCI will only cover up to that amount.</li>
  <li>Concerns over personal managers traveling on the team bus highlighted by a board official.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The other interesting thing that caught my eye is BCCI will pay till 150kgs for a player baggage. Over and above to be paid by the player. Why would anyone need over 150 kgs of luggage on a cricket tour?? No cricket kit-bag can exceed 40 kgs. — Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) <a href="https://twitter.com/cricketaakash/status/1879111317522641352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
<p>The changes were discussed during a review meeting which included team management and follow serious performance concerns after the recent tour. The BCCI aims to enhance team discipline and streamline travel protocols.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Virat Kohli in action</figcaption>
<p>Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) secretary Ashok Sharma has expressed disappointment that star cricketer Virat Kohli will not participate in the Ranji Trophy, urging him to draw inspiration from players who prioritize domestic cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashok Sharma's call for Virat Kohli to play in the Ranji Trophy.</li>
  <li>Kohli last played for Delhi in 2012; faces criticism for not participating in domestic games.</li>
  <li>Comparison with Mumbai players who compete in domestic cricket despite being contracted with the Indian team.</li>
  <li>BCCI's direction emphasizes the importance of participating in the Ranji Trophy.</li>
  <li>Ashok Sharma believes Kohli will not play even a single match for Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BCCI has issued directives in this regard but I don’t think Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant are going to represent Delhi even in one match.” - Ashok Sharma</blockquote>
<p>This issue underscores a growing concern regarding the commitment of top players to domestic cricket, an area that seems to be lacking emphasis in Northern India.</p>]]></description>

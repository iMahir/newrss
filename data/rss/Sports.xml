<p>Indian chess star Tania Sachdev has expressed disappointment over the Delhi governmentâs lack of recognition for her achievements, stating that such acknowledgment is crucial for inspiring youth and fostering talent development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tania Sachdev is the eighth woman chess grandmaster from India.</li>
<li>She criticized the Delhi government for not recognizing her and other athletes' achievements in chess.</li>
<li>She urged for more support from Delhi's Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leaders.</li>
<li>She highlighted her achievements, including a historic gold medal at the Chess Olympiad in 2024.</li>
<li>Sachdev contrasted the lack of recognition with Tamil Nadu's celebration of chess champion D Gukesh.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>âHaving played for India since 2008 itâs disheartening to see a lack of recognition from the Delhi government for achievements in chess. States that support and celebrate their champions inspire excellence and motivate talent.â â Tania Sachdev</blockquote>
<p>Sachdev's comments reflect a broader issue regarding the recognition and support given to athletes by their respective state governments, potentially impacting the motivation and development of future talent.</p>]]></description>

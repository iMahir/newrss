<p>On day four of the Brisbane Test, India successfully avoided the follow-on, thanks to a determined last-wicket stand between Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah. This partnership significantly hampered Australia's chances of winning, especially after Josh Hazlewood's injury.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Akash Deep played aggressively to alleviate pressure during the final stages of the innings.</li>
  <li>His edged boundary and a six off Cummins led to celebrations in the Indian camp.</li>
  <li>At stumps, Deep was unbeaten on 27, with Bumrah on 10, forming a crucial 39-run partnership.</li>
  <li>This performance has reduced India's chances of defeat, with Australia needing to take ten wickets.</li>
  <li>Hazlewood's injury adds to Australia’s challenges in this Test match.</li>
  <li>Deep received a heartfelt gift from Virat Kohli, who surprised him with a bat before the Test.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Bat chaiye kya tujhe?” (Do you need a bat?) - Virat Kohli</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I will never play with that bat. It’s a huge gift from Virat bhaiya, and I will keep it as a souvenir.” - Akash Deep</blockquote>
<p>This partnership of Akash Deep and Bumrah has greatly bolstered India's position in the match, making Australia's task of winning significantly harder.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Josh Hazlewood's Test Series Likely Over Due to Calf Strain</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 17, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> The Guardian</p>
<p>Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has suffered a calf strain, likely ruling him out of the remainder of the Test series against India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hazlewood experienced discomfort during warm-ups and only bowled one over at the Gabba before being sidelined.</li>
  <li>Medical scans confirmed a calf strain, leading to concerns about his availability for upcoming Tests in Melbourne and Sydney.</li>
  <li>Cricket Australia is expected to announce a replacement squad member soon.</li>
  <li>This injury adds to Hazlewood's recent struggles, including a previous side strain that prevented him from playing in Adelaide.</li>
  <li>Scott Boland is the most likely candidate to replace Hazlewood if he cannot continue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“He is likely to miss the remainder of the Test series.” - Cricket Australia</blockquote>
<p>The potential absence of Hazlewood could significantly impact Australia’s bowling lineup, especially with upcoming matches against Sri Lanka and the West Indies on the horizon.</p>]]></description>

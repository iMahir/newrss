<p>India vs Australia 3rd Test Day 4 Live Score: Pat Cummins dismissed Ravindra Jadeja for 77 as India stand in danger of follow-on</p>
<ul>
<li>Pat Cummins dismissed Ravindra Jadeja for 77, putting India on the verge of a follow-on.</li>
<li>Rain disrupted play, causing interruptions and early tea.</li>
<li>KL Rahul scored 84 runs before being dismissed by Nathan Lyon.</li>
<li>Josh Hazlewood is out for the rest of the series due to a calf strain.</li>
<li>India need 45 runs to avoid the follow-on.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"There was a sudden change in field placements as Cummins moved his fielders out towards the boundary. Jadeja was baited with the short ball and he went for the big pull towards the deep mid-wicket region. Cummins had stationed Marsh at mid-wicket and the all-rounder made a diving effort to dismiss Jadeja."</blockquote>
<p>India faces a significant challenge as they risk a follow-on in the ongoing 3rd Test against Australia. Cummins' strategic dismissal of Jadeja leaves India in a precarious position. Rain interruptions and Josh Hazlewood's injury add complexity to the match dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ravindra Jadeja has scored his 22nd Test fifty</figcaption>
<p>The fourth day of the third Test between India and Australia saw Ravindra Jadeja celebrate his fifty just as rain returned to disrupt play once again. India's innings faced multiple interruptions, struggling against Australia's bowling.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jadeja reached his 22nd Test fifty during a rain-affected second session.</li>
  <li>Play was interrupted after only a few overs due to rain.</li>
  <li>India was at 180/6, needing 65 runs to avoid the follow-on.</li>
  <li>KL Rahul played a notable innings, scoring 84 runs before being dismissed.</li>
  <li>India's batting lineup has faced significant challenges, with multiple players falling cheaply.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“India need to significantly eat into the total themselves rather than rely on the all-round duo.”</blockquote>
<p>As rain continues to affect the match, India's hopes hinge on their ability to withstand Australia's bowling on Day 4.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rohit Sharma's poor performance in Test cricket continues, leading to speculation about his retirement after his gloves act following a dismissal during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit scored only 19 runs in three innings during the Australia tour.</li>
  <li>He was dismissed for 10 runs by Pat Cummins, adding to India's struggling batting display.</li>
  <li>His gloves were left behind near the dugout, prompting fans to speculate about his Test career's future.</li>
  <li>Rohit had previously retired from T20I cricket after the T20 World Cup win.</li>
  <li>Concerns are growing about his future in ODI cricket after the upcoming Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>He has scored only 152 runs in 13 innings since September, highlighting a significant decline in form.</li>

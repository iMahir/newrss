<p>In the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been accused of having a suspect bowling action. Veteran sports commentator Ian Maurice suggests that political correctness is preventing a thorough examination of Bumrah's technique.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah has taken 21 wickets in six innings with an average of 10.90 in the series.</li>
  <li>Ian Maurice claims Australian media is hesitant to scrutinize Bumrah's action due to fear of being labeled racist.</li>
  <li>Greg Chappell has defended Bumrah, calling his bowling action legal and unique.</li>
  <li>Concerns about Bumrah's action arose after comparisons to former cricketer Mohammad Hasnain, who was banned for suspect action.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By the way, please stop this nonsense of questioning Bumrah's action. It is unique, but it is unequivocally clean.” - Greg Chappell</blockquote>
<p>This debate highlights the ongoing challenges in addressing issues of fairness and transparency in sports while respecting cultural sensitivities.</p>]]></description>

  <li>He will also miss next year's Hundred competition starting on January 9.</li>

<p>With the completion of the mega-merger between Jio and Star, the two sports broadcasting giants will start operating as a unified entity during the England tour of India.</p>
<ul>
<li>The merger allows for cross-promotion of properties across platforms.</li>
<li>The England series will be broadcast live on Star Sports and Disney+ Hotstar, along with original platforms like JioCinema.</li>
<li>The transaction of the joint venture was worth INR 70.352 crore (USD 8.5 billion).</li>
<li>Reliance Industries invested Rs 11,500 crore (1.4 billion) into the venture.</li>
<li>Star Sports remains a leading sports channel in India but has faced competition from rivals like Sports18 and JioCinema.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The merger of the media and JioCinema businesses of Viacom18 into Star India Private Limited (SIPL) has become effective.” - Reliance Industries Limited</blockquote>
<p>This integration marks a new era in sports broadcasting in India, potentially reshaping how cricket and other sports are presented to the audience.</p>]]></description>

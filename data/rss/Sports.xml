<figcaption>Australia's cricket team discusses fitness ahead of the Boxing Day Test.</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>Travis Head is expected to play despite recent tightness in his quad.</li>
  <li>Captain Pat Cummins stated, "Trav, he'll be fine, it's a bit of a tight quad, he'll be fine for Melbourne."</li>
  <li>Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out for the remainder of the series due to a calf strain.</li>
  <li>Despite concerns, Head's performance has been vital, having scored consecutive centuries.</li>
  <li>The selectors are set to meet to finalize the team ahead of the Test.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"It's really tough," Cummins said regarding Hazlewood's multiple injuries. "He's probably one of the most disciplined, professional sportspeople you could meet."</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Australia's focus remains on ensuring Head's recovery while managing the squad dynamics in the absence of Hazlewood.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Akash Deep, third left, celebrates with teammates after the dismissal of Australia's Mitchell Marsh during play on day five of the third cricket test between India and Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane(AP)</figcaption>
<p>The draw at the Gabba keeps India in the third spot of the World Test Championship (WTC) points table with a PCT of 58.88 after 17 matches. Persistent rain forced the match to conclude in a draw, impacting India's chances for the WTC final.</p>
<ul>
<li>The match ended in a draw due to rain after India began their chase of 275 runs.</li>
<li>India cannot afford another draw or loss in their remaining two matches to stay in contention for the WTC final.</li>
<li>Winning 3-1 in the remaining series would ensure India's qualification without depending on other results.</li>
<li>The draw maintains tight competition in the WTC standings, with Australia and South Africa also in contention.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The draw did keep India still in the hunt for a spot in the WTC final, but they have now entered a must-win territory.</blockquote>
<p>Overall, while India remains in contention for the World Test Championship final, they must secure victories in their upcoming matches to guarantee qualification.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses how Cricket Australia should have heeded the advice of the late Shane Warne regarding scheduling Tests in Australia during the summer. Poor weather led to significant delays in the third Test, and Warne had previously suggested moving the Brisbane Test to avoid rain issues.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The third Test in Brisbane faced numerous rain delays, likely ending in a draw.</li>
  <li>Shane Warne had advocated for scheduling changes to avoid bad weather impacting Test matches.</li>
  <li>The Sydney Test has historically suffered from rain, with calls to move it to earlier in the summer.</li>
  <li>Cricket Australia announced the SCG Test schedule won't change until 2030.</li>
  <li>Gabba will not host a Test in the 2026-27 summer for the first time in decades.</li>
  <li>Warne's predictions in cricket often prove accurate, highlighting his insightful understanding of the game.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It’s better weather (at the start of the season) than it is in the first week of January,” - Shane Warne</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the article emphasizes the foresight of Warne and the ongoing challenges faced by Cricket Australia in scheduling Tests to ensure a fair and uninterrupted game.</p>]]></description>

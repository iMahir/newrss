<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed KL Rahul to play in the upcoming white-ball series against England despite his request to take a break.</p>
<ul>
    <li>BCCI rejected Rahul’s request for a rest during the series.</li>
    <li>India is scheduled to play five T20Is and three ODIs against England starting January 22.</li>
    <li>Rahul last featured in an ODI in August 2024 against Sri Lanka.</li>
    <li>Selectors initially planned to rest Rahul for the series to provide him with a break.</li>
    <li>Rahul is viewed as a crucial player for the upcoming Champions Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We thought this might just change his career in the right direction. Then you saw the failures again.” - Sanjay Manjrekar</blockquote>
<p>This decision highlights the BCCI's focus on ensuring key players are match-ready ahead of major tournaments such as the Champions Trophy.</p>]]></description>

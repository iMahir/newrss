<figcaption>Sunil Gavaskar (X Photo)</figcaption>
<p>Legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar expressed his disapproval of Rishabh Pant's shot selection, calling it 'stupid'. He criticized Pant for prioritizing ego over strategy during a critical moment in the Boxing Day Test.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gavaskar was upset with Pant's risky ramp shot during the match.</li>
<li>He suggested the shot was a result of ego rather than situational awareness.</li>
<li>Gavaskar expressed concerns about Pant trying to assert dominance instead of playing strategically.</li>
<li>He acknowledged Pant's talent but questioned the need for such a high-risk shot.</li>
<li>Gavaskar emphasized the importance of playing conventional cricketing strokes for success.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“When I see somebody as talented as Rishabh Pant play that shot, I had no problem with the first shot he played and missed. The reason I got upset was that ego took over for the next ball.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Gavaskar advocates for Pant to rely on his conventional skills rather than taking unnecessary risks in crucial matches.</p>]]></description>

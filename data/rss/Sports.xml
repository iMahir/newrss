            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Australia, England and India in favour of splitting Test cricket into two divisions</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong>Jan 6, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Source: </strong>The Age</p>
<p>Cricket powerhouses Australia, India, and England are contemplating a move to split Test playing teams into two divisions, aiming for more matches among the 'Big Three'.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The chairs of Cricket Australia and the England Cricket Board will meet with ICC chair Jay Shah later this month.</li>
  <li>Implementing two divisions would see India, Australia, and England playing more frequently against each other.</li>
  <li>Record attendance was seen during the recent Border-Gavaskar Test series in Australia.</li>
  <li>12 Test playing teams currently exist, with varied match frequencies among them.</li>
  <li>The change would not take effect until mid-2027 due to existing schedules.</li>
  <li>Ravi Shastri, former India player and coach, supports the proposal.</li>
  <li>The concept was initially proposed in 2016, facing opposition from several cricket boards.</li>
  <li>The potential division might include South Africa, Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan in the top tier, while West Indies, Bangladesh, Ireland, Afghanistan, and Zimbabwe would be in the second division.</li>
  <li>Concerns exist that this move could diminish television and sponsorship revenues for lower-ranked teams.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you want Test cricket to survive and be alive and thriving, I think that’s the way to go.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>The potential for splitting Test cricket into two divisions represents a significant shift in the sport, aiming to enhance competition and ensure the survival of Test cricket amidst various challenges.</p>]]></description>

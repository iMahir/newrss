</figure>
<p>In light of India's disappointing performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, there have been strong calls for senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to participate in the upcoming Ranji Trophy to regain form. However, former cricketer Mohammad Kaif suggests that fatigue and upcoming international commitments may prevent their participation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli and Rohit face criticism for their absence in domestic cricket.</li>
  <li>India suffered a 1-3 series loss against Australia, marking a significant setback.</li>
  <li>Kaif describes India as "white-ball bullies," emphasizing the need for a robust Test team.</li>
  <li>Kohli's average in Test has dropped significantly since 2022, adding pressure for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"On 23rd February India will earn a lot of praise by beating Pakistan... but if India wants to win the World Test Championship then they will have to make a Test match team." - Mohammad Kaif</blockquote>
<p>The current domestic hiatus for Kohli and Rohit has drawn a lot of attention and criticism, as both players need to adapt and prepare better for upcoming international challenges. Their involvement in the Ranji Trophy could be crucial for their development and the future of Indian Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

<p>Neeraj Chopra, India's superstar javelin thrower, has made significant remarks regarding the doping epidemic in Indian athletics, emphasizing the need for a change in mindset among young athletes.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2022, India recorded the highest number of drug cheats globally, with 125 out of 3865 samples testing positive.</li>
<li>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) listed India as the second worst country for doping cases among minors.</li>
<li>Chopra urged athletes to focus on hard work, proper guidance, and healthy practices rather than doping for performance enhancement.</li>
<li>A total of 142 Indian athletes were caught doping between April 2022 and March 2023.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Once doping is in the mind, it gets hard in the future... the mindset of our athletes needs to be changed.” - Neeraj Chopra</blockquote>
<p>Chopra advocates for a cultural shift in Indian sports, hoping to eradicate doping and improve overall performance standards.</p>]]></description>

<p>With a disappointing performance, the Indian cricket team, led by Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah, failed to secure the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) against Australia, leading to criticism from RPG Enterprises' Chairman Harsh Goenka.</p>
<img src='link_to_image_if_available.jpg' alt='India's Cricket Team' />
<figcaption>India's cricket team faced a significant defeat against Australia.</figcaption>
<p>In a match held at the Sydney Cricket Ground, India lost the series 1-3, ending a decade-long success in the BGT.</p>
<ul>
<li>India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a six-wicket defeat by Australia.</li>
<li>The defeat ruined India's chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship 2025 finals.</li>
<li>Goenka commented on social media about the reliance on certain players.</li>
<li>His tweet gained significant attention, with over 17,000 views and multiple comments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p lang='hi'>Aaj kuch ‘Sharma’ sa gaya hoon, baat bhi ‘Gambhir’ hai ki hum World Test Championship mein ‘Kohli-fy’ nahi kar paaye. Lagta hai hum apne ‘Bumrah’stra par kuch zyada hi depend karne lage hain. <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/INDvAUS?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>#INDvAUS</a></p><p>— Harsh Goenka (@hvgoenka) <a href='https://twitter.com/hvgoenka/status/1875914875198951552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>January 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
<p>This situation has sparked a lot of debates among fans and analysts regarding the team's performance and strategy.</p>]]></description>

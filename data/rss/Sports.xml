<p>The announcement of India's Champions Trophy squad has been delayed due to fitness concerns regarding Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav, prompting discussions among selectors and management.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other countries have announced their Champions Trophy squads, but India has not yet revealed theirs.</li>
  <li>India's deadline to submit the provisional squad was January 12, but they sought an extension.</li>
  <li>Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and the coaching staff met to finalize the squad amid uncertainty over the players' fitness.</li>
  <li>Bumrah is recovering from back spasms and could miss the group-stage matches.</li>
  <li>Kuldeep Yadav underwent surgery for a groin injury and is expected to return to fitness soon.</li>
  <li>Selectors are considering including Bumrah, Kuldeep, and Mohammed Shami in the squad despite fitness concerns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All cricket boards had to send their preliminary teams by midnight of January 12.”</blockquote>
<p>The delay in announcing the squad is a critical issue as it impacts preparations for the upcoming tournament.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>IPL Trophy</figcaption>
<p>The 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will kick off on March 21 at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens, with the final set for May 25. This change comes after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) adjusted the schedule from earlier proposed dates.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IPL season will start a week later than initially announced.</li>
  <li>Kolkata Knight Riders will host both the opener and the final at Eden Gardens.</li>
  <li>The schedule change is reportedly due to broadcaster preferences to avoid overlap with the Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>The BCCI is expected to release the complete schedule shortly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Indian squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy will likely be announced on January 19.”</blockquote>
<p>This adjustment in schedule shows the influence of international cricket events on domestic leagues, highlighting the need for careful planning by the BCCI.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Devajit Saikia hails from Assam. (AFP Photo)</figcaption>
<p>Devajit Saikia was elected unopposed as the new BCCI Secretary at a Special General Meeting in Mumbai, succeeding Jay Shah, who vacated the position after becoming ICC Chairman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Devajit Saikia and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia were elected unopposed for the positions of Secretary and Treasurer, respectively.</li>
<li>Both candidates were the only ones to file nominations for the vacant posts.</li>
<li>Jay Shah left his position after his election as ICC Chairman last month.</li>
<li>Saikia had been performing the duties of Secretary in the interim.</li>
<li>The election was uncontested, eliminating the need for a polling process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Two (02) Elective Posts of the Office Bearers – Secretary and Treasurer were Uncontested, and it was not necessary to conduct a Poll in respect of these Two (02) Posts,” stated electoral officer A K Joti.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Devajit Saikia’s election is a continuation of stable leadership in the BCCI following the recent changes in the organization's hierarchy.</p>]]></description>

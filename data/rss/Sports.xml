<figcaption>Rohit Sharma gave his verdict on Mohammed Shami's return.(File/X)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent press conference, Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma provided an update regarding fast bowler Mohammed Shami's rehabilitation and potential return to the team.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shami has been recovering from an ankle injury sustained during the 2023 ODI World Cup, resulting in a surgery that sidelined him for nearly a year.</li>
    <li>Shami has begun playing domestic cricket and is set to compete in the Vijay Hazare Trophy for Bengal starting December 21.</li>
    <li>Rohit expressed the need for guidance from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) regarding Shami's condition as there are concerns about his knee.</li>
    <li>Rohit emphasized that they would not take risks with Shami's fitness, reflecting on the experience of Josh Hazlewood's premature return from injury.</li>
    <li>The Indian captain mentioned that while Shami is bowling well in domestic matches, a full clearance has not yet been given by the BCCI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"There is no way we want to take that chance unless we are 100 percent, 200 percent sure, we're not going to take any risk." - Rohit Sharma</blockquote>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding Mohammed Shami's return is causing concern as fans and selectors await clarity from the NCA.</p>]]></description>

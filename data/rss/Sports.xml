<figcaption>Irfan Pathan lashes out at Sachin Tendulkar comparisons after Virat Kohli committed the 'same mistake' again (PTI-Getty)</figcaption>
<p>Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan criticized Virat Kohli after he repeated a mistake during a match in Sydney against Australia, highlighting the need for discipline in his gameplay.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli was dismissed chasing a wide delivery by Scott Boland, scoring only 17 runs.</li>
  <li>Pathan emphasized Kohli's consistent mistakes and the need for him to show discipline in his batting.</li>
  <li>He compared Kohli unfavorably to Sachin Tendulkar, claiming that Kohli lacks the same range of shots.</li>
  <li>Fans have been urging Kohli to adapt a more selective approach akin to Tendulkar's performance in 2004.</li>
  <li>India was all out for 185 in the match, currently trailing by 176 runs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Such a great player. But every time, the same mistakes...” - Irfan Pathan</blockquote>
<p>Pathan noted that great players learn from their mistakes, which Kohli seems to be repeating frequently. He calls for Kohli to develop a more disciplined batting technique to improve his performance.</p>]]></description>

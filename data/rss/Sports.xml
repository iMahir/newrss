<figcaption>Temba Bavuma has been nothing but phenomenal as captain of South Africa(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the recent controversies surrounding the Australian media's treatment of the Indian cricket team, particularly Virat Kohli, and Graeme Smith's reflections on the upcoming World Test Championship final against South Africa.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Australian media has faced criticism for harshly targeting Virat Kohli and the Indian team.</li>
  <li>South Africa is preparing for the World Test Championship final at Lord's after a successful run.</li>
  <li>Smith emphasizes Bavuma's calm leadership style while addressing the external pressures from Australian media.</li>
  <li>Smith reflects on his own past achievements against Australia, similar to the challenges Bavuma faces today.</li>

<p>The article discusses how top Indian cricketers, including Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, have not participated in domestic red-ball cricket for several years, impacting the Test team's performance. Following losses to Australia and New Zealand, there's a call for players to engage more in domestic competitions to regain their form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virat Kohli last played a domestic game in 2012, Rohit Sharma in 2016.</li>
  <li>In the last four years, key players have played only four long-format domestic games.</li>
  <li>Indian team lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia.</li>
  <li>Players are urged to participate in the Ranji Trophy for better rhythm and game time.</li>
  <li>The lack of domestic play affects players' readiness for Test matches.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Without game time in the middle, their game will stagnate…”</blockquote>
<p>This trend of avoiding domestic cricket has raised concerns about the future of Indian cricket, with calls for a cultural change where even stars prioritize domestic matches.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Kobbie Mainoo, a promising talent from Manchester United</figcaption>
<p>Chelsea is reportedly leading the pursuit of Manchester United's young talent Kobbie Mainoo, as talks over a new contract for the 19-year-old have stalled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainoo has emerged as a crucial player for Manchester United, making his mark as a standout academy graduate.</li>
<li>His impressive performances led to a call-up to the England squad for Euro 2024.</li>
<li>Despite injury setbacks, Mainoo's recent displays, especially against Liverpool, have drawn attention to his potential.</li>
<li>Chelsea's strategic focus on acquiring young players may appeal to Mainoo, given their commitment to long-term development.</li>
<li>Manchester United is aiming to secure their promising players like Mainoo, but without clear progress on contract negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“In the same way that Kobbie Mainoo might be, he’s out of contract in 2027 – no news on a new deal.” - David Ornstein on Mainoo's future</blockquote>
<p>This situation reflects the ongoing challenges faced by Manchester United in retaining their youth talents while Chelsea looks to capitalize on the situation.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rashford linked with a move amid controversies.</figcaption>
<p>Teddy Sheringham believes Marcus Rashford needs to apologize to Manchester United after expressing a desire for a “new challenge,” following his omission from a match against Manchester City.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rashford's comments have led to speculation about his future with the club.</li>
  <li>He remains connected to clubs such as Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, but staying at United is possible due to his wage demands.</li>
  <li>Sheringham says Rashford's comments reflect a lack of focus, impacting his performance.</li>
  <li>Rashford indicated he wants to leave with “no hard feelings” towards United.</li>
  <li>Former players suggest a transfer could benefit Rashford’s confidence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If I know that a situation is already bad I’m not going to make it worse.” - Marcus Rashford</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rashford’s future at Manchester United remains uncertain as he reflects on his position within the club, with calls for an apology looming over him.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Siegemund Upsets Zheng; Sabalenka Survives a Tough Match at Australian Open</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2 hours ago</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> WTA Tennis</p>
<p>Last year's Australian Open finalists Aryna Sabalenka and Zheng Qinwen faced challenges in their second-round matches. While Sabalenka secured her victory, Zheng became the first Top 10 seed to exit the tournament.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aryna Sabalenka defeated Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-3, 7-5, recovering from a 5-2 deficit in the second set.</li>
  <li>Laura Siegemund made headlines by defeating No.5 seed Zheng Qinwen 7-6(3), 6-3.</li>
  <li>This match marked Siegemund's 11th career Top 10 victory.</li>
  <li>Sabalenka extended her winning streak at Melbourne Park to 16 matches.</li>
  <li>Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva also advanced to the third round with contrasting performances.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"She played incredible tennis, especially in the second set," Sabalenka said. "I'm really happy I was able to turn around that set."</blockquote>
<p>Siegemund's win is notable as she becomes the first German woman to defeat a Top 5 player at the Australian Open since 2016.</p>]]></description>

<p>Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) secretary Ashok Sharma has expressed disappointment that star cricketer Virat Kohli will not participate in the Ranji Trophy, urging him to draw inspiration from players who prioritize domestic cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashok Sharma's call for Virat Kohli to play in the Ranji Trophy.</li>
  <li>Kohli last played for Delhi in 2012; faces criticism for not participating in domestic games.</li>
  <li>Comparison with Mumbai players who compete in domestic cricket despite being contracted with the Indian team.</li>
  <li>BCCI's direction emphasizes the importance of participating in the Ranji Trophy.</li>
  <li>Ashok Sharma believes Kohli will not play even a single match for Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BCCI has issued directives in this regard but I don’t think Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant are going to represent Delhi even in one match.” - Ashok Sharma</blockquote>
<p>This issue underscores a growing concern regarding the commitment of top players to domestic cricket, an area that seems to be lacking emphasis in Northern India.</p>]]></description>

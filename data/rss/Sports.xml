            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Magnus Carlsen Disqualified from World Rapid and Blitz Championship Over Jeans Controversy</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 28, 2024</p>

<figcaption>Norway's chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Magnus Carlsen, a multiple-time world champion, was disqualified from the World Rapid and Blitz Championship 2024 in New York due to a breach of the tournament's dress code by wearing jeans. Despite being fined and asked to change, Carlsen refused, leading to his disqualification.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carlsen was disqualified for wearing jeans, explicitly prohibited by the tournament's dress code.</li>
  <li>Initially fined $200, Carlsen declined to change into formal attire immediately.</li>
  <li>FIDE emphasized that the rules applied equally to all players, including notable players like Carlsen.</li>
  <li>Other players, such as Ian Nepomniachtchi, complied with dress code regulations after being fined.</li>
  <li>Carlsen expressed frustration with FIDE, calling the dress code “stupid” and declaring he no longer wanted to engage with them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I am pretty tired of FIDE, so I want no more of this... maybe it’s a stupid principle, but I don’t think it’s any fun,” said Carlsen.</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the tension between individual player preferences and established tournament rules, raising questions about the rigidity of such regulations in professional chess.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ravindra Jadeja's wicket raises concerns for India.</figcaption>
<p>India is in a precarious position on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia after losing their seventh wicket, Ravindra Jadeja. With their follow-on score in jeopardy, the team is desperate to build a solid partnership to avoid defeat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia posted a total of 474 runs in their first innings.</li>
<li>India is currently 221 runs for 7 wickets with Nitish Reddy and Washington Sundar at the crease.</li>
<li>Jadeja's departure marks a significant setback as he was expected to score critical runs.</li>
<li>If India fails to perform today, their chances of reaching the World Test Championship (WTC) final diminish significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The way India play today might well decide the course of the series and World Test Championship final equation.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, India's batting performance today is crucial to their WTC hopes, and every run counts as they face mounting pressure from the Australian bowlers.</p>]]></description>

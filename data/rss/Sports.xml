<p>In a surprising turn of events, GM <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/magnus-carlsen" target="_blank">Magnus Carlsen</a> announced he will no longer compete in the <a href="https://www.chess.com/events/info/2024-fide-world-rapid-chess-championships" target="_blank">2024 FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship</a> due to a disagreement with the dress code enforced by FIDE. This decision ensures new champions will be crowned this year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carlsen's Withdrawal:</strong> The reigning champion received a $200 fine for wearing jeans and faced an ultimatum to change his attire.</li>
<li><strong>Open Championship Leaders:</strong> GMs <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/volodar-murzin" target="_blank">Volodar Murzin</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/jan-krzysztof-duda" target="_blank">Jan-Krzysztof Duda</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/arjun-erigaisi" target="_blank">Arjun Erigaisi</a>, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/alexander-grischuk" target="_blank">Alexander Grischuk</a> currently lead the Open championship with a score of 7/9.</li>
<li><strong>Women’s Championship:</strong> In the <a href="https://www.chess.com/events/2024-fide-world-rapid-chess-championship-women" target="_blank">2024 FIDE Women's World Rapid Chess Championship</a>, GMs <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/ju-wenjun" target="_blank">Ju Wenjun</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/harika-dronavalli" target="_blank">Harika Dronavalli</a>, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/koneru-humpy" target="_blank">Koneru Humpy</a> share the lead with 6.5/8.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of the Dress Code:</strong> Carlsen’s exit raises questions regarding FIDE’s strict enforcement of dress codes and its implications for player participation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I said I'll change tomorrow... but they said you have to change now & it became a matter of principle for me so here we are!" — <cite>Magnus Carlsen</cite></blockquote>

<figcaption>Virat Kohli responding to heckles after his dismissal.</figcaption>
<p>The Melbourne Cricket Club CEO confirmed that the Indian cricket team has not lodged any official complaint regarding heckling directed at Virat Kohli during the fourth Test match.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kohli faced heckling after a controversial moment involving a shoulder bump with Australian debutant Sam Konstas.</li>
<li>Despite the crowd's hostility, there has been no formal complaint from the Indian team.</li>
<li>CEO Stuart Fox expressed concern only if the heckling escalated to abusive behavior.</li>
<li>Kohli was escorted to the dressing room after allegedly responding to fans.</li>
<li>India is behind in the Test match, with Australia leading by 148 runs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You’re never comfortable when you’ve got fans heavily engaging with the player.” - Stuart Fox</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while there were some tensions in the crowd during the match, the lack of an official complaint indicates that the Indian team is taking the situation in stride.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Sunil Gavaskar weighed in on Virat Kohli-Yashasvi Jaiswal blunder [Source: @justnowofficial/X.com]</figcaption>
<p>After a dramatic mix-up leading to Yashasvi Jaiswal's run out during the fourth Test against Australia, cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar weighs in on the incident, highlighting the miscommunication between Jaiswal and Virat Kohli.</p>
<ul>
<li>India was in a challenging position after early wickets, but Jaiswal and Kohli formed a 100-run partnership.</li>
<li>Jaiswal was run out for 82 due to a miscommunication with Kohli.</li>
<li>Gavaskar believes Kohli should have reacted quicker to Jaiswal's call.</li>
<li>He also suggests that the run taken was risky and unnecessary given the context of the match.</li>
<li>India has since regained control on Day 3, with key performances from Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It could have been a quick single, and someone like Virat Kohli would likely have made it. However, the issue was that he glanced at the fielder. When you do that, you lose that crucial second.” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Gavaskar criticized the mix-up, he acknowledged Kohli's running abilities and the unnecessary risk taken during the run.</p>]]></description>

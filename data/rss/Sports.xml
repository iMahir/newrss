<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong> January 2023 | <strong>Source: </strong>The Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/Kohli-81.jpg?resize=600,338" alt="Faf du Plessis on Virat Kohli form">
<figcaption>India's Virat Kohli bats during play on the last day of the fourth cricket test between Australia and India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne, Australia.</figcaption>
<p>DDCA secretary Ashok Sharma has urged Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant to participate in the Ranji Trophy. He points out a gap in the culture of participation in domestic cricket compared to Mumbai.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli and Pant are named in the probable squad for the last rounds of the Ranji Trophy.</li>
  <li>Sharma emphasizes the importance of playing for one's state team when available.</li>
  <li>There are concerns regarding player fitness and participation influenced by busy schedules.</li>
  <li>DDCA president Rohan Jaitley supports participation in domestic cricket for all players.</li>
  <li>Kohli last played for Delhi in the Ranji Trophy in 2012.</li>
  <li>Jaitley mentions that Kohli's presence could greatly impact younger players in Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is exceptionally important to participate in the domestic tournament. If on national duty, obviously one cannot participate, but otherwise, they should.” - Rohan Jaitley</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, engaging in domestic cricket is vital for players like Kohli and Pant, not just for performance but also for contributing to the development of future talent in the sport.</p>]]></description>

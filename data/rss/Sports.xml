            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Sunil Gavaskar Names Jasprit Bumrah as Next Potential India Captain</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 24 December 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> NDTV</p>
<img width="639" height="479" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/4f9ggg08_sunil-gavaskar_625x300_26_December_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" alt="Sunil Gavaskar" />
<figcaption>Sunil Gavaskar expresses his views on the future of Indian cricket captaincy.</figcaption>
<p>The question of who will lead India in future Test matches arises after their recent 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy. While Rohit Sharma remains in the captaincy conversation, the former star cricketer Sunil Gavaskar hints that Jasprit Bumrah could be the ideal candidate for the role.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma voluntarily stepped down from the last Test, leading to speculation about his future as captain.</li>
  <li>Mohammad Kaif advises against making Bumrah captain, suggesting it may jeopardize his performance due to added pressure.</li>
  <li>Gavaskar believes Bumrah's leadership qualities make him a suitable candidate, highlighting his calm demeanor.</li>
  <li>Bumrah had an outstanding tour with 32 wickets in five matches and won the Player of the Series award.</li>
  <li>Gavaskar reflects on Bumrah's absence during a crucial match against Australia and its impact on the game's outcome.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“With Bumrah you can see that he expects the others to do what their job is, but he doesn't seem to pressurise anybody.” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Gavaskar's commentary suggests a potential shift in leadership as the team prepares for upcoming Tests, possibly under Bumrah's guidance.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Virat Kohli responding to heckles after his dismissal.</figcaption>
<p>The Melbourne Cricket Club CEO confirmed that the Indian cricket team has not lodged any official complaint regarding heckling directed at Virat Kohli during the fourth Test match.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kohli faced heckling after a controversial moment involving a shoulder bump with Australian debutant Sam Konstas.</li>
<li>Despite the crowd's hostility, there has been no formal complaint from the Indian team.</li>
<li>CEO Stuart Fox expressed concern only if the heckling escalated to abusive behavior.</li>
<li>Kohli was escorted to the dressing room after allegedly responding to fans.</li>
<li>India is behind in the Test match, with Australia leading by 148 runs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You’re never comfortable when you’ve got fans heavily engaging with the player.” - Stuart Fox</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while there were some tensions in the crowd during the match, the lack of an official complaint indicates that the Indian team is taking the situation in stride.</p>]]></description>

<p>Virat Kohli showed sportsmanship as he congratulated Steve Smith for his 34th Test century during the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, despite facing criticism for a prior incident in the match.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Kohli applauded Smith as he scored his century, showcasing camaraderie.</li>
    <li>The gesture follows Kohli's earlier criticism for a physical confrontation with a young player.</li>
    <li>Smith equaled greats like Sunil Gavaskar and Brian Lara with his 34th Test century.</li>
    <li>Kohli and Smith have a long history, starting from their U19 cricket days.</li>
    <li>Australia scored 474 runs in their first innings, with Smith contributing significantly before being dismissed for 140.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Kohli's gesture for Smith in the 2019 ODI World Cup, asking the crowd not to boo the Australian batter, earned the ICC Fair Play award that year.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident marks a moment of respect and sportsmanship in cricket, highlighting the relationships between players beyond rivalry.</p>]]></description>

<p>Magnus Carlsen, a multiple-time world champion, was disqualified from the World Rapid and Blitz Championship 2024 in New York due to a breach of the tournament's dress code by wearing jeans. Despite being fined and asked to change, Carlsen refused, leading to his disqualification.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carlsen was disqualified for wearing jeans, explicitly prohibited by the tournament's dress code.</li>
  <li>Initially fined $200, Carlsen declined to change into formal attire immediately.</li>
  <li>FIDE emphasized that the rules applied equally to all players, including notable players like Carlsen.</li>
  <li>Other players, such as Ian Nepomniachtchi, complied with dress code regulations after being fined.</li>
  <li>Carlsen expressed frustration with FIDE, calling the dress code “stupid” and declaring he no longer wanted to engage with them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I am pretty tired of FIDE, so I want no more of this... maybe it’s a stupid principle, but I don’t think it’s any fun,” said Carlsen.</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the tension between individual player preferences and established tournament rules, raising questions about the rigidity of such regulations in professional chess.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ravindra Jadeja's wicket raises concerns for India.</figcaption>
<p>India is in a precarious position on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia after losing their seventh wicket, Ravindra Jadeja. With their follow-on score in jeopardy, the team is desperate to build a solid partnership to avoid defeat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia posted a total of 474 runs in their first innings.</li>
<li>India is currently 221 runs for 7 wickets with Nitish Reddy and Washington Sundar at the crease.</li>
<li>Jadeja's departure marks a significant setback as he was expected to score critical runs.</li>
<li>If India fails to perform today, their chances of reaching the World Test Championship (WTC) final diminish significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The way India play today might well decide the course of the series and World Test Championship final equation.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, India's batting performance today is crucial to their WTC hopes, and every run counts as they face mounting pressure from the Australian bowlers.</p>]]></description>

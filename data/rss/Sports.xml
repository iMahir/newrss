<figcaption>India's Yashasvi Jaiswal walks off the field after losing his wicket.(AP)</figcaption>
<p>Yashasvi Jaiswal faced criticism for his early dismissal in India's innings at the Gabba after a mis-hit shot led to a catch off Mitchell Starc. Former England captain Michael Vaughan mocked the talented youngster's inconsistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yashasvi Jaiswal was out on the second ball of India's innings.</li>
<li>The dismissal was criticized as a 'soft' wicket given away cheaply.</li>
<li>Michael Vaughan commented on Jaiswal's practice versus performance disparity.</li>
<li>Ravi Shastri expressed disbelief at Jaiswal’s choice of shot at a crucial moment.</li>
<li>The Indian team struggled, being 39-3 after several disruptions due to rain.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Five minutes before Jaiswal got out... in practice it’s perfect.” - Michael Vaughan</blockquote>
<p>The criticism surrounding Jaiswal emphasizes the pressure young players face in international cricket, especially against formidable opponents like Australia.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India vs Australia 3rd Test Day 3 Live Score: Virat Kohli fell to Josh Hazlewood</figcaption>
<p>Rain has interrupted the third day of the Test match between India and Australia multiple times, impacting the flow of play as both teams battle for supremacy in the series.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India was reduced to 22/3 at lunch, trailing by 423 runs.</li>
  <li>Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill both fell early, with poor shot selection being a critical factor.</li>
  <li>Australia scored a total of 445 runs, with Travis Head and Steve Smith dominating on Day 2.</li>
  <li>Alex Carey was key to Australia's innings, securing a half-century efficiently.</li>
  <li>Multiple rain delays have disrupted both innings, with players forced off the field repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“One would say it is poor shot selection. You can say that they have bowled well and they have pitched it up but if you look at the three dismissals, none of them were great deliveries.” – Cheteshwar Pujara</blockquote>
<p>As the match progresses, the focus falls on India's performance in batting to recover from a fragile position.</p>]]></description>

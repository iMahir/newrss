<figcaption>Manu Bhaker isn't happy(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Manu Bhaker, the celebrated shooter and twin medal winner at the Paris Olympics, is devastated after being excluded from the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award shortlist despite her historic achievements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manu Bhaker won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics 2024, becoming the first Indian athlete of the Independence era to achieve this feat.</li>
<li>Despite being a strong candidate, she was not shortlisted for the Khel Ratna award.</li>
<li>Bhaker's father shared her disappointment, stating she felt she shouldn't have participated in the Olympics at all.</li>
<li>The sports ministry's decision has drawn backlash from fans and may prompt reconsideration.</li>
<li>She has a remarkable record of 17 gold, six silver, and five bronze medals in various shooting events since the Tokyo Games.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I shouldn't have gone to the Olympics and won medals for the country. In fact, I shouldn't have become a sportsperson.” - Manu Bhaker</blockquote>
<p>This exclusion has sparked significant discussion among sports fans and officials, potentially influencing future deliberations on recognition for athletes.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's captain Rohit Sharma, right, and teammate Virat Kohli leave the field(AP)</figcaption>
<p>Rohit Sharma has addressed the media regarding Virat Kohli's recent difficulties with deliveries outside the off-stump during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, expressing confidence that Kohli will find a way to score runs in the upcoming Tests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit laughed when asked about Kohli's form, emphasizing Kohli's status as a modern-day great.</li>
  <li>Kohli has had a challenging series, with only one century to his name so far.</li>
  <li>Multiple bowlers, including Boland and Hazlewood, have troubled Kohli with their bowling style.</li>
  <li>Rohit himself is also struggling, particularly with in-swing deliveries.</li>
  <li>The upcoming Boxing Day Test is crucial for India's batting lineup as the series is tied 1-1.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You only said he is a modern-day great. Modern-day greats will figure out their way or the path (to overcome issues),” - Rohit Sharma</blockquote>
<p>Sharma remains confident that both he and Kohli will rectify their issues as they prepare for the important matches ahead.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Mumbai's Unconventional Batting Order Pays Off With Iyer and Kotian's Heroics</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> Dec 24, 2024 <strong>by:</strong> HT Sports Desk</p>

<p>Mumbai's cricket team faced a tough challenge during their chase against Hyderabad in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, but a remarkable effort from Shreyas Iyer and Tanush Kotian turned the tide for them, securing a three-wicket victory.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mumbai attempted a risky strategy by reversing their batting order.</li>
  <li>They struggled initially, losing six wickets for just 67 runs.</li>
  <li>Suryakumar Yadav entered at No. 8 and helped stabilize the innings.</li>
  <li>Iyer contributed significantly with a quick score of 44 runs off 20 balls.</li>
  <li>Mumbai chased down the target of 170, finishing at 175 runs for 7 wickets.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The plan failed initially, but teamwork saved the day for Mumbai."</blockquote>
<p>This match showcased the unpredictability of cricket and how unconventional strategies can lead to unexpected victories.</p>]]></description>

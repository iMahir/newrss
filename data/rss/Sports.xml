<p>India's leading bowler Jasprit Bumrah was unable to play on Day 3 of the fifth Test against Australia due to back spasms, prompting Mohammed Siraj to take over opening duties.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bumrah batted after bowling just one over before leaving the field due to injury.</li>
    <li>India set Australia a target of 162 runs after being dismissed for 157 in their second innings.</li>
    <li>Scott Boland achieved figures of 6-45, leading the Australian bowling attack.</li>
    <li>Rishabh Pant scored a notable 61, becoming the top scorer for India.</li>
    <li>Australia lead the series 2-1, needing a win or draw to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If they win or draw, it would also put them into the World Test Championships final in June at Lord's against South Africa."</blockquote>
<p>This match highlights the struggle for India without their star bowler, while Australia aims for a significant series victory.</p>]]></description>

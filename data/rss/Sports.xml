</figure>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to have its first discussions on the future of senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after a series of poor performances. New secretary Devajit Saikia has been instructed to convey a strong message regarding team selection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India's poor performance: Six defeats in the last eight matches, raising concerns about the future of senior players.</li>
  <li>Upcoming ICC Champions Trophy: India must submit a provisional team by January 12.</li>
  <li>Calls for significant changes: Former officials suggest dropping Kohli and Rohit to reinforce that no player is bigger than the game.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The message is going very bad. People can be sweet pawns on the internet but BCCI has to run cricket in the country and it should also be seen running it.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the BCCI is at a crossroads regarding the roles of experienced players, and significant decisions are expected at the upcoming meeting.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Mohammed Shami with Virat Kohli during a practice session(Action Images via Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has criticized the BCCI for their handling of Mohammed Shami's recovery, stating that he should have been taken to Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shastri believes Shami's presence would have impacted India's performance in Australia.</li>
  <li>Shami has not played international cricket since the ODI World Cup final in November 2023.</li>
  <li>BCCI ruled Shami unfit for the remainder of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy due to knee swelling.</li>
  <li>Shastri expressed surprise at the communication regarding Shami's fitness and recovery process.</li>
  <li>He suggested keeping Shami with the team in Australia for better rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Where is he when it comes to recovery? He's been sitting in the NCA for I don't know how long.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri proposed that monitoring Shami's rehabilitation in Australia with professional guidance could have been beneficial for his recovery and the team's performance.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article outlines Jasprit Bumrah's stellar performance in the Border-Gavaskar series despite injury concerns emerging from his heavy workload. He ended the series with 32 wickets and was named Player of the Series, but his absence in the final innings has raised alarms regarding his fitness and management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bumrah took 32 wickets in five matches, achieving three five-wicket hauls.</li>
<li>He bowled 151.2 overs in the series, with a peak of 53.2 overs in one match.</li>
<li>Concerns about workload management sparked debate in the cricketing community.</li>
<li>Former cricketer Balwinder Sandhu criticized the idea of workload management, encouraging players to focus on physical endurance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If a bowler can’t bowl 20 overs in an innings, he should forget about playing for India." - Balwinder Sandhu</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the conflict between modern injury management practices in cricket and the traditional philosophies regarding player endurance.</p>]]></description>

<p>After India’s loss in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, Rohit Sharma clarified that his recent comments regarding stepping out did not signal his retirement. However, the BCCI officials reportedly dismissed his remarks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The BCCI Special General Meeting is scheduled, with discussions expected about Rohit's future in Test cricket.</li>
  <li>Rohit scored only 31 runs in five innings during the tour of Australia, marking a troubling average.</li>
  <li>His clarification to the media included the statement, “I am not going anywhere.”</li>
  <li>According to sources within the BCCI, Rohit's comments did not significantly alter the board's perspective on his future.</li>
  <li>Officials suggested that Rohit was looking for an escape route to the World Test Championship final.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Rohit was waiting to see if India could find an escape route to the WTC final. Now, it’s really up to him whether to continue to fight for a spot.” – BCCI official</blockquote>
<p>The discussion at the BCCI meeting will be crucial in determining the path forward for both Rohit and the Indian team as they navigate the upcoming Champions Trophy and beyond.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the concerns regarding Jasprit Bumrah's heavy bowling load during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he bowled over 150 overs. Former Indian pacer Balwinder Sandhu critiques the concept of workload management in cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah bowled 151.2 overs and took 32 wickets during the series.</li>
  <li>Concerns were raised about his physical limits due to the workload.</li>
  <li>Sandhu argues that workload management is a concept created by Australians and insists that bowlers should listen to their bodies.</li>
  <li>He emphasizes that bowlers are capable of managing such workloads with proper conditioning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Workload management is bull****. These are Australian terms, created by Australians. I don’t agree with this at all," said Balwinder Sandhu.</blockquote>
<p>The article highlights an ongoing debate in cricket regarding player workload and the expectations placed on bowlers in Test matches.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>England To Boycott Match Against Afghanistan In Champions Trophy 2025? Here Is ECB's Response</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not Specified | <strong>Source:</strong> Zee News</p>
<p>The cricketing world is facing a significant debate as the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) considers calls to boycott their upcoming Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan scheduled for February 26 in Lahore. The controversy stems from Afghanistan's restrictions on women's participation in sports under the Taliban regime.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A coalition of over 160 British politicians has urged the ECB to boycott the match.</li>
  <li>Women's cricket in Afghanistan has significantly diminished since the Taliban's return to power in 2021.</li>
  <li>ECB's Chief Executive Richard Gould advocates for a coordinated ICC-wide approach instead of unilateral action.</li>
  <li>Afghanistan has shown remarkable progress in cricket yet faces criticism regarding gender equity.</li>
  <li>The implications of the Taliban's policies extend to Afghan women cricketers seeking refuge abroad.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A coordinated response would be significantly more impactful,” - Richard Gould, ECB Chief Executive</blockquote>
<p>The ECB has not committed to a boycott but maintains its policy of not scheduling bilateral matches against Afghanistan, highlighting the difficulties of merging moral obligations with cricket governance.</p>]]></description>

<p>Kieran Tierney has voiced his support for Mikel Arteta's decision to pursue Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad, strengthening Arsenal's squad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tierney described Zubimendi as a "world-class" player.</li>
  <li>Arsenal has been targeting Zubimendi for over a year, aiming to replace Thomas Partey.</li>
  <li>The club is reportedly close to securing his signature with a £51 million release clause.</li>
  <li>Zubimendi will remain with Real Sociedad until the end of the season, despite interest from other clubs like Manchester City.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You have world-class players like Zubimendi... It’s hard to know [their quality] if you’re only watching the Premier League every week.” - Kieran Tierney</blockquote>
<p>This acquisition is timely as Tierney is likely to leave Arsenal soon, with speculation about a return to Celtic.</p>]]></description>

<p>Islam Makhachev is poised to cement his status in UFC history with a title defense against Arman Tsarukyan at UFC 311. Makhachev has sought to surpass his mentor, Khabib Nurmagomedov, who controversially won against Gleison Tibau.</p>
<ul>
<li>Makhachev is looking to defend the lightweight title at UFC 311.</li>
<li>He aims to surpass Khabib's record of three title defenses.</li>
<li>Makhachev previously faced Gleison Tibau, who also fought Nurmagomedov.</li>
<li>The fight between Nurmagomedov and Tibau in 2013 had close scoring, with many believing Tibau won.</li>
<li>Makhachev avenged the doubt by knocking out Tibau in under a minute in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Gleison at this part in the game seems to be the better fighter,” Commentator Joe Rogan.</blockquote>
<p>Makhachev’s first-round knockout not only silenced skepticism about Nurmagomedov's win over Tibau but also solidified his position in the lightweight division.</p>]]></description>

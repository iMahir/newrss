<p>The Indian cricket team is preparing for the Champions Trophy, with significant discussions expected on player selections, particularly for the wicketkeeper and wrist spinner positions.</p>
<ul>
<li>KL Rahul is not likely to continue as the primary keeper moving forward.</li>
<li>Rishabh Pant remains the first choice for the wicketkeeping position.</li>
<li>Dhruv Jurel, Ishan Kishan, and Sanju Samson are in contention for the second keeper spot, with Jurel currently leading.</li>
<li>Kishan has faced challenges after missing domestic cricket and losing his BCCI contract.</li>
<li>Kuldeep Yadav's fitness is a concern for the team, and Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi are contenders to fill his role.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Ishan Kishan has played 27 ODIs with 933 runs, but his recent form raises concerns about his future in the squad.</p></blockquote>
<p>The outcomes of the selection committee's meeting will shape the team dynamics ahead of the tournament.</p>]]></description>

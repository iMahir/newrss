<figcaption>Shubman Gill during a disappointing performance</figcaption>
<p>Shubman Gill has faced criticism following his poor performance in the Test series against Australia, with former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali pointing out his lack of hunger for runs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shubman Gill dismissed for just 1 run in the third Test against Australia.</li>
  <li>Basit Ali emphasizes the importance of focusing on performance instead of comparing oneself to established players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.</li>
  <li>India's team avoided a follow-on but still trails by 193 runs after scoring 252 for nine.</li>
  <li>Ravindra Jadeja and KL Rahul were key contributors, scoring 77 and 84 runs respectively.</li>
  <li>The five-match series is currently tied at 1-1.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Gill ko toh bilkul hi nahi hai bhookh (Gill is not hungry at all for runs)." - Basit Ali</blockquote>
<p>The criticism highlights the pressure on young players in high-stakes cricket, especially in challenging Test series.</p>]]></description>

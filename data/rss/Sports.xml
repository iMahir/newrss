<figcaption>Temba Bavuma has led South Africa admirably(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>South Africa's cricket team, led by Temba Bavuma, has made a remarkable resurgence, having progressed to the World Test Championship (WTC) final despite facing criticism over their previous performances. Bavuma emphasizes the need for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to address disparities in the number of Tests played by different nations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>South Africa lost 0-2 to New Zealand in February 2024, raising questions about their capabilities.</li>
  <li>Under Bavuma's leadership, the team has won 7 consecutive Tests, securing their place in the WTC final against Australia.</li>
  <li>Bavuma has scored over 500 runs in his last four Tests and expresses confidence in his form and the team's potential.</li>
  <li>He advocates for more Test matches, noting that South Africa played only 12 Tests last year compared to England's 22.</li>
  <li>Bavuma acknowledges their underdog status but believes in the team's strength despite challenges.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think England played about 22 Tests last year. We played 12, that’s almost 50 percent.”</blockquote>
<p>This event highlights the need for reform in international cricket scheduling and aims to elevate the visibility and competitiveness of Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Karun Nair during the Vijay Hazare Trophy; Harbhajan Singh(X/Files)</figcaption>
<p>Harbhajan Singh expresses frustration over BCCI's continued neglect of Karun Nair, who has showcased exemplary performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Karun Nair scored 664 runs in six innings, with five centuries and a strike rate of 120.07.</li>
<li>BCCI's selectors appear to overlook players performing well in domestic cricket.</li>
<li>Nair had previously scored a triple century in Test cricket but has not been picked for recent team selections.</li>
<li>Harbhajan criticizes the unfair selection criteria in Indian cricket.</li>
<li>Nair continues to perform well in multiple formats and leagues, including first-class cricket and county cricket.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When they are scoring runs, you need to play him, right?” - Harbhajan Singh</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the ongoing disregard for players like Nair raises questions about the transparency and fairness of the selection process in Indian cricket.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) recently held a meeting with chief selector Ajit Agarkar, head coach Gautam Gambhir, and Test captain Rohit Sharma concerning India's poor performance in Test cricket.</p>

  <li>For long tours, players can have family with them for a maximum of 14 days.</li>

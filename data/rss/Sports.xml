<figcaption>India's Rohit Sharma walks off the field after his dismissal by Australia's bowler Pat Cummins on day four of the third Test match against Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane on December 17(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Rohit Sharma's poor performance in Test cricket continues, leading to speculation about his retirement after his gloves act following a dismissal during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit scored only 19 runs in three innings during the Australia tour.</li>
  <li>He was dismissed for 10 runs by Pat Cummins, adding to India's struggling batting display.</li>
  <li>His gloves were left behind near the dugout, prompting fans to speculate about his Test career's future.</li>
  <li>Rohit had previously retired from T20I cricket after the T20 World Cup win.</li>
  <li>Concerns are growing about his future in ODI cricket after the upcoming Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>He has scored only 152 runs in 13 innings since September, highlighting a significant decline in form.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If Rohit fails to script a comeback in the remaining two Test matches of the series, the selectors might be forced to think otherwise when India's next WTC cycle begins in July."</blockquote>
<p>As discussions around his cricketing future intensify, the next matches will be crucial for Sharma's career trajectory.</p>]]></description>

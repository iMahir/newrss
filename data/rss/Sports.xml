<p>The Wolverhampton Wanderers have made a significant change in management, parting ways with Gary O'Neil and bringing back renowned super-agent Jorge Mendes for assistance. This decision comes after a string of unsatisfactory performances and a pressing need to turn the team's fortunes around.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wolves turned to Mendes again, after a two-year hiatus, for assistance after failed attempts to find a suitable replacement for O’Neil.</li>
  <li>Vitor Pereira is now in contention to take over as head coach, with negotiations underway for his release from Al Shabab.</li>
  <li>The club faced challenges in securing high-profile managers, prompting reliance on Mendes once again.</li>
  <li>The decision follows a series of poor results, including a demoralizing defeat to Ipswich Town.</li>
  <li>O’Neil's management troubled by an injury crisis and squad mismanagement.</li>
  <li>Mendes’s influence is expected to rise following O’Neil's departure, marking a potential return to a past approach to recruitment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Even senior figures at Wolves accepted that O’Neil was to a large extent a victim of circumstance.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Wolves aim to rejuvenate their season with Vitor Pereira at the helm, relying on Mendes's connections to secure essential players during the upcoming transfer window.</p>]]></description>

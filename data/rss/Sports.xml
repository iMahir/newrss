<p>India captain Rohit Sharma entertained fans with his commentary on the stump mic, particularly while addressing Yashasvi Jaiswal during the Boxing Day Test against Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma was active in his role, showcasing his leadership and humor on the field.</li>
  <li>He reprimanded Yashasvi Jaiswal for a fielding mistake, jokingly referencing 'gully cricket'.</li>
  <li>Rohit captured attention by dropping Shubman Gill from the Playing XI and opting for two spinners.</li>
  <li>India had a challenging day, with Australia scoring well before Jasprit Bumrah's intervention.</li>
  <li>Rohit made two review errors during the match, which could impact the game's outcome.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Arre Jaisu… gully cricket khel raha hai kya? Neeche baithe reh. Jab tak ball khelega nahi, neeche baithe reh. Uthne ka nahi." - Rohit Sharma</blockquote>
<p>This light-hearted scolding exemplifies Rohit's leadership style and the camaraderie within the team.</p>]]></description>

<p>Teenager Sam Konstas made a remarkable debut in the Boxing Day Test against India, scoring a quick fifty, including two sixes off renowned bowler Jasprit Bumrah.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Konstas scored 60 runs off 65 balls with six fours and two sixes.</li>
  <li>He became the first batter in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to hit a six against Bumrah.</li>
  <li>His aggressive batting style included several ramp shots that disrupted Bumrah's bowling.</li>
  <li>Konstas shared an impressive 89-run partnership with Usman Khawaja.</li>
  <li>His innings was cut short by Ravindra Jadeja, who bowled him out leg-before-wicket.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It was the first six Jasprit Bumrah conceded in Test cricket in nearly four years.”</blockquote>

<p>Ravi Shastri commented on Ravichandran Ashwin's retirement during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, suggesting that Ashwin might have continued playing if he had known that India would field two spinners at the MCG.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashwin retired after one Test in the series citing a lack of need in the Indian XI.</li>
  <li>Shastri believes Ashwin would have stayed if aware of the spin-bowling strategy for the Boxing Day Test.</li>
  <li>Washington Sundar was selected over Shubman Gill, surprising many experts.</li>
  <li>The fourth Test is crucial, with both teams having won one match each.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If Ashwin knew India would play two spinners, he might not have retired,” Ravi Shastri remarked.</blockquote>
<p>This commentary sheds light on the strategic decisions surrounding team selection and how they impact player careers.</p>]]></description>

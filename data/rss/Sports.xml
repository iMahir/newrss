<blockquote>“Obviously, few results have not gone our way and as a captain, it is disappointing. As a batter, a lot of the things I am trying to do are not falling in place. Mentally, look, it is disturbing.”</blockquote>
<p>Rohit's insights reflect the challenges faced by the Indian team and highlight the mental aspects of performance in competitive sports.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Yashasvi Jaiswal's Controversial Dismissal: Simon Taufel's Verdict</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source: December 30, 2024 | <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/">NDTV Sports</a></strong></p>
<img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/r0kh88a_jaiswal_625x300_30_December_24.jpeg" alt="" width="639" height="479"><figcaption>Yashasvi Jaiswal was dismissed in a controversial manner at MCG.</figcaption>
<p>India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal's contentious dismissal sparked a controversy on the final day of the fourth Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Jaiswal was given out caught behind despite no clear edge being shown on the Snicko. The decision was made by third umpire Saikat Sharfuddoula, overturning the on-field umpire's not out call. Jaiswal, batting on 84, argued with the umpires before walking back.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jaiswal was dismissed on 84 after a solid innings of 208 deliveries.</li>
  <li>The dismissal led to chants of "cheater" around the MCG.</li>
  <li>The incident follows a similar controversy in the opening Test in Perth involving opener KL Rahul.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Yeh optical illusion hai." - Sunil Gavaskar questions the third umpire's decision to overrule the Snicko technology.</blockquote>
<p>Former ICC Elite Panel umpire Simon Taufel told Channel 7 that the third umpire made the correct decision to overrule the on-field umpire's not out call based on clear deflection off the bat.</p>
<p>This incident has reignited the debate around the use of technology in making decisions in cricket.</p>]]></description>

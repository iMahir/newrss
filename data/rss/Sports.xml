<p>As the cricketing world anticipates India's squad for the Champions Trophy 2025, former players Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh share their insights on the final 15 players. Their choices suggest notable changes in the team, particularly regarding wicketkeeper and opener selections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Harbhajan Singh advocates for Sanju Samson over Rishabh Pant as the preferred wicketkeeper.</li>
  <li>Virender Sehwag recommends young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal to partner with Rohit Sharma.</li>
  <li>India's selection process is closely tied to performances in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy.</li>
  <li>The final squad is expected to be announced by January 19.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Sanju Samson is my choice. Sanju Samson would be the first-choice," said Harbhajan Singh about the wicketkeeper selection.</blockquote>
<p>With these recommendations, both Sehwag and Harbhajan are contributing to shaping India's lineup ahead of a crucial international tournament.</p>]]></description>

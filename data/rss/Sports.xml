<figcaption><small>Real Madrid has decided to make a surprise signing according to SPORT, citing anonymous sources, which would see a "prodigal" son return to the Bernabeu if the transfer is really completed.</small></figcaption>
<p>Real Madrid is reportedly looking to sign back Rafa Marin, who was sold to Napoli. This potential transfer is part of their ongoing strategy to strengthen the squad amidst injury challenges.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rafa Marin was sold to Napoli for €12 million, with potential increases to €22 million based on conditions.</li>
  <li>The deal included a buyback clause, a common practice for players from Madrid's academy.</li>
  <li>Marin's return could happen as soon as January 2025 due to the club's defensive injuries.</li>
  <li>The buyback clause is structured with escalating costs depending on the timing of the exercise.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Madrid made sure to include a $27.1 million (€25 million) buy back clause which can be exercised in 2026.”</blockquote>
<p>This strategic move indicates Madrid's confidence in Marin's potential and necessity in addressing current team deficiencies.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Cheteshwar Pujara discusses the Indian bowling attack.</figcaption>
<p>As the Boxing Day Test against Australia approaches, veteran Indian batter Cheteshwar Pujara has expressed his worries regarding the bowling line-up's ability to perform effectively in the match.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pujara raises concerns about the Indian bowling's strength, doubting its ability to take 20 wickets.</li>
  <li>He highlights Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj as standouts but notes others have underperformed.</li>
  <li>Pujara questions the team combination and the effectiveness of the supporting bowlers like Nitish Kumar and Ravindra Jadeja.</li>
  <li>He emphasizes the need to improve the bowling attack to win the match.</li>
  <li>Pujara praises Australian bowler Mitchell Starc for his recent performances and warns Indian batters to be cautious against him.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you want to win a Test match, then you have to take 20 wickets, and the ability to take 20 wickets is not that good.” - Cheteshwar Pujara</blockquote>
<p>Pujara's insights underline the potential challenges India may face in delivering a robust bowling performance in the upcoming match against a strong Australian team.</p>]]></description>

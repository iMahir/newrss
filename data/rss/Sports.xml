<p>Jasprit Bumrah showcased his batting skills in a crucial moment for India during the third Test against Australia, helping his team avoid a follow-on with an unbeaten score. His performance drew attention and a witty response from Google India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah scored an unbeaten 10 runs, contributing to a critical 39-run partnership for the 10th wicket.</li>
  <li>His batting skills are highlighted by his record of the most runs in an over in Test history, with 35 runs off Stuart Broad.</li>
  <li>Rahul and Jadeja also played significant roles in India's fightback, scoring 84 and 77 runs, respectively.</li>
  <li>Google India humorously responded to Bumrah’s press conference comments after his batting performance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It's an interesting question. But, you are questioning my batting ability. You should use Google and see who has got the most number of runs in a Test over.” - Jasprit Bumrah</blockquote>
<p>This match showcased Bumrah's all-round capabilities and highlighted the ongoing series dynamics, where he has also excelled as a bowler.</p>]]></description>

<p>The drug Chelsea's Mykhailo Mudryk is alleged to have taken is the same one that led to Maria Sharapova's ban from tennis. Mudryk has been provisionally suspended following a positive drugs test.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mudryk, 23, tested positive for meldonium, a banned performance-enhancing drug.</li>
<li>The World Anti-Doping Agency banned meldonium in 2016, after which Sharapova received a suspension.</li>
<li>Mudryk insisted he never knowingly used the substance and is cooperating with investigations.</li>
<li>If his B-sample also returns positive results, he could face a suspension of 18 months to four years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Mudryk stated, "This has come as a complete shock as I have NEVER knowingly used any banned substances or broken any rules."</blockquote>
<p>The case highlights ongoing concerns about doping in professional sports and its consequences.</p>]]></description>

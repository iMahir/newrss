<p>Indian chess star Tania Sachdev has expressed disappointment over the Delhi government’s lack of recognition for her achievements, stating that such acknowledgment is crucial for inspiring youth and fostering talent development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tania Sachdev is the eighth woman chess grandmaster from India.</li>
<li>She criticized the Delhi government for not recognizing her and other athletes' achievements in chess.</li>
<li>She urged for more support from Delhi's Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leaders.</li>
<li>She highlighted her achievements, including a historic gold medal at the Chess Olympiad in 2024.</li>
<li>Sachdev contrasted the lack of recognition with Tamil Nadu's celebration of chess champion D Gukesh.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Having played for India since 2008 it’s disheartening to see a lack of recognition from the Delhi government for achievements in chess. States that support and celebrate their champions inspire excellence and motivate talent.” — Tania Sachdev</blockquote>
<p>Sachdev's comments reflect a broader issue regarding the recognition and support given to athletes by their respective state governments, potentially impacting the motivation and development of future talent.</p>]]></description>

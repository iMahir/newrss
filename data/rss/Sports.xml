<p>Sanju Samson has been performing exceptionally well in T20 internationals, scoring three centuries in his last five innings. Despite this, he may not be included in India's squad for the Champions Trophy, according to Harbhajan Singh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Samson has a T20I average of 56 and three recent centuries.</li>
<li>His lack of participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy may affect his selection.</li>
<li>Harbhajan Singh believes that performance in one format should be considered for other formats.</li>
<li>Samson's exemplifying performance brings into question the selectors' decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If a person is scoring three centuries in five matches, that means that he is in a zone where he can't be stopped.” - Harbhajan Singh</blockquote>
<p>The discussion around Samson's exclusion raises questions about the criteria utilized for selection, particularly when considering a player's performance in varying formats.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Harry Maguire effect! Man Utd cool interest in Jarrad Branthwaite after £80m ex-captain's renaissance under Ruben Amorim</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A <strong>Source:</strong> Goal.com</p>
<p>Manchester United has decided to reduce their interest in player Jarrad Branthwaite following the impressive resurgence of former captain Harry Maguire under the guidance of coach Ruben Amorim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Harry Maguire has transformed his performance, influencing Manchester United's transfer strategy.</li>
<li>The club is now prioritizing retaining and rediscovering the potential of existing players over new signings.</li>
<li>Branthwaite, a potential target, may no longer fit into United's short-term plans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Maguire's form has brought a newfound confidence to the squad.”</blockquote>
<p>This shift indicates Manchester United's evolving strategy as they navigate player performance and recruitment.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Shakeel, Rizwan fifties lead Pakistan's recovery</figcaption>
<p>In a challenging match at Multan, Jayden Seales, the only fast bowler for West Indies, impressively performed despite adverse conditions favoring spin bowlers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pakistan prepared the pitch to aid spin bowling, but Seales made a strong impact.</li>
<li>The match was delayed by four hours due to fog and cold temperatures.</li>
<li>Seales took key wickets, including Kamran Ghulam and Babar Azam, exhibiting skillful seam movement.</li>
<li>Seales reflected on the importance of building pressure and adapting to conditions specific to Asia.</li>
<li>Despite being the only fast bowler, Seales did not feel pressured and focused on doing his best for the team.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a fast bowler, I always wanted to get a wicket or be in the game and it so happened that I got the wickets for the team today." <cite>Seales after the opening day</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seales showed resilience and adaptability, over-delivering in a setting designed to challenge fast bowlers.</p>]]></description>

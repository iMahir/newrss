<figcaption>Sunil Gavaskar took a brutal dig at Australia and England cricketers after 15 wickets fell on Day 2 of the Sydney Test. (Getty Images via AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Sunil Gavaskar made critical remarks regarding the reaction of Australian and English cricketers to the performance on a challenging Sydney Test pitch, highlighting a disparity in how similar situations are perceived in India.</p>
<ul>
<li>15 wickets fell on Day 2 of the fifth Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test.</li>
<li>Gavaskar stated that any significant wicket loss in India would lead to widespread criticism of pitch conditions.</li>
<li>India's second innings saw Rishabh Pant contributing a quick half-century.</li>
<li>Gavaskar emphasized that Indian players do not complain about pitch conditions compared to their foreign counterparts.</li>
<li>The Sydney pitch was criticized for lacking ideal conditions for Test cricket.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"You'll never find us complaining. But 15 wickets in a day in India, man, there would be hell."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Gavaskar argues for a more balanced view on pitch conditions and criticizes double standards in cricketing discourse.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Jasprit Bumrah probably has a question for upstairs • Getty Images</figcaption>
<p>This article provides an analysis of recent stats from the Australia vs. India Test series, highlighting Bumrah's achievements and Kohli's struggles.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>10:</b> Kohli's single digit scores during the 2024-25 season, joint-most for batting in the top seven.</li>
  <li><b>23.75:</b> Kohli's batting average, the third-lowest for a batter scoring an unbeaten century in a Test series.</li>
  <li><b>29:</b> Balls needed for Pant to score fifty, the second-fastest for India in Test cricket.</li>
  <li><b>60:</b> Runs scored by Pant off the first 30 balls, the second-most in a Test innings.</li>
  <li><b>32:</b> Wickets taken by Bumrah in this series, most for an Indian in an away Test series.</li>
  <li><b>1980:</b> Last instance of both teams bowled out under 200 in their first innings in Sydney.</li>
  <li><b>2:</b> Pace bowlers taking four or more wickets in both innings in a Test match in Sydney since 2001.</li>
  <li><b>39 for 4:</b> Australia's score when Beau Webster came out to bat, a historic challenge.</li>
  <li><b>36.22:</b> Partnership average of Jaiswal and Rahul, the lowest by a pair that also shared a double-century stand.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Statistics show the stark contrast in form between Bumrah and Kohli, especially in high-stakes matches.</blockquote>
<p>The recent performances reflect significant disparities in player contributions and suggest potential challenges for Kohli moving forward in his career.</p>]]></description>

<p>D Gukesh has made history by becoming the youngest-ever world chess champion, defeating Ding Liren to claim the title. His trainer, Grzegorz Gajewski, likened him to Magnus Carlsen, while asserting that Gukesh will never play like the Norwegian.</p>
<ul>
<li>D Gukesh, at 18, becomes the youngest world chess champion.</li>
<li>His victory against Ding Liren marks a significant achievement for Indian chess.</li>
<li>Trainer Grzegorz Gajewski believes Gukesh can mimic Carlsen's style but not embody it.</li>
<li>Gukesh prefers calculation and depth over intuition in his gameplay.</li>
<li>Former champion Magnus Carlsen had a mixed response to Gukesh's win.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“He will never be a player like Magnus Carlsen in the sense of being an intuitive kind of a player,” said Grzegorz Gajewski.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Gukesh's training and achievements position him as a rising star in chess, the comparison to Carlsen is complex and reflects differing playing styles.</p>]]></description>

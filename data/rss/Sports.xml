<figcaption>Rishabh Pant had stitched a 88-run partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal to provide the team with some hope before India collapsed after Tea (HT_PRINT)</figcaption>
<p>India is expected to make changes to their playing XI as they aim to save the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in the upcoming match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Rishabh Pant's poor performance may lead to his exclusion from the team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Akash Deep is likely out of the Sydney Test due to a back injury.</li>
<li>Rishabh Pant has faced criticism for his recent batting displays, scoring only 154 runs in seven innings at an average of 22.</li>
<li>The team may rely on Dhruv Jurel if Pant is benched, who has had limited game time in this series.</li>
<li>Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma are deliberating over team changes to improve performance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Stupid, stupid, stupid,” commented Sunil Gavaskar on Pant's dismissals at the MCG, highlighting the pressure on the young player.</blockquote>
<p>The decision to change the lineup reflects India's struggles in the current Test series and may impact their approach to future games as they seek to regain momentum.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma faced intense criticism following India's defeat to Australia in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with former cricketer Basit Ali questioning Sharma's captaincy decisions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma's decision to open batting despite poor form was criticized, affecting the team's confidence.</li>
  <li>Basit Ali highlighted the detrimental impact on KL Rahul after demoting him in favor of Sharma.</li>
  <li>Criticism extended to Gautam Gambhir for his game management decisions.</li>
  <li>Rohit and Virat Kohli were both dismissed cheaply, contributing to the team's struggles.</li>
  <li>Ali suggested a captaincy change for the final Test, proposing Jasprit Bumrah take over leadership.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“One decision: 'I will open', that affected India. You (Rohit) completely shattered the confidence of the team,” said Basit Ali.</blockquote>
<p>Ali's remarks underscore the dissatisfaction with Rohit Sharma's leadership and decision-making during a critical match, calling for immediate changes in captaincy and strategy.</p>]]></description>

<img width="639" height="479" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/71r3l8g_jaiswal-mcg_625x300_30_December_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" title="Australia, Umpires Labelled &quot;Cheaters&quot; By MCG Crowd For Yashasvi Jaiswal DRS Drama. Video Viral">
<figcaption>Chants of 'cheaters' rang around the ground as Yashasvi Jaiswal was given out.</figcaption>
<p>The controversy surrounding Yashasvi Jaiswal's dismissal during the Boxing Day Test has sparked widespread debate, particularly over a contentious third umpire decision that led to 'cheater' chants from the crowd.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaiswal was initially given not out on a caught-behind appeal but was overturned by the third umpire.</li>
<li>The decision was made without any spike detected on the Snicko technology.</li>
<li>India lost the match by 184 runs after a late collapse following Jaiswal's dismissal at 84 runs.</li>
<li>The incident has reignited discussions about the reliability of DRS (Decision Review System) in cricket.</li>
<li>A record crowd of 74,362 attended the match at the MCG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The crowd is not having it. Been chanting non-stop for 10 mins now — Gaurav Kapur</blockquote>
<p>This incident has raised questions about umpiring standards and the impact of technology in cricket, particularly during high-stakes matches like the Boxing Day Test.</p>]]></description>

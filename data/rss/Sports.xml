<p>Legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar expressed his disapproval of Rishabh Pant's shot selection, calling it 'stupid'. He criticized Pant for prioritizing ego over strategy during a critical moment in the Boxing Day Test.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gavaskar was upset with Pant's risky ramp shot during the match.</li>
<li>He suggested the shot was a result of ego rather than situational awareness.</li>
<li>Gavaskar expressed concerns about Pant trying to assert dominance instead of playing strategically.</li>
<li>He acknowledged Pant's talent but questioned the need for such a high-risk shot.</li>
<li>Gavaskar emphasized the importance of playing conventional cricketing strokes for success.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“When I see somebody as talented as Rishabh Pant play that shot, I had no problem with the first shot he played and missed. The reason I got upset was that ego took over for the next ball.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Gavaskar advocates for Pant to rely on his conventional skills rather than taking unnecessary risks in crucial matches.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Marnus Labuschagne (AP Photo)</figcaption>
<p>Marnus Labuschagne, Australia's top scorer, expressed concerns about the inconsistent bounce of the MCG pitch, significantly impacting India’s chase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia concluded day four at 228 for 9, leading India by 333 runs.</li>
<li>Lower order contributions from Pat Cummins (41), Nathan Lyon (41 not out), and Scott Boland (10 not out) were crucial.</li>
<li>Labuschagne scored the highest individual run of 70 for Australia.</li>
<li>He noted the increased difficulty for batsmen with deliveries skidding through and hitting the stumps.</li>
<li>Labuschagne remained non-committal about Australia's declaration plans for the next day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The seam movement's probably been the same. But just the amount of bounce is significantly lower. So that makes for pretty tricky batting there.”</blockquote>
<p>The lower order players received praise from Labuschagne for their performances under pressure, noting their resilience as key to Australia’s current position.</p>]]></description>

<p>Indian cricketer Virat Kohli arrived in Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test and had a tense exchange with the media regarding their filming practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kohli was irritated over perceived filming of his family at the airport.</li>
<li>A Channel 7 reporter clarified that the situation arose from a misunderstanding.</li>
<li>Kohli emphasized his need for privacy concerning his children, stating, “With my kids I need some privacy, you can’t film without asking me.”</li>
<li>The misunderstanding was resolved when it was confirmed that his children were not being filmed.</li>
<li>Kohli's recent performance has been mixed, scoring a century in the first Test but only 26 runs in his other innings.</li>
<li>The Border-Gavaskar series is tied 1-1 going into the fourth Test at the MCG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It was upon seeing the waiting cameras that Kohli became a little heated over what is largely a misunderstanding when he thought the media was filming him with his children,” reported Channel 7.</blockquote>
<p>The incident highlights ongoing tensions between celebrities and media privacy norms.</p>]]></description>

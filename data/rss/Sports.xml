            <description><![CDATA[<h1>BCCI Implements Staff Ban to Promote Discipline Among Cricketers</h1>

<figcaption>Reason Behind BCCI's 'Staff' Ban.</figcaption>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has introduced a ban on families and personal staff accompanying players during tours, following a disappointing Test series against Australia. This decision, part of a new 10-point policy, aims to enhance discipline within the team.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The BCCI's policy is introduced to counteract the growing 'star culture' among players.</li>
  <li>Head coach Gautam Gambhir advocated for stricter regulations on personal staff for players.</li>
  <li>The BCCI has sanctioned only a two-week allowance for families to accompany players on overseas tours.</li>
  <li>Violations of this policy can result in disciplinary action, including sanctions and deductions in fees.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Such practices have a negative impact on the team,” said a BCCI source.</blockquote>
<p>This move is seen as part of BCCI's ongoing efforts to unify the team and promote a more disciplined environment.</p>]]></description>

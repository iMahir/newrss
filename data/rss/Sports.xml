<figcaption>Sanju Samson’s absence from the Vijay Hazare Trophy has raised concerns ahead of the Champions Trophy selection.</figcaption>
<p>As the national selectors prepare to choose the ODI team for the series against England and the ICC Champions Trophy, the BCCI is set to investigate Sanju Samson's decision to skip the Vijay Hazare Trophy. This absence could affect his selection chances.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BCCI displeased with Samson's non-participation in a critical domestic tournament.</li>
  <li>Kerala Cricket Association did not include him due to his unavailability for the preparatory camp.</li>
  <li>Selecting the Champions Trophy squad is crucial, and selectors seek a valid reason for his absence.</li>
  <li>In the past, players lost central contracts for similar reasons, raising the stakes for participation in domestic cricket.</li>
  <li>Samson is competing for one of the wicketkeeper spots against Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, and Dhruv Jurel.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The selectors would want a valid reason. Otherwise, it will be difficult to consider him for the ODI season."</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of this investigation may shape the selectors' decisions, especially regarding the balance of the squad if Rahul is unfit.</p>]]></description>

<p>In light of India's disappointing performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, there have been strong calls for senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to participate in the upcoming Ranji Trophy to regain form. However, former cricketer Mohammad Kaif suggests that fatigue and upcoming international commitments may prevent their participation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli and Rohit face criticism for their absence in domestic cricket.</li>
  <li>India suffered a 1-3 series loss against Australia, marking a significant setback.</li>
  <li>Kaif describes India as "white-ball bullies," emphasizing the need for a robust Test team.</li>
  <li>Kohli's average in Test has dropped significantly since 2022, adding pressure for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"On 23rd February India will earn a lot of praise by beating Pakistan... but if India wants to win the World Test Championship then they will have to make a Test match team." - Mohammad Kaif</blockquote>
<p>The current domestic hiatus for Kohli and Rohit has drawn a lot of attention and criticism, as both players need to adapt and prepare better for upcoming international challenges. Their involvement in the Ranji Trophy could be crucial for their development and the future of Indian Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

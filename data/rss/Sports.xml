<p>Rohit Sharma's absence from the playing XI in Sydney signals a potential shift in the Indian cricket team's direction, as selectors look beyond him for future red-ball cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma was not included in the team for the Sydney Test, suggesting a significant change in the selectors' strategy post-Australia tour.</li>
  <li>Head coach Gautam Gambhir and the selectors communicated their plan, indicating a transition in leadership with upcoming series.</li>
  <li>Rohit's recent performance raised concerns, leading to a decision to rest him amidst struggles with the bat.</li>
  <li>Stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah addressed the team’s unity during the toss, acknowledging Rohit’s choice to rest.</li>
  <li>Former players anticipate this may mark Rohit's last Test as selectorial decisions lean towards younger talent for future events including the Champions Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think it probably means that (if) India don’t qualify for the WTC final, the Melbourne Test will be Rohit Sharma’s last game.” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>The decision regarding Rohit Sharma's role in the team reflects a broader strategy of transitioning to new players, signaling an ending of an era in Indian Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 03, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>

<figcaption>Ravi Shastri and Jasprit Bumrah at toss of Sydney Test</figcaption>
<p>Former Indian cricket coach Ravi Shastri shared insights on why he didn't immediately inquire about Rohit Sharma's absence at the toss for the Sydney Test. This match was crucial as India was down 1-2 and needed a win to retain the trophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and chose to bat, revealing Rohit Sharma had opted out of the match.</li>
<li>Shastri didn't ask about Rohit's absence right at the toss, focusing instead on team composition.</li>
<li>Bumrah stated, "Our captain has shown his leadership; he's opted to rest in this game," affirming team unity.</li>
<li>Criticism arose from former batter Sanjay Manjrekar regarding Shastri's approach at the toss.</li>
<li>Shastri suggested that Rohit might consider retiring from Test cricket if his form does not improve.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"It's not that India don't have youngsters. There are very, very good players in the wings and it's time to build." - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the decision by Rohit Sharma to sit out was seen as a sign of strong leadership, but it also sparked discussions about his future in the format.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian cricket team reportedly failed to bond together, even after a crucial victory, leading to concerns about team dynamics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Indian team has been struggling with unity since their arrival in Australia.</li>
  <li>Despite a significant win in Perth, players split into smaller groups for meals and celebrations.</li>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir, the head coach, remained in his hotel room while the team did not embrace a collective celebratory moment.</li>
  <li>Rohit Sharma has opted to rest from the final Test, heightening tensions with coach Gambhir.</li>
  <li>Performance issues were evident, with Sharma's poor run contributing to the decision to sit out.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They didn’t hang around in the dressing room to have a drink or even step out for a meal together.”</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing disconnect in the team raises questions about future performance and unity going forward.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rishabh Pant faced a challenging day during the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the SCG, where he was struck by rapid deliveries from Mitchell Starc, resulting in significant bruising.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pant was hit on the arm by a sharp bouncer from Starc clocking 140 km/h, leaving a noticeable bruise.</li>
  <li>Subsequently, a delivery reaching 144.6 km/h struck Pant's helmet.</li>
  <li>The incident occurred during the 35th over of India's innings.</li>

<p>Rohit Sharma's decision to rest himself may signal the end of his Test career, as experts speculate that he could retire following the current series.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sunil Gavaskar suggests the Boxing Day Test could be Sharma's last if India doesn't qualify for the World Test Championship final.</li>
  <li>Shastri believes Sharma may end his Test career based on this decision, highlighting his recent struggles with form.</li>
  <li>Rohit has not surpassed the 20-run mark in six of his last eight Test innings.</li>
  <li>India must win the final Test to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and stay in contention for the WTC final.</li>
  <li>Critics like Mark Taylor argue that Sharma's absence indicates he was dropped due to poor performance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If there was a home season coming up he might've thought of carrying on, but I think he might just pull the plug at the end of this Test.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>The future of Rohit Sharma in Test cricket remains uncertain as discussions intensify surrounding his performance and potential retirement.</p>]]></description>

<p>Amid criticism, Rishabh Pant coped several blows to his body, steering India to 107/4 at Tea on Day 1 of the 5th Test against Australia in Sydney. Pant was unbeaten on 32 off 80 balls while Jadeja was batting alongside him on 50.</p>
<ul>
<li>India suffered a significant blow with Virat Kohli's dismissal, caught in the slips.</li>
<li>At Tea, India is at 107/4 with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja at the crease.</li>
<li>Scott Boland has taken 2 wickets for Australia, emerging as the pick of the bowlers.</li>
<li>Rohit Sharma opted out of this Test, with Jasprit Bumrah as stand-in captain.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It still is a brave call for a captain to own up and say, 'I'm prepared to take the bench in this game.'” – Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>India will need to build on the current partnership to recover from a shaky start.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>FIDE's Sutovsky gave his own version after the firefighting was over and Magnus Carlsen had been successfully coaxed to play in the World Blitz Championship. (FIDE)</figcaption>
<p>FIDE CEO Emil Sutovsky has openly criticized Magnus Carlsen for his comments regarding Viswanathan Anand's fitness for his role in the chess governing body. The conflict escalated as Sutovsky also took aim at popular chess streamers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sutovsky criticized Carlsen's remarks about Anand, calling them inappropriate.</li>
  <li>He accused certain platforms of downplaying the situation surrounding Carlsen's statements.</li>
  <li>Sutovsky emphasized the 'entire PR strategy' at play in the ongoing disputes.</li>
  <li>Carlsen responded, deeming Sutovsky unreasonable and highlighted his good rapport with FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich instead.</li>
</ul>

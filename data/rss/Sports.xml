            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Selection questions loom for Australia ahead of important Boxing Day Test</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Unknown</p>
<p>Australia's top three batsmen have struggled in recent matches, raising questions about their selection ahead of the upcoming Test.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Usman Khawaja, Nathan McSweeney, and Marnus Labuschagne have not performed well against the new ball.</li>
  <li>Khawaja averages just 12.6, McSweeney 14.4, and Labuschagne 16.4.</li>
  <li>Skipper Pat Cummins defends their performances, highlighting their ability to face a substantial number of deliveries.</li>
  <li>The middle-order has benefited from the top three's efforts, allowing players like Travis Head and Steve Smith to score freely.</li>
  <li>There's uncertainty whether Australia will stick with the current line-up for upcoming Tests.</li>
  <li>Potential alternative, Sam Konstas, has shown good form recently.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think the trend in world cricket pretty much all around the world is the top three is a really hard place to bat at the moment.” - Pat Cummins</blockquote>
<p>With concerns over the top order's performance, Australia may consider changes ahead of critical matches in the series.</p>]]></description>

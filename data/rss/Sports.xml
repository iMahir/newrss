<p>Manchester United, currently 15th in the Premier League, has seen a rise in optimism among fans due to manager Ruben Amorim's implementation of a new style of play. Recent comments from Amorim about the need for leadership in the squad have sparked notable improvements, particularly from Harry Maguire, who has responded positively to these challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruben Amorim seeks more leaders in the Man Utd dressing room.</li>
<li>Harry Maguire recently had his contract option extended and has shown improved performances.</li>
<li>Maguire is now viewed as a leader again under Amorim's guidance.</li>
<li>Amorim emphasizes Maguire's change in self-perception as key to his revival.</li>
<li>Despite past adversity, Maguire has regained his place as an integral player.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You can see now the way he plays is different. He feels like a more important player in the team and as a leader, I feel he’s a leader again.” – Ruben Amorim</blockquote>
<p>This turnaround by Maguire not only enhances his own career but also serves as an example for his teammates, highlighting the potential for growth and resilience within the squad.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Sarfaraz Ahmed with Babar Azam during Champions Trophy 2017.(Twitter/@ICC)</figcaption>
<p>Former Pakistani cricketer Basit Ali has proposed that Sarfaraz Ahmed be appointed as a mentor for the Pakistan team during their upcoming Champions Trophy match against India, drawing on his experience from the 2017 victory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pakistan will host the Champions Trophy, with India playing their matches in Dubai due to security concerns.</li>
<li>The last time Pakistan won against India in an ICC tournament was in 2021.</li>
<li>Basit Ali emphasized the need for a mentor like Sarfaraz to help break the losing streak against India.</li>
<li>Sarfaraz's mentorship is seen as crucial for their February 23 match against India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Afghanistan appointed the great Younis Khan as mentor, who is a good choice. People in Pakistan must be sleeping, so is the board.” - Basit Ali</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, appointing Sarfaraz Ahmed as a mentor could provide valuable insight and experience for Pakistan as they face a challenging clash against India in the Champions Trophy.</p>]]></description>

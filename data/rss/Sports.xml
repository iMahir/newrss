<p>Following India's 1-3 loss to Australia in a Test series, criticism has been directed toward coach Gautam Gambhir. In the wake of this, cricketers Nitish and Harshit Rana issued similar statements in defense of Gambhir, but former player Aakash Chopra commented that their posts resembled outputs from Chat GPT.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir faced heavy criticism after India's poor performance in the Test series.</li>
  <li>Former cricketer Manoj Tiwary termed Gambhir a 'hypocrite' in his criticism.</li>
  <li>Nitish and Harshit Rana expressed support for Gambhir, but their posts were strikingly similar.</li>
  <li>Aakash Chopra remarked that the two posts seemed like they were generated by Chat GPT.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If you look at it, it looks like a Chat GPT product. There are many similarities in both statements, or someone wrote them and sent them to post on social media." - Aakash Chopra</blockquote>
<p>Despite a strong start to Gambhir's tenure, India has struggled in the Tests, raising questions about the team's performance and his coaching capabilities.</p>]]></description>

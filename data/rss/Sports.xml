<figcaption>Basit Ali takes a dig at Jason Gillespie after his resignation as head coach of the Pakistan cricket team.</figcaption>
<p>Former cricketer Basit Ali has criticized Jason Gillespie following his resignation as Pakistan's head coach, suggesting that it was a calculated move to enhance his career prospects.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jason Gillespie resigned after the PCB did not review Tim Nielsen's contract.</li>
    <li>Gillespie's departure coincides with Pakistan's upcoming Test series against South Africa.</li>
    <li>Basit Ali claims Gillespie's resignation helps him in building his CV.</li>
    <li>He speculated that Gillespie and Nielsen would receive offers from IPL teams.</li>
    <li>Basit humorously commented on the preference for foreign coaches in Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "When Mickey Arthur was removed, people said that perhaps there would be no foreign coaches in Pakistan. Now, when these two have stepped down, you will see that they will get offers from other countries and franchises." - Basit Ali
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Basit Ali's remarks highlight concerns over coaching transitions in Pakistan cricket and the perceived benefits foreign coaches enjoy, suggesting a potential trend of foreign expertise in leadership roles. </p>]]></description>

<p>Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has advised Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah to focus on shorter formats of cricket to manage his fitness better and prolong his career amid concerns over his injury history.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Akhtar suggests that Test cricket's physical demands may strain Bumrah's fitness, advising him to focus on shorter formats.</li>
    <li>He highlights Bumrah's effectiveness in limited-overs cricket, particularly in death overs and powerplay situations.</li>
    <li>With 185 wickets in 42 Tests, Akhtar believes Bumrah has the potential to be an elite fast bowler but warns of recurring injuries hindering his Test career.</li>
    <li>He emphasizes the importance of increasing pace for success in Test cricket while acknowledging the risk of injury associated with it.</li>
    <li>Akhtar stresses that Bumrah must consider his future, balancing responsibilities in IPL, ODIs, and Tests.</li>

<blockquote>
    "Bad (on his financial condition). But the manner in which my wife has handled everything, hats off to her. [Sunil] Gavaskar was the first to react (to Kapil Dev's offer). Sure, I have no hesitation (to enter rehab), because until I have my family with me, I'm not afraid of anything, anybody. I will complete it and return. I will come back," Kambli said on Vickey Lalwani's YouTube channel.
</blockquote>

<p>New Zealand cricketer Kane Williamson faced an unusual dismissal during the first day of the third Test against England, which has since gone viral due to his reaction.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Kane Williamson was well set on 44 runs when he made an error attempting to block a delivery from Matthew Potts.</li>
    <li>The ball bounced and he inadvertently kicked it onto the stumps, resulting in his dismissal.</li>
    <li>This mistake was pivotal as it led to New Zealand losing three wickets for just 34 runs.</li>
    <li>Despite Williamson’s dismissal, New Zealand finished Day 1 at a reasonable score of 315/9.</li>
    <li>Tom Latham contributed with a half-century, scoring 63 runs, while Mitchell Santner provided a quick 50 late in the innings.</li>
    <li>Matthew Potts achieved three wickets, and his partner Gus Atkinson also took three, making history in his debut year.</li>
    <li>Both teams are currently out of contention for the World Test Championship finals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Australian cricketers recently weighed in on the debate between Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, declaring Ashwin as the tougher bowler to face due to his tactical brilliance and adaptability.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ashwin is noted for his mastery of variations and ability to exploit turn.</li>
    <li>Travis Head and other Australian players praised Ashwin's skills over Jadeja's accuracy.</li>
    <li>Steve Smith highlighted Ashwin's exceptional adaptability across different pitches.</li>
    <li>Players like Josh Hazlewood and Usman Khawaja acknowledged Ashwin's cleverness and competitive nature.</li>
    <li>Cameron Green emphasized how Ashwin and Jadeja complement each other's skills.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Probably for me, Ashwin, someone with a couple more tricks and being a lot taller and a lot quicker. Yeah, I think he's probably the hardest," - Travis Head.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"I think what makes them great is that they just complement each other. Ashwin, he's always feels like he's one step ahead." - Cameron Green.</blockquote>
<p>The consensus among Australian players suggests that while both spinners are formidable, Ashwin's psychological edge and varied approach make him the more difficult opponent in the eyes of the cricketers.]]></description>

<p>Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden expressed surprise at Rohit Sharma's bold decision to bowl first on the opening day of the Gabba Test, given that the pitch conditions seemed more suited for batting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hayden was taken aback by Rohit's toss decision, stating that the pitch favored batters.</li>
    <li>He noted that the groundsman had likely prepared the pitch earlier due to recent rain, affecting its behavior.</li>
    <li>India's bowlers struggled against Australia, who ended the day at 28/0 in 13.2 overs.</li>
    <li>Hayden believes that the pitch will deteriorate over the next couple of days, making spinners more effective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I was really surprised that actually, Rohit won the toss and decided to bowl, because I felt like it was over-prepared... Almost 12 inches of rain in the past two weeks." - Matthew Hayden</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Hayden emphasized that opting to bat first would have been a wiser choice, considering the expected changes in pitch conditions over the course of the match.]]></description>

<figcaption>Ruslan Ponomariov or D Gukesh, who is the youngest chess world champion?</figcaption>
<p>Former FIDE champion Ruslan Ponomariov, who won his title in 2002, is often overshadowed by D Gukesh, the current undisputed youngest world champion. This article explores the historical context and implications of their respective victories.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ponomariov became the FIDE World Champion in 2002 at just 18 years old, making him the youngest to do so at the time.</li>
    <li>The chess world saw a split between the classical title and the FIDE title from 1993 to 2006, leading to two recognized champions.</li>
    <li>D Gukesh became the youngest undisputed FIDE world champion at 18 years and six months.</li>
    <li>Ponomariov's victory is often not recognized as Undisputed, which is key for the title debate.</li>
    <li>Despite the split, Ponomariov continued to have a successful career, remaining active in high-level competitions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Ever since 1993, there have been two titles, the phoney one controlled and organised by FIDE and the real one organised outside FIDE’s control.” - IM David Levy</blockquote>
<p>In summary, while D Gukesh is officially recognized as the youngest world champion, Ruslan Ponomariov's achievement in a challenging format highlights the complexities of chess titles during a divided era in the sport.]]></description>

<p>In the third Test against Australia at the Gabba, Indian captain Rohit Sharma opted to bowl first under cloudy conditions. However, Jasprit Bumrah expressed his frustration over the lack of swing during the early overs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rohit Sharma chose to bowl first despite expectations of a favorable pitch for fast bowlers.</li>
    <li>Bumrah was heard on the stump microphone saying, "Nahin ho raha swing aise bhi; kahin bhi kar lo", indicating the ball was not swinging.</li>
    <li>The first day was disrupted by rain, with only 13.2 overs bowled, leaving Australia at 28 for 0 by the end.</li>
    <li>Indian bowlers experimented with different lines but failed to get swing or seam movement.</li>
    <li>Former players and commentators expressed concerns about the decision to bowl first at the Gabba, citing historical context.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"You bat at the Gabba. If you face Australia, you want them to bat second and fourth." - Kerry O'Keeffe</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights ongoing challenges for India in the Test series and raises questions about their bowling strategy in conditions that did not provide the expected advantages.</p>]]></description>

<p>A viral video featuring Australian cricket team members describing Virat Kohli resulted in backlash from Indian fans, particularly regarding Pat Cummins' one-word response.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pat Cummins described Virat Kohli simply as "batter," drawing criticism from fans.</li>
    <li>Other Australian players praised Kohli with terms like "superstar," "classy," and "freak."</li>
    <li>The video has caused social media outrage, with users calling for Cummins' "downfall."</li>
    <li>Kohli's performance in 2024 has been inconsistent, with only 373 runs in 8 Tests and an average of 26.64.</li>
    <li>India needs to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to qualify for the World Test Championship final in 2025.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“Need Pat Cummins' downfall” — User on social media</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Not going to lie, this is becoming quite cringe now” — User on social media</blockquote>

<p>Despite receiving harsh words from Cummins, Kohli's contribution in crucial matches will be vital for India's future successes.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rain disrupted Day 1 of the third Test between India and Australia at the Gabba, allowing only 13.2 overs of play. The highlight was a moment captured on the stump mic featuring Jasprit Bumrah expressing his frustration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl first under overcast conditions.</li>
    <li>Jasprit Bumrah struggled to find swing and indicated to Shubman Gill during play that the ball wasn't swinging as expected.</li>
    <li>Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney faced the Indian bowlers comfortably, contributing to Australia's score of 28/0 before rain halted play.</li>
    <li>The play is scheduled to resume with adjusted timings at 5:20 AM IST, contingent on weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Nahi ho raha swing aise bhi (The ball isn't swinging),” Jasprit Bumrah expressed to Shubman Gill after his delivery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As both teams prepare for the resumption, memories of India's historic win at the Gabba in 2020-21 loom large, with Rishabh Pant sharing his positive outlook about returning to the venue.</p>]]></description>

<p>The BCCI has requested an extension from the ICC for announcing India's squad for the Champions Trophy, which was initially scheduled for January 12, in order to finalize their selection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The announcement delay stems from the BCCI's request for more time to finalize the squad.</li>
<li>Teams were expected to name provisional squads five weeks before the tournament, but the BCCI is citing recent commitments in Australia.</li>
<li>The new date for announcing the squad is likely January 19, one month before the tournament starts.</li>
<li>The provisional squad is expected to see mostly the same players as those in the ODI series against England.</li>
<li>India's T20I squad against England is also expected to be announced shortly.</li>
<li>A review meeting will involve BCCI officials, captain Rohit Sharma, and coach Gautam Gambhir.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The BCCI aims to finalize the squad while addressing recent performance issues after a disappointing series against Australia.</blockquote>
<p>The BCCI's careful planning aims to ensure that the squad is well-prepared following recent overseas matches, indicating a strategic approach to the upcoming Champions Trophy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Hear the story of a former Indian cricketer who represented Tamil Nadu before love forced him to leave the country</figcaption>
<p>This article tells the inspiring story of Mahalingam Venkatesan, an Indian cricketer whose pursuit of love led him to South Africa, despite facing numerous challenges including a ban from playing cricket there. With resilience and determination, he transformed his life and career, eventually becoming a successful entrepreneur.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mali met his wife, a South African-Indian, in 1983 and pursued her to South Africa, risking his cricket career.</li>
  <li>He played for local teams in South Africa but was eventually banned due to visa complications.</li>
  <li>After returning to India, he faced a serious injury that hampered his cricketing career.</li>
  <li>He later found success in the restaurant business in South Africa, building a substantial fortune.</li>
  <li>Mali now enjoys a happy life with his wife and children, reminiscing about his cricketing past and his journey.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I have no regrets today. I came here and started three restaurants. My net worth was about two million Rand." - Mahalingam Venkatesan</blockquote>
<p>Mali's story is a testament to following one's heart, overcoming adversity, and the unexpected paths that can lead to success.</p>]]></description>

<p>Manchester United is reportedly determined to sign Paris Saint-Germain's outcast, Randal Kolo Muani, this winter as they seek to reinforce their attack.</p>
<ul>
  <li>With Marcus Rashford likely leaving, United is in dire need of attacking options.</li>
  <li>Kolo Muani is seen as a potentially attainable target after falling out of favor at PSG.</li>
  <li>Manchester United aims to secure him on an initial loan with an option to buy.</li>
  <li>Competition from clubs like Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Tottenham adds complexity.</li>
  <li>Kolo Muani has a history of success at Nantes and Frankfurt but struggled at PSG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“United are determined to do everything possible to land the 26-year-old this winter.” - Florian Plettenberg</blockquote>
<p>The push to acquire Kolo Muani reflects United's strategy to strengthen their squad amid ongoing challenges in their attacking lineup.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Barcelona could be set to 'exile' star midfielder Frenkie De Jong following ongoing issues during contract negotiations.</figcaption>
<p>Barcelona is facing a crucial time during the January transfer window, with ongoing contract negotiations for Frenkie De Jong. De Jong's contract runs until summer 2026, and the club is desperate for cash due to financial struggles. If he does not agree to a new contract or transfer, he may be 'exiled' from the team.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Barcelona struggling with off-field issues during the January transfer window.</li>
  <li>De Jong's contract negotiation has faced silence from the player.</li>
  <li>High-profile players like Ronald Araujo may also leave.</li>
  <li>De Jong is among the top earners at Barcelona, with a weekly salary of €365,385.</li>
  <li>Flick may not rely on De Jong, with younger players ahead in the selection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the 27-year-old fails to leave the club or sign an extension he could be exiled from the squad”</blockquote>
<p>This situation underscores Barcelona's challenging financial predicament and their need to make tough decisions regarding player contracts and squad management.</p>]]></description>

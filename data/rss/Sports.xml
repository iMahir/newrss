<p>The BCCI is set to hold a meeting with Gautam Gambhir and Chief Selector Ajit Agarkar to discuss the future of star players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after recent disappointing performances in international cricket.</p>
<ul>
<li>The upcoming meeting will review the recent tour to Australia and performances against New Zealand.</li>
<li>Concerns are growing about Kohli and Rohit's diminishing returns at the crease.</li>
<li>Selectors will also discuss team composition for the upcoming Champions Trophy in the UAE.</li>
<li>Questions remain over whether to transition younger players now or wait until after the next ICC event.</li>
<li>Kohli and Rohit's performances in the upcoming ODI Champions Trophy could be crucial for their futures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Both Kohli and Rohit have played just three ODIs in 2024 after the World Cup, which might be too light of a sample size to make a final call on their careers."</blockquote>
<p>This meeting will also include a review of the Gamir-led coaching staff's performance and strategies moving forward.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>BCCI Takes Shock U-Turn On KL Rahul Selection In India Squad For England ODIs: Report © BCCI/Sportzpics</figcaption>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reversed its decision regarding KL Rahul's participation in the upcoming ODI series against England. Initially resting him, the board has now requested his availability as they aim to provide him with match practice ahead of the Champions Trophy in February.</p>
<ul>
    <li>BCCI had initially agreed to KL Rahul's break from the ODI assignment.</li>
    <li>Recent developments show the board now wants him available for selection.</li>
    <li>Rahul's performance in the Test series in Australia was notable, being the third-highest run-getter for India.</li>
    <li>Competition for the wicketkeeper batter's slot includes Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson.</li>
    <li>The board is seeking an extension from the ICC for the Champions Trophy squad announcement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The selectors initially decided to rest Rahul… However, they had a rethink and the BCCI has now asked him to play…”</blockquote>
<p>This change signifies the BCCI's emphasis on Rahul's performance potential and readiness for future tournaments, demonstrating a dynamic approach to player management.</p>]]></description>

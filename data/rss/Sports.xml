<figcaption>India's captain Rohit Sharma with teammates Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja</figcaption>
<p>The BCCI has requested an extension from the ICC for announcing India's squad for the Champions Trophy, which was initially scheduled for January 12, in order to finalize their selection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The announcement delay stems from the BCCI's request for more time to finalize the squad.</li>
<li>Teams were expected to name provisional squads five weeks before the tournament, but the BCCI is citing recent commitments in Australia.</li>
<li>The new date for announcing the squad is likely January 19, one month before the tournament starts.</li>
<li>The provisional squad is expected to see mostly the same players as those in the ODI series against England.</li>
<li>India's T20I squad against England is also expected to be announced shortly.</li>
<li>A review meeting will involve BCCI officials, captain Rohit Sharma, and coach Gautam Gambhir.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The BCCI aims to finalize the squad while addressing recent performance issues after a disappointing series against Australia.</blockquote>
<p>The BCCI's careful planning aims to ensure that the squad is well-prepared following recent overseas matches, indicating a strategic approach to the upcoming Champions Trophy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Hear the story of a former Indian cricketer who represented Tamil Nadu before love forced him to leave the country</figcaption>
<p>This article tells the inspiring story of Mahalingam Venkatesan, an Indian cricketer whose pursuit of love led him to South Africa, despite facing numerous challenges including a ban from playing cricket there. With resilience and determination, he transformed his life and career, eventually becoming a successful entrepreneur.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mali met his wife, a South African-Indian, in 1983 and pursued her to South Africa, risking his cricket career.</li>
  <li>He played for local teams in South Africa but was eventually banned due to visa complications.</li>
  <li>After returning to India, he faced a serious injury that hampered his cricketing career.</li>
  <li>He later found success in the restaurant business in South Africa, building a substantial fortune.</li>
  <li>Mali now enjoys a happy life with his wife and children, reminiscing about his cricketing past and his journey.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I have no regrets today. I came here and started three restaurants. My net worth was about two million Rand." - Mahalingam Venkatesan</blockquote>
<p>Mali's story is a testament to following one's heart, overcoming adversity, and the unexpected paths that can lead to success.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Critics Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik have expressed their doubts concerning the match's quality and format.</li>

<p>Manchester United is reportedly determined to sign Paris Saint-Germain's outcast, Randal Kolo Muani, this winter as they seek to reinforce their attack.</p>
<ul>
  <li>With Marcus Rashford likely leaving, United is in dire need of attacking options.</li>
  <li>Kolo Muani is seen as a potentially attainable target after falling out of favor at PSG.</li>
  <li>Manchester United aims to secure him on an initial loan with an option to buy.</li>
  <li>Competition from clubs like Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Tottenham adds complexity.</li>
  <li>Kolo Muani has a history of success at Nantes and Frankfurt but struggled at PSG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“United are determined to do everything possible to land the 26-year-old this winter.” - Florian Plettenberg</blockquote>
<p>The push to acquire Kolo Muani reflects United's strategy to strengthen their squad amid ongoing challenges in their attacking lineup.</p>]]></description>

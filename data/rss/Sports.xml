<img width="639" height="479" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/mnhb7908_ravindra-jadeja-afp_625x300_28_December_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" title="India vs Australia 4th Test, Day 3 Live Updates: India's Condition Worsens, Follow-On Scare On As Ravindra Jadeja Departs">
<figcaption>Ravindra Jadeja's wicket raises concerns for India.</figcaption>
<p>India is in a precarious position on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia after losing their seventh wicket, Ravindra Jadeja. With their follow-on score in jeopardy, the team is desperate to build a solid partnership to avoid defeat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia posted a total of 474 runs in their first innings.</li>
<li>India is currently 221 runs for 7 wickets with Nitish Reddy and Washington Sundar at the crease.</li>
<li>Jadeja's departure marks a significant setback as he was expected to score critical runs.</li>
<li>If India fails to perform today, their chances of reaching the World Test Championship (WTC) final diminish significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The way India play today might well decide the course of the series and World Test Championship final equation.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, India's batting performance today is crucial to their WTC hopes, and every run counts as they face mounting pressure from the Australian bowlers.</p>]]></description>

</figure></div>
<p>Following rumors of a potential transfer involving Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, Manchester United is considering several players from Stamford Bridge as possible signings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carney Chukwuemeka - Aiming to bolster midfield depth.</li>
<li>Joao Felix - Previous interest and a potential fit for United's attacking needs.</li>
<li>Christopher Nkunku - A valuable target considering his past links with United.</li>
<li>Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall - Possible replacement as United transitions from older players.</li>
<li>Ben Chilwell - Targeted as a new left-back option for United.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Whether because of the Napoli or Chelsea links, there is some potential to consider the situation..."</blockquote>
<p>This situation may lead to significant changes in the team structures of both clubs moving forward.</p>]]></description>

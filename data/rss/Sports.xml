<p>Legendary batter Sunil Gavaskar has shared a candid review of pacer Mohammed Siraj's performance, urging that he be dropped from the Indian team due to his poor form in the ongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy series.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gavaskar highlights Siraj's disappointing performance, having taken only 13 wickets in seven innings.</li>
  <li>Siraj has the highest runs conceded per over among frontline pacers in the series, averaging 4.07 runs per over.</li>
  <li>Gavaskar argues for a direct approach in communicating performance issues to Siraj.</li>
  <li>He suggests bringing back Harshit Rana or introducing Prasidh Krishna for the fifth Test in Sydney.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You need to be brutally upfront and say 'look, your performance has not been up to scratch, and therefore you are being dropped.'” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Gavaskar emphasizes the need for clear communication regarding performance expectations for players in the team.</p>]]></description>

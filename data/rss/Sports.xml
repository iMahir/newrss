<p>In the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been accused of having a suspect bowling action. Veteran sports commentator Ian Maurice suggests that political correctness is preventing a thorough examination of Bumrah's technique.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah has taken 21 wickets in six innings with an average of 10.90 in the series.</li>
  <li>Ian Maurice claims Australian media is hesitant to scrutinize Bumrah's action due to fear of being labeled racist.</li>
  <li>Greg Chappell has defended Bumrah, calling his bowling action legal and unique.</li>
  <li>Concerns about Bumrah's action arose after comparisons to former cricketer Mohammad Hasnain, who was banned for suspect action.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By the way, please stop this nonsense of questioning Bumrah's action. It is unique, but it is unequivocally clean.” - Greg Chappell</blockquote>
<p>This debate highlights the ongoing challenges in addressing issues of fairness and transparency in sports while respecting cultural sensitivities.</p>]]></description>

<p>Ben Stokes has been ruled out of all cricket for at least three months with a torn left hamstring, sustained during the third Test against New Zealand, which England won.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stokes missed the England squad for the Champions Trophy due to his injury.</li>
  <li>He had previous injury issues, including knee surgery in October 2023.</li>
  <li>In August, he suffered a similar hamstring injury that limited his playing time.</li>
  <li>Stokes had been managing his workload and opted out of IPL 2024.</li>
  <li>He expressed confidence in his physical fitness before the injury occurred.</li>
  <li>He will also miss next year's Hundred competition starting on January 9.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I have to work so much harder on the physical side of the job to allow me to go out and do my job...” - Ben Stokes</blockquote>
<p>This latest injury adds to Stokes' challenges on the field, potentially impacting England's future performance.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Rohit Sharma has indicated he will remain captain until a successor is officially appointed.</li>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir supports Yashasvi Jaiswal for the role, while selectors are considering Rishabh Pant.</li>
  <li>Rohit is confirmed to lead the ODIs during the upcoming Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>Jasprit Bumrah's potential captaincy is also discussed, highlighting the importance of a strong vice-captain.</li>
  <li>Suryakumar Yadav is deemed less likely to take over ODI captaincy, given his needing to establish himself in the format.</li>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> [Insert Publication Date] <strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>

<figcaption>IPL Trophy</figcaption>
<p>The 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will kick off on March 21 at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens, with the final set for May 25. This change comes after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) adjusted the schedule from earlier proposed dates.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IPL season will start a week later than initially announced.</li>
  <li>Kolkata Knight Riders will host both the opener and the final at Eden Gardens.</li>
  <li>The schedule change is reportedly due to broadcaster preferences to avoid overlap with the Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>The BCCI is expected to release the complete schedule shortly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Indian squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy will likely be announced on January 19.”</blockquote>
<p>This adjustment in schedule shows the influence of international cricket events on domestic leagues, highlighting the need for careful planning by the BCCI.</p>]]></description>

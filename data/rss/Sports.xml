<figcaption>The young batter was recently dropped by Mumbai for the Vijay Hazare Trophy after he refused to follow the rules.</figcaption>
<p>Prithvi Shaw, once touted as the next cricketing superstar, faces backlash after being dropped from the Mumbai team due to fitness issues and indiscipline. In a recent emotional social media post, he defended his career performance, but officials revealed that rule-breaking behavior was the real reason for his exclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shaw was recently dropped from the Mumbai team for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.</li>
  <li>His removal was attributed to fitness issues, indiscipline, and a poor attitude.</li>
  <li>Late-night parties and skipping training sessions were cited as problematic behaviors.</li>
  <li>A Mumbai Cricket Association official stated that the team had to compensate for Shaw's performance during matches.</li>
  <li>Other players expressed concerns over his attitude, influencing the decision to exclude him.</li>
  <li>The selectors remain unaffected by Shaw's social media sentiments.</li>
  <li>Shreyas Iyer emphasized the need for Shaw to address his issues maturely.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, we played with 10 fielders as we had to hide Prithvi Shaw. He was not able to stop the ball.”</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, the Mumbai Cricket Association emphasizes the need for discipline and teamwork, indicating that exceptional rules will not be made for any individual player.</p>]]></description>

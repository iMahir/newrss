            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Virat Kohli’s future dependent on Shubman Gill’s performance amid BCCI meeting</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong>Not specified <strong>Source: </strong>Hindustan Times</p>
<p>In a recent BCCI review meeting, discussions centered around Virat Kohli's lackluster performances over the past year, particularly during the recent series against New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Kohli's performance has drawn heavy criticism, managing only 93 runs in six innings against New Zealand.</li>
    <li>In the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia, Kohli scored only 90 runs, aside from a century in Perth.</li>
    <li>The BCCI is considering Shubman Gill's form as a factor in Kohli's inclusion for the upcoming England series.</li>
    <li>Players are now required to provide medical reasons if they wish to opt out of bilateral series.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“With the five-Test series against England still five months away, the selectors are likely to sit over the matter before forming an opinion.”</blockquote>
<p>The BCCI's stance indicates a significant change in protocol for players wishing to skip international matches, aiming for greater accountability.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Ravichandran Ashwin(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Ravi Shastri commented on Ravichandran Ashwin's retirement during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, suggesting that Ashwin might have continued playing if he had known that India would field two spinners at the MCG.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashwin retired after one Test in the series citing a lack of need in the Indian XI.</li>
  <li>Shastri believes Ashwin would have stayed if aware of the spin-bowling strategy for the Boxing Day Test.</li>
  <li>Washington Sundar was selected over Shubman Gill, surprising many experts.</li>
  <li>The fourth Test is crucial, with both teams having won one match each.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If Ashwin knew India would play two spinners, he might not have retired,” Ravi Shastri remarked.</blockquote>
<p>This commentary sheds light on the strategic decisions surrounding team selection and how they impact player careers.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Jasprit Bumrah spells trouble for the Australian batsmen.</figcaption>
<p>The 4th Test between India and Australia has begun at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with Australia dominating the early stages. Sam Konstas, a debutant, was impressive, however, Jasprit Bumrah made early attempts to claim wickets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia scored 112 runs by lunch with the loss of 1 wicket.</li>
<li>Sam Konstas scored a rapid 60 before being dismissed by Ravindra Jadeja.</li>
<li>Bumrah struggled early, conceding runs but later found rhythm against Labuschagne.</li>
<li>Konstas' six against Bumrah was significant as it ended a three-year streak where no batsman hit Bumrah for six.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It's quite surreal. Look at the turnout (of the crowd). I'm just trying to play with some freedom and back myself.” - Sam Konstas</blockquote>
<p>As the match progresses, both teams are looking for early breakthroughs after lunch to set the pace for the remainder of the Test.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 26, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>In a controversial moment during the match, Virat Kohli's shoulder barge with Sam Konstas has raised questions about possible sanctions by match referee Andy Pycroft, potentially affecting Kohli's eligibility for the upcoming Sydney Test.</p>
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Kohli and Konstas Incident" />
<figcaption>Virat Kohli and Sam Konstas exchange words on the field.</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli cut across the pitch, leading to physical contact with Konstas.</li>
  <li>The incident falls under cricket's Law 2.12 regarding inappropriate physical contact.</li>
  <li>If deemed a Level Two offence by Pycroft, Kohli could face suspension due to demerit points.</li>
  <li>Kohli has a history of similar incidents, having received a demerit point in a 2019 match.</li>
  <li>Former cricketer Ricky Ponting criticized Kohli for instigating the confrontation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“No doubt in my mind whatsoever. Fielders should be nowhere near the batsman at that stage.” — Ricky Ponting</blockquote>
<p>This incident may lead to serious consequences for Kohli if taken further by match officials, potentially impacting his participation in future matches.</p>]]></description>

<p>Former India all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin has commented on his recent retirement from international cricket, stating that he doesn't believe in grand farewell ceremonies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ashwin's retirement announcement was abrupt, catching many by surprise.</li>
<li>Kapil Dev expressed that Ashwin deserved a respectful farewell.</li>
<li>Ashwin firmly opposes the idea of grand farewells, viewing them as part of a celebrity culture.</li>
<li>He emphasizes the importance of legacy over ceremonies, suggesting that farewells can be seen as a disservice to the game.</li>
<li>Despite his achievements, including 106 Tests and 537 wickets, Ashwin is content with his quiet departure.</li>
<li>He denied any familial issues following his sudden retirement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think grand send-offs are part of a super celebrity culture.” - Ravichandran Ashwin</blockquote>
<p>Ashwin's perspective reflects a humble approach to his career, focusing on the impact he leaves rather than fanfare.</p>]]></description>

  <figcaption>No, no way! You cannot do that, Mohammad Abbas!</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Mohammad Abbas, returning to the Pakistan Test team after a three-year absence, showcases his exceptional bowling skills and team spirit as he prepares for the upcoming series in South Africa. Despite the mystery surrounding his exclusion from the team, his consistent performances at Hampshire have earned him this much-deserved opportunity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abbas has taken 180 wickets at an average of 19.26 over the past three seasons with Hampshire.</li>
  <li>He last played for Pakistan in August 2021, demonstrating his prowess with a ten-wicket haul against Australia.</li>
  <li>Coaches and teammates believe his skillset is crucial for the team’s success in South Africa.</li>
  <li>During his absence, other fast bowlers have emerged, but Abbas remains the most prolific bowler in first-class cricket since his last Test match.</li>
  <li>His return is seen as a chance to correct past mistakes and showcase his talent on the international stage.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"His skill is second to none." - Shan Masood, Pakistan Test captain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cricket community awaits Abbas’s performance as he returns to represent Pakistan, hopeful for a successful redemption.</p>]]></description>

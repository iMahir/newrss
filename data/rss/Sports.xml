<figcaption>Virat Kohli in action</figcaption>
<p>Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) secretary Ashok Sharma has expressed disappointment that star cricketer Virat Kohli will not participate in the Ranji Trophy, urging him to draw inspiration from players who prioritize domestic cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashok Sharma's call for Virat Kohli to play in the Ranji Trophy.</li>
  <li>Kohli last played for Delhi in 2012; faces criticism for not participating in domestic games.</li>
  <li>Comparison with Mumbai players who compete in domestic cricket despite being contracted with the Indian team.</li>

  <li>Ashok Sharma believes Kohli will not play even a single match for Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BCCI has issued directives in this regard but I don’t think Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant are going to represent Delhi even in one match.” - Ashok Sharma</blockquote>

</div>
<p>Kieran Tierney has voiced his support for Mikel Arteta's decision to pursue Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad, strengthening Arsenal's squad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tierney described Zubimendi as a "world-class" player.</li>
  <li>Arsenal has been targeting Zubimendi for over a year, aiming to replace Thomas Partey.</li>
  <li>The club is reportedly close to securing his signature with a £51 million release clause.</li>
  <li>Zubimendi will remain with Real Sociedad until the end of the season, despite interest from other clubs like Manchester City.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You have world-class players like Zubimendi... It’s hard to know [their quality] if you’re only watching the Premier League every week.” - Kieran Tierney</blockquote>
<p>This acquisition is timely as Tierney is likely to leave Arsenal soon, with speculation about a return to Celtic.</p>]]></description>

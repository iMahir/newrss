<p>During a recent BCCI review meeting, Gautam Gambhir and the selector Ajit Agarkar identified potential successor for Rohit Sharma's captaincy but faced disagreements regarding the ideal candidate.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma has indicated he will remain captain until a successor is officially appointed.</li>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir supports Yashasvi Jaiswal for the role, while selectors are considering Rishabh Pant.</li>
  <li>Rohit is confirmed to lead the ODIs during the upcoming Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>Jasprit Bumrah's potential captaincy is also discussed, highlighting the importance of a strong vice-captain.</li>
  <li>Suryakumar Yadav is deemed less likely to take over ODI captaincy, given his needing to establish himself in the format.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I will remain the captain until the board picks the next skipper in Tests and ODIs.” - Rohit Sharma</blockquote>

<p>The announcement of India's Champions Trophy squad has been delayed due to fitness concerns regarding Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav, prompting discussions among selectors and management.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other countries have announced their Champions Trophy squads, but India has not yet revealed theirs.</li>

  <li>Bumrah is recovering from back spasms and could miss the group-stage matches.</li>
  <li>Kuldeep Yadav underwent surgery for a groin injury and is expected to return to fitness soon.</li>
  <li>Selectors are considering including Bumrah, Kuldeep, and Mohammed Shami in the squad despite fitness concerns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All cricket boards had to send their preliminary teams by midnight of January 12.”</blockquote>
<p>The delay in announcing the squad is a critical issue as it impacts preparations for the upcoming tournament.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to find a new treasurer as Ashish Shelar, currently in the position, will step down after taking a ministerial role in the Maharashtra Cabinet, which is against BCCI’s constitutional rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shelar has served as treasurer since September 2022.</li>
<li>His resignation is the second departure of a BCCI office-bearer in two weeks.</li>
<li>The BCCI constitution disqualifies individuals from office if they hold a ministerial position.</li>
<li>Shelar previously confirmed he would not be taking on a more demanding role within BCCI due to his political commitments.</li>
<li>Questions remain on whether BCCI will elect a new treasurer or if responsibilities will be delegated.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A person shall be disqualified from being an office-bearer... if he or she is: a Minister or a Government Servant.”</blockquote>
<p>This transition within the BCCI comes at a pivotal time, influencing its governance as it navigates future leadership and responsibilities.</p>]]></description>

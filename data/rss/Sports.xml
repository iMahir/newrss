<figcaption>ICC Champions Trophy Logo</figcaption>
<p>India's matches in the 2025 Champions Trophy will be held in Dubai after the country refused to visit Pakistan due to ongoing political tensions between the two nations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ICC confirmed that India will play in Dubai, the chosen neutral venue for their matches.</li>
    <li>India’s fixtures include games against Bangladesh and New Zealand, as well as their Group A game against Pakistan.</li>
    <li>If India qualifies for the final on March 9, it will be hosted in Dubai instead of Lahore.</li>
    <li>This decision follows the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s announcement that it would not send a team to Pakistan, citing government advice.</li>
    <li>The last time India toured Pakistan was in 2008, while Pakistan last played India in the 2023 World Cup.</li>
    <li>The tournament marks the first Champions Trophy since 2017, which Pakistan won against India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are pleased that an agreement has been reached based on the principles of equality and respect, showcasing the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that defines our sport,” - PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi.</blockquote>
<p>The tournament is expected to be a major event, with Pakistan last hosting an ICC event in 1996.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India vs Australia LIVE Score, 5th Test Day 2: Prasidh Krishna struck out of nowhere to end a dangerous-looking stand between Beau Webster and Alex Carey</figcaption>
<p>India vs Australia are locked in a fierce contest during the 5th Test, with both teams vying for vital points. Jasprit Bumrah's injury scare looms large as he has been off the ground after bowling only one over after Lunch.</p>

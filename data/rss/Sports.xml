            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India Squad For Champions Trophy And England ODIs Live Updates</h1>

<figcaption>Former Indian cricket team star Aakash Chopra's views on the squad selection.</figcaption>
<p>The announcement of the Indian squad for the 2025 Champions Trophy and ODIs against England has stirred speculation regarding player selections, notably concerning Suryakumar Yadav.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aakash Chopra predicts Yadav will not be selected for the Champions Trophy.</li>
<li>Jasprit Bumrah's fitness is under scrutiny, potentially sidelining him for several months.</li>
<li>Yashasvi Jaiswal is a prospective inclusion in the squad.</li>
<li>Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli may see this as their last ICC event.</li>
<li>The ODI series against England starts from February 6, leading up to the Champions Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Suryakumar Yadav isn't there but Shreyas Iyer is. Since the start of the World Cup, he has scored 620 runs in 15 innings, with two centuries, at a strike rate of 112 and an average of 52.” – Aakash Chopra</blockquote>
<p>As the countdown begins to the tournaments, the fate of several key players is uncertain, making this an exciting yet nerve-wracking moment for Indian cricket fans.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Published on:</strong> Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 12:37 PM by <span>Cricbuzz</span></p>
<img height="396" width="595" alt="&quot;I'm really happy that she went back and got those runs,&quot; Mandhana said of Shafali" title="&quot;I'm really happy that she went back and got those runs,&quot; Mandhana said of Shafali" src="/a/img/v1/595x396/i1/c598116/im-really-happy-that-she-wen.jpg">
<figcaption>"I'm really happy that she went back and got those runs," Mandhana said of Shafali © BCCI</figcaption>
<p>Smriti Mandhana, captain of the Indian women's team, indicates that Shafali Verma may reclaim her place in the squad for the ODI series against Ireland, starting January 10, after impressive domestic performances.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shafali was dropped from the squad due to poor scores in previous matches.</li>
  <li>Pratika Rawal impressed as her replacement with notable scores.</li>
  <li>Shafali has shown strong form in domestic games, scoring impressive runs.</li>
  <li>Madhana acknowledges Pratika's contributions but emphasizes Shafali's potential impact.</li>
  <li>Mandhana expresses confidence in the team's fielding capabilities and adaptability to conditions.</li>
  <li>This series is significant as India has not frequently played against Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I'm really happy that she went back and got those runs," Mandhana on Shafali.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Mandhana focuses on maintaining a positive mindset and looks forward to facing Ireland, highlighting the excitement of playing against a less familiar opponent.</p>]]></description>

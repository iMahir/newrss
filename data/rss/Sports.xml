<p>As the cricketing world anticipates India's squad for the Champions Trophy 2025, former players Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh share their insights on the final 15 players. Their choices suggest notable changes in the team, particularly regarding wicketkeeper and opener selections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Harbhajan Singh advocates for Sanju Samson over Rishabh Pant as the preferred wicketkeeper.</li>
  <li>Virender Sehwag recommends young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal to partner with Rohit Sharma.</li>
  <li>India's selection process is closely tied to performances in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy.</li>
  <li>The final squad is expected to be announced by January 19.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Sanju Samson is my choice. Sanju Samson would be the first-choice," said Harbhajan Singh about the wicketkeeper selection.</blockquote>
<p>With these recommendations, both Sehwag and Harbhajan are contributing to shaping India's lineup ahead of a crucial international tournament.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's captain Jasprit Bumrah (C) talks with coach Gautam Gambhir (3rd L) and teammates before the start of day three of the fifth cricket Test match between Australia and India(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>India’s cricket board has appointed Sitanshu Kotak as the new batting coach, starting with the upcoming home series against England, following the team’s recent poor performances.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin Pietersen expressed interest in the batting coach position, but BCCI chose Kotak.</li>
<li>India will play five T20Is and three ODIs against England starting January 22.</li>
<li>Kotak previously served as the India A batting coach and has extensive coaching experience.</li>
<li>The current coaching staff includes Gautam Gambhir, Morne Morkel, T Dilip, and assistant coaches Abhishek Nayar and Ryan ten Doeschate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Kotak will be joining the Indian team as a batting coach. The Indian team will be having a three day-camp in Kolkata and players will be reporting on January 18.”</blockquote>
<p>Sitanshu Kotak's extensive experience and domestic cricket record make him a promising choice to bolster India's batting lineup.</p>]]></description>

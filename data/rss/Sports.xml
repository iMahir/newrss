<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 03, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/03/550x309/Screenshot_2025-01-03_110701_1735882633330_1735882640635.png" alt="Ravi Shastri and Jasprit Bumrah at toss of Sydney Test" title="Ravi Shastri and Jasprit Bumrah at toss of Sydney Test">
<figcaption>Ravi Shastri and Jasprit Bumrah at toss of Sydney Test</figcaption>
<p>Former Indian cricket coach Ravi Shastri shared insights on why he didn't immediately inquire about Rohit Sharma's absence at the toss for the Sydney Test. This match was crucial as India was down 1-2 and needed a win to retain the trophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and chose to bat, revealing Rohit Sharma had opted out of the match.</li>
<li>Shastri didn't ask about Rohit's absence right at the toss, focusing instead on team composition.</li>
<li>Bumrah stated, "Our captain has shown his leadership; he's opted to rest in this game," affirming team unity.</li>
<li>Criticism arose from former batter Sanjay Manjrekar regarding Shastri's approach at the toss.</li>
<li>Shastri suggested that Rohit might consider retiring from Test cricket if his form does not improve.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"It's not that India don't have youngsters. There are very, very good players in the wings and it's time to build." - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the decision by Rohit Sharma to sit out was seen as a sign of strong leadership, but it also sparked discussions about his future in the format.</p>]]></description>

<li>At Tea, India is at 107/4 with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja at the crease.</li>
<li>Scott Boland has taken 2 wickets for Australia, emerging as the pick of the bowlers.</li>

<p>Following India's significant loss to Australia, speculations about conflicts within the team's dressing room have surfaced. Sunil Gavaskar, however, attributes these stories to media exaggeration and insists they only arise after team losses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports of dressing room rifts emerged after India's defeat to Australia.</li>
<li>Sunil Gavaskar criticized the media for fueling these rumors.</li>
<li>Gavaskar stated that such speculation occurs frequently after Indian team losses.</li>
<li>Rohit Sharma may be rested for the upcoming fifth Test against Australia.</li>
<li>Gautam Gambhir clarified that these reports are not truthful.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Every time the Indian team has not done well, these things about rifts come up. It's almost as if we people feel that the Indian team cannot lose." - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while media speculations create narratives of conflict, both Gavaskar and Gambhir emphasize the need to focus on team performance instead.</p>]]></description>

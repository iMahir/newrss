            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Ravi Shastri on how Rohit Sharma can rediscover his Test mojo</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>Ravi Shastri, former Indian cricketer and coach, provided insights on how Rohit Sharma can regain his form in Test cricket, particularly when batting at No.6, a position he hasn't played in years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma previously averaged 54.57 batting at No.6 before transitioning to an opener.</li>
  <li>Shastri suggests Rohit should apply his aggressive white-ball mindset to his Test batting.</li>
  <li>He emphasizes the importance of being decisive in attack rather than being in two minds.</li>
  <li>Rohit is encouraged to take risks in the first 10-15 minutes to capitalize on his strengths.</li>
  <li>The role of a No.6 is crucial, and effective counter-attacking is vital.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The last thing you want is him to be in two minds whether to defend or attack. In his case, it should be attack.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri believes that Rohit's natural game and aggressive approach will not only help him regain form but also win games for India.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian cricket team head coach Gautam Gambhir faced disagreement over key selections for the Champions Trophy 2025 squad. Disputes arose between Gambhir, captain Rohit Sharma, and chief selector Ajit Agarkar, particularly regarding the vice-captaincy and wicket-keeper position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gambhir preferred Hardik Pandya as vice-captain, while Rohit and Agarkar chose Shubman Gill.</li>
<li>For the wicket-keeper spot, Gambhir advocated for Sanju Samson, but Rishabh Pant was selected instead.</li>
<li>Ajit Agarkar mentioned that Jasprit Bumrah may not be fit for the first two ODIs against England.</li>
<li>The final squad for the Champions Trophy is due to the ICC by February 11.</li>
<li>India will play three ODIs against England starting February 6.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We'll probably find out a bit more around that time. What exactly (it is) and with regards to what his medical condition is, I'm sure BCCI might just put something out from the physio itself.” – Ajit Agarkar</blockquote>
<p>This internal conflict highlights the challenges within the Indian cricket hierarchy as they prepare for an important international tournament.</p>]]></description>

<p>Sanju Samson's non-participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy has possibly cost him a spot in the Indian team for the Champions Trophy. His omission has raised questions about his commitment and availability for the team.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Samson's stunning form in T20Is led to calls for him to be included in the Champions Trophy team.</li>
  <li>KCA president Jayesh George criticized Samson for his lack of communication regarding his availability for the preparatory camp.</li>
  <li>Samson sent a brief text stating he wasn't available, leading to his exclusion from the Vijay Hazare squad.</li>
  <li>The Indian squad for the Champions Trophy sees the return of Jasprit Bumrah, pending fitness measures.</li>
  <li>Karun Nair was left out despite scoring heavily in the Vijay Hazare Trophy due to selection preferences.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Be it Sanju Samson or any other player, KCA has a policy in place that needs to be respected.” - Jayesh George</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Samson's commitment to the team and his choices during the Vijay Hazare Trophy may have significantly impacted his chances for selection in upcoming critical matches.</p>]]></description>

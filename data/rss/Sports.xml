            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Harry Maguire effect! Man Utd cool interest in Jarrad Branthwaite after £80m ex-captain's renaissance under Ruben Amorim</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A <strong>Source:</strong> Goal.com</p>
<p>Manchester United has decided to reduce their interest in player Jarrad Branthwaite following the impressive resurgence of former captain Harry Maguire under the guidance of coach Ruben Amorim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Harry Maguire has transformed his performance, influencing Manchester United's transfer strategy.</li>
<li>The club is now prioritizing retaining and rediscovering the potential of existing players over new signings.</li>
<li>Branthwaite, a potential target, may no longer fit into United's short-term plans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Maguire's form has brought a newfound confidence to the squad.”</blockquote>
<p>This shift indicates Manchester United's evolving strategy as they navigate player performance and recruitment.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Devajit Saikia hails from Assam. (AFP Photo)</figcaption>
<p>Devajit Saikia was elected unopposed as the new BCCI Secretary at a Special General Meeting in Mumbai, succeeding Jay Shah, who vacated the position after becoming ICC Chairman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Devajit Saikia and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia were elected unopposed for the positions of Secretary and Treasurer, respectively.</li>
<li>Both candidates were the only ones to file nominations for the vacant posts.</li>
<li>Jay Shah left his position after his election as ICC Chairman last month.</li>
<li>Saikia had been performing the duties of Secretary in the interim.</li>
<li>The election was uncontested, eliminating the need for a polling process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Two (02) Elective Posts of the Office Bearers – Secretary and Treasurer were Uncontested, and it was not necessary to conduct a Poll in respect of these Two (02) Posts,” stated electoral officer A K Joti.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Devajit Saikia’s election is a continuation of stable leadership in the BCCI following the recent changes in the organization's hierarchy.</p>]]></description>

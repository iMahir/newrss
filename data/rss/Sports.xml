<p>With the completion of the mega-merger between Jio and Star, the two sports broadcasting giants will start operating as a unified entity during the England tour of India.</p>
<ul>
<li>The merger allows for cross-promotion of properties across platforms.</li>
<li>The England series will be broadcast live on Star Sports and Disney+ Hotstar, along with original platforms like JioCinema.</li>
<li>The transaction of the joint venture was worth INR 70.352 crore (USD 8.5 billion).</li>
<li>Reliance Industries invested Rs 11,500 crore (1.4 billion) into the venture.</li>
<li>Star Sports remains a leading sports channel in India but has faced competition from rivals like Sports18 and JioCinema.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The merger of the media and JioCinema businesses of Viacom18 into Star India Private Limited (SIPL) has become effective.” - Reliance Industries Limited</blockquote>
<p>This integration marks a new era in sports broadcasting in India, potentially reshaping how cricket and other sports are presented to the audience.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Cheteshwar Pujara working as a pundit during Border-Gavaskar Trophy</figcaption>
<p>Cheteshwar Pujara expresses concerns over the Indian bowling attack's ability to take 20 wickets in Tests ahead of the critical Boxing Day Test against Australia, emphasizing the team's need for improvement in their bowling depth and top-order batting performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pujara questions the current effectiveness of India’s bowling attack, particularly their fourth and fifth bowlers.</li>
<li>The series is currently tied at 1-1, with crucial matches in Melbourne and Sydney ahead.</li>
<li>Concerns about the top-order batting alongside the bowling dilemma, with specific reference to Mitchell Starc's outstanding performance.</li>
<li>Pujara criticizes the lack of support for Jasprit Bumrah and the need for a stronger team composition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Pujara stated, "To win a Test match, you have to take 20 wickets, and the ability to take 20 wickets is not that good." </blockquote>
<p>Overall, Pujara emphasizes the need for strategic adjustments in both bowling and batting if India aims to secure victory in the remaining Test matches.</p>]]></description>

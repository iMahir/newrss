<figcaption>Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma (Getty Images)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent press conference, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir praised Rohit Sharma for prioritizing the team's needs over his personal batting form during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which India lost 1-3 to Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma missed the first Test to be with his family for the birth of his second child.</li>
  <li>He batted in the middle order for two Tests to maintain the opening partnership but struggled with scores of 3 and 6.</li>
  <li>His return to the opening position in the fourth Test did not improve his score, adding just 11 runs.</li>
  <li>Eventually, he rested for the final Test after a prolonged slump in form.</li>
  <li>Gambhir emphasized Rohit’s accountability, stating, "To keep the dressing room happy, I have to be honest and fair to everyone." </li>
  <li>The loss against Australia means India missed out on the World Test Championship final and ended a decade-long hold on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Rohit Sharma showed accountability at the top," said Gautam Gambhir.</blockquote>
<p>This series loss highlights the challenges the Indian cricket team is currently facing as they undergo a transitional phase.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Virat Kohli reacts on his dismissal on day two of the fifth Test match between Australia and India at the Sydney Cricket Ground(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Virat Kohli’s ongoing struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy have sparked discussions about his future in the Indian Test team as he finishes the series with only 190 runs across nine innings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli shows visible frustration after repeated dismissals, indicating rising concerns about his form.</li>
  <li>Despite a historic career, Kohli’s place in the upcoming England tour is being questioned due to lack of recent red-ball cricket.</li>
  <li>He has expressed no intention to retire, aiming for participation until the 2027 ODI World Cup.</li>
  <li>Former selectors suggest Kohli must play domestic red-ball matches to maintain his spot in the squad.</li>
  <li>He has yet to show interest in participating in the Ranji Trophy due to his packed schedule.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It would be very hard for selectors to pick either Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli on the basis of IPL performance or form.”</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming England tour represents a pivotal moment for Kohli, as he is expected to contribute significantly in ODIs but questions persist if he can regain his form in Test matches before then.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Jasprit Bumrah (Getty Images)</figcaption>
<p>India's leading bowler Jasprit Bumrah was unable to play on Day 3 of the fifth Test against Australia due to back spasms, prompting Mohammed Siraj to take over opening duties.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bumrah batted after bowling just one over before leaving the field due to injury.</li>
    <li>India set Australia a target of 162 runs after being dismissed for 157 in their second innings.</li>
    <li>Scott Boland achieved figures of 6-45, leading the Australian bowling attack.</li>
    <li>Rishabh Pant scored a notable 61, becoming the top scorer for India.</li>
    <li>Australia lead the series 2-1, needing a win or draw to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If they win or draw, it would also put them into the World Test Championships final in June at Lord's against South Africa."</blockquote>
<p>This match highlights the struggle for India without their star bowler, while Australia aims for a significant series victory.</p>]]></description>

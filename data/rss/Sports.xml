<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> November 14, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> NDTV</p>
<img width="639" height="479" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/82521sog_sarfaraz-khan-bcci_625x300_14_November_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" alt="Don't Play God: On Sarfaraz Khan Being 'Completely Dumped' Against Australia, Stern Message Sent">
<figcaption>Sarfaraz Khan during a cricket match.</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the surprising exclusion of batters Sarfaraz Khan and Abhimanyu Easwaran from the India vs Australia cricket series, despite their solid domestic performances. Former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar criticizes the selectors' decisions regarding these players.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sarfaraz Khan has displayed potential in his six Test matches.</li>
  <li>Despite a good domestic record, he was overlooked for the series.</li>
  <li>Manjrekar questions the rationale behind the exclusion and calls for reward for domestic success.</li>
  <li>Abhimanyu Easwaran's inclusion was similarly questioned, with doubts about his ability in tough conditions.</li>
  <li>Concerns are raised regarding Sarfaraz Khan's techniques against fast bowling.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Let's not try and play God too much, maybe just watch a little bit, be concerned about how they'll shape up at the highest level. But you've got to reward people who've got runs.” - Sanjay Manjrekar</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the article highlights the ongoing debate in Indian cricket regarding player selection and the need for selectors to acknowledge domestic performance.</p>]]></description>

<p>Former India coach Ravi Shastri has advised struggling cricketers Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to return to domestic cricket as they face challenges in their careers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli and Rohit have had disappointing performances in 2024, particularly in Test matches.</li>
  <li>Shastri believes they should play domestic cricket to regain form and contribute to younger players.</li>
  <li>Rohit has not played a domestic match since 2016; Kohli since 2012.</li>
  <li>Playing domestic cricket would help them improve their playing against spin, an area of struggle for India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If there's a gap for them, I think they should go back and play some domestic cricket and see how it is.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri emphasizes the importance of playing domestic cricket not just for personal revival but for the future of Indian cricket, highlighting the need for engagement with the current generation.</p>]]></description>

<p>Yashasvi Jaiswal has made a significant impact on the cricket scene, boasting impressive statistics in T20 and First-Class formats. With the Champions Trophy approaching, there is debate over whether he should be included as an opener for India’s squad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jaiswal scored 564 runs in six innings in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.</li>
  <li>He has achieved 3,000 T20 runs at a strike rate of 150.23 and averages 62.40 in First-Class cricket.</li>
  <li>Despite his recent form, he has yet to earn an ODI cap.</li>
  <li>Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill have a strong opening partnership, averaging 72.16 together.</li>
  <li>Head coach Gautam Gambhir's strategy may necessitate a left-handed opener to balance the batting order.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“ODI has always been his ready to go format; hope he gets his debut soon.”</blockquote>
<p>The discussion around Jaiswal’s inclusion continues as selectors weigh performance against tradition. With increasing pressure on Gill, the opportunity for Jaiswal may soon arise.</p>]]></description>

<p>Indian captain Rohit Sharma, senior batter Virat Kohli, and head coach Gautam Gambhir will reportedly survive the series defeat in Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir likely to continue as head coach through the 2025 Champions Trophy and upcoming Tests in England.</li>
  <li>Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will keep their spots in the team despite performance scrutiny.</li>
  <li>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) plans a review meeting but will not dismiss Gambhir after criticism for the series defeat.</li>
  <li>India won the first Test but lost the series 3-1 to Australia.</li>
  <li>Both Rohit and Kohli faced challenges with low runs scored during the Tests.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Yes, there will be a review meeting but no firing. C’mon, you can’t sack a coach for the batters’ poor show in one series.” - BCCI sources</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the focus remains on the upcoming Champions Trophy, with a need for improved performances from senior players.</p>]]></description>

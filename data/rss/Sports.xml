<figcaption>FIDE hailed D Gukesh and Ding Liren for putting up a good show during the 2024 World Chess Championship match in Singapore. Image credit: FIDE</figcaption>
<p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) President Arkady Dvorkovich has dismissed allegations that Ding Liren lost the World Chess Championship match to D Gukesh intentionally, praising both players for their performances.</p>
<ul>
    <li>D Gukesh won the 2024 World Chess Championship, making him the second Indian champion after Viswanathan Anand.</li>
    <li>Ding Liren made a critical blunder in Game 14, which cost him the match and title.</li>
    <li>Vladimir Kramnik and the Russian Chess Federation raised doubts about the nature of Liren's loss.</li>
    <li>Despite criticism from Magnus Carlsen, Viswanathan Anand supported Gukesh and encouraged him to disregard negative feedback.</li>
    <li>Gukesh became the youngest-ever World Chess Champion at 18, breaking Garry Kasparov's record.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Sports is about mistakes, without mistakes, there would be no goals in football. Every sportsman makes mistakes but that’s what we are excited about..." - Arkady Dvorkovich</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the FIDE President's remarks highlight the unpredictability of chess, while Gukesh's historic victory continues to generate discussion and debate in the chess community.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Marnus Labuschagne fell victim to India's mindgames</figcaption>
<p>Mohammed Siraj employed a mind game tactic reminiscent of Virat Kohli during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, resulting in the dismissal of Australia's Marnus Labuschagne shortly after their fiery exchange.</p>
<ul>
    <li>During the third Test match in Brisbane, Siraj engaged Labuschagne in a heated moment before flipping the bails.</li>
    <li>This tactic led to Siraj being booed by the Gabba crowd, recalling past incidents involving him and Australian players.</li>
    <li>Despite not dismissing Labuschagne directly, Siraj's psychological play contributed to the batter's wicket in the following over.</li>
    <li>Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah capitalized on the pressure by taking two wickets early in the day.</li>
    <li>The match faced interruptions due to rain, affecting the total overs played on the first day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The right-armer may not have got the better of Labuschagne in that over, but the mind game worked to perfection for India.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the intense rivalry and psychological tactics in cricket, showcasing Siraj's ability to influence the game beyond just bowling performance.</p>]]></description>

<p>Mohammed Siraj continued his lively antics during the Border Gavaskar Trophy, notably at the Gabba, where he engaged the crowd and fellow cricketer Marnus Labuschagne with a 'bail flip' moment.</p>
<ul>
    <li>On Day 2 of the Brisbane Test, Siraj flipped the bails at the striker's end to unnerve Labuschagne.</li>
    <li>Labuschagne responded by flipping the bails back, much to the cheers of the crowd.</li>
    <li>This playful exchange came after a previous incident between the two during the Adelaide Test.</li>
    <li>Siraj received boos from the crowd upon his arrival to bowl at the Gabba after a tumultuous outing in Adelaide.</li>
    <li>In a prior match, both Siraj and Labuschagne faced penalties for their heated exchanges on the field.</li>

<blockquote>“Siraj later gave a fiery send-off to local boy Travis Head after dismissing him, which led to recurring boos from the crowd.”</blockquote>

<p>The article discusses an unusual incident during the ongoing third Test match between India and Australia, where Mohammed Siraj and Marnus Labuschagne engaged in a playful bail-swapping act during the 33rd over, which resulted in Labuschagne's dismissal shortly thereafter.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incident occurred during the 33rd over of Australia's innings on Day 2 at The Gabba in Brisbane.</li>
    <li>Siraj removed the bails in an attempt to distract Labuschagne, who then swapped them back.</li>
    <li>Labuschagne was dismissed in the next over by Nitish Kumar Reddy after scoring 12 runs.</li>
    <li>The Australian innings faced early setbacks, losing two wickets swiftly before Labuschagne's participation helped stabilize the score for a time.</li>
    <li>The incident gained significant attention and went viral on social media platforms.</li>
    <li>Labuschagne has been under scrutiny for his recent form despite being a leading run-scorer in WTC history.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The bail swap trick, which led to the dismissal of many batters in the past, paid off for India as well on Sunday." 
</blockquote>
<p>This light-hearted incident showcased the competitive spirit of the game while highlighting the growing online engagement with cricket matches. Fans have found humor and entertainment even in challenging performances on the field.]]></description>

    <li>Punjab CM Bhagwant Singh Mann's wife attended the concert; an advisory was issued to avoid alcohol-themed songs during the performance.</li>

<blockquote>"Today's show is dedicated to world chess champion Gukesh. Do you know why it is dedicated to him? Because whatever you think in life, he has already thought about becoming a world champion. And he became that. Problems are there, I face them daily."</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Diljit Dosanjh's concert highlighted both his admiration for Gukesh's achievements in chess and his appreciation for the film Pushpa, engaging the audience with inspirational messages and entertainment.</p>]]></description>

    <li>Other notable years for Ponting include 1503 runs in 2003 and 1544 runs in 2005.</li>

<figcaption>Mohammed Siraj's send-off to Travis Head in the India vs Australia 2nd Test.</figcaption>
<p>Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar criticized Australian fans and players for their treatment of Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj after a controversial incident during the second Test in Adelaide.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gavaskar condemned the hypocrisy of Australian fans, suggesting they would cheer if the roles were reversed.</li>
    <li>Siraj faced criticism for a fiery send-off directed at Australian batsman Travis Head, which Gavaskar believes was unjust.</li>
    <li>Despite receiving a demerit point and a 20% fine on his match fees, Gavaskar noted the importance of the Indian Premier League in reducing animosity in cricket.</li>
    <li>Gavaskar humorously questioned whether Australian cricketers are "mongrels" who only bark in the context of aggressive play.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Siraj is getting the stick from all the 'saints' in Australian cricket who, of course, were known for their impeccable behaviour on the field... So, do mongrels simply purr, or do they bark, too?" - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>Gavaskar's remarks highlight the double standards in cricket fan culture and emphasize a call for fair treatment of players regardless of nationality.</p>]]></description>

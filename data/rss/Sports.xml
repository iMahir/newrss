  <li>Selecting the Champions Trophy squad is crucial, and selectors seek a valid reason for his absence.</li>
  <li>In the past, players lost central contracts for similar reasons, raising the stakes for participation in domestic cricket.</li>
  <li>Samson is competing for one of the wicketkeeper spots against Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, and Dhruv Jurel.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The selectors would want a valid reason. Otherwise, it will be difficult to consider him for the ODI season."</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of this investigation may shape the selectors' decisions, especially regarding the balance of the squad if Rahul is unfit.</p>]]></description>

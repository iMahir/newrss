<p>Sanju Samson has been performing exceptionally well in T20 internationals, scoring three centuries in his last five innings. Despite this, he may not be included in India's squad for the Champions Trophy, according to Harbhajan Singh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Samson has a T20I average of 56 and three recent centuries.</li>
<li>His lack of participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy may affect his selection.</li>
<li>Harbhajan Singh believes that performance in one format should be considered for other formats.</li>
<li>Samson's exemplifying performance brings into question the selectors' decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If a person is scoring three centuries in five matches, that means that he is in a zone where he can't be stopped.” - Harbhajan Singh</blockquote>
<p>The discussion around Samson's exclusion raises questions about the criteria utilized for selection, particularly when considering a player's performance in varying formats.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Harry Maguire effect! Man Utd cool interest in Jarrad Branthwaite after £80m ex-captain's renaissance under Ruben Amorim</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A <strong>Source:</strong> Goal.com</p>
<p>Manchester United has decided to reduce their interest in player Jarrad Branthwaite following the impressive resurgence of former captain Harry Maguire under the guidance of coach Ruben Amorim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Harry Maguire has transformed his performance, influencing Manchester United's transfer strategy.</li>
<li>The club is now prioritizing retaining and rediscovering the potential of existing players over new signings.</li>
<li>Branthwaite, a potential target, may no longer fit into United's short-term plans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Maguire's form has brought a newfound confidence to the squad.”</blockquote>
<p>This shift indicates Manchester United's evolving strategy as they navigate player performance and recruitment.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>Former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh has publicly criticized the BCCI for its new restrictions on family visits during team tours, questioning their effectiveness in relation to the team's performance.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Harbhajan Singh expresses concern over BCCI's decision to limit family visits during tours.</li>
    <li>He questions, "What have the wives done?" in response to the rationale behind the restrictions.</li>
    <li>Singh states that losing games is part of sports and shouldn't be blamed on family presence.</li>
    <li>The BCCI has introduced a 10-point policy aimed at promoting discipline among players, with penalties for non-compliance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What have the wives done? We win or lose because of what we do on the field.” - Harbhajan Singh</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Singh advocates for focusing on improving the team's on-field performance rather than imposing restrictions that he believes are counterproductive.</p>]]></description>

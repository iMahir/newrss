<figcaption>India need Shubman Gill to fire and fire big in Melbourne(HT_PRINT)</figcaption>
<p>Shubman Gill has faced challenges in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, failing to convert starts into substantial scores. Ricky Ponting has pointed out technical errors in Gill's batting that need to be addressed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>KL Rahul has been a consistent performer while other top players have struggled.</li>
  <li>Gill has scored low in key matches, raising concerns about his technique.</li>
  <li>Ponting noted that Gill is changing his guard and presenting his front pad too much, leading to dismissals.</li>
  <li>He emphasized the need for Gill to back his defensive technique and adopt a more attacking mindset.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I watched him a little bit in Adelaide... Scott Boland was bowling and he changed his guard, he moved across to the off stump…” - Ricky Ponting</blockquote>
<p>For Gill, the key to improvement lies in trusting his technique and finding a balance between aggression and caution as he plays in Australia.</p>]]></description>

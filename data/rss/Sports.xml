<p>In a recent incident during the Boxing Day Test, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma lost his cool after Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped a simple catch of Marnus Labuschagne, who was batting on 46 runs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaiswal dropped a routine catch during the 40th over of Australia's innings.</li>
<li>Rohit Sharma's frustration was captured in a viral video shared across social media.</li>
<li>Labuschagne capitalized on the mistake and scored a crucial half-century.</li>
<li>The match remains evenly poised with significant contributions from bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Reaction of Rohit Sharma after Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped a catch. In his 8 years of captaincy, I have never seen Virat Kohli react like this.” — Harshit (@spiral_craver)</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>IND vs AUS: Ideal Run Chase for India in 4th Innings</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> <time datetime="2024-12-29T09:46:56+05:30">Sunday, December 29, 2024</time> | <strong>Source:</strong> MyKhel</p>

<figcaption>IND vs AUS</figcaption>
<p>The 4th Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy is currently closely contested, with India capitalizing on strong bowling performances, particularly from Jasprit Bumrah. Australia holds a lead of 235 runs, and the Indian team must consider their ideal run chase.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Australia currently at 130 for 6, struggling against a strong Indian bowling attack.</li>
  <li>The pitch in Melbourne is expected to deteriorate, influencing chase strategies.</li>
  <li>Historical data shows the average 4th innings total at the MCG is 172, with teams generally struggling to chase over 350 runs.</li>
  <li>India's all-time highest 4th innings score in Australia is 445 runs, which occurred in 1978.</li>
  <li>Realistically, India aims to chase between 250-260 runs, but anything above 325 will be very challenging.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Anything beyond 325 runs at the MCG will be extremely difficult to chase."</blockquote>
<p>In summary, with the match hanging in the balance, India's strategy will focus on minimizing the target they need to chase on the final day to keep their hopes alive in the WTC finals.</p>]]></description>

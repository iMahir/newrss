<figcaption>Image credit: X</figcaption>
<p>In the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Virat Kohli didn't quite live up to expectations, managing just 190 runs at a modest average of 23.75. It seems his challenging phase isn't over yet, as he finds himself in a five-year slump.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kohli scored 190 runs during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</li>
<li>His average in the recent series was only 23.75.</li>
<li>Over the last five years, he has hit a new low in Test cricket.</li>
<li>His average in the last 40 Tests stands at 32.29, significantly below his career average.</li>
<li>Kohli's current average is the lowest among great Indian batters during this lean period.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is another nightmare for Virat. His recent performances continue to raise concerns among cricket fans and experts alike."</blockquote>
<p>This slump not only impacts Kohli's career stats but also raises questions about his role in the Indian batting lineup moving forward.</p>]]></description>

<p>As the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee prepares to announce India's 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy, experts debate the potential inclusion of Rishabh Pant versus KL Rahul as wicketkeeper.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The squad announcement is set for January 11, with selectors discussing key player performances from recent matches.</li>
  <li>India will play its Champions Trophy matches in Dubai due to political tensions with Pakistan.</li>
  <li>Rohit Sharma's captaincy is under scrutiny after a poor performance in the Test series but is expected to continue.</li>
  <li>Jasprit Bumrah's participation is uncertain pending medical clearance.</li>
  <li>Rishabh Pant faces competition from KL Rahul and Sanju Samson for the wicketkeeper position.</li>
  <li>Three senior players may be dropped in favor of newer talent.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Pant was away from cricket for a long time... KL Rahul should be your first-choice keeper,” said former coach Sanjay Manjrekar.</blockquote>
<p>With the ICC setting January 12 as the deadline to submit provisional squads, the selection committee faces significant decisions regarding player fitness and form ahead of the key tournament.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Virat Kohli exchanged words with the media at the Melbourne Airport. (Screenshot)</figcaption>
<p>Indian cricketer Virat Kohli arrived in Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test and had a tense exchange with the media regarding their filming practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kohli was irritated over perceived filming of his family at the airport.</li>
<li>A Channel 7 reporter clarified that the situation arose from a misunderstanding.</li>
<li>Kohli emphasized his need for privacy concerning his children, stating, “With my kids I need some privacy, you can’t film without asking me.”</li>
<li>The misunderstanding was resolved when it was confirmed that his children were not being filmed.</li>
<li>Kohli's recent performance has been mixed, scoring a century in the first Test but only 26 runs in his other innings.</li>
<li>The Border-Gavaskar series is tied 1-1 going into the fourth Test at the MCG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It was upon seeing the waiting cameras that Kohli became a little heated over what is largely a misunderstanding when he thought the media was filming him with his children,” reported Channel 7.</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hybrid model agreed for Champions Trophy and ICC events from 2024-27</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> ESPNcricinfo</p>
<p>The ICC has reached a breakthrough in the 2025 Champions Trophy impasse, implementing a hybrid model where India's matches will take place at neutral venues, and vice versa for Pakistan.</p>
<ul>
<li>All matches involving India in events hosted in Pakistan will be at neutral venues.</li>
<li>Similarly, all matches involving Pakistan in events hosted by India will also be held at neutral venues.</li>
<li>This agreement applies to multiple events, including the 2025 men's Champions Trophy and the 2025 women's ODI World Cup.</li>
<li>The neutral venue will be proposed by the tournament host board and must be approved by the ICC.</li>
<li>The ICC is open to hosting a tri-nation T20I series involving India and Pakistan at neutral venues.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The 2025 Champions Trophy is set to begin on February 19, but the tournament schedule has not yet been released due to uncertainty over the venues.</blockquote>
<p>This agreement marks a significant development in international cricket relations and aims to ensure fairness for both teams during tournament play.</p>]]></description>

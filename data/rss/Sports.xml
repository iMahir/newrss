<p>The Indian cricket team is facing a setback as Jasprit Bumrah is unlikely to recover in time for the Champions Trophy due to worsening back spasms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah experienced back spasms during the final Test against Australia.</li>
  <li>His condition was found to be worse than anticipated, with swelling on his back.</li>
  <li>He is currently undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru.</li>
  <li>BCCI has requested an extension for the squad announcement due to Bumrah's injury.</li>
  <li>There is uncertainty whether to include him in the 15-man roster or as a reserve in the UAE.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"He (Bumrah) will be going to NCA for his rehabilitation. The initial report says he doesn't have a fracture but has swelling on his back."</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of Bumrah's recovery is critical, as his absence could significantly affect India's performance in the Champions Trophy, with the semi-finals set to begin shortly after his expected rehabilitation period.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's Rohit Sharma (R) gestures next to Virat Kohli during day five of the third cricket Test match between Australia and India at The Gabba in Brisbane on December 18(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The future of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma was a central topic during the recent BCCI review meeting, where their recent disappointing performances were scrutinized.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BCCI selection committee, led by Ajit Agarkar, discussed the future of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.</li>
  <li>Rohit Sharma's recent Test performance has raised concerns; he scored only 164 runs in eight matches.</li>
  <li>Kohli's future depends on Shubman Gill's performance before the England tour.</li>
  <li>Kohli performed poorly during the Australia tour, managing only 90 runs besides one century.</li>
  <li>The selectors have the option to reconsider positions based on upcoming performances.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“That is not to say that Rohit’s 'I am not going anywhere' statement is how things will ultimately transpire.”</blockquote>
<p>The selectors will monitor performance closely as the next Test series approaches, looking for signs of form improvement from both senior players.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India batter Shubman Gill made way for a third specialist all-rounder in Washington Sundar in the fourth Test in Melbourne (AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The Indian cricket team made a surprising decision to drop Shubman Gill from the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to include Washington Sundar as a second spinner, leading to questions about the team's batting depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shubman Gill was not seen during team warm-ups and left the field early before the toss.</li>
<li>The team opted for a bowling attack featuring six bowlers instead of utilizing Gill's batting skills.</li>
<li>Assistant coach Abhishek Nayar explained that the decision was based on pitch conditions and the need for variation in their bowling attack.</li>
<li>Nayar acknowledged the impact of such decisions on young players like Gill, who are eager to prove themselves.</li>
<li>Gill's away record has been underwhelming, but he has been working hard in practice, indicating potential for future opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think a lot of the decisions when they are made and the process of it being made, the communication is always there and transparency is there.” - Abhishek Nayar</blockquote>
<p>This decision raises questions about the balance between batting and bowling in the team and how it may affect future matches.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Virat Kohli and Sam Konstas during the incident in Boxing Day Test.</figcaption>
<p>The altercation between Virat Kohli and Sam Konstas during the Boxing Day Test sparked widespread discussion in the cricket community. Kohli received a Level 1 breach charge resulting in a 20% fine but avoided a suspension.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli faced a physical confrontation with Konstas after the 10th over.</li>
  <li>The ICC fined Kohli 20% of his match fee and issued one demerit point.</li>
  <li>Experts speculated that a ban could occur, but Kohli received only a fine.</li>
  <li>This demerit point is the first for Kohli since 2019.</li>
  <li>ICC Article 2.12 was cited concerning inappropriate physical contact.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Virat Kohli has been fined 20 percent of his match fee and awarded one demerit point for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct."</blockquote>
<p>The outcome raises questions about the applicability of ICC regulations regarding player conduct and the severity of penalties for on-field incidents.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption><span>The fast bowlers were guilty of not bowling the right line and length to the batter, which allowed him to settle down.</span></figcaption>
<p>Former all-rounder Irfan Pathan criticized Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj for their performance in the Boxing Day Test, allowing debutant Sam Konstas to score a solid fifty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam Konstas, a 19-year-old debutant, scored 60 runs off 65 balls, including six boundaries.</li>
<li>He formed an 89-run partnership with Usman Khawaja.</li>
<li>Pathan believes the Indian bowlers failed to pitch the ball correctly, allowing Konstas to settle down.</li>
<li>Konstas was involved in a controversial moment with Virat Kohli during the match.</li>
<li>He replaced Nathan McSweeney for the last two Tests of the series.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Sam Konstas is an LBW candidate but the Indian bowlers didn’t try to pitch the ball up and force him to drive the ball... By the time they corrected their mistake, Sam Konstas was up and running.” - Irfan Pathan</blockquote>
<p>The criticism from Pathan highlights the challenges faced by the Indian bowlers in adapting to the conditions and the implications for their performance in the series.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses an incident during the India vs Australia 4th Test where Rohit Sharma was caught on the stump mic expressing his disappointment with Yashasvi Jaiswal's fielding performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rohit Sharma was instructing Jaiswal on field positioning while facing Steve Smith.</li>
<li>Rohit sarcastically questioned Jaiswal's fielding style, asking, "Jaisu, do you think you're playing gully cricket?".</li>

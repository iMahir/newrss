<figcaption>Sanjay Manjrekar and Irfan Pathan had a heated argument on Live TV.</figcaption>
<p>During a live discussion, former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar and Irfan Pathan engaged in a heated debate over a controversial run-out incident involving Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli during a Test match against Australia.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incident occurred on Day 4 of the 4th Test, where Jaiswal and Kohli built a significant partnership of 102 runs.</li>
    <li>A mix-up between the two players led to Jaiswal's dismissal, with differing opinions on who was at fault.</li>
    <li>Manjrekar defended Jaiswal, stating Kohli should have responded to his call for a run, while Pathan argued Kohli acted rightly given the ball's speed.</li>
    <li>The debate escalated, with Manjrekar claiming that if Kohli didn't want to let him talk, then that was acceptable.</li>
    <li>Manjrekar later suggested that Kohli's own dismissal was influenced by guilt over the run-out incident involving Jaiswal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Kohli's dismissal probably also down to the guilt he had inside his heart over Jaiswal's run-out.” — Sanjay Manjrekar</blockquote>
<p>This spirited discussion highlighted the tensions and varying perspectives among cricketers regarding crucial moments in the game.</p>]]></description>

<p>Day two of the Boxing Day Test witnessed a dramatic collapse in India's innings. After a strong start, they lost wickets quickly towards the end of the session, ending at 164-5, trailing Australia by 310 runs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Australia's total:</strong> All out for 474 with significant contributions from Steve Smith (140) and Sam Konstas (60 on debut).</li>
<li><strong>India's performance:</strong> Jaiswal scored 82 runs before a crucial run out, while Kohli was dismissed for 35.</li>
<li><strong>Wickets:</strong> India lost three wickets for just 13 runs as they stumbled towards the day's conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Key bowlers:</strong> Scott Boland claimed three wickets for Australia, turning the momentum in their favor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All hope isn’t lost for India with the destructive pair of Pant and Jadeja at the crease.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Australia dominated the second day, and India's efforts to make a comeback are hindered as they face a daunting deficit.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article discusses the criticism faced by Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma regarding his shot selection during a Test match against Australia, particularly focusing on an ineffective pull shot that led to his early dismissal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma attempted a pull shot that resulted in his dismissal for just 3 runs during the Boxing Day Test.</li>
  <li>His performance has been under scrutiny due to a significant slump in form, with only 22 runs in the series so far.</li>
  <li>Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting criticized Sharma's lack of focus and decision-making at the crease.</li>
  <li>Darren Lehmann and Michael Vaughan echoed similar sentiments, pointing out that Rohit needs to be more aggressive and committed in his play.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“That's just a lazy, not switched on, not up for the moment type of shot.” - Ricky Ponting</blockquote>
<p>The critique from former players highlights the pressures on Rohit Sharma as a captain and his need to adapt and recover in the ongoing series against Australia.</p>]]></description>

<p>After losing five of their last ten matches, Manchester United's season has descended into crisis, with Ruben Amorim facing immense pressure following his premonitory comments about an impending 'storm' affecting the team's performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>United suffered a 2-0 defeat against Wolves, adding to their struggles this season.</li>
<li>The club has now lost five games in all competitions since Amorim warned of potential issues.</li>
<li>This is the worst start for a United manager in 92 years, with questions surrounding his ability to turn the club's fortunes around.</li>
<li>Despite the defeats, Amorim maintains that the team had control in some matches.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The storm will come... we have difficult moments, and we will be found out in some games." - Ruben Amorim</blockquote>
<p>The difficulties facing Manchester United suggest that significant changes may be needed to recover their past glories.</p>]]></description>

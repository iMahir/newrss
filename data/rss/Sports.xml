<p>The Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma faced intense criticism following India's defeat to Australia in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with former cricketer Basit Ali questioning Sharma's captaincy decisions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma's decision to open batting despite poor form was criticized, affecting the team's confidence.</li>
  <li>Basit Ali highlighted the detrimental impact on KL Rahul after demoting him in favor of Sharma.</li>
  <li>Criticism extended to Gautam Gambhir for his game management decisions.</li>
  <li>Rohit and Virat Kohli were both dismissed cheaply, contributing to the team's struggles.</li>
  <li>Ali suggested a captaincy change for the final Test, proposing Jasprit Bumrah take over leadership.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“One decision: 'I will open', that affected India. You (Rohit) completely shattered the confidence of the team,” said Basit Ali.</blockquote>
<p>Ali's remarks underscore the dissatisfaction with Rohit Sharma's leadership and decision-making during a critical match, calling for immediate changes in captaincy and strategy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Shubman Gill in action during the Boxing Day Test.</figcaption>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> India faces a crucial decision in the must-win fifth Test against Australia in Sydney, with the future of young batsman Shubman Gill hanging in the balance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gill's form and role in the team have been a topic of discussion after a promising start to the tour.</li>
  <li>Head coach Gautam Gambhir's preference for Cheteshwar Pujara and Gill's technical vulnerabilities have raised questions about his spot in the playing XI.</li>
  <li>India's batting order has been shuffled, with Rohit Sharma opening and Gill finding himself in and out of the team.</li>
  <li>The team management's decision to bench Gill for the Melbourne Test has further complicated his situation.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> With the series on the line, India must decide whether to stick with Gill at No.3 or bring back Pujara, potentially strengthening their bowling attack at the cost of Gill's batting spot.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rohit Sharma's Three Options In Do-Or-Die Sydney Test: Step Aside Or...</figcaption>
<p>As India prepares for a must-win Test match against Australia, captain Rohit Sharma faces crucial decisions regarding team selection, especially concerning the inclusion of Shubman Gill.</p>
<ul>
<li>India lost the Boxing Day Test by 184 runs, putting pressure on the team.</li>
<li>Shubman Gill, a top run-scorer, may return to the playing XI in place of a bowler.</li>
<li>Washington Sundar’s performance in the previous match complicates team balance.</li>
<li>Rohit has three options: include Gill by dropping a bowler, shift his position, or step aside himself.</li>
<li>Rohit’s own poor form raises questions about his role in the squad.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Taking a back seat to allow the team to move forward is a call that can only be taken if the heart is in the right place.”</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Jasprit Bumrah Sets New India Record in ICC Rankings, Virat Kohli Slips to 10-Year Low</h1>
<p><strong>January 1, 2025 - Hindustan Times</strong></p>

<p>India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah scripted history on Wednesday by going past Ravichandran Ashwin to become the highest-rated Indian bowler in ICC Test rankings. However, former India captain Virat Kohli slipped to a 10-year low in the rankings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bumrah's performance in the Melbourne Test earned him the highest rating (907) for an Indian bowler, surpassing Shane Warne's previous best.</li>
<li>Kohli's poor performance in the same test resulted in him dropping to his lowest ranking (24th) since 2014.</li>
<li>Rohit Sharma also dipped to a six-year low (40th) in the rankings.</li>
<li>Yashasvi Jaiswal, however, reached a career-high rating (854) with his performance in the fourth Test.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Bumrah's achievement is a significant milestone for Indian cricket, Kohli and Sharma's dip in rankings might cause concern for the team's management.</p>]]></description>

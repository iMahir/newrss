<figcaption>India batter Shubman Gill made way for a third specialist all-rounder in Washington Sundar in the fourth Test in Melbourne (AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The Indian cricket team made a surprising decision to drop Shubman Gill from the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to include Washington Sundar as a second spinner, leading to questions about the team's batting depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shubman Gill was not seen during team warm-ups and left the field early before the toss.</li>
<li>The team opted for a bowling attack featuring six bowlers instead of utilizing Gill's batting skills.</li>
<li>Assistant coach Abhishek Nayar explained that the decision was based on pitch conditions and the need for variation in their bowling attack.</li>
<li>Nayar acknowledged the impact of such decisions on young players like Gill, who are eager to prove themselves.</li>
<li>Gill's away record has been underwhelming, but he has been working hard in practice, indicating potential for future opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think a lot of the decisions when they are made and the process of it being made, the communication is always there and transparency is there.” - Abhishek Nayar</blockquote>
<p>This decision raises questions about the balance between batting and bowling in the team and how it may affect future matches.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Virat Kohli and Sam Konstas during the incident in Boxing Day Test.</figcaption>
<p>The altercation between Virat Kohli and Sam Konstas during the Boxing Day Test sparked widespread discussion in the cricket community. Kohli received a Level 1 breach charge resulting in a 20% fine but avoided a suspension.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli faced a physical confrontation with Konstas after the 10th over.</li>
  <li>The ICC fined Kohli 20% of his match fee and issued one demerit point.</li>
  <li>Experts speculated that a ban could occur, but Kohli received only a fine.</li>
  <li>This demerit point is the first for Kohli since 2019.</li>
  <li>ICC Article 2.12 was cited concerning inappropriate physical contact.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Virat Kohli has been fined 20 percent of his match fee and awarded one demerit point for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct."</blockquote>
<p>The outcome raises questions about the applicability of ICC regulations regarding player conduct and the severity of penalties for on-field incidents.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Rohit made two review errors during the match, which could impact the game's outcome.</li>
</ul>

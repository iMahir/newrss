<figcaption>India vs Australia LIVE Score, 5th Test Day 2: Prasidh Krishna struck out of nowhere to end a dangerous-looking stand between Beau Webster and Alex Carey</figcaption>
<p>India vs Australia are locked in a fierce contest during the 5th Test, with both teams vying for vital points. Jasprit Bumrah's injury scare looms large as he has been off the ground after bowling only one over after Lunch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia was 101/5 at Lunch, trailing India by 84 runs.</li>
<li>Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Marnus Labuschagne early in the day before struggling with fitness.</li>
<li>Prasidh Krishna secured key wickets including Steve Smith and Alex Carey.</li>
<li>An under-pressure Indian batting line-up, unable to stabilize in their previous innings.</li>
<li>The Test match holds significant implications for both teams concerning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the World Test Championship.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“An injury to Bumrah is arguably the one thing India dread the most, with the pacer being the visitors' only consistent performer throughout the series.”</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of this match is crucial for both teams, with significant ramifications for future series and rankings.</p>]]></description>

<p>Australian opener Sam Konstas has come under fire for a heated argument with India captain Jasprit Bumrah during the SCG Test.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Konstas engaged in a furious exchange with Bumrah before Usman Khawaja's dismissal.</li>
  <li>The altercation led to India celebrating Khawaja's wicket and marked a tense finale to day one.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest Konstas' behavior may have distracted Khawaja from finishing the day's play smoothly.</li>
  <li>Adam Gilchrist criticized Konstas, highlighting the unusual and intense nature of the celebration from the Indian team.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"They're charging in from everywhere … All sorts of drama here," said Adam Gilchrist. "It was Bumrah who turned to Konstas. He learns a tough lesson in his second Test match."</blockquote>
<p>The incident has sparked widespread discussion and criticism among commentators and former players regarding the balance between confidence and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>]]></description>

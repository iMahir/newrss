<p>Ravindra Jadeja expressed that he will deeply miss Ravichandran Ashwin, whom he considers an on-field mentor, after Ashwin announced his retirement during the Test series against Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashwin retires as India’s second-highest wicket-taker in Tests with 537 wickets.</li>
  <li>He and Jadeja took 587 wickets together in 58 Tests, surpassing the Kumble-Harbhajan duo.</li>
  <li>Jadeja praised Ashwin's mentorship and their communication during matches.</li>
  <li>They will reunite in IPL 2025 for Chennai Super Kings.</li>
  <li>Ashwin reflected on his career and significant memories with teammates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level. I do feel there's a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to expose... I've had a lot of fun.” - R Ashwin</blockquote>
<p>Jadeja's sentiments highlight the bond formed between the two over many years, while Ashwin's retirement marks a significant moment in Indian cricket history.</p>]]></description>

<p>Prithvi Shaw, once touted as the next cricketing superstar, faces backlash after being dropped from the Mumbai team due to fitness issues and indiscipline. In a recent emotional social media post, he defended his career performance, but officials revealed that rule-breaking behavior was the real reason for his exclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shaw was recently dropped from the Mumbai team for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.</li>
  <li>His removal was attributed to fitness issues, indiscipline, and a poor attitude.</li>
  <li>Late-night parties and skipping training sessions were cited as problematic behaviors.</li>
  <li>A Mumbai Cricket Association official stated that the team had to compensate for Shaw's performance during matches.</li>
  <li>Other players expressed concerns over his attitude, influencing the decision to exclude him.</li>
  <li>The selectors remain unaffected by Shaw's social media sentiments.</li>
  <li>Shreyas Iyer emphasized the need for Shaw to address his issues maturely.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, we played with 10 fielders as we had to hide Prithvi Shaw. He was not able to stop the ball.”</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, the Mumbai Cricket Association emphasizes the need for discipline and teamwork, indicating that exceptional rules will not be made for any individual player.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How India’s T20 Batting Evolved in 2024</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified<br><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>In 2024, India's domestic T20 cricket saw a remarkable surge in six-hitting prowess, with batsmen embracing a new attacking mindset driven by several key changes and rules.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The introduction of the Impact Sub Rule in SMAT in 2022 transformed batting strategies.</li>
  <li>Record scoring rates were achieved in SMAT tournaments, with a significant increase in strike rates over the years.</li>
  <li>Teams adapted to the new dynamics, with a notable shift towards T20 specialization among players.</li>
  <li>Baroda set a world record for T20 with 349 runs, including 37 sixes in a single match.</li>
  <li>Several individual records were broken, highlighting the explosive potential of the new generation of players.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The impact player rule has completely changed the mindset. It gives you that boost that you can take on every delivery.” - Shreyas Iyer</blockquote>
<p>As India approaches the 2026 World Cup, maintaining their aggressive T20 batting style will be crucial to their success.</p>]]></description>

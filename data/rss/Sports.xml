<figcaption>Magnus Carlsen recently criticised Vishwanathan Anand's role as FIDE deputy president.</figcaption>
<p>FIDE chief Arkady Dvorkovich has come to the defense of Viswanathan Anand following Magnus Carlsen's critical remarks about FIDE officials during recent tournaments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carlsen faced criticism for wearing jeans during the Rapid Championship, which led to violations of FIDE's dress code.</li>
  <li>He accused FIDE officials, including Anand, of being unqualified in their roles.</li>
  <li>Dvorkovich stated that personal attacks are unacceptable and defended Anand's contributions to FIDE.</li>
  <li>After the controversy, Carlsen acknowledged that some of his comments were excessive.</li>
  <li>Match-fixing accusations against Carlsen also surfaced after the Blitz Championship.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you want to attack someone, attack me. You can criticise anyone (in FIDE) constructively.” - Arkady Dvorkovich</blockquote>
<p>In summary, Dvorkovich emphasized the importance of respect within the chess community and the need to adhere to established rules while recognizing that mistakes can happen on all sides.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Robin Uthappa opened up on Yuvraj Singh's axing from the Indian cricket team, while comparing Virat Kohli's captaincy to Rohit Sharma's.</figcaption>
<p>Former cricketers are criticizing Virat Kohli’s leadership style, accusing him of unreasonably axing Yuvraj Singh from the Indian cricket team after Singh's recovery from cancer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yuvraj Singh, a key player in India's cricket history, made a comeback post-cancer but faced challenges in his return.</li>
  <li>Robin Uthappa claims Kohli’s strict standards and leadership style negatively impacted Yuvraj's chances to return to form.</li>
  <li>Yuvraj requested reduced fitness test requirements but was denied, which Uthappa indicates contributed to his exit from the team.</li>
  <li>Uthappa contrasts Kohli’s “my way or the highway” approach to Rohit Sharma’s more inclusive style of leadership.</li>
  <li>Yuvraj Singh announced his retirement from international cricket in 2019, concluding his IPL career that same year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Virat was very ‘my way or the highway’ kind of a captain. How to treat your team, how you treat your personnel, because it is not just about results.” - Robin Uthappa</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the complexities of leadership in sports, and the varying styles that can impact team dynamics and player careers.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Champions Trophy puzzles: Will selectors give Yashasvi Jaiswal maiden ODI call-up? Will Suryakumar Yadav find a return route? Is Ravindra Jadeja’s time up?</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Date not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>The Indian cricket team is gearing up for the Champions Trophy selection, with key players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli likely guarantees, yet several other spots remain contentious. Yashasvi Jaiswal's potential call-up and fitness concerns over Jasprit Bumrah add to the intrigue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are confirmed selections for the team.</li>
  <li>Yashasvi Jaiswal is likely to make his ODI debut, potentially affecting Shubman Gill's position.</li>
  <li>Selector deliberations must address the fitness of Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav.</li>
  <li>Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, and KL Rahul form a strong middle order.</li>
  <li>Rishabh Pant's position as wicketkeeper remains uncertain.</li>
  <li>Hardik Pandya's potential return bolsters the all-rounder options alongside Axar Patel and Washington Sundar.</li>
  <li>The bowling lineup hinges on the availability of Kuldeep Yadav and includes spinners like Varun Chakravarthy.</li>
  <li>Fast bowler selections could come down to fitness levels of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is understood that for Kuldeep to be in contention, he has to feature in the ODIs against England to prove his fitness.”</blockquote>
<p>As India prepares for the Champions Trophy, the selectors face challenging decisions that could shape the team's future and their performance in the tournament.</p>]]></description>

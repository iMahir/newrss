<figcaption>India's Mayank Yadav bowls a delivery during the first T20 cricket match between Bangladesh and India(AP)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses Mayank Yadav's ongoing injury issues and criticizes the influence of the IPL on young fast bowlers. Former Australian cricketer Brad Hogg expresses concerns over the prioritization of IPL contracts over developing skills for longer formats of the game.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mayank Yadav gained prominence during the 2024 IPL but has been plagued by injuries.</li>
  <li>Brad Hogg comments on the lack of focus among young bowlers on developing endurance for longer formats.</li>
  <li>Hogg emphasizes that many young bowlers prioritize IPL contracts which detract from their longer game skill development.</li>
  <li>The National Cricket Academy is taking a careful approach with Yadav’s development, focusing on recovery and gradual improvement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Once they get that IPL contract, everything falls out of the window. They don’t know how to bowl within themselves.” - Brad Hogg</blockquote>
<p>The concerns raised point to a broader issue within cricket where the fast-paced nature of the IPL may compromise the foundational skills necessary for future success in the sport.</p>]]></description>

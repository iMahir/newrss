<figcaption>Ravindr Jadeja addresses a presser at MCG</figcaption>
<p>A Border-Gavaskar Trophy series is never short of controversies, and this time Ravindra Jadeja has stirred attention by communicating exclusively in Hindi during a press conference, leaving Australian journalists puzzled.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jadeja was filmed answering questions in Hindi regarding a prior encounter in Brisbane.</li>
  <li>The Australian media expressed their confusion as he did not respond in English.</li>
  <li>India's media manager argued with local journalists, stating the need to leave as the team bus was waiting.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING🚨The Australian media has unnecessarily targeted the Indian cricket team once again.</p>
<p>The Australian media accused Ravindra Jadeja of speaking in his native tongue instead of waiting to respond in English, which caused controversy at the press conference.… <a href="https://t.co/9L5mYm7G34" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/9L5mYm7G34</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This incident follows another recent controversy involving Virat Kohli, who confronted media over privacy concerns regarding his children.</p>
<p>This situation highlights ongoing tensions between the Indian cricket team and the Australian media, especially during high-stakes series like the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</p>]]></description>

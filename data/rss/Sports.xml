<figcaption>Travis Head (Photo Source: X)</figcaption>
<p>Travis Head's impressive performance in recent matches has left the Indian cricket team struggling to find a way to tackle his aggressive batting style, raising concerns about their strategies moving forward.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Travis Head entered the game with high confidence after scoring a century in the previous pink-ball Test.</li>
    <li>India's bowlers struggled to contain runs and failed to apply sustained pressure during crucial periods of play.</li>
    <li>India's bowling coach, Morne Morkel, acknowledged issues in executing their game plans against Head.</li>
    <li>Head's scoring impact is significant, having scored 392 runs in four innings, with a strike rate of nearly 95.</li>
    <li>Steve Smith highlighted that the current Kookaburra ball's properties favor aggressive batting, benefiting players like Head.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Yes we've got the game plans, but are we executing those game plans with a softer ball from both ends, that's something we need to discuss and get better at," said Morkel.</blockquote>
<p>The Indian cricket team needs to reassess their approach to handling Travis Head, as their current strategies have proven ineffective, risking further heavy defeats in upcoming matches.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India needs to get better with old ball between overs 50-80, accepts bowling coach Morkel</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="HT Image" title="HT Image">

<p>Bowling coach Morne Morkel has acknowledged that Indian bowlers need to improve their performance with the old ball, especially during the critical overs 50 to 80, following a disappointing session against Australian batsman Travis Head.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Morkel emphasized the need to execute plans effectively during the latter part of the innings.</li>
    <li>Australia accumulated 171 runs in the third session, finishing the day at 405 for seven.</li>
    <li>Jasprit Bumrah stood out with a five-wicket haul, while other bowlers struggled.</li>
    <li>Morkel backed Ravindra Jadeja despite his tough outing in the match.</li>
    <li>He defended the decision to bowl first, believing in the team's ability to control the run rate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “It’s definitely an area that we need to focus on, maybe deeper in the innings. Yes, we’ve got the game plans, but are we executing those game plans with a softer ball from both ends?” - Morne Morkel
</blockquote>
<p>In summary, Morkel's critiques underscore the necessity for improvement in India's bowling strategy with the old ball, especially against skilled opponents like Australia. The team must adapt swiftly to bolster their performance in the ongoing series.</p>]]></description>

<p>Mohammed Siraj's reckless throw during the third Test against Australia sparked frustration from Ravindra Jadeja, highlighting a tense moment on the field as the match progressed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Siraj's aggressive throw caused Jadeja to react angrily during Day 2 of the Test in Brisbane.</li>
    <li>Former England cricketer Mark Nicholas noted the "civil war" on the field as Jadeja chastised Siraj for his throw.</li>
    <li>Australia dominated the day, reaching 405/7 at stumps, with significant contributions from Travis Head and Steve Smith.</li>
    <li>Head scored 152 runs and Smith made 101 runs, both forming a crucial partnership in the middle order.</li>
    <li>Jasprit Bumrah was India's standout bowler, achieving figures of 5-72.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“You almost broke my finger, pal. Take it easy,” said Ravindra Jadeja in response to Siraj's throw.</p>

<figcaption>Marnus Labuschagne and Mohammed Siraj (Image credit: X)</figcaption>
<p>Former Australia batter Matthew Hayden criticized Marnus Labuschagne for losing focus after Mohammed Siraj's playful antics during the Brisbane Test.</p>
<ul>
  <li>During Day 2 of the Brisbane Test, Siraj attempted to distract batsmen, notably flipping the bails at Labuschagne's end.</li>
  <li>Labuschagne responded by switching the bails back, shortly before he was dismissed for 12 runs off 55 balls.</li>
  <li>Hayden, commentating on Star Sports, emphasized that Labuschagne should have remained composed and not acknowledged Siraj's actions.</li>
  <li>The five-match series is currently tied at 1-1.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"He saw 55 deliveries, has had no go forward whatsoever... if it was me at the crease and a bowler does that, I'm not even looking at the bowler." - Matthew Hayden</blockquote>
<p>Hayden's comments highlight the importance of maintaining focus during intense matches, particularly in the competitive environment of Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

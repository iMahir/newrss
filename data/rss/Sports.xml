            <title><![CDATA[While Rohit Sharma has decided to retire after Sydney Test, shouldn't he be saying goodbye right away? - The Times of India]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rohit Sharma's Test Retirement: Should He Step Down Immediately?</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source: Melbourne, Dec 31, 2024 - <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">The Times of India</a></strong></p>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116788985,imgsize-76074,width-400,resizemode-4/116788985.jpg" alt="Rohit Sharma walks back after being dismissed cheaply in the second innings at Melbourne Cricket Ground. (Getty Images)" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high">
<figcaption>Rohit Sharma walks back after being dismissed cheaply in the second innings at Melbourne Cricket Ground. (Getty Images)</figcaption>
<p>Rohit Sharma's dismal performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has brought into question his future in Test cricket. With just 31 runs in three Tests, his batting average in 2024 has been in the mid-20s. This, combined with his tactics as captain, has raised concerns about his continuity in the team.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rohit's batting struggles: Only 619 runs in 14 Tests, with just two centuries and two half-centuries.</li>
  <li>Captaincy and reputation: Despite poor form, Rohit has been retained due to his captaincy and reputation.</li>
  <li>Experimentation in Melbourne: Playing Rohit at the top, KL Rahul at No. 3, and benching Shubman Gill did not yield positive results.</li>
  <li>Transition to next generation: Delaying Shubman Gill's opportunities and KL Rahul's return to a familiar batting position hinders the team's progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<blockquote>Will Rohit follow suit (retiring mid-series like MS Dhoni) or wait for the 'why nots' to get louder?</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: With Rohit's retirement seemingly imminent, the focus should be on a smooth transition to the next generation of players.</p>]]></description>

<li>Jasprit Bumrah achieved a five-wicket haul, becoming the first fast bowler to claim 30 wickets in a single Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.</li>
<li>Former captain Ponting expected a declaration from Cummins to maximize Australia’s chances but was surprised by the approach taken.</li>
<li>Commentator Tim Lane noted that the decision has resolved a lingering question regarding Australia’s strategy ahead of the final day.</li>

<figcaption>Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland (Getty Images)</figcaption>
<p>The fourth day of the Boxing Day Test saw Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland forming a gritty partnership that left India frustrated as Australia extended their lead to over 300 runs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A partnership of over 50 runs for the last wicket changed the match dynamics.</li>
  <li>India had hopes of an early finish when they dismissed key Australian players, but Lyon and Boland held firm.</li>
  <li>This marked the second instance in Test history of a 10th wicket pair batting for over 50 balls in both innings.</li>
  <li>The first such instance was in 1961 between Afaq Hussain and Haseeb Ahsan for Pakistan against England.</li>
  <li>Drama ensued with a no-ball call that kept the partnership intact late in the day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The partnership not only defied India but also turned the tide of the match."</blockquote>
<p>This remarkable display by Lyon and Boland marks a significant moment in Test cricket history, showcasing resilience and skill under pressure.</p>]]></description>

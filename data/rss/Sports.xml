            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Ravi Shastri on how Rohit Sharma can rediscover his Test mojo</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>Ravi Shastri, former Indian cricketer and coach, provided insights on how Rohit Sharma can regain his form in Test cricket, particularly when batting at No.6, a position he hasn't played in years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma previously averaged 54.57 batting at No.6 before transitioning to an opener.</li>
  <li>Shastri suggests Rohit should apply his aggressive white-ball mindset to his Test batting.</li>
  <li>He emphasizes the importance of being decisive in attack rather than being in two minds.</li>
  <li>Rohit is encouraged to take risks in the first 10-15 minutes to capitalize on his strengths.</li>
  <li>The role of a No.6 is crucial, and effective counter-attacking is vital.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The last thing you want is him to be in two minds whether to defend or attack. In his case, it should be attack.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri believes that Rohit's natural game and aggressive approach will not only help him regain form but also win games for India.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India beat Pakistan by 228 runs in 2023 Asia Cup</figcaption>
<p>The aftermath of Pakistan's loss to India in the 2023 Asia Cup has led to significant turmoil within the team, as expressed by batter Imam-ul-Haq. He noted that the unexpected defeat sparked rumors of rifts among players, affecting subsequent performances in the ODI and T20 World Cups.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Imam-ul-Haq attributes the team's turmoil to the loss against India.</li>
  <li>Pakistan suffered a humiliating defeat by 228 runs in the Asia Cup Super Four stage.</li>
  <li>The players' confidence plummeted post-Asia Cup, contributing to later failures in the ODI and T20 World Cups.</li>
  <li>Imam described seeing many players crying and some isolating themselves after the defeat.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A lot of boys were disheartened from there. I heard a lot of them crying during the World Cup; some had stopped smiling and locked themselves up in their hotel rooms.” - Imam-ul-Haq</blockquote>
<p>This incident illustrates the significant emotional and psychological impact that a high-stakes loss can have on a sports team, highlighting the importance of mental resilience in competitive sports.</p>]]></description>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In August 1831, people reported the Sun appearing in strange colors, which led to a two-year period of unusually cool weather globally. Recent research has identified the eruption's source, linking it to the Zavaritskii caldera on Simushir Island in the Kuril Islands.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The anomaly was likely caused by volcanic dust scattering sunlight.</li>
  <li>Temperatures dropped by approximately 1°C (1.8°F) globally.</li>
  <li>The eruption has been confirmed as highly explosive based on ice-core sample analysis.</li>
  <li>Collaboration with international colleagues provided critical ash samples for the study.</li>
  <li>The research highlights volcanoes' potential climatic impacts, which could disrupt global temperatures significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The moment in the lab when we analyzed the two ashes together, one from the volcano and one from the ice core, was a genuine eureka moment. I couldn’t believe the numbers were identical.</blockquote>
<p>This study emphasizes the need for preparedness and response strategies for potential future volcanic eruptions that could mimic the 1831 event.</p>]]></description>

<p>Princeton engineers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding how embryonic cells transition from symmetry to asymmetrical structures, unlocking new insights into developmental disorders. </p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery that transformation in cell organization can be predicted earlier than previously thought.</li>
<li>The researchers used stem cell models to study chemical signals that dictate embryonic development.</li>
<li>Identified early chemical signals that can predict whether cells will become part of the 'head' or 'tail' of an embryo.</li>
<li>Observations revealed a mechanism for cell sorting which explains how tail cells gather together.</li>
<li>The findings have potential implications for improving our understanding of mammalian development.</li>
<li>Future research may utilize these tools for additional developmental processes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is a ton of potential in these stem cell models for both basic science and applications that could improve human health.” - Harry McNamara</blockquote>
<p>Overall, this research opens exciting new avenues for the study of mammalian embryonic development and may enhance the understanding of related disorders.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 8, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Space.com</p>
<p>More than a month after a flooded data center at Stanford University knocked out data processing operations for two NASA sun-studying spacecraft, solar scientists are starting to regain access to information and images beamed to Earth by the instruments.</p>
<p>A restored database server is 'functioning adequately' with back-up servers ready for use, and data processing has begun from the time of the flooding incident going forward.</p>
<img src="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877111691583934900" alt="Imagery courtesy of the Solar Dynamics Observatory" />
<figcaption>Imagery courtesy of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is finally back online after the JSOC outage since November. Great news!</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>The flooding incident on November 26 damaged roughly 20% of the computer systems.</li>
  <li>The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) archives became inaccessible.</li>
  <li>The first stage of the processing pipeline for incoming data was restarted by December 20, but with reduced capacity.</li>
  <li>Despite the outage, the spacecraft continued to operate normally, meaning no science data was lost.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Restoration of the database servers that manage the storage of the billions of files in the JSOC repository is our first and foremost challenge — this is our highest priority."</blockquote>
<p>The team is awaiting replacement parts for other damaged data servers, which are expected to arrive soon, to assess recoverable data.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Not provided<br><strong>Source:</strong> CNN</p>
<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pia19968-large.jpg?c=original" alt="The NASA New Horizons' high-resolution enhanced color view captured a detailed perspective of the rocky, icy moon Charon." loading="lazy">
<figcaption>The NASA New Horizons' high-resolution enhanced color view captured a detailed perspective of the rocky, icy moon Charon.</figcaption>
<p>For decades, astronomers have tried to determine how Pluto acquired its unusually large moon Charon. New research suggests a “kiss and capture” collision occurred billions of years ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>Charon is about half the size of Pluto.</li>
<li>Research indicates that Pluto and Charon likely collided and briefly stuck together before separating.</li>
<li>This new behavior contrasts with typical collision scenarios, which are classified as 'hit and run' or 'graze and merge.'</li>
<li>The study could provide insight into how planets form and may indicate the presence of a subsurface ocean beneath Pluto's icy crust.</li>
<li>Charon and Earth’s moon both represent large fractions of the size of the bodies they orbit.</li>
<li>The collision may have occurred around 4 billion years ago, early in the solar system's history.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What we’ve discovered is something entirely different — a ‘kiss and capture’ scenario where the bodies collide, stick together briefly and then separate while remaining gravitationally bound.” – Adeene Denton</blockquote>
<p>This research challenges previous theories and opens new possibilities for understanding the formation of celestial bodies in the outer solar system.</p>]]></description>

Standing atop a platform at VLT, ESO Photo Ambassador Petr Horálek reaches towards a standout object in the sky. You may assume this bright body, like many others in the sky, to be a star, but it is in fact a planet in our solar system: the gas giant Jupiter. Closer to Earth, the four Unit Telescopes (UTs) that comprise the VLT can be seen in the background. Each UT features an 8.2-meter mirror and they operate synergistically to produce some of the sharpest views of the universe. Accompanying the four UTs are four smaller, movable Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) which have 1.8-meter mirrors. The Chilean Atacama desert once again proves its value as the ideal location for ESO's VLT. The remoteness of the observatory means that there is very little to no light pollution, which is vital for astronomy and also yields such breathtaking views. Credit: ESO/P.

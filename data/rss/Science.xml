<figcaption>Stargazers captured stunning views of various celestial events in 2024.</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>The Great North American Eclipse on April 8 covered many states from Mexico to Newfoundland.</li>
  <li>Comet 12P/Pons–Brooks, known as the Devil Comet, made its closest approach on June 2.</li>
  <li>Comet 13P/Olbers had its closest approach to Earth on July 20, being the brightest comet at that time.</li>
  <li>Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS) was highly anticipated and visible to the naked eye in October.</li>
  <li>Asteroids and meteorites struck various locations including South Africa and the Philippines, with significant sightings and reports.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It was similar to a rocky asteroid about the size of a car entering Earth's atmosphere at very high speed.” - Professor Roger Gibson</blockquote>
<p>This year was a remarkable one for astronomy enthusiasts as the multitude of celestial events captured widespread attention and provided stunning sights across the globe.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Speed of Human Thought Lags Behind Internet Connection, Study Reveals</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/human-brain.jpg?w=640" alt="human brain" width="640" height="360">
<figcaption>The researchers noted that the human brain processes sensory information from sight, smell and sound much more rapidly — about 100,000,000 times the rate that cognition does. (Representational image/Pixabay)</figcaption>
<p>A recent study indicates that the human brain processes thought at a significantly slower rate than the speed of information flow over the internet, highlighting the limitations of human cognition.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The human brain processes thought at approximately 10 bits per second, while typical Wi-Fi connections handle 50 bits per second.</li>
  <li>The study titled 'The unbearable slowness of being: Why do we live at 10 bits/s?' published in the journal Neuron.</li>
  <li>Neuroscientist Markus Meister argues that the study suggests the human brain is much slower than commonly believed.</li>
  <li>Humans can process sensory information much faster — at a rate of 100,000,000 times that of cognition.</li>
  <li>The researchers suggest that this slow pace of thought is linked to evolution and environmental needs.</li>
  <li>Some experts question the study's methodology and suggest it may underestimate the human nervous system's information flow.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is a bit of a counterweight to the endless hyperbole about how incredibly complex and powerful the human brain is… If you actually try to put numbers to it, we are incredibly slow.” - Markus Meister</blockquote>
<p>This study sheds light on the inherent limitations of human cognition and raises significant questions about the nature of human thought compared to technological processing speeds.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Scientists Just Proved Your Brain Operates at the Speed of a Snail—and It’s Shockingly Low</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date] <strong>Source:</strong> [Insert Source]</p>
<p>Recent research from <strong>Caltech</strong> reveals that the human brain processes conscious thought at just <strong>10 bits per second</strong>, a speed dramatically slower than the billion bits per second our senses can collect, prompting important questions about cognitive capabilities.</p>

<figcaption>This graphic illustrates the disparity between sensory input and conscious thought processing speeds.</figcaption>
<p><strong>The 10-Bit Bottleneck:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite having <strong>85 billion neurons</strong>, only <strong>10 bits per second</strong> are processed consciously.</li>
<li>This processing speed is significantly slower than modern technologies like Wi-Fi.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Every moment, we are extracting just 10 bits from the trillion that our senses are taking in,” said Markus Meister, highlighting the stark difference between brain capacity and processing speed.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Evolutionary Implications:</strong> The research suggests that this limitation evolved as early nervous systems focused on basic survival tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-task focusing exemplifies the brain's slow yet precise processing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our ancestors evolved in a world slow enough to make survival possible,” notes Zheng and Meister.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Impact on Future Technologies:</strong> The findings challenge expectations for brain-machine interfaces that aim to enhance communication speeds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Neural links would still be restricted by the brain's processing limit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future Research Directions:</strong> The study calls for more exploration into how the brain prioritizes sensory information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding this selection is crucial to unlocking human cognition's architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Redefining Intelligence:</strong> This study encourages defining intelligence not by speed but through an efficient and deliberate approach to processing information.</p>
<p>The findings reaffirm the complexity of human thought, revealing the balancing act between efficiency and precision in cognitive functions.</p>]]></description>

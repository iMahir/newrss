<figcaption>NASA Jet Propulsion Lab Under Siege as Wildfires Destroy Everything in Their Path. (Image Credit: NASA)</figcaption>
<p>The Pasadena-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of NASA was ordered to be evacuated due to the advancing Eaton Fire, which threatened to reach the facility.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Residents in the vicinity were also ordered to evacuate.</li>
  <li>The fire lines came within a mile of the lab, causing strong winds that prompted concern, although the lab has not suffered fire damage.</li>
  <li>JPL director Laurie Leshin expressed the impact on local residents, noting that many have lost their homes.</li>
  <li>The Eaton Fire has burned approximately 10,600 acres as of January 8, 2024, with zero percent containment reported.</li>
  <li>The wildfire has resulted in the evacuation of over fifty-one thousand residents and confirmed five fatalities.</li>
  <li>Despite the evacuation, JPL has managed to maintain communication with various NASA spacecraft through its emergency protocols.</li>
  <li>The lab is critical for ongoing planetary missions and will remain closed until further notice.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“No fire damage yet (there is some wind damage), but it is right next to the lab. Hundreds of JPLers have been evacuated from their homes, and many have lost homes.” - Laurie Leshin</blockquote>
<p>As Southern California faces severe wildfire conditions, the well-being of JPL employees and the community remains a top priority.</p>]]></description>

<p>NASA’s Mars Sample Return mission aims to collect Martian materials and deliver them to Earth, but plans have become more complicated and costly. Recently, NASA has proposed two options to expedite the sample return process, which could see the samples arrive by the late 2030s. However, a finalized plan will be left for the next administration.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mars Sample Return mission is designed to retrieve rocks, sand, and air from Mars.</li>
<li>Initial plans were found to be costly and time-consuming, prompting new proposals.</li>
<li>NASA is considering two alternative strategies for a more cost-effective approach.</li>
<li>The selected plan will be determined by the next administration in about 18 months.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Is the project on the rocks?”</blockquote>
<p>The future of the Mars Sample Return mission hangs in the balance as NASA seeks to balance scientific ambition with cost and practicality.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>SpaceX's vision for Mars colonization.</figcaption>
<p>This article reflects on Elon Musk's ambitious plans to colonize Mars by 2022, which remain unrealized as the projected timelines have continually shifted since 2016.</p>
<ul>
<li>Musk initially proposed travel to Mars at less than $100,000 per person, with a timeline for colonization starting in 2022.</li>
<li>By 2017, he had revised plans to land cargo on Mars, aiming to introduce humans to the planet by 2024.</li>
<li>The vision escalated from an initial colony of 80,000 to 1 million inhabitants over a span of 40 to 100 years.</li>
<li>Critiques highlight the disconnect between Musk's promises and actual achievements in space exploration.</li>
<li>The piece argues that Musk's approach reflects a pattern of unmet expectations reminiscent of other ventures he leads.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“...recognize Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities.”</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the article emphasizes the need for accountability in private space ventures, suggesting that misleading promises can erode public trust in legitimate scientific progress.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Thin films could make atomic clocks compact and portable.</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses significant advancements in the development of practical nuclear clocks, made possible by the successful use of thin-film technology that could considerably reduce the cost and radiation associated with thorium-229 isotopes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thin films of thorium tetrafluoride (ThF4) have been successfully used, marking a potential turning point in nuclear clock technology.</li>
<li>The new method minimizes the amount of radioactive thorium-229 needed for timekeeping.</li>
<li>Nuclear clocks, utilizing energy transitions in atomic nuclei, can provide ultra-precise timekeeping compared to existing optical atomic clocks.</li>
<li>The use of physical vapor deposition (PVD) produces even, thin layers of materials critical for clock function.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Thorium-229 by weight is more expensive than some of the custom proteins I’ve worked with,” said JILA researcher Jake Higgins.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, advancements in thin-film technology may soon make nuclear clocks more accessible for practical applications beyond the lab, promising improvements in precision timekeeping.</p>]]></description>

<p>A new method developed by a multidisciplinary team at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub captures the spatial organization of proteins within a human cell, enabling a greater understanding of cell function and disease response.</p>
<ul>
<li>The team achieved a detailed map of roughly 10,000 types of proteins within human cells.</li>
<li>The approach can track how proteins change locations during viral infections.</li>
<li>The study highlights the concept of spatial proteomics, aimed at understanding protein functions by mapping their locations.</li>
<li>The method, Organelle Profiling, allows for the analysis of proteins in relation to the cellular compartments.</li>
<li>Findings indicate that protein relocation may correlate with disease mechanisms, potentially guiding antiviral treatments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If we want to get the full picture of what’s going on in cells during disease, we need to think not only about measuring abundance, but also changes in spatial organization.” — Manuel Leonetti, senior author</blockquote>
<p>This comprehensive mapping not only enhances our understanding of cellular organization but also identifies potential targets for new therapies.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>We finally know where the Yellowstone volcano will erupt next</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 1, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Live Science</p>
<p>New research identifies the likely future eruption site of the Yellowstone supervolcano, indicating it will be on the northeastern side of the national park in hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study reveals melted magma is stored in four separate reservoirs beneath Yellowstone.</li>
  <li>The northeastern reservoirs, specifically near Sour Creek Dome, have magma that is in contact with hot mantle rocks, keeping it liquid.</li>
  <li>Modern research methods involving magnetotellurics allowed scientists to map pockets of magma more accurately than previous studies.</li>
  <li>Despite significant magma quantities, the caldera is not likely to erupt soon due to low concentrations of magma in pore spaces.</li>
  <li>Only when more than 40% of pore spaces are filled will the magma be able to mobilize and potentially initiate an eruption.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We have a much lower concentration of magma in these pore spaces, so a lot fewer of the pore spaces are filled with magma.” - Ninfa Bennington</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while significant magma is present, the timeline for a potential eruption remains uncertain, possibly taking tens of thousands of years.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Video about dark comets</figcaption>
<p>Astronomers are eagerly awaiting the 2025 launch of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is expected to enhance the discovery of dark comets—celestial bodies that lack traditional visibility.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dark comets, similar to regular comets, were first recognized in 2017.</li>
  <li>By 2023, seven dark comets were identified in the solar system.</li>
  <li>Rubin Observatory aims to detect these elusive objects with its advanced technologies.</li>
  <li>Dark comets provide insights into the early formation of the solar system.</li>
  <li>New discoveries could help understand planetary development and potential life origins on Earth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be instrumental in advancing research.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the advancements in detecting dark comets could significantly enhance our knowledge of the solar system's formation and the role of these mysterious objects in its history.</p>]]></description>

<p>NASA's Parker Solar Probe has made history by surviving its closest approach to the Sun, flying within 3.8 million miles and transmitting crucial data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The probe reached a speed of 430,000 mph, covering the distance from Japan to the US in under a minute.</li>
<li>It successfully transmitted telemetry to mission control after its historic flyby on December 24, 2024.</li>
<li>The spacecraft withstood extreme temperatures of over one million degrees Fahrenheit thanks to its innovative heat shield.</li>
<li>NASA plans more flybys in 2025 to further explore the solar corona.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This mission is ushering a new golden era of space exploration, bringing us closer than ever to unlocking the Sun’s deepest and most enduring mysteries.” - Nour Rawafi, Project Scientist for Parker Solar Probe</blockquote>
<p>The successful telemetry and data collection mark a significant milestone in solar exploration, paving the way for future discoveries about our home star.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://cf-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/visualstory/wp/2025/01/cropped-Reuters-RTXN3QPITG-1735895250733.jpg" alt="Quadrantid Meteor Shower" />
<figcaption>Quadrantid Meteor Shower</figcaption>
<p>The Quadrantid meteor shower is set to peak tonight, providing a stellar display for sky gazers. This annual phenomenon, likely originating from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Quadrantids occur every year, typically peaking in early January.</li>
  <li>They originate from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, a fragment of a comet.</li>
  <li>Known for their sharp peak, they can produce bright meteors that may appear blue.</li>
  <li>The meteors radiate from near Boötes and the Big Dipper’s handle.</li>
  <li>Best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere, away from city lights.</li>
  <li>Quadrantids travel at approximately 41 km/s (25 miles per second).</li>
  <li>First observed in the 1820s and named after the now-defunct Quadrans Muralis constellation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The Quadrantids are known for their sharp peak, lasting only a few hours, but they can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</blockquote>
<p>Tonight’s viewing conditions could offer impressive displays for those in favorable locations, making it a perfect time for astronomy enthusiasts.</p>]]></description>

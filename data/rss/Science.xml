<p><strong>New Delhi: </strong>NASA has revealed breathtaking images of two star clusters, NGC 602 and NGC 2264, resembling festive decorations. These clusters allow astronomers to observe stellar birth in contrasting cosmic environments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The images from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and James Webb Space Telescope show surrounding gas and dust formations.</li>
  <li>NGC 602, located 200,000 light-years away in the Small Magellanic Cloud, displays young stars in an ionised gas region.</li>
  <li>NGC 2264 is known as the “Christmas Tree Cluster” and is about 2,500 light-years away, showcasing a conical shape resembling a Christmas tree.</li>
  <li>The data offers insights into star formation and the life cycle of stars.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These cosmic images paint how beautiful and intricate the process of star formation is.”</blockquote>
<p>NASA's continuous exploration extends our knowledge of the universe's mysteries, shedding light on the processes of star formation and evolution.</p>]]></description>

<p>This Christmas, the asteroid NEO 2024 YP will pass Earth at a dangerously close distance, raising concerns among scientists as it moves at high speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The asteroid 2024 YP will fly past Earth at a distance of approximately 994,398 km on Christmas Day, 2024.</li>
<li>Discovered on December 19, 2024, it belongs to the Apollo group of asteroids.</li>
<li>2024 YP is considered a potentially hazardous object, but no collision threat is currently identified.</li>
<li>The asteroid has a low absolute magnitude of 27.085, indicating its small size.</li>
<li>Orbital characteristics show it takes about 1.33 Earth years to complete an orbit around the Sun.</li>
<li>Future approaches are anticipated, with the next close encounter predicted in April 2033.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This Christmas flyby is a good wake-up call for NEO observation and planetary defence measures.”</blockquote>
<p>The close approach of asteroid 2024 YP highlights the importance of planetary defense efforts and the need for ongoing observation of near-Earth objects.</p>]]></description>

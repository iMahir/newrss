<p>Axiom Space, in collaboration with NASA, has updated its assembly plans for its commercial space station to expedite the process and minimize dependence on the International Space Station (ISS). The restructured plans aim to establish a free-flying commercial destination ahead of the ISS's planned retirement in 2030.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The revised strategy involves launching the Payload, Power, and Thermal modules towards the ISS by 2028, marking the inception of the Axiom Station.</li>
  <li>Axiom's modified assembly will include an airlock and additional habitat modules after departing from the ISS.</li>
  <li>NASA will maintain its scientific experiments in partnership with Axiom Space throughout this transition.</li>
  <li>Other commercial projects like Boeing’s Orbital Reef and Starlab's initiatives are underway, ensuring ongoing missions in Low Earth Orbit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The revised plans allow Axiom Space to depart from the ISS earlier, ensuring that the ISS can stick to its planned deorbit timelines.”</blockquote>
<p>This strategic shift underscores the acceleration of commercial space exploration and the necessary adjustment as international cooperation in orbit transforms.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Parker Solar Probe is set to make history as it approaches within 6.1 million kilometers of the Sun, breaking its own record.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spacecraft will conduct the closest approach to the Sun ever on 24 December 2024.</li>
<li>This record surpasses the previous closest distance of 6.3 million kilometers achieved in July 2023.</li>
<li>The probe's systems are reported to be in good health ahead of the flyby.</li>
<li>Ground teams will regain contact with the probe after it transmits a health beacon on 27 December.</li>
<li>NASA’s mission aims to provide insights into solar processes and enhance understanding of space weather.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is one example of NASA’s bold missions, doing something that no one else has ever done before to answer longstanding questions about our universe.” - Arik Posner, Parker Solar Probe Program Scientist</blockquote>
<p>This mission not only has immediate scientific significance but also promises to shape future research on solar phenomena.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Researchers reveal how human eyelashes encourage water drainage</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 20, 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> Science Advances</p>
<p>This study reveals the unique hydrodynamic properties of human eyelashes, demonstrating their role in maintaining clean eyesight by effectively draining excess moisture.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eyelashes are composed of a flexible array of hydrophobic fibers.</li>
  <li>They facilitate the rapid removal of moisture from the eyes, preserving visual acuity.</li>
  <li>Research was conducted by a team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</li>
  <li>A quantitative model was created to understand the elastic forces affecting eyelash function.</li>
  <li>The findings may inspire the design of new waterproof devices and aesthetic products.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The mechanism governing moisture drainage is due to the fiber array’s heterogeneous elastic deformations and multi-scale asymmetric structures.” - Prof. JIANG Lei</blockquote>
<p>This research enhances our understanding of the functional significance of eyelashes, suggesting they play an essential role in eye care during activities like exercise.</p>]]></description>

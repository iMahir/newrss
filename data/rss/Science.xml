            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Boltz-1: A Model to Predict Biomolecular Structures</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 17, 2024<br/><strong>Source:</strong> MIT News</p>
<p>MIT scientists have introduced Boltz-1, an innovative open-source AI model aimed at predicting biomolecular structures with high accuracy, similar to existing models while encouraging community collaboration.</p>
<img src='https://gcorso.github.io/assets/boltz1_image.jpg' alt='Visualization of Boltz-1'>
<figcaption>Visualization demonstrating the effectiveness of Boltz-1 in protein structure prediction.</figcaption>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Boltz-1 is the first fully open-source model achieving performance on par with AlphaFold3.</li>
  <li>The model was developed by the MIT Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health.</li>
  <li>Researchers focused on improving prediction efficiency and accuracy through new algorithms.</li>
  <li>Boltz-1's entire development pipeline is open-sourced for further scientific collaboration.</li>
  <li>MIT researchers call for community contributions to enhance Boltz-1 continuously.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We hope for this to be a starting point for the community...This is not the end of the line. We want as much contribution from the community as we can get.” - Gabriele Corso</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Boltz-1 represents a significant leap in the field of biomolecular prediction, fostering open collaboration among researchers for future advancements.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Published on:</strong> December 16, 2023, <strong>Source:</strong> The Astrophysical Journal</p>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116395242,imgsize-23490,width-400,resizemode-4/116395242.jpg" alt="NASA James Webb Space Telescope" />
<figcaption>Image source: NASA</figcaption>
<p>The recent findings from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope reveal that planets can form and survive in environments that are much harsher than previously believed. This challenges long-held theories about planet formation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>James Webb Telescope findings suggest long-lasting planet-forming disks exist around stars with low heavy elements.</li>
  <li>Planet-forming disks can survive for tens of millions of years, providing ample time for planets to form.</li>
  <li>Research challenges traditional models that argue planets cannot form in metal-poor environments.</li>
  <li>Implications extend to understanding planet formation in the early universe, potentially dating back to shortly after the Big Bang.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This implies that planets could have begun forming at a much earlier stage in the universe’s history than previously thought.” - Guido De Marchi</blockquote>
<p>The discovery revolutionizes our understanding of planet formation and opens new avenues for research in astronomy, particularly regarding the early universe and the origins of our solar system.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Three asteroids are making close passes by Earth in December 2024.</figcaption>
<p>On December 17, 2024, three asteroids will approach Earth, presenting unique scientific research opportunities. The asteroids include 2022 YO1, 2024 XR6, and 2024 XC17, all deemed non-threatening to the planet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asteroids 2022 YO1, 2024 XR6, and 2024 XC17 are set for close encounters with Earth.</li>
<li>2022 YO1 will approach within 7,56,604 kilometers and measures 2.6–5.9 meters.</li>
<li>2024 XR6, measuring 12–26 meters, will pass at about 15 million kilometers away.</li>
<li>2024 XC17, measuring 9.1–20 meters, will come within 7.8 million kilometers.</li>
<li>All asteroids pose no threat to Earth and will provide research opportunities for astronomers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Astronomers are tracking the asteroids with advanced systems to study their trajectories, sizes, and compositions, enhancing understanding of near-Earth dynamics.</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming flybys of these asteroids present an excellent opportunity for scientific observation without endangering Earth.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Twins Were Common for Ancient Primate Ancestors, Study Finds</h1><p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> Publication Date: Not specified, Source: Not specified</p><p>Twins have been rare in human history and for that reason can seem special. Many cultures associate twins with health and vitality, while others see them as a philosophical reminder of the duality of life and death, good and evil.</p><p>Our recent research suggests that twins were actually the norm much further back in primate evolution, rather than an unusual occurrence worthy of note. Despite the fact that almost all primates today, including people, usually give birth to just one baby, our most recent common ancestor, which roamed North America about 60 million years ago, likely gave birth to twins as the standard.</p><ol><li>Twins were the norm for ancient primate ancestors about 60 million years ago.</li><li>The switch to singletons occurred early on, at least 50 million years ago, and was advantageous for primates to develop only one fetus per pregnancy.</li><li>Having a single offspring allowed for larger bodies and brains, crucial for complex learning.</li><li>Rates of twins have almost doubled in the US over the past 50 years due to advances in assistive reproductive technologies.</li><li>Having twins today can be dangerous for both the mother and babies, with more than half of all twins in the US being born prematurely.</li></ol><blockquote>Our findings don’t mean that having twins today is a disadvantage — although, as a mother of multiples, Tesla can certainly say it’s not easy. But having twins today is quite a different experience from our tiny primate ancestors birthing in the trees 60 million years ago.</blockquote><p>Despite these risks, our research shows that twins are a critical part of our genetic history.</p>]]></description>

In this scenario, the seed and the pump are fully integrated together with the amplifier on to a silicon photonics platform. The device is deployed on a satellite orbiting a planet in or outside the solar system and generates high-power light of around 1.9 μm to map out the chemical makeup of the planet's atmosphere. The inset shows a large mode region in the amplifier where the mode is 10s of μm<sup>2</sup>, which allows large energy extraction from the silicon photonics-based LMA amplifier.&nbsp;Image Credit: Neetesh Singh et al.</em></figcaption>
<p>Researchers in Germany, led by Dr. Neetesh Singh and Prof. Franz Kärtner, have developed a high-power tunable laser on silicon photonics, achieving nearly 2 Watts of output power. This innovation could impact the field of space exploration significantly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The development utilizes a large-mode-area integrated waveguide amplifier.</li>
  <li>The technology aims to replace traditional benchtop systems, reducing size, weight, and cost.</li>
  <li>Potential applications include detecting vital molecules in space using small-scale satellites.</li>
  <li>This study supports the EU Horizon 2020 Framework Program along with German research initiatives.</li>

<p>A powerful X1.8 solar flare erupted on January 4, 2025, recorded by NOAA’s Solar Ultraviolet Imager. Such intense flares disrupt Earth’s communications and endanger astronauts in orbit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flares occur when magnetic energy stored in the Sun is released.</li>
<li>Solar flares are classified into five categories: A, B, C, M, and X.</li>
<li>X-class flares are the most intense, with a numerical value indicating their magnitude.</li>
<li>NOAA’s SUVI provided critical observations due to data inaccessibility from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory.</li>

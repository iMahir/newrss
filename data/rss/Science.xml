<p>A NASA astronaut must be prepared for various scenarios, including the unfortunate event of a death in space. This article sheds light on the protocols NASA follows in such situations and highlights the importance of training for astronauts.</p>
<ul>
<li>A NASA astronaut must follow specific protocols if a colleague dies in space.</li>
<li>Chris Hadfield explains the necessity of 'death simulations' that are part of astronaut training.</li>
<li>If death occurs during an EVA, the body must be brought into the airlock and kept in a pressurized suit.</li>
<li>The body is stored away to prevent odor from decomposition affecting the rest of the crew.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Are NASA astronauts trained for death in space? Yes, NASA astronauts are trained on what to do if a death occurs in space, and the related activities surrounding it.”</blockquote>
<p>This preparation underscores NASA's commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of its astronauts, even in the most dire situations.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption><p>Energy diagram for the C2H5 + S reaction. Values in square brackets indicate energies for the same well in the C2H5 + O reaction studied in Vazart et al. (2020). Insets correspond to the structures at the potential wells. We note that the products cy-CH2SCH2 + H and C2H3SH + H are almost isoenergetic.</p></figcaption>
<p>In recent years the chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium has experienced a renewed interest due to the detection of a large variety of molecules containing sulfur. This article reports the first identification in space of thioacetaldehyde (CH<sub>3</sub>CHS), which is the sulfur counterpart of acetaldehyde (CH<sub>3</sub>CHO).</p>
<ul>
<li>Seven individual lines were detected corresponding to the rotational transitions of CH<sub>3</sub>CHS in the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz).</li>
<li>Assuming a rotational temperature of 9 K, a column density of 9.8e10 cm<sup>-2</sup> for CH<sub>3</sub>CHS was derived.</li>
<li>CH<sub>3</sub>CHS is 36 times less abundant than its oxygen counterpart CH<sub>3</sub>CHO.</li>
<li>Hydrogenation seems to be less favored for S-bearing molecules compared to O-bearing ones in cold sources like TMC-1.</li>
<li>The chemical model used underestimates the observed abundance of thioacetaldehyde.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>By comparing the column densities of the O- and S-bearing molecules detected in TMC-1, it was found that as these molecules increase their degree of hydrogenation, sulfur-bearing molecules become less abundant.</blockquote>
<p>This discovery highlights the complexities of astrochemical processes in space, particularly how sulfur and oxygen-bearing molecules behave differently in the interstellar medium.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/zowpbPSVSEQ/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Play Video">
<figcaption>A video discussing the findings</figcaption>
<p>The extinction of many kangaroo species in Australia may have been more directly linked to human activities rather than climatic changes. This conclusion is drawn from fossil evidence indicating that kangaroos had adaptable diets, suggesting human hunting played a critical role in their extinction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study analyzed 937 kangaroo teeth specimens, revealing varied diets that contradict previous beliefs about their vulnerability to climate change.</li>
<li>The timing of human arrival in Australia coincides with the decline of kangaroo populations, strengthening the argument that hunting was a major factor.</li>
<li>Future research leveraging similar dental analyses could lend insights into the dietary habits of other extinct species and their extinction causes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The evidence suggests these animals had varied diets, making them more resilient to environmental changes.”</blockquote>
<p>This study posits that human impacts may have overshadowed environmental factors in driving kangaroo extinction, prompting a re-evaluation of the causes of past megafaunal extinctions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Pluto and Charon Formed Through a Unique 'Kiss and Capture' Collision</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date</strong>: Not specified | <strong>Source</strong>: Earth.com</p>
<p>Billions of years ago, two celestial bodies collided in the solar system, leading to the formation of Pluto and its moon, Charon, through a process referred to as 'kiss and capture'. A recent study from the University of Arizona challenges previous theories regarding their formation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study challenges previous assumptions about how Pluto and Charon were formed.</li>
  <li>Researchers discovered that the materials in these bodies behave differently than previously thought, resulting in a 'kiss and capture' scenario.</li>
  <li>The collision preserved the integrity of Pluto and Charon, contradicting older models of planetary formation.</li>
  <li>Tidal forces from the collision may have led to the development of a subsurface ocean on Pluto.</li>
  <li>This research has implications for understanding planetary formation and could apply to other celestial bodies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Most planetary collision scenarios are classified as ‘hit and run’ or ‘graze and merge.’ What we’ve discovered is something entirely different – a ‘kiss and capture’ scenario.” - Adeene Denton</blockquote>
<p>This discovery reshapes theories of planetary system formation and highlights new processes that govern the evolution of celestial bodies.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A montage of the samples collected by Perseverance on Mars. (Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS).</figcaption>
<p>NASA has changed its approach for returning the samples collected by the Perseverance Rover to maximize the success of the attempt. The rover has stashed one copy of the collected samples in a depot and carries the other with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>NASA will pursue two different strategic plans for formulating the return program, with confirmation expected by the second half of 2026.</li>
<li>Perseverance is now tasked with delivering the samples to the lander instead of having a retrieval rover.</li>
<li>NASA is exploring two options for delivering the lander: the sky crane method and utilizing novel commercial capabilities.</li>
<li>A nuclear power source will be used instead of solar panels to simplify the mission.</li>
<li>The Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) is expected to execute the first rocket launch from the surface of Mars.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The financial viability of the complex mission has been questioned by auditors."</blockquote>
<p>In summary, NASA is collaborating with ESA for the Mars sample return mission, aiming for a streamlined approach to successfully bring Mars samples back to Earth. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Prepare for the Spectacle of Comet Atlas C/2024 G3 in 2025</h1><p><strong>Date:</strong> Sat 11th Jan, 2025</p><p>Following the recent Quadrantids meteor shower, skywatchers will soon be treated to another dazzling celestial event: the arrival of comet Atlas C/2024 G3. This comet is set to reach its perihelion, the point in its orbit where it comes closest to the sun, on January 13, 2025. Coincidentally, it will also be at its nearest point to Earth on the same date, making it a potential candidate for the title of the brightest comet of the year. With no other comets expected to be visible to the naked eye in 2025, this event is one not to be missed.</p><ul><li>Discovered on April 5, 2024, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas).</li><li>Comet C/2024 G3 comes from the Oort Cloud, a distant region at the fringes of our solar system.</li><li>Set to be approximately 13.5 million kilometers from the sun at perihelion.</li><li>Could achieve a brightness of magnitude -4.5, similar to Venus, and likely visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere.</li><li>Its structural integrity is a concern due to the intense heat it will experience near the sun.</li><li>Visible just after sunset on January 13, 2025, in the southern hemisphere.</li><li>Experts advise caution when attempting to observe the comet, particularly in regard to viewing conditions and safety precautions.</li></ul><blockquote>Experts recommend that only experienced astronomers attempt to view C/2024 G3, as looking directly at the sun without appropriate filters can result in serious eye damage.</blockquote><p>For those in the northern hemisphere, viewing conditions will be challenging, and the use of binoculars or telescopes may enhance the experience for southern observers.</p>]]></description>

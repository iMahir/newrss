            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NASA releases long-term strategy for robotic Mars exploration</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 11, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> NASA</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has unveiled a new strategy to enhance robotic exploration of Mars, proposing a series of smaller, science-driven missions to prepare for future human exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nasa's 20-year plan encourages low-cost missions at each launch opportunity.</li>
<li>The strategy introduces three key science themes: searching for life, supporting human exploration, and understanding Mars as a dynamic planetary system.</li>
<li>Smaller missions are expected to cost between $100 million and $300 million each and will focus on specific scientific questions.</li>
<li>The plan emphasizes collaboration with commercial and international partners.</li>
<li>Nasa's 2025 budget proposal includes $40 million for Mars robotic exploration technologies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We want to do that with lower-cost missions that are science driven and has the capability of providing flexible, rapid response to discoveries.” - Becky McCauley Rench</blockquote>
<p>This strategy is aimed at expanding our understanding of Mars and lays the groundwork for future human missions to the planet, emphasizing scientific inquiry and innovative partnerships.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>A New Method to Detect Dehydration in Plants</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 1, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Nature Communications</p>
<p>Researchers at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) have developed a breakthrough sensor technology that can detect drought stress in plants in real-time, allowing for timely interventions to prevent crop loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of the world's first covalent organic framework (COF) sensors integrated within silk fibroin microneedles for in-planta detection of physiological pH changes.</li>
<li>The sensors can detect early signs of drought stress, providing warnings up to 48 hours in advance compared to traditional methods.</li>
<li>This technology aims to enhance agricultural practices amidst challenges such as climate change and reduced resources.</li>
<li>The integration of COF-based sensors and biomaterials facilitates seamless monitoring of plant health.</li>
<li>The findings are published in an open-access paper titled “Chromatic Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling In-Vivo Chemical Tomography.”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This type of sensor can be easily attached to the plant and queried with simple instrumentation. It can therefore bring powerful analyses into the hands of farmers and researchers alike.” - Professor Michael Strano</blockquote>
<p>This new sensor technology represents a significant advancement in precision agriculture, potentially optimizing crop production and resilience to drought.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Discovered: Batch of asteroids between Mars, Jupiter</figcaption>
<p>Astronomers have discovered a vast population of small asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter using archival images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>
<ul>
  <li>The newly discovered asteroids range in size from that of a bus to several stadiums.</li>
  <li>These asteroids, termed “decametre,” collide with Earth 10,000 times more often than larger asteroids.</li>
  <li>A total of 138 new decametre asteroids were found, along with eight previously known asteroids.</li>
  <li>NASA has identified two asteroids, 2024 XY5 and 2024 XB6, passing near Earth on December 16, 2024.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“An asteroid just tens of metres in size exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, releasing 30 times more energy than the atomic bomb detonated over Hiroshima.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, this discovery enhances the understanding and tracking of smaller asteroids that may approach Earth.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SpaceX's 31st Dragon Cargo Capsule Departs ISS to Head Home to Earth</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 16, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Space.com</p>
<p>SpaceX's 31st robotic cargo mission is on its way back to Earth, after successfully undocking from the International Space Station (ISS) this morning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Dragon cargo capsule undocked at 11:05 a.m. EST, beginning deorbit burns to complete its mission.</li>
  <li>It will splash down off the coast of Florida tomorrow, December 17, with thousands of pounds of equipment and samples from ISS research.</li>
  <li>The spacecraft is currently the only cargo craft capable of safely returning cargo to Earth, while others incinerate upon reentry.</li>
  <li>CRS-31 delivered 6,000 pounds of supplies for NASA's astronauts at the ISS in November.</li>
  <li>NASA can quickly retrieve the Dragon after splashdown to continue research on the returned experiments.</li>
  <li>Today's undocking was delayed from its original schedule due to bad weather in the splashdown zone.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“NASA will be able to retrieve the CRS-31 Dragon spacecraft relatively quickly after splashdown tomorrow, reaping the benefits of any experiments in need of quick attending following atmospheric reentry.”</blockquote>
<p>This mission is crucial for ongoing research and supply to astronauts on the ISS, highlighting the importance of commercial partnerships in space exploration.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Preserving Our Martian Heritage: A Call from Leading Scientists</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Date Not Provided <strong>Source:</strong> The Guardian</p>
<p>Leading researchers emphasize the importance of preserving human artifacts on Mars as part of our species' historical record of space exploration. They warn that current and future missions must consider the impact on existing sites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists assert that artifacts and debris left on Mars represent significant historical markers.</li>
<li>Natural weathering and potential disturbances from missions threaten these sites.</li>
<li>Preservation of these items is crucial for documenting humanity's history of exploration.</li>
<li>Past significant missions like Apollo 11 and Venera 7 also warrant protection due to their heritage status.</li>
<li>Experts suggest a need for a systematic approach to record and map space heritage across different celestial bodies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Each dispersal event represents key moments in our species’ long history of migration.” - Dr. Justin Holcomb</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, safeguarding our Martian heritage is deemed vital for future generations' understanding of our exploratory legacy.</p>]]></description>

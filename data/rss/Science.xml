<figcaption>Reasons of rays</figcaption>
<p>Rays are rays of energy of a certain kind that travel in either form of a wave or a particle. It is also possible to categorize them by their nature, the wavelength or the source. <mark>Rays have wide usage in many natural occurrences and in technology as well.</mark> Below are the main types of rays and the reasons behind their generation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electromagnetic Rays</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gamma Rays:</strong><br>- <em>Reason:</em> That originates from radioactive decay, nuclear reactions as well as from extra terrestrial events, supernovas and black hole events.<br>- <em>Uses:</em> Sterilization, cancer treatment and astronomy.</li>
<li><strong>X-Rays:</strong><br>- <em>Reason:</em> Emitted when a high-speed electron, or beta particle, hits a metal surface, or during changes of an atom’s inner electrons.<br>- <em>Uses:</em> X rays, Scanning machines.</li>
<li><strong>Ultraviolet (UV) Rays:</strong><br>- <em>Reason:</em> Associated with stars, or artificial UV lamps, emitted in the process of high-energy interactions.<br>- <em>Uses:</em> Sterilization of equipment, tanning and bio recognition of materials.</li>
</ul>

<p>An international team of researchers has identified a complex of gold and sulphur that aids in understanding how gold makes its way to the surface of the Earth. The study reveals the conditions under which gold-enriched magmas rise to the surface from deep within the mantle, particularly in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where volcanic activity is prevalent.</p>
<ul>
<li>The research focused on understanding the movement of gold from the mantle to the Earth's surface via magma.</li>
<li>It identified a gold-trisulphur complex that forms under specific pressure and temperature conditions below active volcanoes.</li>
<li>The study utilized numerical modeling to demonstrate how this complex is crucial for transporting gold during volcanic activity.</li>
<li>A paper detailing these findings has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>Coauthor Adam Simon highlighted the novelty of the thermodynamic model that supports the existence of this gold-trisulphur complex.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This thermodynamic model that we’ve now published is the first to reveal the presence of the gold-trisulfur complex that we previously did not know existed at these conditions.” - Adam Simon</blockquote>
<p>This discovery provides a greater understanding of how gold concentrations reach significant levels in subduction zone environments and contributes to the broader field of geological and planetary science.</p>]]></description>

<p>Nasa is closely observing a vast region known as the South Atlantic Anomaly where Earth's magnetic field is significantly weaker, posing risks to spacecraft in low-Earth orbit.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The South Atlantic Anomaly is a region where Earth's magnetic field is weaker than usual.</li>
  <li>This anomaly poses risks to spacecraft due to increased exposure to charged particles.</li>
  <li>Satellite operators often take protective measures as they approach the anomaly.</li>
  <li>Nasa aims to understand the nature of the anomaly and its effects on charged particles.

<p>The first is a total lunar eclipse on March 14, which will be invisible in India. The second is a partial solar eclipse on March 29, which will also not be seen from India. However, Indian astronomy enthusiasts can look forward to a full lunar eclipse between September 7 and 8, visible in India. The final event is a partial solar eclipse between September 21 and 22, viewable only in New Zealand and surrounding areas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>March 14: Total lunar eclipse (invisible in India)</li>
  <li>March 29: Partial solar eclipse (invisible in India)</li>
  <li>September 7-8: Full lunar eclipse (visible in India)</li>
  <li>September 21-22: Partial solar eclipse (invisible in India)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Indian astronomy lovers can be thrilled by the fact that the full lunar eclipse between September 7 and 8 will be visible in the country,” said Dr. Rajendra Prakash Gupt.</blockquote>
<p>This year 2024 has already provided four celestial events including a penumbral lunar eclipse, total solar eclipse, partial lunar eclipse, and annular solar eclipse.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while 2025 will showcase several eclipses, Indian viewers will only get to experience one.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Earth’s Largest Waterfall: The Hidden Denmark Strait Cataract</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A <strong>Source:</strong> Earth.com</p>
<p>This article explores the Denmark Strait cataract, the largest waterfall on Earth, which is submerged beneath the Arctic Ocean. Unlike traditional waterfalls, this underwater cascade plays a vital role in global ocean circulation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Denmark Strait cataract has a vertical drop of 11,500 feet, making it three times taller than Angel Falls.</li>
  <li>It stretches approximately 300 miles wide and is crucial for oceanic heat distribution and regulating the planet's climate.</li>
  <li>The cataract was formed during the last Ice Age, shaped by glacial movements.</li>
  <li>With a flow of 3.2 million cubic meters per second, it surpasses the discharge of the Amazon River.</li>
  <li>This phenomenon remains undetected without advanced oceanographic tools, highlighting the hidden powers of nature.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What happens here is felt everywhere. The flow creates a ripple effect that connects ecosystems and climates around the globe.” - Anna Sanchez Vidal</blockquote>
<p>The Denmark Strait cataract showcases the unseen yet significant natural processes that shape our planet, emphasizing the importance of understanding these underwater phenomena.</p>]]></description>

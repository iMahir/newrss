            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Is the Wheel of Ghosts an Ancient Observatory? New Study Suggests Otherwise</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Gadgets 360</p>
<p>The ancient Rujm el-Hiri site, known as the 'Wheel of Ghosts,' has been reassessed, leading researchers to question its identification as an astronomical observatory due to significant geodynamic changes over millions of years.</p>
<h2>Geophysical Insights Challenge Established Theories</h2>
<p>The study reveals that movements over 150 million years have altered the site's alignment, straying from celestial patterns. Led by Dr. Olga Khabarova and Prof. Lev Eppelbaum, the researchers concluded that historical interpretations regarding its orientation do not align with solstices or other astronomical markers.</p>
<h2>Advanced Techniques Reveal Archaeological Landscape</h2>
<p>Through geomagnetic analysis and satellite technology, the team documented archaeological features near the Sea of Galilee. Unique circular structures alongside burial mounds indicate potential agricultural uses rather than ceremonial roles.</p>
<h2>A Broader Perspective on Rujm el-Hiri's Role</h2>
<p>Dr. Michal Birkenfeld stated that this research enriches the understanding of ancient life, encouraging further exploration of community-environment interactions.</p>

<p>As the US and China prepare for lunar bases, potential disputes over resources and claims could arise due to existing space laws.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both nations plan to establish long-term bases on the moon.</li>
  <li>Disputes might emerge regarding the location of lunar bases and resource extraction.</li>
  <li>International space law is complex, with various treaties governing exploration rights.</li>
  <li>The Outer Space Treaty states space is free for exploration by all states.</li>
  <li>The Moon Agreement restricts ownership of lunar resources but is not signed by major spacefaring nations.</li>
  <li>The Artemis Accords aim to establish guidelines for lunar resource use.</li>
  <li>Legal responsibility for pollution applies even as spacecraft travel beyond our solar system.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Countries will want to extract this ice because it can be turned into rocket fuel for onward journeys and for life support... the prospect of 'space water wars' is actually nearer..."</blockquote>
<p>This article explores the implications of space law as nations aim for a new space race, highlighting the urgent need for clear regulations to prevent conflict over extraterrestrial resources.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Multi-object grasping increases pick-and-place efficiency (📷: J. Eom et al.)</figcaption>
<p>The development of a new robotic gripper by researchers at Seoul National University promises to enhance the efficiency of robotic operations by allowing robots to handle multiple objects simultaneously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing robotic systems struggle with precise manipulation of multiple objects, whereas humans can perform this task effortlessly.</li>
<li>The new robotic hand employs a dual system: fingers for grasping and conveyor belts for transporting items.</li>
<li>Trials demonstrated up to 34% time savings and up to 71% reductions in travel distances for robotic arms.</li>
<li>This design approach focuses on functionality rather than complex mimicry of human movements.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The efficiency gains of this novel robotic system were demonstrated in both commercial and domestic trials."</blockquote>
<p>This development represents a significant step toward creating more functional and versatile robots for various applications.</p>]]></description>

<p>A large team of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has found evidence that suggests the moon had a magnetic field around 2 billion years ago, based on studies of rock samples returned by the Chang'e-5 lunar mission.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The research analyzed lunar rock samples to investigate the moon's magnetic field history.</li>
  <li>The moon, currently lacking a global magnetic field, had a weak field generated by thermomechanical convection in its interior.</li>
  <li>Past missions suggested the moon had a magnetic field approximately 4 billion years ago; this study extends the timeline to 2 billion years ago.</li>
  <li>The magnetic field measurements indicated values between 2,000 to 4,000 nanoteslas, suggesting longer volcanic activity and potential for ancient water.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The moon's magnetic field would have shielded water on the surface from solar wind, preserving it in shadowed regions.</blockquote>
<p>This discovery enhances our understanding of the moon's geological history and its internal processes.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The Lyrid meteor shower - NASA</figcaption>
<p>The Quadrantids meteor shower, one of the finest meteor showers, is visible throughout early January and will end on January 12. This article offers tips on how to catch this stunning display.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The meteor shower is best viewed on the West Coast of the U.S. and in the Pacific region.</li>
  <li>Robert Massey from the Royal Astronomical Society notes that a thin crescent moon allows for better visibility this year.</li>
  <li>The Quadrantids are associated with the near-Earth asteroid 2003 EH1, with debris burning up as meteors.</li>
  <li>During the peak, up to 70 to 80 meteors can be seen per hour, including a notable number of bright fireballs.</li>
  <li>To view the shower, find a dark spot away from city lights and avoid using binoculars or telescopes for a wider view.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They have a pretty strong intensity if you happen to be in the right place at the right time…” - Robert Massey</blockquote>
<p>Don't miss out on this New Year treat; enjoy the meteor shower with good weather and dark skies!</p>]]></description>

<figcaption><em>Optically bistable nanocrystals can store information that is written and read entirely through light, making them useful for building small and scalable optical memory units. These nanocrystals are controlled by lasers: one delivers continuous power, while the other triggers them to emit light after a brief pulse. This functionality mimics the behavior of electronic transistors and paves the way for devices where light controls light. Image Credit: Artiom Skripka, OSU College of Science</em></figcaption>
<p>Scientists at Oregon State University have identified luminescent nanocrystals that can quickly switch between light and dark states, which holds potential for advancements in optical computing and memory technologies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study was published in <em>Nature Photonics</em>.</li>
  <li>Avalanching nanocrystals exhibit highly non-linear light emission properties.</li>
  <li>Controlled by lasers, these nanocrystals mimic electronic transistor behavior.</li>
  <li>Research could lead to more efficient optical communication and artificial intelligence processing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The extraordinary switching and memory capabilities of these nanocrystals may one day become integral to optical computing…”</em> - Artiom Skripka, Assistant Professor, Oregon State University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These nanocrystals may be key in reducing energy consumption in electronic devices and data centers as they can operate on low power.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the findings are promising, further research is necessary for real-world applications.</p>]]></description>

<p>Researchers have developed a copper-based catalyst that converts carbon dioxide to acetaldehyde with 92% efficiency, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional methods.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The catalyst was created by a public-private consortium led by Cedric David Koolen and others.</li>
  <li>Acetaldehyde is primarily derived from ethylene, a process with a significant carbon footprint.</li>
  <li>This new electrochemical reduction method effectively addresses CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemicals.</li>
  <li>The catalyst shows promise for scalability and cost-effectiveness in industrial applications.</li>
  <li>During testing, it maintained performance and selectivity over multiple cycles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>The Wacker process effectively hasn’t changed in the past 60 years. It is still based on the same basic chemistry. The time was ripe for a green breakthrough.</em> - Cedric David Koolen</p></blockquote>
<p>This breakthrough could transform industries reliant on acetaldehyde, including pharmaceuticals and agriculture, while reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Significantly older than previously believed. Full moon rising over Istanbul. (photo credit: kadir tezel. Via Shutterstock)</figcaption>
<p>The research, published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08231-0" target="_blank" rel="">Nature</a>, reveals that the Moon may have formed up to 4.51 billion years ago, over 80 million years earlier than earlier estimates. This could change understanding of lunar history and geology.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Moon's age has been recalculated based on crystalline inclusions found in rock samples.</li>
  <li>Previous lunar age estimates derived from Apollo mission samples suggested a cooling age of 4.35 billion years.</li>
  <li>The Moon's formation is linked to a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body named Theia.</li>
  <li>Gravitational interactions have caused dynamic changes in the Moon's orbit and heating of its crust.</li>
  <li>The study indicates that the Moon's surface age reflects a remelting event rather than its original formation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Moon 'would seem to have formed very late, 200 million years after the beginning of the solar system...'" - Alessandro Morbidelli, co-author of the study.</blockquote>
<p>China's upcoming Chang'e 6 mission aims to return samples from the far side of the Moon, which could provide further insights into its true age.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Video on PDS 70b study.</figcaption>
<p>This research on PDS 70b, an exoplanet 400 light-years away, reveals significant discrepancies in its atmospheric chemistry, prompting a reevaluation of traditional planet formation theories.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PDS 70b is nearly three times larger than Jupiter.</li>
  <li>The planet has lower carbon and oxygen levels than expected.</li>
  <li>Research suggests PDS 70b may have formed differently than previously thought.</li>
  <li>Future observations of PDS 70c could shed more light on planet formation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This discrepancy highlights potential oversimplifications in the widely accepted models of planetary formation.” - Dr Chih-Chun Hsu</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the findings urge scientists to examine more systems to refine our understanding of how planets develop.</p>]]></description>

The black hole, detected just 800 million years after the Big Bang, has a mass 400 million times that of the Sun.</p><ul><li>The massive black hole accounts for about 40% of its host galaxy's total mass.</li><li>It is accreting gas at a rate significantly below its theoretical maximum limit.</li><li>This discovery challenges current models of black hole formation, suggesting they may spend long periods of dormancy after bursts of rapid growth.</li><li>The black hole's dormancy makes it harder to detect, as it does not emit significant light.</li></ul><blockquote><p><em>Even though this black hole is dormant, its enormous size made it possible for us to detect. Its dormant state allowed us to learn about the mass of the host galaxy as well. The early universe managed to produce some absolute monsters, even in relatively tiny galaxies.</em></p><footer>- Ignas Juodžbalis, Study Lead Author, Kavli Institute for Cosmology, University of Cambridge</footer></blockquote><p>The findings indicate that black holes may not only be formed through the remnants of dead stars but could also be 'born big'.</p><blockquote><p><em>It is possible that black holes are ‘born big’, which could explain why Webb has spotted huge black holes in the early universe. But another possibility is they go through periods of hyperactivity, followed by long periods of dormancy.</em></p><footer>- Roberto Maiolino, Study Co-Author and Professor, University of Cambridge</footer></blockquote><p>The researchers believe that the low luminosities of dormant black holes suggest many more such massive black holes could exist undetected in the early universe.</p><p>The research was funded in part by the European Research Council and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Scientists Are Stunned by Juno’s Groundbreaking Discovery Beneath Io’s Volcanic Surface</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2024-02-25 <strong>Source:</strong> NASA</p>
<p>Navigating close to Io, Juno's recent flybys revealed that the moon's volcanic eruptions are driven by localized magma chambers rather than a global magma ocean.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, featuring over 400 active volcanoes.</li>
  <li>Juno's close flybys in late 2023 and early 2024 allowed scientists to gather precise gravitational data.</li>
  <li>The study found that Io's tectonic activity is significantly influenced by tidal flexing from its orbit around Jupiter.</li>
  <li>Local magma chambers are the source of its eruptions, challenging previous theories of a vast magma ocean.</li>
  <li>The findings have implications for understanding other celestial bodies, including Europa and Enceladus.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface.” - Scott Bolton</blockquote>
<p>This discovery not only clarifies Io's volcanic mechanics but also shapes future planetary exploration strategies.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 18, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Space.com</p>
<img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ubdgzQzzQHv3w3KTc2cAN-320-80.png" alt="infrared telescope photo showing a bright yellow-orange ring in deep space that represents a planet-forming disk">
<figcaption>Observations of the exoplanet PDS 70b taken with ALMA that show it being tailed by a cloud of dust, indicating a "Trojan planet" called PDS 70c (Image credit: ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO) /Balsalobre-Ruza et al.)</figcaption>
<p>Astronomers have discovered that planets can significantly differ from the gas and dust from which they are born, challenging the prevailing model of planet formation. This finding came from a study of PDS 70b, a gas giant discovered in the protoplanetary disk surrounding its star.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study was led by Northwestern University researchers.</li>
<li>PDS 70b is three times the mass and diameter of Jupiter and is located 369 light-years away.</li>
<li>Scientists expected the carbon and oxygen ratios in the planet's atmosphere to match those in the protoplanetary disk, but found them to be much lower.</li>
<li>The findings suggest that the accepted model of planet formation may be overly simplistic.</li>
<li>Future research will focus on PDS 70c, a companion planet to PDS 70b.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For observational astrophysicists, one widely accepted picture of planet formation was likely too simplified,” said Chih-Chun “Dino” Hsu of Northwestern University.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the discovery of PDS 70b's unique composition prompts a reevaluation of the models that explain how planets form from their natal materials.</p>]]></description>

<p>New research by NASA’s Juno probe has shed light on the intense volcanism observed on Jupiter's moon Io, revealing that each of its volcanoes is likely powered by individual magma chambers.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Io is known for having around 400 volcanoes that are almost continuously active.</li>
    <li>The findings offer new insights into the origin of volcanic activity first discovered in 1979 by Voyager I.</li>
    <li>The Juno mission made close flybys of Io in 2023 and 2024 to collect critical data.</li>
    <li>Research indicates that the heating mechanisms do not point to a shared global ocean of magma.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface. Was there a shallow ocean of white-hot magma fueling the volcanoes, or was their source more localized?” - Scott Bolton, Principal Investigator of the Juno mission.</blockquote>
<p>The Juno research enhances our understanding of Io’s geological processes and its unique volcanic landscape, continuing to unravel the mysteries of this fascinating moon.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/sgvfmh/article68950335.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/15istb%20Simon_Marius%202.jpg" alt="This portrait of Marius appeared as a frontispiece (illustration facing the title page of a book) to the Mundus Iovialis." width="100%">
<figcaption>This portrait of Marius appeared as a frontispiece to the <i>Mundus Iovialis</i>. It also shows Jupiter’s moons in orbit around the planet – something that Galileo didn’t include in his book. | Photo Credit: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS</figcaption>
<p>Simon Marius, a 17th-century astronomer, is known for naming the four largest moons of Jupiter despite being overshadowed by Galileo, who claimed to have discovered them first. The debate over Marius' contributions continues today.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Marius was an astronomer, mathematician, physician, and calendar maker born in 1573 in Gunzenhausen, Germany.</li>
    <li>He independently observed Jupiter's moons on December 29, 1609, claiming to see “four tiny stars” aligned with the planet.</li>
    <li>In 1614, Marius published <i>Mundus Iovialis</i>, detailing his findings including Jupiter’s moons and the Andromeda Galaxy.</li>
    <li>His suggested names for the moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—were influenced by the work of Johannes Kepler.</li>
    <li>Galileo accused Marius of plagiarism in 1623, resulting in ongoing debate about Marius' contributions to astronomy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“While it is nigh impossible for us to determine if Marius does deserve credit for independently discovering the four major satellites of Jupiter, there’s no doubt that he was the one who gave them the names that are now in use.”</blockquote>
<p>The legacy of Simon Marius highlights the complexities of scientific discovery and the importance of acknowledgment in the history of astronomy. Despite controversies, his contributions to the naming of Jupiter’s moons remain significant.]]></description>

</figure>
<p>A groundbreaking study suggests that Uranus and Neptune may conceal vast oceans beneath their atmospheres, potentially up to 5,000 miles deep, which could revolutionize our understanding of these ice giants.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Research led by Burkhard Militzer from UC Berkeley utilized advanced computer simulations.</li>
    <li>Layered structure proposed: thick hydrogen-helium atmosphere, deep ocean of water, and compressed hydrocarbons.</li>
    <li>The presence of these oceans may explain the unique magnetic fields of these planets as observed by NASA's Voyager 2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications for the search for extraterrestrial life</h2>
<p>The discovery raises potential for habitable environments on icy moons, such as Miranda, which might harbor subsurface oceans.</p>

<h2>Advancements in planetary modeling</h2>
<p>Militzer's team developed a model simulating 540 atoms under extreme conditions, aligning with Voyager 2's measurements, enhancing the credibility of the new theory.</p>
<blockquote>"One day, I looked at the model, and the water had separated from the carbon and nitrogen. What I couldn’t do 10 years ago was now happening." - Burkhard Militzer</blockquote>
<h2>Future exploration and confirmation</h2>
<p>NASA proposes a flagship mission to confirm the existence of these oceanic layers by 2034, taking advantage of a rare planetary alignment for faster travel.</p>
<p>These findings reshape our understanding of ice giants and expand the possibilities for extraterrestrial life.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter has been repurposed as a weather station on Mars.</figcaption>
<p>The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, originally deployed by NASA for flight testing, will now function as a weather station after sustaining damage during its 72nd flight. Despite losing its flying capabilities, the helicopter's systems remain operational for data collection.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The helicopter suffered rotor damage during its last flight on January 18, 2024.</li>
    <li>Ingenuity will record telemetry and take images every sol as a weather station.</li>
    <li>The navigation system struggles with uniform Martian terrain, complicating safe landings.</li>
    <li>Communication relies on the Perseverance rover, located 3 kilometers away.</li>
    <li>Ingenuity can potentially operate for up to 20 years, collecting valuable data.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"She's now going to continue on as a weather station of sorts, recording telemetry and taking images every sol." - Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity's project manager</blockquote>
<p>As Ingenuity's mission transitions, JPL is now considering the development of a new six-rotor Mars helicopter designed for extended scientific exploration.</p>]]></description>

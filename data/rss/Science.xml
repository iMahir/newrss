<figcaption>Experts warn about the growing space debris crisis.</figcaption>
<p>Earth's orbital environment faces escalating risks due to increased space debris accumulation, with experts urging immediate actions to avoid a crisis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Over 10,200 active satellites are currently in orbit, with many in low Earth orbit (LEO).</li>
  <li>SpaceX's Starlink network contributes significantly to satellite numbers, planning to reach 40,000 satellites.</li>
  <li>More than 40,500 debris objects over 10 cm and an estimated 130 million smaller fragments threaten space operations.</li>
  <li>The Orbital Sustainability Act (ORBITS) has been introduced in Congress to address the lack of global satellite regulations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Without immediate intervention, Earth's low Earth orbit could become unusable.” - Dan Baker</blockquote>
<p>Experts stress the need for coordinated global action to protect the future of space operations and science.</p>]]></description>

<p>Scientists are raising alarms over risks posed by synthetic 'mirror life' bacteria, urging an immediate halt to such research due to potential global health risks associated with these organisms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A group of 38 scientists, including Nobel laureates, warns against the creation of 'mirror' microbes.</li>
  <li>Mirror bacteria could evade immune defenses and spread uncontrollably.</li>
  <li>Existing antibiotics may be ineffective against these theoretical organisms.</li>
  <li>The scientists propose global discussions to address the potential risks.</li>
  <li>Researchers caution that advancements in biotechnology may lead to mirror bacteria within the next decade.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Unless compelling evidence emerges that mirror life would not pose extraordinary dangers, we believe that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms, even those with engineered biocontainment measures, should not be created.” - Report from scientists</blockquote>
<p>The report highlights the need for proactive safety measures in scientific exploration concerning synthetic biology.</p>]]></description>

<p>Astronomers have identified a highly unusual celestial object, named GLEAM-X J0704–37, that emits regular bursts of radio waves every 2.9 hours—the longest interval ever observed for this type of source.</p>
<ul>
<li>The discovery was made using older data from the Murchison Widefield Array and analysed with observations from the MeerKAT radio telescope.</li>
<li>The bursts are highly organised and polarised, resembling emissions from pulsars.</li>
<li>GLEAM-X J0704–37 is different due to its long emission period and its association with a faint M-dwarf star.</li>
<li>Researchers believe the radio bursts are generated by powerful magnetic fields within the system.</li>
<li>It's suggested that it might be part of a rare binary system featuring an M-dwarf and a white dwarf.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is an exciting discovery because it shows how little we understand about such long-period radio transients,” said the research team.</blockquote>
<p>This discovery opens up possibilities for studying magnetic field interactions and unusual stellar systems, leading to potential fresh insights into the diversity of objects in our universe.</p>]]></description>

<p>NASA scientists have discovered a black hole tipped onto its side in the galaxy NGC 5084, after investigating it like a cosmic crime scene using Hubble and Chandra telescopes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The black hole is located around 80 million light-years from Earth in the Virgo constellation.</li>
  <li>It rotates unexpectedly in relation to its galaxy and has an unusual cross-shaped structure from plasma plumes.</li>
  <li>The discovery was aided by a new image analysis technique called SAUNAS.</li>
  <li>Follow-up observations revealed a dusty ring at the galaxy's center, indicating a black hole rotated at a 90-degree angle.</li>
  <li>The current theory suggests a collision with another galaxy could have caused the black hole to be knocked over.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,” said Pamela Marcum, Ames Research Center astrophysicist.</blockquote>
<p>This unique finding emphasizes the potential of archival data and innovative analysis techniques in uncovering new astronomical phenomena.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Is the 'missing link' black hole in Omega Centauri real?</h1>

<img src='https://img.youtube.com/vi/qlivLiUjeNY/hqdefault.jpg' alt='Play Video'>
<figcaption>Watch video for more insights.</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses recent research that casts doubt on the existence of an intermediate-mass black hole in Omega Centauri, suggesting instead that high-velocity stars may be influenced by a cluster of stellar-mass black holes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial findings indicated an intermediate-mass black hole with a mass of 8,200 solar masses in Omega Centauri.</li>
  <li>Reanalysis implies the mass could be less than 6,000 solar masses.</li>
  <li>Pulsar data was used to enhance measurements of gravitational dynamics within the cluster.</li>
  <li>Future research may benefit from advancements in pulsar timing techniques.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The likelihood of an intermediate black hole now appears slim.” - Justin Read, University of Surrey</blockquote>
<p>While the existence of the black hole remains unconfirmed, researchers are optimistic about future discoveries in black hole research and pulsar formation.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New Study Reveals Moon is 100 Million Years Older Than Previously Thought</h1>

<figcaption>Image source: BBC</figcaption>
<p>A recent study published in Nature challenges the long-held belief about the moon's age, suggesting it could be 4.51 billion years old—about 100 million years older than the previous estimate of 4.35 billion years. This finding offers new insights into the moon's history and the early solar system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The moon may have formed 4.51 billion years ago based on new research.</li>
  <li>Previous assumptions were based on geological dating of lunar rocks returned by Apollo missions.</li>
  <li>The study emphasizes the role of Earth's gravitational interaction causing remelting of lunar rocks.</li>
  <li>Zircon mineral evidence supports an older age dating back to the Earth-moon forming event.</li>
  <li>Future lunar missions are expected to gather more information to refine these findings.</li>
  <li>This older timeline enhances our understanding of the solar system’s history.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The history of the moon is important for understanding the origin of the solar system as well.” - Carsten Munker, University of Cologne</blockquote>
<p>This new understanding could reshape the narrative around lunar formation and provide context to the solar system's origins, emphasizing the significance of future research in this domain.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The Moon started out molten and then cooled down, only to be reheated roughly 100 million years later. This heating event could have reset most of the ages recorded by lunar rocks. - Francis Nimmo</figcaption>
<p>The study discusses how new perspectives on the Moon's history may change scientists' understanding of its formation. The research explores tidal heating effects and challenges existing estimations concerning the Moon's age.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Moon's formation is linked to a Mars-sized object colliding with Earth.</li>
  <li>Initial Moon rocks suggest the Moon is about 4.35 billion years old, but this may not reflect its actual age.</li>
  <li>The research proposes that tidal heating might reset radiometric clocks in lunar rocks.</li>
  <li>Further analysis and samples from ongoing lunar missions may provide clarity on the Moon's formation timeline.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the Moon warmed up enough, its clocks would lose their memory and would start recording time only once the Moon cooled down again.”</blockquote>
<p>The implications of these findings could reshape our understanding of planetary formation and the early solar system's dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Scientists Discover Twin Stars For First Time Near Black Hole In Center Of Our Galaxy</figcaption>
<p>Scientists from the University of Cologne have, for the first time, recorded a binary star system that orbits a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The binary star system, named D9, is located near the black hole Sagittarius A, about 27,000 light-years from Earth.</li>
  <li>This discovery utilized methods based on the Doppler effect to study the stars' movements.</li>
  <li>The D9 system is approximately 2.7 million years old.</li>
  <li>The findings provide insights into how supermassive black holes influence star dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Scientists hope continued research on the D9 system will unlock further knowledge about gravitational interactions near supermassive black holes.</blockquote>
<p>This discovery opens new doors to understanding the structure and behavior of our galaxy, potentially revealing other hidden phenomena in the heart of the Milky Way.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NASA Cameras to Capture Interaction Between Blue Ghost, Moon’s Surface</h1>
<p><strong>Date Published:</strong> Thursday, December 19, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> WEBWIRE</p>
<p><img itemprop="image" alt="SCALPSS Cameras" height="180" width="240" src="//img.youtube.com/vi/n-iLjvhaKxc/hqdefault.jpg"><figcaption>Image courtesy of Firefly. The six SCALPSS cameras mounted around the base of Blue Ghost will collect imagery during and after descent and touchdown.</figcaption></p>
<p>NASA is set to launch its Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume-Surface Studies (SCALPSS), designed to observe the interaction between a lunar lander's rocket plume and the surface of the Moon.</p>
<ul>
<li>SCALPSS 1.1 will employ six cameras to create 3D imagery of the Moon’s surface during and after landing.</li>
<li>This mission follows a previous one, SCALPSS 1.0, which failed to capture plume interactions due to landing complications.</li>
<li>The cameras will record data to help scientists understand how lunar landers affect the Moon’s surface.</li>
<li>The project underscores NASA's efforts to maintain safety for multiple landers operating near each other on future missions.</li>
<li>SCALPSS 1.1 is funded by NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate’s Game Changing Development Program.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If we’re placing things – landers, habitats, etc. – near each other, we could be sand blasting what’s next to us...” - Michelle Munk, Principal Investigator for SCALPSS</blockquote>
<p>This project aims to enhance safety and effectiveness of future lunar missions by providing crucial data on lander interactions with the lunar surface.</p>]]></description>

<p>The research, published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08231-0" target="_blank" rel="">Nature</a>, reveals that the Moon may have formed up to 4.51 billion years ago, over 80 million years earlier than earlier estimates. This could change understanding of lunar history and geology.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Moon's age has been recalculated based on crystalline inclusions found in rock samples.</li>
  <li>Previous lunar age estimates derived from Apollo mission samples suggested a cooling age of 4.35 billion years.</li>
  <li>The Moon's formation is linked to a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body named Theia.</li>
  <li>Gravitational interactions have caused dynamic changes in the Moon's orbit and heating of its crust.</li>
  <li>The study indicates that the Moon's surface age reflects a remelting event rather than its original formation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Moon 'would seem to have formed very late, 200 million years after the beginning of the solar system...'" - Alessandro Morbidelli, co-author of the study.</blockquote>
<p>China's upcoming Chang'e 6 mission aims to return samples from the far side of the Moon, which could provide further insights into its true age.</p>]]></description>

<p>Astronomers using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope have explored the surrounding environment of quasar 3C 273 in unprecedented detail, revealing new features that may enhance our understanding of these powerful celestial objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quasars are extremely luminous astronomical entities, powered by supermassive black holes.</li>
<li>The latest observations highlighted “weird things” in the quasar’s vicinity, including blobs and a mysterious L-shaped filament.</li>
<li>Quasar 3C 273 is the closest known quasar, located 2.5 billion light-years from Earth, emitting more energy than the brightest elliptical galaxies.</li>
<li>Hubble’s advanced instruments allowed researchers to examine fine details of the quasar’s host galaxy, unveiling dusty disks and intricate interactions.</li>
<li>The recent study sets the stage for future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Thanks to Hubble’s observing power, we’re opening a new gateway into understanding quasars.” - Bin Ren</blockquote>
<p>The insights gained from observing quasar 3C 273 enhance our understanding of the cosmic processes that shape galaxies and quasars throughout the universe.</p>]]></description>

</figure>
<p>Two European satellites were launched on a mission to simulate total solar eclipses, aiming to enhance our understanding of solar activity and the sun's corona.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) from southern India.</li>
  <li>The Proba-3 mission will test precision formation flying with satellites operating 150 meters apart.</li>
  <li>Planned artificial eclipses will allow for detailed observation of the sun without its overwhelming brightness.</li>
  <li>Each eclipse can last up to six hours, compared to the few minutes of natural eclipses.</li>
  <li>The project aims to gather 1,000 hours of totality over its two-year mission.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For six hours at a time, it will be able to see the sun's faint atmosphere, the corona...,” ESA stated.</blockquote>
<p>This mission represents a significant step in solar research and is supported by over 40 European companies.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://www.nasa.gov/image.jpg" alt="Gamma-ray flare from black hole M87">
<figcaption>Image Credit: NASA</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses a rare gamma-ray flare detected from the supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy M87, offering new insights into the physical mechanisms of particle acceleration near black holes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The flare was emitted from the black hole in 2018 and lasted approximately three days.</li>
  <li>It marked the first gamma-ray flaring event observed from this source in over a decade.</li>
  <li>The flare's photons reached energy levels of several teraelectronvolts (TeV).</li>
  <li>The emission region was estimated to be about ten times the size of the black hole.</li>
  <li>The findings were part of an international observational campaign involving over 25 telescopes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We were lucky to detect a gamma-ray flare from M87 during this Event Horizon Telescope’s multi-wavelength campaign.” - Giacomo Principe</blockquote>
<p>This discovery underscores the significance of collaborative research in astrophysics and opens avenues for further studies on supermassive black holes.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The Jovian moon of Io is the most volcanic body in the Solar System. (Image Credit: NASA).</figcaption>
<p>Io is a moon of Jupiter with an estimated 400 volcanoes that continuously erupt, covering its surface in volcanic material. Observations from NASA's Juno probe suggest that each volcano is powered by its own magma chamber, rather than a shared subsurface magma ocean. This discovery helps to clarify the origins of Io's volcanic activity, a question that has puzzled scientists since the Voyager I mission in 1979.</p>
<ul>
<li>Io is the most volcanic body in the Solar System, featuring around 400 volcanoes.</li>
<li>The research indicates that volcanoes on Io are powered by separate magma chambers.</li>
<li>This finding challenges previous assumptions of a global ocean of magma beneath Io's surface.</li>
<li>The data was collected during close flybys of Io in 2023 and 2024 by the Juno spacecraft.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface.” - Scott Bolton</blockquote>
<p>This research provides vital insights into the geological activities of Io and will likely influence future explorations and studies of volcanic bodies in our Solar System.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>An illustration of cosmic rays. (Image Credit: Columbia University).</figcaption>
<p>New research has unraveled the mysterious origins of some cosmic rays, with implications for astrophysics and particle physics.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study explores the connection between magnetic turbulence in the solar wind and ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</li>
    <li>Ultra-high energy cosmic rays can reach energy levels exceeding 10<sup>20</sup> electron volts.</li>
    <li>The findings suggest that magnetic turbulence from supernova shocks may generate these high-energy particles.</li>
    <li>The research was published in <em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and involved a team including Luca Comisso.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These findings help solve enduring questions that are of great interest to both astrophysicists and particle physicists about how these cosmic rays get their energy.” - Luca Comisso</blockquote>
<p>This research provides insights into the extreme environments that produce some of the universe's most energetic particles, adding to our understanding in the fields of astrophysics and particle physics.</p>]]></description>

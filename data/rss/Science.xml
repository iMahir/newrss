<p>This article explores the growing competition between the US and China to establish bases on the Moon and the potential conflicts that could arise from current gaps in space law.</p>
<ul>
<li>The US and China are planning to set up long-term research stations on the Moon.</li>
<li>Legal complexities arise regarding claims to lunar resources like water ice.</li>
<li>The Outer Space Treaty suggests space is free for all nations to explore but complicates national claims.</li>
<li>International agreements like the Moon Agreement have limited support from major spacefaring nations.</li>
<li>Disputes over resource extraction may lead to 'space water wars'.</li>

<figcaption>Quadrantid Meteor Shower</figcaption>
<p>The Quadrantid meteor shower is set to peak tonight, providing a stellar display for sky gazers. This annual phenomenon, likely originating from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Quadrantids occur every year, typically peaking in early January.</li>
  <li>They originate from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, a fragment of a comet.</li>
  <li>Known for their sharp peak, they can produce bright meteors that may appear blue.</li>
  <li>The meteors radiate from near Boötes and the Big Dipper’s handle.</li>
  <li>Best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere, away from city lights.</li>
  <li>Quadrantids travel at approximately 41 km/s (25 miles per second).</li>
  <li>First observed in the 1820s and named after the now-defunct Quadrans Muralis constellation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The Quadrantids are known for their sharp peak, lasting only a few hours, but they can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</blockquote>
<p>Tonight’s viewing conditions could offer impressive displays for those in favorable locations, making it a perfect time for astronomy enthusiasts.</p>]]></description>

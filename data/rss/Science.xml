<p>NASA's Parker Solar Probe has made history by surviving its closest approach to the Sun, flying within 3.8 million miles and transmitting crucial data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The probe reached a speed of 430,000 mph, covering the distance from Japan to the US in under a minute.</li>
<li>It successfully transmitted telemetry to mission control after its historic flyby on December 24, 2024.</li>
<li>The spacecraft withstood extreme temperatures of over one million degrees Fahrenheit thanks to its innovative heat shield.</li>
<li>NASA plans more flybys in 2025 to further explore the solar corona.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This mission is ushering a new golden era of space exploration, bringing us closer than ever to unlocking the Sun’s deepest and most enduring mysteries.” - Nour Rawafi, Project Scientist for Parker Solar Probe</blockquote>
<p>The successful telemetry and data collection mark a significant milestone in solar exploration, paving the way for future discoveries about our home star.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article discusses a novel method developed by chemists at Rice University for incorporating chlorine into various chemical products, utilizing sustainable catalysts and mild conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The researchers created a photocatalytic method using iron and sulfur catalysts, activated by mild blue light, for more efficient chlorination.</li>
  <li>The method operates at room temperature, eliminating the need for harsh chemicals and high temperatures commonly used in chlorination.</li>
  <li>This technique allows for precise control over chlorine placement, enhancing product purity and reducing purification costs.</li>
  <li>A new method for incorporating the stable hydrogen isotope deuterium may bolster drug stability and efficacy.</li>
  <li>The study was led by Julian West, with significant contributions from Rice students and faculty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>Our method uses sustainable, low-cost catalysts and operates at room temperature with gentle blue light. It provides a targeted, efficient way to chlorinate molecules without conventional approaches’ environmental and purification challenges.</em> - Julian West</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s exciting that this method could open new doors for modifying pharmaceuticals and natural products in ways that weren’t possible with older techniques.</em> - Julian West</p></blockquote>
<p>The research offers promising implications for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, emphasizing sustainability and efficiency in chemical processes.</p>]]></description>

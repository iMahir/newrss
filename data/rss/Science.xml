<p>The University of Michigan’s latest study suggests that organic solar cells, made from carbon-based materials, could outperform traditional silicon and gallium arsenide cells in space. These organic cells show resilience against radiation, making them suitable for space missions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic materials demonstrate no degradation after three years of radiation exposure.</li>
<li>Silicon semiconductors suffer performance drops due to proton irradiation.</li>
<li>Proton radiation can create electron traps that degrade solar cell efficiency.</li>
<li>Organic solar cells are lighter and more flexible than their silicon counterparts.</li>
<li>Thermal annealing may help repair radiation damage, but further research is needed to understand self-healing in space.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Silicon semiconductors aren’t stable in space because of proton irradiation coming from the sun.” - Yongxi Li</blockquote>
<p>The findings represent a significant advancement in solar technology for extraterrestrial use, encouraging further exploration into the reliability and application of organic solar cells in future space missions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory back online after 2024 data center flood</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 8, 2025</p>

<p>More than a month after a flooded data center at Stanford University knocked out data processing operations for two NASA sun-studying spacecraft, solar scientists are starting to regain access to information and images beamed to Earth by the instruments.</p>
<p>A restored database server is 'functioning adequately' with back-up servers ready for use, and data processing has begun from the time of the flooding incident going forward.</p>
<img src="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877111691583934900" alt="Imagery courtesy of the Solar Dynamics Observatory" />
<figcaption>Imagery courtesy of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is finally back online after the JSOC outage since November. Great news!</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>The flooding incident on November 26 damaged roughly 20% of the computer systems.</li>
  <li>The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) archives became inaccessible.</li>
  <li>The first stage of the processing pipeline for incoming data was restarted by December 20, but with reduced capacity.</li>
  <li>Despite the outage, the spacecraft continued to operate normally, meaning no science data was lost.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Restoration of the database servers that manage the storage of the billions of files in the JSOC repository is our first and foremost challenge — this is our highest priority."</blockquote>
<p>The team is awaiting replacement parts for other damaged data servers, which are expected to arrive soon, to assess recoverable data.</p>]]></description>

You may assume this bright body, like many others in the sky, to be a star, but it is in fact a planet in our solar system: the gas giant Jupiter.

<p>A recent study indicates that the composition of magma may influence volcanic tremors during eruptions at the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands. Conducted by researchers from the American Museum of Natural History and City University of New York, the study emphasizes the utility of volcanic ash analysis as a forecasting tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study details how silica levels in magma relate to the volcano's tremor intensity.</li>
<li>Gathered samples captured 94% of the eruption timeline, allowing for unprecedented chemical analysis.</li>
<li>The findings could improve eruption forecasting and hazard assessment measures globally.</li>
<li>Coordination challenges during eruptions must be overcome for effective petrological monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If our findings hold true for other volcanoes, we might be able to monitor interior magma properties from the surface of an eruption...” - Samantha Tramontano</blockquote>
<p>This research bridges the gap between chemical data and physical eruption characteristics, providing new insights into volcanic activity.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pia19968-large.jpg?c=original" alt="The NASA New Horizons' high-resolution enhanced color view captured a detailed perspective of the rocky, icy moon Charon." loading="lazy">
<figcaption>The NASA New Horizons' high-resolution enhanced color view captured a detailed perspective of the rocky, icy moon Charon.</figcaption>
<p>For decades, astronomers have tried to determine how Pluto acquired its unusually large moon Charon. New research suggests a “kiss and capture” collision occurred billions of years ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>Charon is about half the size of Pluto.</li>
<li>Research indicates that Pluto and Charon likely collided and briefly stuck together before separating.</li>
<li>This new behavior contrasts with typical collision scenarios, which are classified as 'hit and run' or 'graze and merge.'</li>
<li>The study could provide insight into how planets form and may indicate the presence of a subsurface ocean beneath Pluto's icy crust.</li>
<li>Charon and Earth’s moon both represent large fractions of the size of the bodies they orbit.</li>
<li>The collision may have occurred around 4 billion years ago, early in the solar system's history.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What we’ve discovered is something entirely different — a ‘kiss and capture’ scenario where the bodies collide, stick together briefly and then separate while remaining gravitationally bound.” – Adeene Denton</blockquote>
<p>This research challenges previous theories and opens new possibilities for understanding the formation of celestial bodies in the outer solar system.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>NASA has unveiled a new strategy for the Mars Sample Return Program. (AP File)</figcaption>
<p>NASA's Perseverance Rover has collected numerous soil samples on Mars, but details regarding their return to Earth are limited. The process involves a two-phase approach, where decisions will ultimately be made by then-US President Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Mars Sample Return Program will likely have two phases: sample retrieval and transportation.</li>
    <li>Key cost and time factors will be influenced by the chosen method, which relies on technology differences.</li>
    <li>NASA has received 11 studies on possible methods for sample transport from the Mars Sample Return Strategic Review Team.</li>
    <li>The decision-making will rest with President Trump in late 2026, amidst budgets and political considerations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>NASA aims to significantly reduce the program's cost and duration while unlocking secrets about Mars and the universe.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, this event will shape the future exploration of Mars and may unlock crucial scientific understanding, but the timing and method remain uncertain.</p>]]></description>

<p>Researchers from Texas A&M University have developed a new flame-retardant coating for cotton that can be applied in a single step, which may help save lives and property.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The coating uses a polyelectrolyte complex that reduces the flammability of cotton.</li>
  <li>This technology can be tailored for various textiles and is suitable for industrial applications.</li>
  <li>Current methods require multiple steps, increasing costs and time.</li>
  <li>The new approach uses ammonia as a volatile base to induce chemical reactions on cotton.</li>
  <li>The technology is non-toxic and environmentally friendly.</li>
  <li>Continued research may lead to applications in wood, fabric, foam, and more.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This cutting-edge research offers Texas A&M recognition as one of the leaders of this technology and the opportunity for further development with external companies,” said Dr. Jaime Grunlan.</blockquote>
<p>This flame-retardant coating technology represents a significant advancement in enhancing everyday safety through innovative materials science.</p>]]></description>

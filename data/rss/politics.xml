<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations/2023/8/17/23832734/trump-indictment-democracy-paradox">indicted four times</a> — including two indictments arising out of his failed attempt to steal the 2020 election. One of these indictments <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections">even yielded a conviction</a>, albeit on 34 relatively minor charges of falsifying business records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the extraordinary protections the American system gives to sitting presidents will ensure that Trump won’t be going to prison. He’s going to the White House instead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The federal charges against Trump are doomed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two of the indictments against Trump are federal, and two were brought by state prosecutors in New York and Georgia. The federal indictments (one about Trump’s role in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/1/23810131/trump-indictment-charges-jan-6-jack-smith-supreme-court">fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, and the other about his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360735/trump-classified-documents-case-cannon-dismissed-indictment">handling of classified documents</a>) are the most immediately vulnerable. Once Donald Trump becomes president, he will have full command and control over the US Department of Justice, and can simply order it to drop all the federal charges against him. Once he does, those cases will simply go away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House does have a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/restoring-integrity-independence-u-s-justice-department/">longstanding norm of non-interference with criminal prosecutions</a>, but this norm is nothing more than that — a voluntary limit that past presidents placed on their own exercise of power in order to prevent politicization of the criminal justice system. As president, Trump is under no constitutional obligation to obey this norm. He nominates the attorney general, and he can fire the head of the Justice Department at any time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, Trump is reportedly considering Judge Aileen Cannon, a judge who has consistently tried to sabotage one of the Justice Department’s prosecutions of Trump, to be <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-tossed-trumps-classified-docs-case-list-proposed/story?id=114997807">the next US attorney general</a>. Cannon, who oversees Trump’s federal classified documents’ trial, even tried to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga">disrupt the Justice Department’s investigation into Trump</a> before he was indicted. There’s no indication that her apparent loyalty to Trump would diminish if she becomes the nation’s top prosecutor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The fate of the state charges is a little more uncertain, but they are unlikely to amount to anything either</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fate of the state charges against Trump is a little more uncertain, in large part because there’s never been a state indictment of a sitting president before, so there are no legal precedents governing what happens if a state attempts such a prosecution (or, in the case of New York, to impose a serious sentence on a president who was already convicted).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is highly unlikely that the state prosecutions can move forward, however, at least until Trump leaves office. On the federal level, the Department of Justice has long maintained that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/146241-0/dl?inline">it cannot indict a sitting president for a variety of practical reasons</a>: The burden of defending against criminal charges would diminish the president’s ability to do their job, as would the “public stigma and opprobrium occasioned by the initiation of criminal proceedings.” Additionally, if the president were incarcerated, that would make it “physically impossible for the president to carry out his duties.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s little doubt that the current Supreme Court, which recently held that Trump is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">immune to prosecution for many crimes he committed while in office</a>, would embrace the Justice Department’s reasoning. The Court’s decision in <em>Trump v. United States</em>, the immunity case, rested on the Republican justices’ belief that, if a president could be indicted for official actions taken in office, he “would be chilled from taking the ‘bold and unhesitating action’ required of an independent Executive.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The kind of justices who favor such “bold and unhesitating action” over ensuring presidential accountability to the law are unlikely to tolerate a prosecution of a sitting president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These same practical considerations would apply with equal force to a state prosecution of a president, and there’s also one other reason why a constitutional limit on state indictments of the president makes sense. Without such a limit, a state led by the president’s political enemies could potentially bring frivolous criminal charges against that president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This argument may not seem particularly compelling when applied to a convicted criminal like Donald Trump. But imagine if, say, Ron DeSantis’s Florida had attempted to indict, try, and imprison President Joe Biden. Or if the state of Mississippi had indicted President Lyndon Johnson to punish him for signing civil rights legislation that ended Jim Crow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In constitutional law, the same rule that applies to liberal democratic presidents like Biden or Johnson must also apply to an anti-democratic president like Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One open question is whether Trump could be incarcerated during the lame-duck period before he is sworn into office. The only state that could conceivably do this is New York, as that is the only place where Trump has been convicted. Trump is currently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">scheduled for a sentencing hearing on November 26 in that case</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question of whether an already-convicted president-elect can be incarcerated is unique — this situation has thankfully never arisen before in US history, so there’s no definitive law on this subject. But it’s worth noting that neither the New York prosecutors nor the judge overseeing this case have pushed for a quick sentencing process. Judge Juan Merchan chose to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">delay sentencing until after the election</a>, and the prosecution did not oppose this move. Merchan may decide to delay matters even further now that Trump has won the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if the sentencing does move forward, the charges against Trump in New York are relatively minor, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">could only result in him being fined or sentenced to probation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, there’s never been a state prosecution of a sitting president before, so there are no precedents to rely on here. It’s possible that, once Trump leaves office, New York or Georgia (the other state with an open case against Trump) may try to resume its long-pending prosecutions against him — although that assumes that the 78-year-old Trump survives his second term in office, and that these states still have the will to prosecute him four years from now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that these prosecutions are likely dead. And they are almost certainly going nowhere for the next four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following a heated presidential contest, political coverage and commentary can feel unavoidable. Kids are not immune — they might be picking up information about the election results from the adults in their lives, at recess, or on social media. As much as parents may think their children are oblivious, research shows kids, including very young ones, are paying attention. One study found that nearly all of the surveyed kids between the ages of 5 and 11<a href="https://news.ku.edu/news/article/2019/08/06/researchers-find-youths-knowledgeable-about-politics-call-even-better-early-political"> could name the candidates</a> running for president in 2016. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Kids as young as kindergarten and first grade can name candidates when they see their pictures,” says <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/psychology/faculty-and-staff/erin-pahlke">Erin Pahlke</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Whitman College and a co-author of the study, “and they have a sense of what the candidates believe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t have to have an in-depth discussion with your child every time they encounter a political topic. When it comes to political conversations with kids, experts say you should answer their questions and quell any fears they may have — but avoid telling them how to think.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When kids are young, teach them about civic engagement</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since children as young as 5 are shown to already have a basic understanding of presidents and elections, you can use this early exposure to guide and inform their knowledge. Kids of all ages can learn about civic engagement through activities like mock elections in school or accompanying their parents to the polls on Election Day, says clinical psychologist <a href="https://melissagoldbergmintz.com/">Melissa Goldberg Mintz</a>, author of<em> </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/dp/1462547494"><em>Has Your Child </em></a><em><a href="https://www.guilford.com/books/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/Melissa-Goldberg-Mintz/9781462547494?srsltid=AfmBOopzU8cgP9dUWxCAgcx6boSaYPYd55-fu1OnB0NLCoFBcjd1EPcy">Been</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/dp/1462547494"><em> Traumatized? How to Know and What to Do to Promote Healing and Recovery</em></a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can use this experience to teach kids how elections work. Children as young as 5 can grasp that voters are choosing between two major candidates from opposite parties and for laws that affect where they live, Pahlke says. If an elementary school-aged child has particular interests — maybe they love trains and buses — you could explain how proposed legislation would impact transportation in your city or town, Goldberg Mintz says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But don’t get too in the weeds or too prescriptive. “Something we would not want to do,” she says, “is talk about ‘With global climate change and increasing natural disasters, our city is doomed if we don&#8217;t have these protective flood measures.’”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Allow kids to lead the dialogue</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although children are exposed to more political information than their parents realize, their understanding or the conclusions they draw is sometimes incorrect, Pahlke says. Parents have a responsibility to clear up these misunderstandings, she continues, so ask your kids what they know about certain topics. Watching or reading the news together can be an effective way to start a conversation, says <a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/caporino.cfm">Nicole Caporino</a>, an associate professor of psychology at American University. If any stories trigger fear or confusion, you can discuss the likelihood that their fears will materialize, point out hopeful news stories, and assure them the family will cope with any potential challenges together, Caporino says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caporino’s research has suggested that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32100153/">most children and adolescents were worried</a> about political issues. Don’t downplay their concerns, Goldberg Mintz says. Do your best to give them an honest answer, but try not to give into fear or negativity, even if you are feeling scared. You might say, “I hear that you’re worried about that, and I have some concerns too. But we’ll figure out ways to get through it if that happens.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents should open the door to these conversations, because chances are children might already be thinking about these topics, Pahlke says. However, you shouldn’t offer up too many details if your child isn’t interested. For example, if you ask your elementary-aged kid, “The presidential election is coming up. Have you heard anything?” and they don’t have a strong opinion or say they haven’t talked about it with their friends, you can leave it at that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don&#8217;t ever want to volunteer bloody details or gory information that kids don&#8217;t already know about,” Goldberg Mintz says. “We want to be a trustworthy source for them. And if we don&#8217;t know the answer, we want to show them how to get to a trustworthy source.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens who are closer to voting age can handle discussions about specific policies, Pahlke says, and parents can explain various perspectives and potential outcomes. Parents can also talk with their teens about the importance of voting, Goldberg Mintz says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Encourage them to fact-check what they see on social media</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html">increasingly turning to social media</a> to stay informed, with one 2022 survey finding that half of Gen Z adolescents <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/digital-social-media-power-gen-z-teens-news-consumption-01655136478">source their news from online platforms</a>. If your kid asks you a question about something they’ve seen on social media (or sounds as if it originated there), use this as an opportunity to fact-check those claims with them. Check sources like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html">AP </a><a href="https://apnews.com/ap-fact-check">Fact</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html"> Check</a>, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/">Politifact</a>, and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> and show them where they can find trusted reporting. To <a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/is-it-legit/">determine a source’s credibility</a>, the News Literacy Project recommends quickly researching the source of your news, determining if the organization has ethical standards, and assessing the quality of the outlet’s other coverage.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We don&#8217;t ever want to volunteer bloody details or gory information that kids don&#8217;t already know about.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If your teen doesn’t come to you directly with what they’ve been watching online, you might need to gently broach the conversation. In the case of viral disinformation campaigns, you can ask your child, “Did you see people talking about this on social media?” This way you can glean information about what your kid is seeing online and correct any inaccuracies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let them come to their own conclusions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">High schoolers will have more nuanced understandings about certain current events and policies and it’s appropriate to discuss these topics with them, Pahlke says. But rather than paint various candidates or points of view as “good” or “bad,” help them consider different perspectives. Explain why people with various experiences would have different opinions on a topic. It’s fine if they align with a particular candidate or policy, but they should also be able to see where the other side is coming from. Perspective-taking can help them in other relationships, too, Pahlke says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens may also have a clear understanding of their personal values and can reflect on how certain candidates or policies reflect these values and goals, Goldberg Mintz says. You can show your teen where to find <a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/is-it-legit/">credible information</a> from <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/fake_news">trusted news sources</a> on specific candidates and policies and let them make up their minds. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Rather than trying to get in the weeds about ‘This is the candidate that our family can support, and it&#8217;s because XYZ’ is trying to define a kid&#8217;s beliefs for them,” Goldberg Mintz says. “We let our kids come to their own decisions.”</p>

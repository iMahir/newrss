 Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had notified Brazil of its decision, which will take effect immediately.

tells meeting of parliamentary Labour party there will be more difficult decisions to come</p><p>Like the Telegraph (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/09/winter-fuel-payment-vote-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with:block-66dec7c18f08a07a6f4ceba8#block-66dec7c18f08a07a6f4ceba8">11.25am</a>), the Times has also published a new article with a Tory endorsement for Kemi Badenoch, but this one is potentially more significant. Margaret Thatcher is no longer with us, but for Conservative party members she is still the one figure from the party’s recent past whose authority is more or less unquestioned and <strong>Peter Lilley</strong> has written<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/kemi-badenoch-engineer-fix-britain-dcnw7frrv"> an article</a> claiming that Badenoch would be a worthy inheritor of her mantle. He says Thatcher was a scientist, and Badenoch is an engineering graduate. Like Thatcher, Badenoch is focused on facts, and what works, he says. He goes on:</p><p>Leadership candidates are under great pressure to make popular pledges, to abolish specific taxes or set a numerical limit on immigration. Kemi, rightly in my view, has <a href="https://archive.is/o/wWsCE/https://www.thetimes.com/article/kemi-badenoch-uk-integration-xxznv27vq">refused to do so</a>. Voters want lower taxes and much less immigration (as do I), but they have seen every glib promise broken. To convince them, a new leader will need to show first, that policies have been rigorously worked out in practical terms and second, that we truly believe in them rather than adopting them to win votes. As Margaret Thatcher said: “To carry conviction, you must have conviction.”</p><p>Conviction is the fruit of hard-nosed scepticism. Kemi’s approach is similar to Margaret Thatcher’s, for whom I once worked. When ministers took a policy to her which was in line with all her prejudices, expecting instant approval, she would tear into it, challenging every weakness. Only when satisfied that a policy was totally robust would she take it on board – but then she pursued it with unwavering conviction. Kemi is likewise willing to challenge, criticise and <a href="https://archive.is/o/wWsCE/https://www.thetimes.com/article/blue-ambition-unauthorised-biography-kemi-badenoch-michael-ashcroft-review-brnm22n9q">expose weaknesses</a>, which does not endear her to everyone. But we cannot afford to go on adopting half-baked, unworkable policies.</p><p>We can rage at Labour’s actions, but the public won’t listen to our narrative – unless we have a leader who can communicate.</p><p>Kemi Badenoch is that person. She is blessed with that rare gift in politics: the X-factor that means she can not only communicate but achieve all important ‘cut-through’, so that the public actually notice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/09/winter-fuel-payment-vote-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/09/winter-fuel-payment-vote-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/09/winter-fuel-payment-vote-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 19:09:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Covid inquiry: Johnson and Hancock accused of making ‘false’ NHS claims]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Inquiry told how NHS entered pandemic with high nursing vacancies and low number of critical care beds</p><p>Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock have been criticised by bereaved families at the Covid inquiry for trying to mislead the public by “brazenly” claiming “things went reasonably well” in the NHS.</p><p>On the opening day of 10 weeks of evidence in a module focused on the impact of the pandemic on the health service, Pete Weatherby KC, representing the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said claims that the NHS had coped were “false”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/09/boris-johnson-matt-hancock-criticised-covid-inquiry-nhs">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/09/boris-johnson-matt-hancock-criticised-covid-inquiry-nhs</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/09/boris-johnson-matt-hancock-criticised-covid-inquiry-nhs</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 17:21:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Republicans spread unsubstantiated slurs about Haitian migrants in Ohio city]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Police reject suggestion by Trump campaign and JD Vance that Haitians in Springfield are eating pets and local wildlife</p><p>Prominent Republicans including the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Trump</a> campaign and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a> are sharing false and unsubstantiated claims that Haitian migrants in an Ohio city are eating pets and local wildlife.</p><p>The salacious and often racist social media posts claim, without evidence, that migrants from Haiti to Springfield, Ohio, are stealing pets and local wildlife such as ducks and geese and are butchering them for food.

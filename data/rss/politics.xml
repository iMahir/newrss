<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, when Joe Biden won the White House, generative AI still looked like a pointless toy, not a world-changing new technology. The first major AI image generator, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/05/1015754/avocado-armchair-future-ai-openai-deep-learning-nlp-gpt3-computer-vision-common-sense/">DALL-E, wouldn’t be released</a> until January 2021 — and it certainly wouldn’t be putting any artists out of business, as it still had trouble <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/dall-e-is-illiterate-with-the-text-it-adds-in-images/570654">generating basic images</a>. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/12/7/23498694/ai-artificial-intelligence-chat-gpt-openai">release of ChatGPT,</a> which took AI mainstream overnight, was still more than two years away. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/351189/google-ai-overview-section-230">AI-based Google search results</a> that are — like it or not —&nbsp;now unavoidable, would have seemed unimaginable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of AI, four years is a lifetime. That’s one of the things that makes AI policy and regulation so difficult. The gears of policy tend to grind slowly. And every four to eight years, they grind in reverse, when a new administration comes to power with different priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That works tolerably for, say, our food and drug regulation, or other areas where change is slow and bipartisan consensus on policy more or less exists. But when regulating a technology that is basically too young to go to kindergarten, policymakers face a tough challenge. And that’s all the more case when we experience a sharp change in who those policymakers are, as the US will after Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, I reached out to people to ask: What will AI policy look like under a Trump administration? Their guesses were all over the place, but the overall picture is this: Unlike on so many other issues, Washington has not yet fully polarized on the question of AI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s supporters include members of the accelerationist tech right, led by the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who are fiercely opposed to regulation of an exciting new industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But right by Trump’s side is Elon Musk, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/26/elon-musk-supports-california-ai-bill-00176388">supported California’s SB 1047</a> to regulate AI, and has been <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/30/elon-musk-ai-could-go-bad-existential-threat-xai-fundraising/">worried</a> for a long time that AI will bring about the end of the human race (a position that is easy to dismiss as classic Musk zaniness, but is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/10/24032987/ai-impacts-survey-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-superintelligence">actually quite mainstream</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s first administration was chaotic and featured the rise and fall of various chiefs of staff and top advisers. Very few of the people who were close to him at the start of his time in office were still there at the bitter end. Where AI policy goes in his second term may depend on who has his ear at crucial moments.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where the new administration stands on AI</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, the Biden administration issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">executive order on AI</a>, which, while generally modest, did mark an early government effort to take AI risk seriously. The Trump campaign platform says the <a href="https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_ga=2.255281992.1180040526.1729587267-1531562902.1729587267">executive order</a> “hinders AI innovation and imposes radical left-wing ideas on the development of this technology,” and has promised to repeal it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There will likely be a day one repeal of the Biden executive order on AI,”&nbsp;Samuel Hammond, a senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, told me, though he added, “what replaces it is uncertain.”&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/aisi">AI Safety Institute</a> created under Biden, Hammond pointed out, has “broad, bipartisan support” — though it will be <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/big-tech-urges-congress-to-formalize-ai-safety-institute/">Congress’s responsibility to properly authorize and fund it</a>, something they can and should do this winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are reportedly drafts in Trump’s orbit of a proposed replacement executive order that will <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/16/trump-ai-executive-order-regulations-military/?wpisrc=nl_technology202">create a “Manhattan Project” for military AI</a> and build industry-led agencies for model evaluation and security.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past that, though, it’s challenging to guess what will happen because the coalition that swept Trump into office is, in fact, sharply divided on AI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How Trump approaches AI policy will offer a window into the tensions on the right,” Hammond said. “You have folks like Marc Andreessen who want to slam down the gas pedal, and folks like Tucker Carlson who worry technology is already moving too fast. JD Vance is a pragmatist on these issues, seeing AI and crypto as an opportunity to break Big Tech&#8217;s monopoly. Elon Musk wants to accelerate technology in general while taking the existential risks from AI seriously. They are all united against ‘woke’ AI, but their positive agenda on how to handle AI&#8217;s real-world risks is less clear.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/what-trump-means-for-ai-safety">Trump himself</a> hasn’t commented much on AI, but when he has — as he did in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrFdHO7FH8w">Logan Paul interview earlier this year</a> — he seemed familiar with both the “accelerate for defense against China” perspective and with expert fears of doom. “We have to be at the forefront,” he said. “It&#8217;s going to happen. And if it&#8217;s going to happen, we have to take the lead over China.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for whether AI will be developed that acts independently and seizes control, he said, “You know, there are those people that say it takes over the human race. It&#8217;s really powerful stuff, AI. So let&#8217;s see how it all works out.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a sense that is an incredibly absurd attitude to have about the literal possibility of the end of the human race — you don’t get to see how an existential threat “works out” — but in another sense, Trump is actually taking a fairly mainstream view here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many AI experts think that the possibility of AI taking over the human race <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">is a realistic one</a> and that it could happen in the next few decades, and also think that we don’t know enough yet about the nature of that risk to make effective policy around it. So implicitly, a lot of people do have the policy “it might kill us all, who knows? I guess we’ll see what happens,” and Trump, as he so often proves to be, is unusual mostly for just coming out and saying it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We can’t afford polarization. Can we avoid it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been a lot of back and forth over AI, with Republicans <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-ai-safety-regulation/">calling equity and bias concerns “woke” nonsense</a>, but as Hammond observed, there is also a fair bit of bipartisan consensus. No one in Congress wants to see the US fall behind militarily, or to strangle a promising new technology in its cradle. And no one wants extremely dangerous weapons developed with no oversight by random tech companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who is an <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1852563383318462784">outspoken Trump critic</a>, is also an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/12/metas-yann-lecun-says-worries-about-a-i-s-existential-threat-are-complete-b-s/#:~:text=Dietsch%20%2F%20Getty%20Images-,Meta's%20Yann%20LeCun%20says%20worries%20about%20AI's%20existential%20threat%20are,winner%20of%20the%20prestigious%20A.M.">outspoken critic of AI safety worries</a>. Musk supported California’s AI regulation bill — <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/369628/ai-safety-bill-sb-1047-gavin-newsom-california">which was bipartisan, and vetoed by a Democratic governor</a> — and of course Musk also <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/383336/trump-election-elon-musk-misinformation">enthusiastically backed</a> Trump for the presidency. Right now, it’s hard to put concerns about extremely powerful AI on the political spectrum.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that is actually a good thing, and it would be catastrophic if that changes. With a fast-developing technology, Congress needs to be able to make policy flexibly and empower an agency to carry it out. Partisanship makes that next to impossible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than any specific item on the agenda, the best sign about a Trump administration’s AI policy will be if it continues to be bipartisan and focused on the things that all Americans, Democratic or Republican, agree on, like that we don’t want to all die at the hands of superintelligent AI. And the worst sign would be if the complex policy questions that AI poses got rounded off to a general “regulation is bad” or “the military is good” view, which misses the specifics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hammond, for his part, was optimistic that the administration is taking AI appropriately seriously. “They&#8217;re thinking about the right object-level issues, such as the national security implications of AGI being a few years away,” he said. Whether that will get them to the right policies remains to be seen — but it would have been highly uncertain in a Harris administration, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>A Vox reader writes: “Trump can&#8217;t run for a third term, right? (Yes, we know what the Constitution says &#8230; but he really, truly can&#8217;t run for a third term, right??)”</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">President-elect Donald Trump</a> has won his second — and final — term in office. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786">Trump has joked about pursuing a third term</a> and has a penchant for promoting authoritarian ideas, <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/can-donald-trump-run-2028-presidential-election/76094187007/">he’s barred from running again</a> by the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. To run for a third term, he’d have to repeal that amendment, and that would be difficult. Undoing a constitutional amendment requires an overwhelming level of support from Congress and state legislatures, support he would be unable to obtain. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked if there were legal loopholes or other ways for a president to get around the 22nd Amendment, Stanford University Law Professor Michael McConnell, a specialist in constitutional law, had a definitive answer. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No. There are none. This will be his last run for president,” McConnell told Vox. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the 22nd Amendment says</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 22nd Amendment firmly limits <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-we-wound-up-with-the-constitutions-only-term-limits-amendment">presidents to two</a> successful runs and applies equally to those elected to consecutive terms and those, like Trump, who are elected to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-run-again-2028/">nonconsecutive terms</a>. It states the following: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-the-22nd-amendment-came-into-existence">was ratified in 1951</a> and came after years of both parties calling for term limits for the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While President George Washington set a precedent for only holding two terms in office, President Franklin D. Roosevelt later <a href="https://www.history.com/news/fdr-four-term-president-22-amendment">became the first and only commander-in-chief</a> to serve additional terms. Roosevelt was ultimately elected to four terms in office, though he passed away during his last term in 1945. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following Roosevelt’s tenure, there were growing calls to establish term limits for future presidents, leading to Congress’s approval of the 22nd Amendment and states’ subsequent ratification. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why it’s so hard to roll back the 22nd Amendment</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thresholds for approving a constitutional amendment and for repealing it are exceedingly high. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two ways to go about rolling back an amendment. The first would require two-thirds of both the House – 290 members – and the Senate – 67 members – to agree to do so. Once they did so, three-fourths of all states – 38 – would then also have to agree.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These thresholds would be impossible for Trump to meet given Democratic opposition, and there would likely be some Republican outcry as well. While <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump">Republicans are poised to retake Senate control</a>, they’ll fall far short of the two-thirds majority required for such a vote. If the GOP attains control of the House, they’d similarly fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed there. Additionally, at least 17 states have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, signaling that they’d be unlikely to support any such amendment. That’s more than the one-fourth of states Trump could afford to lose should he somehow succeed in getting the amendment overturned by Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second means of repealing an Amendment would require holding a Constitutional Convention, which two-thirds of states – 34 – would have to support. Any amendments proposed at such a Convention would still need ratification from three-fourths of states – 38. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This option would face the same opposition from Democrat-leaning states as the first one. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the amendment was first approved, there have been numerous proposals in <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/term-limits/">Congress raised to repeal it</a>, though they have all languished due to lack of support.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The amendment is crystal clear</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say there aren’t really any realistic options for Trump to try to bypass the 22nd Amendment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theoretically, <a href="https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/">the 22nd Amendment doesn’t prevent a former president</a> who has already served two terms from becoming vice president in a subsequent term. As vice president, that person could then potentially ascend to the presidency if the president on the ticket stepped down. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It could theoretically happen, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen,” says McConnell, who added that it’s a “silly thing to worry about.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Efforts to challenge the amendment in court are also moot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court does not have the basis to overturn the 22nd Amendment, according to legal experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Per UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, any challenge to a constitutional amendment would likely rest on arguments that the procedure used to approve the amendment was faulty in some way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s “impossible” in this case, says Winkler, given how this amendment has been settled for more than seven decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Winkler notes the Supreme Court could try to interpret the 22nd Amendment to say that it only applies to presidents who have served consecutive terms, but even that would be a stretch based on its text. Any effort to declare the amendment unconstitutional by the Court would run into the problem of the amendment being part of the Constitution, notes McConnell. “By definition, the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional,” he says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, as Georgetown law professor Abbe Smith explained when asked if Trump could vie for a third term, it’s pretty simple: “Short answer: There is no way.” </p>

 The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country.<br><br>
 The temporary relief from deportation brought a brief sense of security to some 500,000 immigrants estimated to benefit from the program before Texas-based U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker put it on hold in August, days after applicants filed their paperwork.<br><br>
 Barker ruled yesterday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority by implementing the program and had stretched the legal interpretation of relevant immigration law “<strong>past its breaking point</strong>.”<br><br>
 The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as <strong>“Keeping Families Together”</strong> would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump’s return to the White House.<br></p><p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/11/politics/house-votes-count-election-dg/">CNN’s latest projection</a> of the crucial races to gain control of the House has Republicans ahead in ten of the contests, with, according to their projections, only six victories needed to tip them over the magic 218 for control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 14:13:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[From higher tariffs to lower taxes, will Donald Trump’s economic plan pay off?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>There is a strong chance the president-elect’s radical strategy going wrong, with a high risk of rising prices, inflation and interest rates</p><p>It’s the economy, stupid.

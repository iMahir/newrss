<p class="has-text-align-none">No less an authority than Russian President Vladimir Putin has predicted that the coming years in global affairs will be a “<a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/putins-revolution-and-war-historical-crossroads">revolutionary situation</a>”: a reference to a <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/csi/ii.htm">line of Vladimir Lenin’s from 1913</a>, just prior to World War I. Putin’s counterpart in China, Xi Jinping, <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/13/vladimir-putins-spies-are-plotting-global-chaos">concurs</a>, foreseeing “changes the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean World War III is inevitable or even likely. But it does mean we are in an era when the decisions of major leaders in moments of crisis could have an outsize impact on global security and the lives of millions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This also is the moment, after a stunning win, when Donald Trump will return to the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The year 2016, when Trump was elected the first time, didn’t exactly feel like a very peaceful or stable moment in world history. The Syrian civil war and the US-led campaign against ISIS <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-us-policy-isis">were raging</a>. In June, one of the terror group’s sympathizers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482322488/orlando-shooting-what-happened-update">killed 49 people</a> at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Russian-backed forces were occupying much of Eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About a month before the election, North Korea conducted its <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/08/asia/north-korea-seismic-activity/">most powerful nuclear test</a> to date. Europe was still in the midst of an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911">unprecedented influx of migrants</a> from the Middle East and Africa, which would end up having dramatic political consequences in several countries. Sen. Ted Cruz was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/happened-ted-cruz-told-year-girl-worlds-fire/story?id=29673686">terrifying 3-year-olds</a> on the campaign trail by telling them the world was “on fire.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, viewed from the vantage point of this year, 2016 feels like a simpler time. Wars of all types have gotten <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia">more common and deadlier</a> around the world in the years since, and superpower conflict — a concern that had largely receded in the post-Cold War era — is back on the agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, the global situation Trump will inherit this time around will be far more dangerous and unpredictable. And that in turn raises the risks of his erratic and transactional approach to foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What was, eight years ago, a localized “gray zone” conflict in Eastern Ukraine is now the first major land war in Europe in decades, one in which Russia’s president has repeatedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">threatened to use nuclear weapons</a>. Israel’s war in Gaza, already one of the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/2024-08-14/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-death-toll-in-gaza-is-bad-even-compared-to-the-wars-in-ukraine-iraq-and-myanmar/00000191-50c6-d6a2-a7dd-d1decf340000">deadliest conflicts for civilians</a> of the 20th century, is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364148/haniyeh-iran-israel-hamas-hezbollah">fast spiraling into a regional conflict</a> that could involve direct combat between Israel and Iran and could yet drag in the US military.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further east, potentially even more dangerous conflicts loom. Many North Korea watchers believe the country is <a href="https://www.38north.org/2024/01/is-kim-jong-un-preparing-for-war/">preparing for war</a>, and that the risk of all-out conflict on the Korean peninsula — which <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/7/16974772/north-korea-war-trump-kim-nuclear-weapon">could potentially kill more than a million people</a>, even if North Korea doesn’t use its nuclear arsenal — has never been higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s Taiwan. Even putting aside a death toll on both sides that could <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/ac08ba446e8ca4c4285b79969439856a1">dwarf the war in Ukraine</a>, a war in Taiwan would be a <a href="https://rhg.com/research/taiwan-economic-disruptions/">body blow to the global economy</a>. If the US came to Taiwan’s aid, it could lose <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?VersionId=WdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ">as many troops in a matter of weeks</a> as it did in 20 years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some analysts believe China could even <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/Thomas_Shugart_Testimony.pdf">preemptively attack US bases</a> in the Pacific if it believed US intervention was inevitable, something the US military has not experienced since WWII. And the threat of nuclear weapons use would loom over the conflict: China has the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, <a href="http://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/Chinas-plan-to-be-the-next-nuclear-superpower-ada094a58e6db44acad90284fc2d087d4">one that is growing fast</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran — a group <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine">some have dubbed</a> the “axis of upheaval” — may not have much in common in terms of ideology of overall interests, but they are increasingly collaborating: The reported presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/north-korea-russia-military-ukraine.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">just the latest example</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to downplay the wars and security threats that existed in 2016 and continued through Trump’s first term, nor the obviously massive disruptive effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. But state versus state conflict, and even superpower versus superpower conflict, is an entirely different matter than war against terrorist groups. Gray zone conflict is a different matter than open warfare. Recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24107959/replicator-drones-china-taiwan-ukraine-pentagon">rapid advances in drone technology</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24151437/ai-israel-gaza-war-hamas-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> are likely to make the wars of the future all the more unpredictable, and potentially more destructive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which makes the idea of putting back in the Oval Office a president who <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/10/23/ambiguity-or-madness-where-harris-and-trump-stand-on-china">proudly calls</a> his foreign policy approach “crazy” so dangerous.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>A world on fire</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even putting aside the issues of Trump’s temperament, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/how-big-problem-is-mental-acuity-trump/">mental acuity</a>, or the warnings from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/10/the-generals-warning/680279/">senior</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/world/video/the-lead-israel-hamas-middle-east-2024-election-donald-trump-fasciscm"> national security</a> <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/mattis-told-woodward-he-agreed-trump">officials</a> from his own past administration that they believe he is dangerously unqualified for the presidency, there are several reasons to believe a new Trump presidency would amplify this “revolutionary situation” rather than moderate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Trump does not put much value on the idea of territorial integrity. It may sound like a wonky academic point, but we tend to take for granted that in our current era, <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/aba6c9c34b4b34f9498e48f63f97e04de">countries rarely conquer each other and borders are rarely changed by force</a>. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has obviously <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest">challenged this taboo</a> against what the <a href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/purposes-and-principles-un-chapter-i-un-charter#:~:text=Article%202%20(4)%20of%20the,political%20independence%20of%20other%20States.">UN Charter calls </a>the “threat or use of force against the territorial integrity” of other countries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As president, Trump <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/trump-russia-crimea">reportedly told other world leaders</a> that the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, is rightfully Russian because everyone there speaks Russian. Figures close to the Trump campaign like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-ukraine-war-crimea-russia-state-tv-1776696">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?lang=en">Elon Musk</a> have openly endorsed the view that Crimea is rightfully Russian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump overturned decades of US policy and international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-made-golan-heights-decision-after-a-quick-history-lesson-idUSKCN1RJ01O/">he has described</a> as a snap decision made after a quick history lesson from his ambassador to Israel and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. He <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/trump-morocco-western-sahara-israel.html">did the same</a> for Morocco’s claims over the disputed region of Western Sahara, in return for Morocco recognizing Israel. (In fairness, the Biden administration hasn’t reversed either of these moves — once the taboo is broken, it’s hard to reestablish.) For Trump, the president who, after all, mused about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-eyes-a-new-real-estate-purchase-greenland-11565904223">buying Greenland</a>, sovereignty and territorial integrity are like anything else in a deal: negotiable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, Trump doesn’t value alliances. One reason Russia has not attacked any of the countries bordering Ukraine, even as weapons flow into Ukraine from those countries, is that they are members of NATO, meaning that an attack on them could bring a military response from the alliance as a whole. It’s proof of concept for the most powerful military alliance in history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump tends to take a narrowly transactional view of alliances. His antipathy to NATO and threats to pull the US out of the alliance <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine">have been well-documented</a>, as have his comments that treat the US defense of Asian partners like <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/15/trump-asks-tokyo-quadruple-payments-us-troops-japan/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/trump-usfk-sma-10162024034010.html">South Korea</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8">Taiwan</a> as a protection racket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third related point is Trump&#8217;s attitude toward nuclear weapons. Defying many predictions <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Bomb/Fred-Kaplan/9781982107307">made at the dawn of the nuclear age</a>, no nuclear weapon has been used in war since 1945, a record that likely involves both a bit of luck as well as the power of nuclear deterrence and the very justified fear these weapons cause. Trump, though, seems a bit more blasé on the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to former aides, Trump discussed using a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120">nuclear weapon against North Korea</a> as president during the period he was publicly threatening Kim Jong Un’s regime with “fire and fury.” As president, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-open-skies-treaty-arms-control.html">withdrew</a> from, or <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/05/trump-administrations-aggressive-approach-arms-negotiatons-could-backfire/165334/">let lapse</a>, a number of key arms control treaties, most famously the Iran nuclear deal, instead preferring an approach where the US would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-armscontrol/u-s-prepared-to-spend-russia-china-into-oblivion-to-win-nuclear-arms-race-u-s-envoy-idUSKBN22X2LS/">build up its own nuclear arsenal</a> to spend its rivals into oblivion. Recently on the campaign trail, he suggested that a reason presidents need legal immunity is so they could <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-nuclear-president-crime/">use nuclear weapons without fear of legal repercussions</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue is not just Trump’s own attitude toward nuclear weapons. In a number of US allies in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24091566/europe-nuclear-weapons-poland-germany-france-putin-trump">Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-arsenal.html">Asia</a>, there is now an active debate over whether they need nuclear deterrents of their own, driven in part by concerns over whether they could actually count on the US nuclear umbrella. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently suggested that without effective security guarantees from allies, his country might need <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-nukes-volodymyr-zelenskyy-war-ukraine-aid-russia/">nuclear weapons</a> for protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The international community’s success at limiting the number of nuclear powers is one of the biggest reasons why the nuclear taboo has remained intact. But a world with more nuclear powers is a world where the use of nuclear weapons is more likely, and that world becomes more likely if allies don’t believe security guarantees are worth the paper they’re printed on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>An agent of chaos in the Oval Office</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the campaign, Trump countered that the very fact that the world has become so dangerous is the reason he should be returned to the presidency. He repeatedly made the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-27/debate-trump-foreign-policy-russia-ukraine-gaza-israel">unprovable claims</a> that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas’s October 7 attacks would not have happened had he been president. He also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/">falsely claimed</a> that there were no terrorist attacks and no wars during his presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those claims elide the major military escalations in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia that took place under his tenure, as well as risky actions like the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, which prompted an Iranian missile strike on US troops in Iraq. Thankfully, no one was killed in those strikes, but commanders say up to 150 troops <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/al-asad-missile-attack-nearly-killed-150-us-troops-destroyed-30-aircraft-report.html">could have been</a>. As president, he reportedly considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html">missile strikes</a> into Mexico and the idea of sending troops into America’s neighbor — and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2024/02/07/2023-results-are-in-us-has-new-top-port-trade-partner-export-import">No. 1 trading partner</a> — has evolved into a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html">mainstream Republican position</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump case, essentially, is that he was able to rule the world through fear. In his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5107967/viktor-orban-hungary-donald-trump-presidential-debate">cited</a> his ideological ally Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán: “Why is the whole world blowing up? [Orbán] said, ‘Because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid.’ And I don&#8217;t like to use the word afraid, but I&#8217;m just quoting him. &#8216;China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him.&#8217; Look at what&#8217;s going on with North Korea, by the way. He said &#8216;Russia was afraid of him.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-the-bully-with-a-heart-of-gold-2024-presidential-election-dd922dd6">claimed he threatened</a> to strike Moscow if Putin attacked Ukraine, though it’s not quite clear when this was since Russian troops were in Ukrainian territory throughout the entirety of Trump’s presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also not clear that US adversaries were deterred by Trump’s tough-guy posturing. Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html">has maintained that the punishing sanctions</a> he put on Iran after withdrawing from the nuclear deal stopped it from orchestrating attacks in the region, but he had little response after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-does-not-want-war-after-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-idUSKBN1W10X6/">Iran attacked Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The killing of Soleimani <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-iran-escalation-timeline-march-2020-update">did not stop Iran’s proxies from attacking US troops in Iraq</a>. When it comes to Taiwan, he has suggested that the island is simply too small and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-the-trump-or-harris-administration-approach-taiwan/">insignificant to be worth defending</a> — the kind of rhetoric that might influence China’s calculations over a possible invasion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Once more unto the breach</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent weeks, world affairs have seemed to be in a bit of a holding pattern, with leaders not making major decisions until they see the results of November 5. Trump may have soured a bit on his onetime good friend Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24072983/biden-trump-palestinians-israel-gaza-policy-different">but in all likelihood</a> — based on his past record — he will apply even less pressure than the Biden administration has to get Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or allow in more humanitarian aid. A Trump win will likely embolden annexationists within the Israeli government, including the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-once-fringe-movement-to-reoccupy-gaza-gains-momentum-9bcb6a28">once-fringe but increasingly vocal movement</a> in favor of reoccupying Gaza with Israeli settlers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Ukraine, Trump promised to end the conflict immediately. Judging by comments made by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html">running mate Sen. JD Vance</a>, though, this would likely involve pressuring Ukraine to both cede territory to Russia and accept neutrality, without security guarantees — not far from Putin’s desired outcome. When it comes to China, the outlook is more unpredictable. Trump portrays himself as the ultimate China hawk, except when he believes doing so is <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-lies-china-coronavirus-timeline.html">bad for business</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the question is not whether Trump is a hawk or a dove. It’s what a return of the chaos and unpredictability that marked his first tenure will mean in a world where the risk of cataclysm is now so much higher.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris after winning the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, and reaching the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Across the nation, there was a shift toward Trump as the former president significantly improved on his performance in the 2020 election. It looks plausible that he could win the national popular vote for the first time ever, though that will take some time to determine for sure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s defeat marks the end of a historically short, incredibly intense presidential campaign cycle. She faced formidable obstacles, including inheriting President Joe Biden’s unpopularity and struggling to brand herself as the change candidate who would deliver a fresh, new approach from the failed politics of the past.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans also secured control of the Senate, flipping the body after four years of Democratic control. The House of Representatives remains up for grabs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four years after Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election and left office in disgrace, the American people returned him to power in the 2024 election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Major news outlets called most of the major swing states — North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — for Trump late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, giving him an Electoral College majority. Vice President Kamala Harris no longer has a path to victory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trend was broader than the swing states; there was a shift toward Trump across the nation, as he significantly improved on his performance in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, it looks quite plausible that Trump could end up winning the national popular vote for the first time ever, though that will take some time to determine for sure, as it depends on the exact margin in slow-counting states like California.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s win will come with a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump">new Republican Senate majority</a>, as Democratic incumbents lost in Ohio and Montana. But as of Wednesday morning it is not yet clear which party will control the House of Representatives, and it <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/06/hakeem-jeffries-becomes-deflated-democrats-last-hope?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">could take some time</a> to find out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is clear is that Trump won. How did this happen?<br><br>The blame game among Democrats will come fast and furious. But though the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380750/harris-trump-closing-message-fascism-democracy-authoritarianism">Harris campaign’s strategy</a> is sure to be second-guessed, the extent and nationwide nature of the shift in Trump’s favor suggest she had an uphill battle all around — because of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">widespread unpopularity</a> of President Joe Biden and public disapproval of his record in office.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris inherited a tough situation from Biden – and ultimately could not overcome it</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Harris unexpectedly joined the presidential race in July after Biden stepped aside, she faced three formidable obstacles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first was a global trend: In the years since the pandemic, incumbent parties <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/opinion/trump-harris-inflation.html">have been struggling</a> in wealthy democracies across the world. The reasons for this are debated, though post-reopening inflation is likely a big one. But to win, Harris would have to defy this trend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second was Biden’s unpopularity. The president was <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">historically unpopular</a> long before his disastrous debate with Trump, and poll after poll showed voters irate with his handling of the economy and immigration. Foreign policy, particularly the Israel-Gaza war that divided Democrats’ coalition, was a problem too. And since Harris had served in his administration as vice president, she had to figure out what to do about that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, such dynamics would seem to point to a “change” election where the incumbent party is booted. In such elections, the opposition can often put the blame for the current state of affairs on the incumbents, make vague promises that they’ll do things differently, and ride to victory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there was nothing typical about Harris’s opponent: Donald Trump. The fact that Trump had recently served as president in his own controversial term, with his own controversial record, seemed to present Harris with an opening. Perhaps she could brand herself the change candidate who would deliver a fresh, new approach, breaking from the failed politics of the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That brings us to the third obstacle: Harris’s own record. While running for president in 2019, Harris embraced a set of very progressive policy positions that Democrats <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center">now view as politically toxic</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/06/kamala-harris-interviews-election-scrutiny">including</a> banning fracking and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing. So she had a choice to make: Should she stand by her old positions and promise bold progressive change, or should she tack to the center?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, Harris took a kind of middle path. She downplayed, disavowed, or simply avoided mention of many of the progressive policies she’d supported back in 2019 — but she didn’t deliberately pick fights with the left in search of centrist cred, like <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-clinton-sister-soulja-moment.html">Bill Clinton did</a> in his 1992 presidential campaign. Harris wanted to keep the Democratic coalition happy, pleasing as many people as she could, rather than taking sides in any factional fights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addressing Biden’s record, too, Harris tried to strike a balance. She decided not to criticize Biden, throw him under the bus, or break with him — or the Biden-Harris administration’s policies&nbsp;— in any significant way. When pressed about voter anger over inflation and unauthorized immigration, she did not acknowledge error. Rather, she tried to argue that the economy was doing well now, and blamed Trump for not supporting a bipartisan immigration bill. And she did not shift on Israel-Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s hope was that she’d done enough to present herself as a new face, and that the fundamental unfitness of Donald Trump — and his unpopular record on issues like abortion and his attempt to steal the 2020 election — would ultimately prove to be decisive to voters disgruntled with both parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That hope was in vain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, much of the public was more resentful of inflation under Biden than they were about Trump’s attempted election theft. And so voters turned back to the candidate they kicked out of office just four years ago.</p>

Labour MPs previously signed a motion saying Trump should not be allowed to speak in Westminster Hall</p><p>Another Labour politician who has criticised Donald Trump strongly in the past is <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, shadow foreign secretary when Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader and now chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee. In an interview on the Today programme this morning she said Trump’s victory (or apparent victory – he still has not officially hit 270 electoral college votes) was “disappointing”, and that it made the world “unpredictable”.</p><p>When it was put to her that she described him as a “racist, sexual predator” when he visited the UK during his first term as president, she replied:</p><p>Well, he is. But he is the president of the United States, and we need to work with him.</p><p>I know that many Londoners will be anxious about the outcome of the US presidential election. Many will be fearful about what it will mean for democracy and for women’s rights, or how the result impacts the situation in the Middle East or the fate of Ukraine. Others will be worried about the future of NATO or tackling the climate crisis …</p><p>The lesson of today is that progress is not inevitable. But asserting our progressive values is more important than ever - re-committing to building a world where racism and hatred is rejected, the fundamental rights of women and girls are upheld, and where we continue to tackle the crisis of climate change head on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-uk-politics-live-news">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-uk-politics-live-news</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-uk-politics-live-news</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 13:19:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starmer congratulates Trump on ‘historic election victory’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>PM says UK-US special relationship will ‘continue to prosper for years to come’</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-uk-politics-live-news">UK politics live – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/06/us-presidential-election-2024-donald-trump-kamala-harris-latest-news-updates">US elections 2024 – live updates</a></li></ul><p>Keir Starmer has congratulated Donald Trump on his “historic election victory” and said that “as the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise”.</p><p>The British prime minister said the UK-US special relationship would “continue to prosper”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-election-victory">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-election-victory</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-election-victory</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 12:57:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Donald Trump Is the President-Elect -- but There's an Even Bigger Winner Today]]></title><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-president-elect-theres-111100460.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-president-elect-theres-111100460.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 11:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Republicans take Senate majority for first time in 4 years]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/republicans-win-back-u-senate-051216079.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/republicans-win-back-u-senate-051216079.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 05:12:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Kamala Harris lost the election: The fatal flaws in a doomed election bid]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/kamala-harris-lost-election-fatal-105809720.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/kamala-harris-lost-election-fatal-105809720.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 10:58:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Opinion: Here’s What I Learned From Trump’s Victory: I’m the Problem.

 “We need to crush liberal dominance where it’s most insidious, so we’ll direct resources to build talent and capital formation pipelines in the areas of news and entertainment, where leftwing extremism is most evident,” Leo told the FT in a rare interview.</p><p>“Expect us to increase support for organisations that call out companies and financial institutions that bend to the woke mind virus spread by regulators and NGOs, so that they have to pay a price for putting extreme leftwing ideology ahead of consumers.”</p><p>As the United States approaches a critical election, I can’t sit quietly as Donald Trump – perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation – eyes a return to the White House. For that reason, though I’m a Republican, I’ve decided to support Kamala Harris for president.</p><p>Trump failed to do his duty and exercise his presidential power to protect members of Congress, law enforcement and the Capitol from the attacks that day. He failed to deploy executive branch personnel to save lives and property and preserve democracy. He just watched on television and chose not to do anything because that would have been contrary to his interests. Trump still describes that day as beautiful. And as for those subsequently convicted of committing crimes, he describes them as hostages.</p><p>Any discussion about fidelity to the rule of law has to include Trump’s 34 state felony convictions, his state civil financial judgment of libel based on sexual abuse, as well as the pending federal elections interference case, not to mention the recently dismissed federal documents case that Special Counsel Jack Smith <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/26/jack-smith-appeal-trump-classified-documents-case-00176380">is continuing to pursue</a>. Standing alone, these charges, convictions and judgments show that Trump is someone who fails to act, time and time again, in accordance with the rule of law.</p><p>To be fair, I have spoken with Trump only once. I do not really know him. It is telling, however, that several senior officials who worked for him in the White House now refuse to support him, including his vice president, chief of staff, defense secretary and national security adviser. Their unwillingness to endorse their former boss is an indictment of his character at a level equal to his many, many criminal indictments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/12/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-debate-news-updates">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/12/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-debate-news-updates</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/12/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-debate-news-updates</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 13:29:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian missile hit civilian ship carrying Ukrainian grain in Black Sea, Zelenskiy says]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-missile-hits-civilian-ship-125221002.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-missile-hits-civilian-ship-125221002.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 12:52:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia says it could "combine" with China if they faced a threat]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-could-combine-china-142351507.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-could-combine-china-142351507.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 14:23:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[U.N. staff among 18 killed in Israeli strike on Gaza school, rescuers say]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-n-staff-among-18-124054609.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-n-staff-among-18-124054609.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 12:40:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Biden says ending ban on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons being worked out]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-says-administration-working-potentially-210947026.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-says-administration-working-potentially-210947026.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 21:09:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

Joe Biden’s momentous announcement that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/21/joe-biden-withdraw-running-president">he is dropping out of the presidential race</a> may soon be remembered as inevitable – but if so, it only started to look that way once it had happened. Even as the president announced his withdrawal, campaign aides were calling Democratic convention delegates to shore up their support, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out-election/biden-team-calling-delegates-drop-out-00170032">Politico reported</a>; blindsided White House officials were “finding out by tweet”.</p><p>That’s not to say the decision was surprising. With more and more party leaders and donors urging Biden to quit, publicly or privately, in recent days, the president cut a deeply isolated figure. After the announcement, in contrast, Democrats fell in line <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/21/biden-drops-out-democrat-reaction">to describe him as a selfless American hero</a> – and many of them echoed his endorsement of his vice-president, Kamala Harris.</p><p><em><strong>UK politics </strong></em>| Rachel Reeves has indicated that the government could agree <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/21/reeves-hints-public-sector-workers-could-get-above-inflation-pay-rises">above-inflation pay rises for teachers and other public sector workers</a>, saying there is “a cost to not settling” pay negotiations.

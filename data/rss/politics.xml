<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to launch a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportation program</a> starting on day one of his second term. That could have devastating consequences for the millions of people residing in “mixed status” households: those in which both undocumented immigrants and people with permanent legal status reside.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has said that he would rely on an <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">18th-century law</a> to carry out mass deportations and that he intends to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/trump-mass-deportations-detention-camps-military-migrants">first target</a> “known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members.” Vice President-elect JD Vance has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-mass-deportations-start-1-million-defends/story?id=112739447">set an initial goal of 1 million deportations</a>. A representative for the Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment about whether any exceptions would be made for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for a long time or who have immediate family here, including US-citizen spouses and children. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many such people: The US has an estimated <a href="https://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CMS-REPORT-Proposed-2024-Mass-Deportation-Program-Would-Socially-and-Economically-Devastate-American-Families.pdf">4.7 million mixed-status households</a>, according to a 2024 Center for Migration Studies report. Roughly 500,000 people in those households may have hoped for new protections against deportation through a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/355662/biden-path-citizenship-spouses-children-undocumented-legalization-green-card">Biden administration program</a> that would have cleared the way for undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for legal status. That program was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/judge-declares-biden-immigration-program-for-spouses-of-u-s-citizens-illegal/">struck down</a> in federal court on Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Trump gets his way, his deportation program threatens to rip families apart in what could be a new iteration of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/10/7/21506059/trump-family-separations-sessions-rosenstein">first administration’s policy of separating immigrant families</a>. However, Tom Homan, Trump’s former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and current immigration adviser, has also proposed that <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/1850689458590384212">families could be deported together</a>, apparently including US citizens. It is not clear whether he was suggesting that they would go voluntarily together.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">clear practical challenges</a> associated with implementing a mass deportation program on the scale Trump is promising. But if he manages to overcome those hurdles, such a program could wreak lasting psychological damage on <a href="https://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CMS-REPORT-Proposed-2024-Mass-Deportation-Program-Would-Socially-and-Economically-Devastate-American-Families.pdf">millions of American-born children</a> in mixed-status families, place economic strain on their communities, and even weaken the US economy. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The familiar damage of family separation</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research on the effects of Trump’s previous policy of separating immigrant families sheds light on the potential fallout from breaking up mixed-status families through mass deportations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first term, Trump adopted what was called the “zero tolerance policy” for undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern border. Parents were sent to immigration detention to await deportation proceedings. Their children, meanwhile, were sent to separate facilities operated by the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some cases, released to other family members in the US or to foster homes. (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/fact-check-did-obama-administration-separate-families-n884856">Previous administrations</a>, in most cases, would not have detained the parents or children, releasing them together into the US.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least 5,000 families were separated before a California federal court ordered the federal government in June 2018 to reunify the families affected and end the policy. As of May 2024, some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/07/immigration-family-separation/">1,400 still had not been reunited</a>, despite an ongoing Biden administration effort to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The harm the policy would inflict was well-known to Trump officials at the outset. Commander Jonathan White, who previously oversaw the government’s program providing care to unaccompanied immigrant children during the first Trump administration, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-was-warned-of-traumatic-psychological-injury-from-family-separations-official-says">told Congress</a> that he had repeatedly warned the officials who concocted the policy that it would likely cause “significant potential for traumatic psychological injury to the child.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://perma.cc/2RPJ-WM5H">September 2019 government report</a> confirmed those effects, finding that immigrant children who entered government custody in 2018 frequently experienced “intense trauma,” and those who were “unexpectedly separated from a parent” even more so. In 2021, a group of pediatricians <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/147/1/e2020012930/33464/Treatment-of-Migrant-Children-on-the-US-Southern?autologincheck=redirected">concluded</a> in a study that separating families “constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment that rises to the level of torture.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/10/21/21526566/trump-family-separations-immigrant-children">previously reported</a>, psychologists have seen that childhood trauma manifested in three main ways: disruptions to social attachments, increases in emotional vulnerability, and, in some cases, post-traumatic stress disorder. Those symptoms could be short-lived or they could persist; they could also not even manifest until a child enters their teen years or adulthood. Any of them could significantly hinder a child’s later success in academics and in the workplace.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The family separation caused by mass deportations would look different from family separation at the border, and whether the psychological effects on separated children are more or less extreme will depend on their circumstances. What is clear, however, is that mass deportation would cause family separation at a scale far larger than anything Trump tried in his first term in office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is orders of magnitude higher as far as families that are going to be split apart, and the kind of life-altering consequences of that will be visited upon 5.5 million US-born children,” said Matthew Lisiecki, a senior research and policy analyst at the Center for Migration Studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He and his co-researcher Gerard Apruzzese conservatively <a href="https://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CMS-REPORT-Proposed-2024-Mass-Deportation-Program-Would-Socially-and-Economically-Devastate-American-Families.pdf">estimate</a> that a third of American-born children in mixed-status families, including 1.8 million who live in households with two undocumented parents, would remain in the US even if their household members were deported.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That would inflict not just psychological suffering, but also a hefty financial cost: Children who remain in the US would see their median household income drop by nearly half, from $75,500 to $39,000, if their undocumented household members were deported, Lisiecki and Apruzzese found. Other family members or public social services would have to pick up the cost of raising them, which the researchers estimate at $116.5 billion. The loss of their parents’ productivity — and the $96.7 billion they contribute annually in taxes — could also hurt the US economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The kind of trauma experienced as part of that is something that these Americans will be living with every day of their life from here on out,” Lisiecki said. “I don&#8217;t think we have the experience at that scale to say what that means for the lives of those kids as they grow up and move forward.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Trump can actually deliver on his promises of mass deportations is a big question mark. He has said that the program would have “<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/trump-immigration-mass-deportations-00188339">no price tag,</a>” suggesting that the budget is unlimited, but he would need the support of Congress to make that happen. It’s not yet clear that he’ll have the numbers to increase the immigration enforcement budget, especially given that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-33301/2024-house-seats-undecided-control">control of the House is still undecided</a>. But even if implemented on a small scale, the consequences for affected mixed-status families would be dire. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Germany appears headed toward an unexpected election — and complete political upheaval — after its deeply unpopular ruling coalition collapsed this week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until Wednesday, Germany, which operates under a parliamentary system in which multiple parties compete for power, was governed by a fragile coalition of three parties with very different aims. That arrangement changed after <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/8/22810520/germany-government-olaf-scholz-chancellor-greens-fdp">Chancellor Olaf Scholz</a> (who belongs to the party that led the coalition, the center-left Social Democratic Party) fired his finance minister, who belongs to the fiscally conservative Free Democratic Party, over a budget dispute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In response, the Free Democratic Party pulled out of the coalition, leaving the Social Democratic Party and its other coalition partner, the climate change-focused Green Party, without a majority in the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament. For the time being, the two parties will still govern the country, but it will be difficult to pass legislation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, Germany faces political gridlock. Scholz has said he will call a vote of confidence in his government <a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-government-struggling-economy-coalition-lindner-1cae2cd0266453103fc89800e47e7ce7">in January</a>. He and the Greens are expected to lose, which would trigger an early election and likely <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/political-wrangling-starts-after-german-coalition-collapse/a-70725678">elevate different parties and politicians</a> to leadership positions, significantly shifting the course of German politics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did things get so chaotic in Germany?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The three-party coalition was troubled nearly from the beginning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scholz has never been particularly popular, and his party has been steadily losing ground to the right-wing <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/12/24080074/germany-afd-far-right">Alternative for Germany (AfD)</a>, as well as to other minority parties in both <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354601/european-parliament-elections-macron-afd-national-rally-far-right-fidesz-france">European Parliament</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-far-right-afd-track-another-state-election-win-2024-09-22/">state elections</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other issue the coalition faced was that German economic growth has been slow for years, struggling to rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic. That’s primarily because the German auto industry is threatened by<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/18/vw-bmw-mbg-germanys-top-car-brands-are-struggling-in-the-ev-era.html#:~:text=The%20headwinds%2C%20while%20not%20unique,member%20states%20from%20voting%20in"> Chinese electric imports and decreased demand</a>. German energy costs have skyrocketed following <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/28/23325958/sanctions-impacting-russias-economy-putin">sanctions on the cheap Russian fuel</a> the country relied on prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After no party won a majority back in 2021, the coalition members — each with a very different approach to spending — agreed to work together “based on the assumption that they had a pretty generous budget from <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-top-court-annuls-move-to-repurpose-covid-funding/a-67403848">leftover coronavirus funds</a>,” credit secured to finance the country’s pandemic response, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/liana-fix">Liana Fix</a>, a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan was for “Social Democrats to give social welfare to their constituencies, for the Liberals to reduce taxes for business owners, and for the Greens to do climate projects,” in line with their parties’ priorities, said Fix.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the German constitutional court ruled earlier this year that the emergency Covid-19 funds couldn’t be used for other priorities, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/23/germany-slides-deeper-into-budget-crisis-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">leaving a multibillion-euro hole in Germany’s budget</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adding to this problem is that Germany has a constitutionally set level of debt it isn’t supposed to exceed. Scholz wanted to raise that debt level, in part, to <a href="https://www.vox.com/22960493/germany-chancellor-reversal-defense-war-russia-ukraine">surge aid to Ukraine during its war with Russia</a>. Christian Lindner, the fired finance minister, said that to do so would be tantamount to “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c04f5dc1-e971-4421-9993-ac11c6231dd5">violating my oath of office</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Opposition parties have called for rapid action to form a new government, particularly given that US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">threatened tariffs</a> that could further damage Germany’s economy. Scholz’s proposed timetable for elections wouldn’t allow a new government to be formed before June. Once it is formed, he and the Social Democratic Party will likely find themselves voted out of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As leaders scramble to assign blame for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">Donald Trump&#8217;s decisive win</a> on Tuesday, this round of post-election finger-pointing differs markedly from recent cycles. Unlike past elections with narrow margins, Trump&#8217;s likely popular vote victory and his uniform swing across states and counties defy simple explanations like a racist electorate or discontent over Biden&#8217;s foreign policy. Even chalking the election entirely up to inflation seems rather convenient and incomplete.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. Bernie Sanders, who earned about 6,000 fewer votes in his reelection bid than Kamala Harris did in Vermont, came out on Wednesday <a href="https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1854271157135941698">with a statement</a> blasting the Democratic Party for abandoning working-class people, who appeared to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/">break overwhelmingly</a> for Trump. This critique quickly gained traction, with commentators arguing that Harris and the Democrats had lost touch with working people&#8217;s needs, prioritizing issues like&nbsp;democracy and abortion rights too much. “If voters did not believe that Harris had a real plan to make their lives better, materially, it is hard to fault them,” <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/11/its-happening-again-trump-election-win">wrote Matt Karp in Jacobin</a> on Wednesday. “I wish we had enacted the housing, care, and child tax credit elements in Build Back Better so we would have had concrete cost-of-living benefits to run on,” <a href="https://x.com/BharatRamamurti/status/1854556125523329511">lamented</a> former Biden administration official Bharat Ramamurti on Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not here to prescribe what politicians should or should not run on next time around, and I do desperately hope that elected officials use their time in office to pass good, well-designed legislation that improves people’s lives. But it seems like the discourse is barreling toward a well-trodden yet dubious place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The (appealing) contention is that Democrats could have turned their electoral fortunes around if they had passed the right policies and then campaigned more effectively on those programs. In recent years this philosophy has been dubbed “<a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1447356638768373761">deliverism</a>” — coined to suggest that voters will elect politicians who deliver on their promises to solve problems. “Deliverism means governing well and establishing a record that the electorate needed to win actually feels,” <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/case-for-deliverism/">wrote</a> American Prospect editor David Dayen in 2021.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the 2022 midterms, Sen. Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/opinion/elizabeth-warren-democrat-senate-midterm.html">argued in the New York Times</a> that voters had rewarded Democrats specifically for programs like pandemic relief and infrastructure modernization. Other policies, like allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices and capping insulin costs for older Americans, Warren argued, were what motivated voters to cast their ballots for Democrats. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Party leaders particularly favor a more sophisticated version of this theory: that policies will create “positive feedback loops,” building loyal constituencies who enable further policy victories through their continued electoral support. It’s no secret, for example, that Democrats believe making it easier for workers to join unions will not only improve their standard of living but improve Democrats’ electoral position by increasing the number of union members in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deliverism&#8217;s appeal lies in its intuitive logic, especially for college-educated rationalists drawn to clear cause-and-effect relationships: Good policies will lead to subsequent electoral victories. But there’s not a lot of evidence that policymaking actually works like this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Decades of scholarship have shown that most people don’t understand how policies work, what policy benefits they’re getting, and which party is responsible for enacting specific policies. And even when a politician designs a program so that it’s easier for them to take credit, that still doesn’t always work out to their benefit. Those who received health insurance through Obamacare Medicaid expansion, for example, <a href="https://www.russellsage.org/publications/stable-condition">showed very little change</a> in voter turnout or party loyalty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Northwestern political scientists Daniel Galvin and Chloe Thurston outline <a href="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2018/wp-18-16.pdf">in their essential research</a> on these questions, history should fundamentally challenge the premise that good policy success will most likely lead to political rewards for the party that passes it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Upon inspection, the intellectual basis for thinking that policies are good vehicles for building electoral majorities — or good substitutes for the more tedious work of organizational party-building — is quite thin,” they write.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t to say that Democrats shouldn’t try to pass good policy. The expanded child tax credit during the pandemic was <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/30/23317834/child-tax-credit-ctc-ira">demonstrably good policy</a>, even if most voters showed only <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NPR_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202112070936.pdf">muted enthusiasm for it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it’s of course not the case that politicians are never rewarded for good policy. Many voters even now still credit Trump <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/2024-10-31-philadelphia-kamala-vs-the-couch/">for the stimulus checks</a> they received in the mail during the pandemic, checks that prominently featured the president’s name. Doing good things and taking credit for those things can be helpful sometimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as Democratic leaders move to refocus on working-class priorities, they face two sobering realities: <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-death-of-deliverism/">Policies alone rarely drive electoral outcomes</a>, and an increasingly stark divide separates non-college voters from the college-educated liberals and socialists who lead the party and its allied progressive groups. Navigating these tensions will be necessary for charting future strategy, and the research suggests that Harris’s loss this week could not have been avoided if she had just emphasized Biden administration accomplishments more clearly. Such thinking oversimplifies a much more complex political reality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382945/kamala-harris-lost-donald-trump-why">Election night 2024</a> felt like the sequel to Election 2016: Many of the beats were the same, but the particulars were different.

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you are anything like me, you have been trying to hold many different ideas in your head at once these past few days —&nbsp;and you still have a lot of questions.

But we have collected your questions from the Vox Instagram page, our Explain It to Me inbox, and the Explain It to Me podcast phone line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are four common queries from Vox’s readers and listeners, with my best read on them (with an assist from one of Vox’s most astute young political minds) as we sift through the fog of Election Week.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9146325452" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Did Trump overperform or did Harris underperform?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We all want to apportion blame or credit. Was Kamala Harris doomed by the political environment? Or did her campaign make missteps? Both can be true. Which one determined the outcome more?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is, it’s hard to say what was determinative. Nate Silver can run 80,000 simulations of the election, but the rest of us only get to live through one reality. We can’t know the counterfactual and it will take time for <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/">the data that tells the story of this election</a> to come into focus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With that caveat out of the way, I am skeptical that Harris ever had a chance — and I’m more inclined to pin her loss on the conditions under which she was running, rather than the choices she made as she ran.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Something stuck out to me throughout election night: Whenever MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki would pull up some bellwether county in a swing state, he would compare the 2024 margins to 2020 and 2016. He would often point out Donald Trump was returning to his 2016 levels, while Harris trailed President Joe Biden’s 2020 performance, closer to (and yet usually above) Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/11/05/compare-2020-2024-presidential-results/">Look at this map from the Washington Post</a> that charts the shift from 2020 to 2024 in the presidential race by county. It’s red arrows all over. You should read exit polls with caution, but it would <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-harris-trump-women-latinos-black-voters-0f3fbda3362f3dcfe41aa6b858f22d12">appear</a> Trump made gains with voters across the board. That suggests to me there was a structural problem, as much as any strategic one, for Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luckily, we don’t have to look far for structural explanations. Vox’s Zack Beauchamp <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">wrote on the wave of anti-incumbency worldwide</a> that seems to have carried Trump and sunk Harris. It’s damaged conservatives (in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/358985/uk-labour-keir-starmer-tories-migration-politics-elections-july-4-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson">the UK</a>) and liberals (in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-koreas-2024-general-election-results-and-implications">South Korea</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The constant is people being fed up with those in power after Covid-19 and the global inflation that followed. The aggregated economic indicators might still be solid, but wage growth has only <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383397/economy-inflation-2024-election-democrats-trump">narrowly outpaced</a> inflation. Consumers aren’t feeling flush with cash and slowing inflation does not mean <em>no</em> inflation. Interest rates have also stayed high, adding to the sense that things are expensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America might also be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/americans-conservative-obama-trump-joe-biden">a little more conservative</a> than Democrats thought, which is why Trump sought to portray Harris as an out-of-touch liberal. Maybe the Biden-Harris administration could have handled inflation better. But it’s vexed governments everywhere.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than anything, people were simply frustrated: <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx">In an October Gallup poll</a>, 72 percent of US adults said they were dissatisfied with how things were going in the country. It’s going to be hard for any incumbent national leader to win in that environment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s remember the state of the 2024 campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">after the Biden-Trump debate</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/08/14/harris-energizes-democrats-in-transformed-presidential-race/">the clear evidence</a> of improvement in Democrats’ chances after Harris took over. She attempted to circumvent Americans’ anger with the status quo by running as the challenger even while she was the sitting vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it didn’t work, and maybe it never could. People were sick of the Biden-Harris administration. They wanted a change. That’s what Trump was selling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is Trump going to do?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s the big takeaway, beyond any specifics that could be subject to change: Trump is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term">less likely to be constrained</a> by other Republicans, by advisers who are more loyal to the office than him personally, and by democratic norms than he was during his first term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now for the specifics. The day after his victory, Trump’s campaign <a href="https://x.com/axios/status/1854167037586595937?s=46&amp;t=LVLwPwruc4koXd6hdIOe8Q">pledged</a> to start “the largest mass deportation operation” in US history on his first day back in office, a signal that he may be even more aggressive on his signature issue. He could enact those tariffs as he pleases <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">unless Congress stops him in the next two months</a>. His team has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-day-one-election-victory-karoline-leavitt-1981319">telegraphed</a> an immediate expansion of oil and gas exploration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923">brashly said</a> that the Trump administration would advise the removal of fluoride from American water supplies on day one, a preview of the public health agenda likely to follow. We can also expect some kind of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/donald-trump-election-federal-agencies">shake-up within the federal bureaucracy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is worth sounding a note of caution, however. Trump signed the so-called “Muslim ban” on January 27, 2017, but <a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/pages/timeline-muslim-ban">it was blocked by the courts</a>, including the Supreme Court. It took him a year and a half to get an altered version okayed by the judiciary. Likewise, Trump’s attempt to approve <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18263675/medicaid-work-requirements-lawsuit-donald-trump">Medicaid work requirements</a> was later stopped by a federal judge. One of the biggest questions of a second Trump term is: How much will the judiciary restrain him, if his own people won’t?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Congress, Trump and Republicans are already hankering to cut more taxes and slash the social safety net. But actually passing those plans is still going to be hard. Control of the House is still undecided and even if the GOP wins it, their margin will be extremely thin. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed">The failure to repeal Obamacare in 2017</a> is a very recent example of a newly minted Republican majority’s top priority failing because of public backlash.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What does Trump&#8217;s election mean for the world?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the election even occurred, one Vox reader asked us: Why do US elections matter so much for the rest of the world?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US has <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ranked-us-military-officially-most-powerful-2024-208664">the most powerful military in the world</a>, it is one of the two most important diplomatic players in global affairs (<a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/china-beats-united-states-top-2024-global-diplomacy-index">though China has caught up</a>), and its foreign aid programs are <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-the-u-s-government-and-global-health/">a vital lifeline for humanitarian efforts</a> around the world. On foreign policy in particular, Trump has plenty of discretion to do as he pleases without much or any input from Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know the consequences of this enormous power’s misuse. The US military has obviously been used for <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war">terrible ends</a>, US diplomacy can be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/us-sanction-countries-work/">ineffectual</a>, and US-funded humanitarianism has a mixed track record.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is why the fate of not only 330 million Americans but many millions more around the world was altered by Trump’s election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353037/trump-gaza-israel-protests-biden-election-2024">Israel’s war in Gaza</a>, the effort to contain <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/366903/mpox-monkeypox-africa-continental-emergency-drc-who-clade">mpox in Africa,</a> the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/354112/sudan-darfur-el-fasher-genocide-humanitarian-aid-neglect">famine in Sudan</a>, the war in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7vuV-cyHA">Ukraine</a>, Taiwan’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24047940/china-us-war-taiwan-japan-key-role-explained">future as an independent nation</a> — these are some of the high-profile issues over which Donald Trump, rather than Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, will have significant leverage and influence. PEPFAR, the AIDS relief program that became the signature success of the bipartisan global health consensus that took shape under George W. Bush, <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/">will need to be reauthorized next year</a>, and there are signs of Republican support <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24036223/pepfar-aids-hiv-africa-global-health-george-w-bush-republicans-congress">wavering</a>. Trump will hold the veto pen during that congressional debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What will actually happen? I don’t know. But I know Trump’s election has defined what will be possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What do Democrats do now?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to briefly hand the newsletter over to Vox senior political reporter Christian Paz, who sat down with Explain It To Me podcast host Jonquilyn Hill to analyze this year’s election and has as good of a read on the state of the Democratic Party as anyone:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s still this assumption that a diversifying America would inevitably lead to progressive or liberal or Democratic dominance, regardless of other factors, which once again, keeps being proven wrong and wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, this election will be one where racial polarization decreases, especially among Latino voters. They voted similarly or in the similar direction or similar swing as white voters. The Democrats got the turnout they wanted, but it turns out that the voters that were turning out just didn&#8217;t want to vote for a Democrat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democrats bet a lot on educated and suburban voters, while expecting to maintain their previous margins with working-class voters of color and snagging enough white working-class voters to push them over the top. That bet didn’t pay off.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will take months for Democrats to figure out how to recalibrate going forward, in the 2026 midterms and beyond. Looking at the 2024 fallout so far, Christian said, “There&#8217;s a mixed bag [in terms] of just what it is that the electorate wants.”</p>

  <p id="Vhbgxm">People across the country received racist text messages in the days after Donald Trump was elected to a second term for president, and now federal authorities are investigating.</p>
<p id="V0BiNg">“In multiple states, including Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, Black women, men, and students have reported receiving racist text messages from an unknown source, urging them to report to a plantation to pick cotton,” the NAACP said in a press release. Messages said variations of, “You have been selected to be a house slave,” or “You have been selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation,” according to <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/slave-texts-telling-people-to-pick-cotton-sent-to-dc-virginia-residents/3763360/">screenshots</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/racist-texts-election-fbi.html">news reports</a>. They also often instruct recipients on where to go or when to be ready “With all of your belongings.” </p>

 The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country.<br><br>
 The temporary relief from deportation brought a brief sense of security to some 500,000 immigrants estimated to benefit from the program before Texas-based U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker put it on hold in August, days after applicants filed their paperwork.<br><br>
 Barker ruled yesterday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority by implementing the program and had stretched the legal interpretation of relevant immigration law “<strong>past its breaking point</strong>.”<br><br>
 The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as <strong>“Keeping Families Together”</strong> would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump’s return to the White House.<br></p><p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/11/politics/house-votes-count-election-dg/">CNN’s latest projection</a> of the crucial races to gain control of the House has Republicans ahead in ten of the contests, with, according to their projections, only six victories needed to tip them over the magic 218 for control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 21:42:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nancy Pelosi says Biden’s delay in exiting race blew Democrats’ chances]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Had Biden left sooner, she noted, the party could have an open primary.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, conservatives on social media claimed an unlikely new icon. It wasn’t a podcaster with questionable views or a libertarian businessman selling a course or any particular ideology. It was actress Sydney Sweeney, <em>Euphoria</em> star and the recent lead of the rom-com <em>Anyone But You.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following her hosting gig on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in March, two conservative outlets <a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/amy-hamm-wokeness-is-no-match-for-sydney-sweeneys-undeniable-beauty">published</a> <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boobs-are-back-thank-you-sydney-sweeney/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1709711300-2">columns</a> heralding Sweeney as a return to conventional beauty standards of the ’90s and early 2000s — or as, Bridget Phetasy for the Spectator put it, “the giggling blonde with an amazing rack.” Both pieces<strong> </strong>postulate that, by wearing low-cut dresses and playing up her sexuality, Sweeney was inviting men to gawk at her, therefore raising a middle finger to “woke culture” and the Me Too movement. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sweeney hasn’t publicly aligned herself with the right in any way. (Her <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/sydney-sweeney-responds-maga-supporting-family-member-controversy-1234629337/">family’s politics</a>, though, were the subject of controversy in 2022, which may have something to do with the right’s eager embrace of her.) Rather, her ascension as a throwback-y, hyper-feminine sex symbol has given conservatives the rare mainstream Gen Z figure on whom to project their values. For those paying close attention, the past year was rife with springboards for the conservative message.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the hindsight following Trump’s reelection, it seems the zeitgeist of 2024 was a foreshadowing of his return to office and something forecasters might have considered a little more seriously. “Bro country” singers became the artists de jour, going head-to-head with female pop singers on the charts and, in many cases, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/359734/female-pop-stars-charts-billboard-rap-country-popularity">outperforming them</a>. The buzziest new reality shows were about <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/360219/dcc-dallas-cowboys-cheerleaders-netflix-judi-kelli-victoria-kalina">Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/374143/secret-lives-mormon-wives-momtok-utah">Mormon TikTokers</a>. Conservative films from smaller distributors, like the biopic <em>Reagan</em> and Daily Wire documentary <em>Am I Racist?</em>, made millions at the box office. Nominally apolitical podcasters and streamers, from Joe Rogan to the Nelk Boys, hosted presidential <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">candidates</a> and took on an increasingly political valence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a sharp turn from the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/obamacore-obama-pop-culture-kamala-harris.html">liberal-coded pop culture of the Obama years</a> and the sort of trends that took off in response to Trump’s first presidency — comic-book movies with a progressive edge like <em>Wonder Woman</em> and <em>Black Panther, </em>social commentary films like <em>Get Out</em> and <em>Promising Young Woman</em>, not to mention <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/drag-race-inc-whats-lost-when-a-subculture-goes-pop.html">the explosion of drag culture</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Joel Penney, an associate professor at Montclair State University, says the overall conservative feel of pop culture at the moment is, in many ways, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23581859/me-too-backlash-susan-faludi-weinstein-roe-dobbs-depp-heard">response to the Me Too movement</a> and the notion by its detractors that “masculinity is in crisis.” At the same time that we’re seeing Sweeney receive praise for representing “traditional” femininity, the All-American straight white “bro” is getting renewed cultural attention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s been a lot of this trying to restore these strong male role models in pop culture, whether it’s Tom Cruise in the <em>Top Gun</em> remake or these ‘bro’ podcasters and country singers,” Penney says. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>2024 was all about the straight white bro </strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can see this happening most visibly in mainstream music. It’s not just that country music — a Southern genre with a past and present of conservative politics — has emerged in the mainstream over the past two years — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/">with</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/morgan-wallen-arrest-controversy-timeline-b2525290.html">much</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political">controversy</a>. It’s that this class of musicians — Morgan Wallen, Zach Bryan, Jelly Roll, Luke Combs, Shaboozey, and the newly rustic Post Malone — are glaringly male. Shaboozey’s unprecedented achievements in an overwhelmingly white genre add a refreshing element to this conversation. Beyoncé also released a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24115959/beyonce-cowboy-carter-country-music-explained">successful country album</a> this year that features Shaboozey and an array of Black female country artists.<em> Cowboy Carter</em>’s lead single, “Texas Hold ’Em,” topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, a shorter amount of time than Morgan Wallen, Post Malone, and Shaboozey’s No.1 songs this year. Nor was she recognized by the country establishment, getting completely <a href="https://thehilltoponline.com/2024/09/16/beyonces-cowboy-carter-receives-zero-cma-nominations/">shut out of the CMAs</a>. Overall, it seems like country fans and the average young person, who’s <a href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/cmts-morgan-wallen-country-streaming-march-1235573629/">listening to more country music</a> these days, are still more eager to hear dudes croon about beer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside of the charts, these country singers have also become mainstream personalities and subjects of celebrity gossip. In the span of roughly a year, Bryan went from a <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/pulling-weeds-chris-black-zach-bryan">little-known alternative country crooner posting videos on YouTube</a> to a celebrity whose personal relationships are being <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abbzbon/video/7435029860285746474">analyzed</a> by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bethanysware/video/7434745300285246763">TikTok</a> users and explained in the pages of <a href="https://people.com/zach-bryan-brianna-chickenfry-relationship-timeline-7866836">People</a>. Jelly Roll and his wife, influencer and popular podcast host Bunnie XO, have also become a recognizable celebrity couple, while Morgan Wallen’s <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/07/31/entertainment/country-singer-megan-moroney-addresses-morgan-wallen-dating-rumors/">dating life</a> and <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/08/entertainment/morgan-wallen-arrested-after-allegedly-throwing-chair-off-bar-roof/">public antics</a> have become<em> </em>Page Six fodder. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elsewhere in pop culture, figures seemingly designated for a more male, conservative audience have gone mainstream. First, there was the <a href="https://www.vox.com/internet-culture/357813/hawk-tuah-girl-meme-tiktok-explained">viral video</a> of a woman from Tennessee being asked about oral sex outside of a bar — a very bro-y Girls Gone Wild-inspired genre that’s emerged on TikTok — and offering a memorable onomatopoeia. There’s also the viral Florida-based father-and-son duo A.J. and Big Justice, who do food reviews at Costco. With the exception of Big Justice’s sister and mother — who’s literally referred to as the “Mother of Big Justice” in videos — this expanded universe of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pl6Dg0YB3w">“Costco Guys”</a> is made of white men and boys from Florida and New Jersey rating foods in a cartoonishly macho manner.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They&#8217;re not explicitly expressing MAGA as a value, but they&#8217;re trafficking in spaces that have been less visible in recent years: rural and suburban enclaves, featuring white, heterosexual, male, and even &#8220;bro-y&#8221; talent that was out of vogue in recent history. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One can assume that the current MAGA-coded fabric of mainstream culture correlates with a generation of young people who identify as <a href="https://www.theupandup.us/p/gen-z-teens-conservative-shift-gallup-data">more conservative than their parents</a>, although Penney says the relationship between pop culture and politics is a two-way street. While the media can reflect growing opinions and interests of the moment, it can also be used to shape it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pop culture doesn&#8217;t just emerge out of nowhere,” says Penney, who wrote the book <em>Pop Culture, Politics, and the News</em>. “We’re seeing attempts to shape the culture that are increasingly coming from the conservative media ecosystem.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Conservatives carved out a space for themselves at the movies&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March, Ben Shapiro’s media company The Daily Wire released its first theatrical movie, the “satirical” documentary <em>Am I Racist?, </em>which <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/how-the-daily-wire-engineered-box-office-hit-am-i-racist.html">earned $4.5 million</a> its opening weekend. Currently, it’s the highest-grossing documentary of the year along with a handful of other conservative nonfiction films including the Catholic documentary <em>Jesus Thirsts: The Story of the Eucharist</em>, the Dinesh D&#8217;Souza-directed <em>Vindicating Trump</em>, and the creationist movie <em>The Ark and The Darkness</em> all making the <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/2024/genre/Documentary">top 10 list</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 saw other movies from conservative studios and right-wing producers make notable financial gains. Despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, the Ronald Reagan biopic, <em>Reagan</em>, starring Dennis Quaid, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/09/14/reagan-defies-negative-reviews-and-holds-strong-in-box-office-top-5/">broke into the Top 5 at the box office</a> when it premiered in August, doing particularly well with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/box-office-summer-labor-day-deadpool-wolverine-afraid-1236073792/">older, white, and Southern audiences</a>. This summer, the Christian media company Angel Studios also released the pro-adoption movie <em>Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trout</em>, marketed by Daily Wire+. While it made significantly less money than its <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2023/">2023 predecessor <em>Sound of Freedom</em></a><em>, </em>which had a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/19/1188405402/qanon-supporters-are-promoting-sound-of-freedom-heres-why">vocal fanbase of QAnon supporters</a><em>,</em> its nearly $12 million worldwide earnings are still a massive accomplishment for a small Christian film with no movie stars attached. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the performance of these movies has not bred the same immediate concern of something like <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, it does provide a potential incentive for major studios to start courting a movie-going crowd that’s felt alienated by mainstream Hollywood.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/2571_FP_00623B-3587x1500-d3275b2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=10.064120434904,0,79.871759130192,100" alt="Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. " title="Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones in the 2024 film &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;/em&gt;. | Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment" data-portal-copyright="Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Warner Bros has yet to produce its own <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, but we’ve seen hints that Hollywood is interested in movies that at least appeal to white, Southern, and conservative audiences. American nostalgia bait came to the fore in the summer blockbuster <em>Twisters</em>. The Oklahoma-set film with a star-studded, country-infused soundtrack did <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/box-office-twisters-middle-america-red-states-1236016845/">particularly well in Southern cities and theater chains</a> in middle America, outperforming initial estimations. While it’s probably most accurate to describe the film as decidedly apolitical with some patriotic markers, it does see the white, blond savior (played by Glen Powell) emasculate the movie’s other male main character, Latino storm chaser Javi (Anthony Ramos). Powell happened to produce another piece of Americana, <em>Blue Angels</em>, a look at the US Navy’s flight demo squadron, and the fourth highest-grossing documentary of 2024. He also co-starred in <em>Anyone But You</em> with Sweeney, a film released at the end of 2023 that crossed the <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-anyone-but-you-crosses-200-million-poor-things-nears-100-million-mark-1235922019/">$200 million</a> mark in early 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Penney says that corporations will try new strategies and pander to different audiences, as they’ve done with Marvel and Disney’s diversity pushes in recent years, based on what they think will benefit them financially. They’re not really thinking about political impact. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That was very much the reality of capitalism at work,” says Penney. “[Disney] was trying new strategies, not because they were really, truly convinced that they were going to save the world through expanding diversity, but they were getting a sense that that&#8217;s what the audience wanted. It was a response to Me Too and Black Lives Matter and things that actually resonated with our culture to a degree.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This pendulum swing from the sort of diversity-focused art that dominated pop culture during the Obama years to what we’re seeing now is hardly unprecedented. Specifically in music, country’s popularity as a genre has historically corresponded with a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/911-country-music-songs-1221348/">push in right-wing politics,</a> from the jingoist anthems following 9/11 to “Okie from Muskogee” during the Nixon years. Pop culture has also seen movies with conservative and/or religious themes, from<em> American Sniper</em> and <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, break the box office. If this current moment tells us anything, it’s that we’re stuck in an ouroboros of shifting political values and corporate interests. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Suffice to say, it’s not a question of whether we’ve been here before but whether we’re paying attention to what these signals all mean. With an honest look at our media landscape, were the results of the election truly that surprising?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On November 5, Americans elevated a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/14/23958866/trump-vermin-authoritarian-democracy">reactionary authoritarian</a> to the presidency — again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/3/22211657/washington-post-trump-call-georgia-secretary-state-raffensperger-recording-find-votes">attempting to overturn an election</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23513019/january-6-committee-report-trump-2020-election-insurrection">fomenting an insurrection</a>, becoming a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353111/trump-trial-verdict-criticisms-wrongly-convicted">convicted criminal,</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/podcasts/372206/springfield-ohio-pets-haitian-immigrants-conspiracy">baselessly accusing</a> an immigrant community of eating house pets, Donald Trump not only won a second lease on the White House, but he did so with a plurality of the popular vote — while Republicans took control of both congressional chambers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Liberals may be feeling a sense of déjà vu. But this is not 2017 all over again. It is something worse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past eight years, Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image. In Congress, his intraparty critics have almost all <a href="https://rollcall.com/2019/10/28/trump-has-gop-critics-in-congress-but-many-of-them-arent-sticking-around/">decamped for the private sector</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/gops-awkward-2016-flip-flops-trump-make-comeback-2024/">knelt to kiss his ring</a>. In the executive branch, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jim-mattis-resignation-officially-ends-adults-room-era-trump-s-ncna951036">the “adults”</a> are <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/marjorie-taylor-greene-wants-a-cabinet-position?srsltid=AfmBOoqgx-gjs0dkk7QYIdtJ5BbWuDB3Pvkgko7san1Yz-wEapz1W7Ns">no longer “in the room</a>”: Awed by his own power and unprepared to staff an administration, Trump leaned on many relatively mainstream advisers in his first term. This time around, he and his allies have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/trump-loyalists-2024-presidential-election">assembled a cadre</a> of loyalists, some of whom have won <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384320/trump-cabinet-white-house">cabinet nominations</a> (alongside some more conventional Republicans). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, conservatives have consolidated their grip on the Supreme Court, slashed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-voters-trump-florida-texas-pennsylvania-democrats-3637d86dede99e36f35d725afabdcba1">the Democrats’ advantage with Hispanic voters</a>, and fortified the GOP’s strength with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-return-power-fueled-by-hispanic-working-class-voter-support-2024-11-06/">the non-college-educated electorate</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/383565/2024-election-results-kamala-harris-loss-democrats-future">realignments</a> that threatened the Democratic Party’s capacity to wield federal power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this amounts to a catastrophe for anyone who values liberal democracy, egalitarian economic policy, and social equality for all marginalized groups. As someone who has spent the past decade advocating for more expansionary immigration policies, a larger social safety net, criminal justice reform, and decarbonization, it is difficult to see my country embrace a man who evinces contempt for all of those causes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the face of this calamity, Democrats must develop a clear-eyed understanding of how they got here and chart a plausible path back to the country they want to live in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This newsletter — The Rebuild — aims to aid in that project. In weekly installments, I’ll try to offer some insight into how Democrats lost their national majority, as well as what we — people who care about advancing progressive change — must do to become more effective moving forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Answering those questions will require Democrats to analyze their predicament with open minds. If we seek ideologically comforting explanations for the party’s problems — rather than empirically sound ones — the coalition will march deeper into the wilderness. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, in the wake of Harris’s loss, virtually <a href="https://samharris.substack.com/p/the-reckoning">every</a> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188110/biden-white-working-class-ira-trump">Democratic</a> faction has produced its share of motivated reasoning. In future newsletters, I plan to take issue with some centrists’ analysis of the party’s difficulties. But today, I want to explain why I worry that the left is allowing wishful thinking to cloud its vision of political reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since November 5, some progressives have drawn a sweeping lesson from Donald Trump’s second victory: Harris’s loss proves that Democrats gain little from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/08/obama-era-democrat-party-future">moderation</a>” or “<a href="https://x.com/mattduss/status/1854169589237874891">centrism</a>” and must “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democratic-party-elite-responsible-catastrophe/">embrace radical policies</a>” in order to compete. I admire many of the writers making this argument. But their confidence in this narrative strikes me as wildly unfounded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367389/dnc-2024-kamala-harris-policies-trump-dangerously-liberal">pivoted to the center</a> on border security, crime, and, to a lesser extent, economics. There are plenty of sound arguments — both moral and political — against Democrats moderating on specific issues. Yet it’s hard to see how anyone could be confident that Harris lost because she moderated, much less that her loss proved that moderation is electorally counterproductive as a rule. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To name just a few reasons for doubting those premises:</p>

<li>Harris actually <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/08/2024/a-very-simple-prescription-for-democrats-just-wait">did better</a> where both she and Donald Trump held campaign rallies and aired TV advertisements than she did in the rest of the country. Thus, if Harris’s problem was her moderate messaging, it is odd that she won a higher share of the vote in the places that were more exposed to that messaging, despite the fact that such areas were also inundated by pro-Trump ads. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In a September poll from <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651692/voters-choice-character-leadership-skill.aspx">Gallup</a>, 51 percent of voters described Harris as “too liberal,” while just 6 percent deemed her “too conservative.”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Some of the Democratic Party’s biggest overperformers in the 2024 election — the down-ballot candidates that ran furthest ahead of Harris with their constituents — were moderates: <a href="https://x.com/tahrajirari/status/1854908246534111278">Jon Tester, Amy Klobuchar,</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/maine-us-house-district-2-results">Jared Golden</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-washington-us-house-3.html">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Harris had been <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris">a liberal senator</a> and took many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html">left-wing positions</a> during the 2020 Democratic primary. She was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-paints-harris-ultra-liberal-1st-rally-biden/story?id=112253634">attacked relentlessly</a> by the Trump campaign on that basis. It’s hard to see how one could determine that it was Harris’s moderate messaging, rather than her progressive background, that was more damaging to her prospects. What we know, however, is that her opponent’s political advisers sought to highlight the latter, not the former. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Biden-Harris administration was, by many progressives’ own account, the most <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">left-wing White House on domestic policy</a> in generations, and Trump’s team portrayed Harris <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4871309-trump-campaign-harris-biden-presidential-debate/">as an extension of that administration</a>. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Across the wealthy world, parties that presided over inflation have <a href="https://x.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1854485866548195735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854485866548195735%7Ctwgr%5Ed9a3106d708552ae9f36cdc67a77f45ec428ac3a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2F2024%2F11%2F07%2Felection-world-inflation-harris-trump%2F">been losing at the ballot box</a>, irrespective of their political leanings, a fact that raises doubts about whether any grand ideological lesson can be drawn from Harris’s defeat.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My aim here is not to argue that Democrats must pivot to the center on all issues. I don’t think they should. I do think that the party needs to moderate its image nationally, if only to better compete for Senate control. But I’m still gathering my thoughts on how precisely they should pursue that task and will elaborate on them in future newsletters.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, my point is simply that there is little basis for confidence that Harris lost due to excessive moderation, or that Democrats would benefit electorally from becoming broadly more left-wing. The fact that many on the left nevertheless evince such certainty is therefore disconcerting. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being progressive, in the best sense of that term, means putting the interests of the most vulnerable above one’s own comfort — whether material or ideological. And right now, America’s most disempowered constituencies have a strong interest in Democrats ousting reactionaries from power. If the party substitutes wishful thinking for unblinkered analysis, they will have a harder time accomplishing that task.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sifting through the wreckage of the 2024 campaign, one thing that can’t be said about the Democrats is that they put too little effort into winning over Latino voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you looked closely, it was clear that the national party, the Biden-Harris campaign, and Democratic-allied groups were determined to avoid a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/pandemics-assault-latino-political-power/615979/">repeat of 2020</a>, when Joe Biden’s campaign was widely accused of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/9/9/21420401/latino-vote-democrats-joe-biden-chuck-rocha">neglecting Latino voters</a>, starting its outreach too late, and making tone-deaf appeals — all mistakes that allowed Donald Trump to make historic gains with these communities despite Biden ultimately prevailing in the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time around, the Biden (and then Harris) campaign were determined to do everything right. They hired and elevated <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/4/23708278/joe-biden-kamala-harris-2024-election-latino-voters-julie-chavez-rodriguez">top Latino consultants, strategists</a>, and <a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/27/president-joe-biden-reelection-campaign-team-el-paso-rep-veronica-escobar-added/70155654007/">elected</a> <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2023/biden-harris-2024-announces-campaign-national-advisory-board/">officials</a>. They opened field offices and hired staff in heavily Latino parts of swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania as early as the spring. They reached out to voters on <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-vs-harris-is-the-whatsapp-campaign.html">WhatsApp</a>, a private messaging app used as a form of social media by many Latino and immigrant communities; sent surrogates to Spanish-language radio stations; and microtargeted advertising to Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Mexican American voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spanish and bilingual ads ran continuously on TV, radio, and online starting in March. And those ads moved beyond an explicit focus on identity, instead talking up policy and accomplishments like Medicare’s cap on insulin prices, the expansion of health care coverage, and job creation during the post-Covid economic recovery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hope was that this earlier, smarter, more tailored campaign would help reverse a few trends that were obvious for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23873568/biden-polling-black-latino-voters-2024-election-trump">most of 2023</a> and 2024: that Latino voters were deeply unhappy with the status quo, were not enthusiastic about Biden’s reelection, and were questioning their loyalty to the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s clear now that this strategy was not enough. Though it will take months to get more granular data, county-level results and exit polls do indicate a rightward shift by Latino voters across the country that contributed to Trump’s victory. To be clear, it appears<strong> </strong>Democrats still won a majority of Latino voters — but the harsh reality for Democrats is that Trump once again managed to improve his standing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean that Democrats should <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/democrats-latino-vote-trump-00187991">throw out</a> the playbook for campaigning with Latino voters. Calls for a hard pivot to the <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-common-sense-democrat-manifesto">right</a> on cultural issues, or outright resignation about a permanent racial realignment — as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-black-latino-voters-interview/680588/">some</a> of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/trump-latino-hispanic-vote-election">conventional</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/latinos-vote-trump/680596/">wisdom</a> floating around since the election suggests — are premature. Republicans simply cannot be sure these gains will stick around without Trump on the ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are oddly two contradictory takeaways given what we know so far: Democrats can assure themselves that they ran a pretty good campaign to win back Latino voter support. On a deeper level, however, they missed a more fundamental disconnect between the party and the voters, particularly the working class, that a textbook campaign simply couldn’t fix.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Two takeaways from the election</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two distinct points to take away from November 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, campaigning does still matter. The <a href="https://x.com/williamjordann/status/1856076168111194180">national trend</a> of Trump posting better margins of support in non-battleground states than in swing states applied to Latino voters as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Where Democrats campaigned heavily for Latino votes, Kamala Harris saw a smaller drop in support than in places where her campaign did not focus its efforts — meaning that the Harris campaign’s Latino ground game, spending, and organizing shouldn’t be discounted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second point cuts the other way: There is a much deeper problem with Democrats’ appeal to Latino voters, one that will take time to repair. Nationally, Democrats like Biden and Harris were just not trusted as working-class champions by many Latino voters, who are still overwhelmingly working class and not college educated. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The memories of economic hardship during the pandemic (for which Trump largely escaped blame) and the inflationary period that followed never went away, and weren’t properly addressed by either Biden or Harris during the campaign. Combined with an overriding <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">anti-incumbent mood</a> that permeated electorates globally this year, Democrats were almost certain to do worse with Latino voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There were some exceptions. Republican Senate candidates, for example, did not do as well as Trump did among Latino voters, and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who won the Arizona Senate race in a state Harris lost, particularly overperformed, winning by two percentage points a state that Trump won by five. But the larger point holds: Democrats lost ground with Latino voters, and analysts point to their inability to appeal to the working class as a culprit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It starts with the credibility of the message,” Chuck Rocha, a Mexican American strategist who advised Bernie Sanders’ 2020 primary campaign and helped with both Biden general election campaigns, told me. “People like to say that Bernie Sanders was this, or that — the thing that made Bernie Sanders great was that he had always said the same thing, so he was credible. People see bullshit now in politicians. They want someone that&#8217;s credible whether they like him or hate him.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rebuilding that credibility will be essential if Democrats are to reverse their fortunes not just with Latino voters, but with a wide swathe of the electorate.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democrats never really figured out how to regain Latinos’ trust on the economy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In retrospect, the storyline of the Latino electorate was fairly consistent. Poll after preelection poll told the same story: These voters were most concerned about the economy, and they were as likely as white voters to say they either missed the policies and economic conditions of the Trump era, or trusted Trump more than either Biden or Harris to deliver relief.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the heart of this feeling was a disconnect between what voters meant by “the economy” and what many national Democrats, including Biden and Harris, were talking about on the trail. Latino voters, troubled by inflation earlier in the Biden presidency, largely meant “prices should be lower,” while Biden and Harris mostly talked about job creation, slowing inflation, and gradually rising wages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was true as early as November 2023, when polling from the Democratic research firm Blueprint found that Latino voters cared most about lower prices and least about “creating more jobs” — which was especially problematic because, as Blueprint also found, Latino voters <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/uncategorized/bidenomics-poll-deck-nov/">more than any other racial group</a> thought that more employment was Biden’s priority. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Add to this dynamic the fact that it was Latino and Black Americans who experienced <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23992436/black-latino-americans-economy-biden-democrats-voters-poll-inflation">uniquely traumatizing</a> financial rollercoasters during the post-Covid period —&nbsp;seeing their wealth and financial prospects <a href="https://www.vox.com/22600143/poverty-us-covid-19-pandemic-stimulus-checks">rise</a> during the pandemic because of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/13/23500066/pandemic-savings-inflation-recession">government aid</a> only for <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/8/10/23824742/real-wages-economy-inflation-no-money">rising costs of living</a> to wipe out many of those gains before wages began <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/20/23964535/labor-market-employment-inflation-sentiment-economy-bad-polls">to grow again</a> — and you can see where the Biden administration’s credibility gap emerged.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden economic message was focused on trying to sell a positive economic success story — and there were indeed data and legislation they could point to tell that story. But according to Camille Rivera, a senior advisor for Voto Latino and founder of the Puerto Rican civic organization La Brega y Fuerza, the campaign’s foregrounding of topline indicators —&nbsp;the GDP, the improving consumer price index, the low unemployment rate, and investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, among others — could not sway voters who still saw vivid reminders of peak inflation in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/11/8/23951098/economy-inflation-prices-job-market-sticker-shock">cost of food and household essentials</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were talking about the economy in macro forms, but people were not feeling it. They were just not feeling it. My father would be like, ‘Hey, did you see this? I just bought these potato chips. There&#8217;s like 50 percent air in these potato chips, and the price is higher,’” Rivera said. “We kept saying, ‘But the economy is great. Look at the stock market!’ That to me was many of our flaws.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The “identity force-field” showed cracks</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over time, this disconnect may have taken a toll on the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/22/latino-drift-democrats-poll">overall “party of the work class” brand</a> of the national Democratic Party. And there’s perhaps no better sign of this than in polling specifically focused on one dynamic that tends to bind Latinos to the Democratic Party: the question of which party best “cares for people like you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s that feeling that has tended to root most Latino voters in the Democratic camp, even if these voters don’t necessarily agree with every social position, economic or immigration policy, or cultural value that the party takes on —&nbsp;a kind of “identity force-field,” as Equis, a Democratic research firm focused on Latino voters, calls it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the aftermath of the 2022 midterms, Equis found evidence that those feelings were still fairly strong. In those midterms, there were conflicted or swing voters who turned out, and who, because of that warm association with the Democratic Party, pulled the lever for Democratic candidates. There were also Latino voters who ended up voting for Republicans —&nbsp; but who still harbored warm feelings toward Democrats anyway. Generally, Equis polling found, Democrats were still the party viewed as “better for Hispanics” and which cared “about people like you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as Carlos Odio, an Equis co-founder, warned at the time of that report, there was a good chance swing Latino voters could drift in 2024 if “there is a major shift in the issue environment, imbalanced campaigning, or a weakening of identity bonds.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that seems to be what happened. The signs of weakening identity bonds were there. The Biden campaign fizzled out. And the economy, as well as a rise in the salience of immigration, put national Democrats on the defensive with both Latino voters and the general electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By October 2024, after Biden drove down positive perceptions of the party among Latinos prior to his late-July exit, Harris had managed to recover the party’s footing. Her campaign strategy didn’t change tremendously, but polling showed Latino voters returning to the Democratic candidate, albeit not at the same rates that they had voted for Biden in 2020. By the close of the campaign, Harris was viewed as being “better for Hispanics” and “people like you.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <a href="https://www.weareequis.us/research/latino-update-october-2024">Democratic advantage</a> had shrunk from two years before. The force field was weak. And by then, it was too late for the Harris campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats now face a challenge: to reassess how they talk about the economy, about class, and about material conditions in a way that can connect with the electorate. There’s a tendency among some in the party — strategists, commentators, and elected officials — to either want to throw out the way they’ve run outreach to Latino voters or to deny that they have a problem at all (and blame “disinformation” or <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/trump-latino-voters-unidos-us">offer counterintuitive data</a> to bolster that thinking). Democratic campaign operations in 2024 were not useless, but if the party is to have a shot in 2028, the work to rebuild credibility with working-class Latinos starts now.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s be clear: Not everything Donald Trump has proposed to do in his upcoming administration is a threat American democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384320/trump-cabinet-white-house">Cabinet appointments</a>, like Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state or former Rep. Lee Zeldin for EPA administrator, are basically what you’d expect from Republicans. You might disagree with their policies, but you can’t seriously argue that they represent threats to the rule of law or democratic norms. Others, like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services, are troublingly unqualified and even outright dangerous — but not an immediate five-alarm fire for American democracy specifically.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet at the same time, there is already clear and undeniable cause for alarm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the world, there are certain steps a leader takes if they want to destroy a country’s democracy, like putting loyalists in charge of law enforcement and politicizing the armed forces. Many of Trump’s early decisions fit this pattern to a T.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest red flag is the choice of arch-loyalist Matt Gaetz as attorney general. The Justice Department is arguably the single most powerful domestic policy agency, running everything from the FBI to federal criminal prosecutors to civil rights litigation. Gaetz has few, if any, qualifications to manage all of this — except for his vendetta against the department, as it once investigated him on suspicion of sex crimes. (Gaetz denies the allegations and the DOJ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">dropped its investigation</a> into them in 2023.)<strong> </strong>His pitch for the job, <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/donald-trump-is-dead-serious-about">one Trump insider told the Bulwark</a>, was to “go over there and start cuttin’ fuckin’ heads.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s plans for the military are similarly ominous. Two teams of reports, in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606">the Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-team-drawing-up-list-pentagon-officers-fire-sources-say-2024-11-13/">Reuters</a> respectively, have uncovered plans for a political purge of the brass — potentially including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump’s proposed secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, is a Fox News commentator and MAGA diehard who called for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/pete-hegseths-plan-overhaul-americas-military-fire-ton/story?id=115842674">precisely such a purge</a> in a recent book.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s Trump’s scheme to get his Cabinet picks in office. If the Republican Senate actually does block any of these picks, Trump has <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">demanded the power</a> to install them through recess appointments while the chamber is out of session. If enough senators balk, Trump reportedly has put together <a href="https://x.com/AJentleson/status/1857081316937761089">a complicated backup plan</a> that boils down to the House giving him the power to go around the Senate entirely — effectively eviscerating its constitutional advice-and-consent role on appointments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, we don’t know how much of these really bad ideas will come to pass. Trump is famous for saying things and failing to follow through. But given the enormity of the tail risk — the corrosion of American democracy — it’s critical to take what’s happening right now seriously. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that means being clear-eyed about the Trump agenda: both what’s not so scary about it, and what is.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The “authoritarian checklist” that can guide us through Trump 2.0</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United States is not the only democracy to elect an authoritarian of late. Voters in a series of other countries —&nbsp;including Hungary, Turkey, Israel, India, Poland, Venezuela, Brazil, and the Philippines —&nbsp;have elevated similarly dangerous leaders in recent elections. None of these countries are exactly like the United States, but all have some things in common that can give us guidance as to what to expect.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most important similarities is that none of these country’s leaders openly campaigned on abolishing democracy. The concept remained far too popular among both citizens and elites to act like Hitler and abolish elections outright.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, they made incremental changes that would slowly-but-surely increase their own power while neutering opponents both in and out of the government. No one step marks the end of democracy, but each cumulatively makes it a little bit weaker. If this process reaches its endpoint, elections become functionally meaningless — theoretically free contests that in actuality are nearly impossible for the incumbent party to lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Executing this strategy requires a few key moves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, would-be authoritarians need the loyalists in key government positions. No one can hollow out an entire government on their own; it’s simply too towering a task to micro-manage. So they delegate, empowering individuals with unwavering loyalty and dedication to remaking key government institutions along authoritarian lines. In India, for example, the second-most powerful position in government — home minister — is occupied by a man named Amit Shah, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68653573">close friend and comrade</a> of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s since 1982.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, they need those appointees to eviscerate legal and political guardrails on their power. Independent prosecutors, government accountability offices, courts, legislative prerogatives — all of this needs to be either co-opted or eliminated. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/1/3/24022467/israel-supreme-court-judicial-overhaul-reasonableness-basic-law-overturn">failed 2023 judicial overhaul in Israel</a>, which would have effectively stripped its courts of any ability to check Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s power, is an unusually stark example of such a move.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After these first two steps have succeeded in consolidating power over the state, the authoritarian then wields it to weaken dissenters outside of government&nbsp;— with the ultimate aim of tilting the playing field on which elections take place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t just mean obvious things, like formally restricting free speech rights, but more subtle tools — like wielding tax agencies and spurious legal investigations against critics and potential private sector rivals. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump">is the pioneer here</a>, using something as seemingly benign as government ad spending to bring the Hungarian media under his control.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through all of this, they need to be able to count on the loyalty of the security services as a last resort. In between elections, would-be authoritarians fear nothing more than popular uprisings and military coups. Stacking the intelligence community and armed forces with loyalists is the best way to ensure that coups fail (as happened <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/15/12204172/turkey-coup-erdogan-military">in Turkey in 2016</a>) or to violently repress street protests if necessary (as happened <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/06/venezuela-election-maduro-analysis">after Venezuela’s stolen election earlier this year</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These four points — appoint loyalists, eviscerate guardrails, attack dissent, suborn armed forces — are the key benchmarks one should use for evaluating Trump’s policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does what he’s proposing truly further one of those objectives? If so, by how much? How likely is it to happen? And how does the threat level rank relative to other things that he’s doing?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Grading Trump’s early decisions by the checklist</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trying to assess Trump’s policies on these metrics is not some kind of academic game. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those of us who care about democracy, in the press and elsewhere, need to maintain our credibility with potentially persuadable third parties&nbsp;— like swing voters or moderate Republican senators. Being seen as liberal hacks who call any Republican appointee a threat to democracy is a problem; so too is developing a track record of crying wolf by labeling everything Trump does anti-democratic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this spirit, it’s clear what emerges as the most dangerous move of Trump’s early transition: the Gaetz pick.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is hard to imagine someone <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/04/matt-gaetz-house-republican-congress-profile/677915/?gift=zYCTBrO_7y7KHmiTPdBdgz2i_q9mnP-Ul9A5kUUNFTY&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share">more cravenly loyal to Trump than Gaetz</a>. It is hard to imagine anyone who has a more serious vendetta against non-partisan administration of laws, since Gaetz was once the target of a federal investigation. And it is hard to imagine a more important position than attorney general — one that gives immense power both to eviscerate guardrails and to punish private sector dissenters with <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/185487/trump-maga-legal-war-slow-burn-authoritarianism">spurious criminal investigations</a> (among other tools).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Defense Department plans aren’t too far behind. Purging the Joint Chiefs based on political loyalty — excuse me, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-vows-fire-generals-push-wokeness-cant-woke-military">alleged “wokeness”</a> — removes one of the chief barriers to Trump’s alleged desire to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-insurrection-act-threat">invoke the Insurrection Act</a> and deploy soldiers against protestors at home. Hegseth isn’t quite as egregious a Cabinet choice as Gaetz, but it’s hard to imagine someone who has proposed such purges and regularly praises Trump on TV standing in the way of his boss’s plans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can go on down the list.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan for circumventing the Senate’s advice-and-consent power would be extremely threatening to guardrails if it happened, but it’s unclear how likely it is to happen. Gabbard as director of national intelligence raises some troubling questions about politicizing intelligence, but she’s not as much of a Trump toady as a Gaetz or even a Hegseth. Kennedy is almost certainly a disaster for public health, but not an obvious threat to democracy narrowly speaking. The office of presidential personnel is small potatoes compared to a cabinet post, but Trump’s decision to put <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-personnel-sergio-gor.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">his book publisher in charge of it</a> will facilitate his plans for seeding the entire government with loyalists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, there’s no reason to think appointments like Rubio or Zeldin even register on this scale. These are the kind of appointments you’d expect from any Republican, and while their policies may be terrible, they’re not an attack on our system of government. In terms of protecting our democracy, the question for them isn’t whether they themselves are a sign of authoritarian rot, but whether they would have the courage to resist it while in power (color me skeptical).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranking these matters for more than just credibility purposes. Democracy’s defenders have limited resources and energy, especially when both chambers of Congress and the Supreme Court are controlled by Republicans. They need to prioritize which Trump appointments and policies to fight, a task made far more difficult by the deluge of daily outrages that we all remember from Trump’s first term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That requires being clear-eyed about what really is threatening and what isn’t. And at present, an objective evaluation of Trump’s early proposals should give Americans a hell of a lot to worry about.</p>

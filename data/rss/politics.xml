These figures have not been independently verified by the Guardian.</p><p><em>Responsibility for the deliberate missile attack on the civilians of Sevastopol is borne above all by Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, and by the Kyiv regime, from whose territory this strike was carried out.</em></p><p>A Russian attack on Ukraine’s southern city of <strong>Odesa</strong> on Monday struck civilian infrastructure and caused casualties, the region’s governor said.

He referred to comments by the Pentagon last week that Ukrainian forces can use US supplied weapons to strike Russian forces anywhere across the border into Russia.</p><p>One person was killed and three injured in <strong>Russia’s Belgorod region</strong>, bordering Ukraine, when three Ukrainian drones attacked the city of Grayvoron, regional governor <strong>Vyacheslav Gladkov </strong>said. Air defences overnight shot down 33 Ukrainian drones over Russia’s western Bryansk, Smolensk, Lipetsk and Tula regions, the Russian defence ministry said Sunday.</p><p>A new attack on<strong> Kharkiv </strong>killed at least one person and injured 11 others on Sunday, according to local officials.

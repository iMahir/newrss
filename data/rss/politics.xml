<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s</em> <em>note, November 4, 10:30 am:</em></strong><em> On Monday, November 4 — more than a year after the justices first met to consider the </em>Hamm<em> case — the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/110424zor_8mjp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released an order</a> sending the case back down to the federal appeals court that previously decided it.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Monday&#8217;s order is probably bad news for Joseph Clifton Smith, the death row inmate at the heart of this case. It asks the lower court to clarify whether it gave “conclusive weight” to Smith&#8217;s lowest score on five separate IQ tests, or whether it also gave full consideration to the tests that showed a higher score. This suggests that many of the justices doubt that Smith is intellectually disabled — it is unconstitutional to execute an intellectually disabled person.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>At the same time, the order focuses on the specific facts of Smith&#8217;s case, rather than diving into deeper questions about how to interpret the Eighth Amendment. So that suggests the Court may not be eager to substantially revise the law governing cruel and unusual punishment.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The original story, published October 17, follows. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For more than a year, Joseph Clifton Smith, a man who says he is intellectually disabled, has sat on death row, waiting to find out if the Supreme Court will greenlight his execution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith’s case, known as <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hamm-v-smith-3/"><em>Hamm v. Smith</em></a>, first arrived on the Court’s doorstep in August 2023. Since then, the justices have met more than two dozen times to decide what to do about the case, and each time they’ve put the decision off until a future meeting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one outside of the Court can know for sure why the justices keep delaying, but if you follow the Court’s Eighth Amendment cases closely, it’s easy to see how the <em>Hamm</em> case could open up all kinds of internal rifts among the justices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Eighth Amendment, which has a vague ban on “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-8/">cruel and unusual punishments</a>,” is at the center of the <em>Hamm </em>case because, for decades, the Court has held this amendment forbids executions of<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html">intellectually disabled</a> offenders (and offenders who <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/543/551/">commit a crime while they are juveniles</a>). The idea is that both groups have diminished mental capacity, at least as compared to non-disabled adults, and thus bear less moral responsibility even for homicide crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That idea, however, has long been contested by the Court’s various ideological factions, and the <em>Hamm</em> case potentially reopens up all of the Court’s issues with the amendment at once. Indeed, in the worst-case scenario for criminal defendants, the justices could potentially overrule more than 60 years of precedents protecting against excessive punishments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This Supreme Court’s ongoing battles over the Eighth Amendment, briefly explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In two 2000s decisions, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html"><em>Atkins v. Virginia</em></a> (2002) and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/543/551/"><em>Roper v. Simmons</em></a> (2005), a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican justices handed down decisions that barred youths and people who are intellectually disabled from being executed. Those majority decisions came down over bitter dissents from the Court’s right flank — the same right flank that has since <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion">gained a supermajority on the Supreme Court</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least some of the current Court’s Republicans seem eager to use their newfound supermajority to blow up those two cases (and pretty much everything the Court has said about the Eighth Amendment in the last six or seven decades). So it’s possible that the Court is fighting over what to do with the <em>Hamm</em> case because many of the justices want a wholesale revolution in Eighth Amendment law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beginning in the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court maintained that the Eighth Amendment “must draw its meaning from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/30/22187578/death-penalty-united-states-executions-decline-gregg-georgia-bucklew-precythe">evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society</a>.” Thus, as a particular method of punishment grew less common, the Court was increasingly likely to declare it cruel and unusual in violation of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least some members of the Court’s Republican majority, however, have suggested that this “evolving standards of decency” framework should be abandoned. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf"><em>Bucklew v. Precythe</em></a> (2019), the Court considered whether states could use execution methods that risked causing the dying inmate a great deal of pain. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion, which held that potentially painful methods of execution are allowed, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/30/22187578/death-penalty-united-states-executions-decline-gregg-georgia-bucklew-precythe">seems to exist in a completely different universe</a> than the Court’s Eighth Amendment cases that look to evolving standards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Court’s earlier opinions ask whether a particular form of punishment has fallen out of favor <em>today</em>, Gorsuch asked whether a method of punishment was out of favor <em>at the time of the founding</em>. Though his opinion does list some methods of execution, such as “disemboweling” and “burning alive” that violate the Eighth Amendment, Gorsuch wrote that these methods are unconstitutional because “by the time of the founding, these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become ‘unusual.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes <em>Bucklew</em> confusing, however, is that it didn’t explicitly overrule any of the previous decisions applying the evolving standards framework. So it’s unclear whether all five of the justices who joined that opinion share a desire to blow up more than a half-century of law, or if the justices who joined the <em>Bucklew </em>majority simply failed to rein in an overly ambitious opinion by Gorsuch, the Court’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/22431044/neil-gorsuch-nihilism-supreme-court-voting-rights-lgbt-housing-obamacare-constitution">most intellectually</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23184848/supreme-court-kennedy-bremerton-school-football-coach-prayer-neil-gorsuch">sloppy justice</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, <em>Hamm</em> opens up at least two major potential divides within the Court. Smith says he is intellectually disabled; the state of Alabama wants to execute him anyway. So the case perfectly tees up a challenge to <em>Atkins</em> if a majority of the justices want to go there. Meanwhile, <em>Bucklew</em> looms like a vulture over any cruel and unusual punishment case heard by the Court, as it suggests that the Republican justices may hit the reset button on all of its Eighth Amendment precedents at any time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what is the specific legal issue in <em>Hamm</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court receives thousands of petitions every year asking it to hear a particular appeal, and it typically <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/supreme-court-procedure/#:~:text=In%20most%20circumstances%2C%20the%20Supreme,argument%20in%20only%20about%2080.">only grants several dozen of these petitions</a>. The vast majority of these cases are nominally discussed at one of the justices’ regular conferences, then promptly denied.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the Court often discusses a case in two different conferences before agreeing to hear it — for this reason, I and other Supreme Court reporters often watch the <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/petitions-were-watching/">list of cases the Court “relisted”</a> for a second conference to identify cases the justices are more likely to hear. Occasionally, a case may be relisted for several conferences in a row. But this is rare, and typically is a sign either that the justices are negotiating over which issues they wish to decide in a particular case — or, more often, that a justice is dissenting from the Court’s decision not to hear a case and the “relists” are really just buying that justice time to draft an opinion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Hamm</em>, however, has now been relisted in every single conference since the justices first discussed it on October 27, 2023. That is, to say the least, highly unusual. And it suggests that some particularly bitter internal negotiations are ongoing. If someone were dissenting from the Court’s decision to turn the case away, they likely would have released that dissent last July, because the justices typically try to resolve loose ends before they go on their summer vacation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Hamm </em>involves a question that would inevitably arise once the Court decided <em>Atkins</em> — though it is unconstitutional to execute intellectually disabled offenders, there will always be some offenders who are on the borderline of what mental health professionals consider an intellectual disability. The specific question before the Court is what to do with these borderline cases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a general rule, someone must have an IQ of 70 or below to be considered intellectually disabled. But IQ tests aren’t particularly precise — as the Supreme Court acknowledged in <a href="https://casetext.com/case/moore-v-texas-12"><em>Moore v. Texas</em></a> (2017), the IQ of someone who scores 74 on a particular IQ test falls within “a range of 69 to 79.” So, if courts read IQ tests as if they can identify an offender’s IQ score exactly, an intellectually disabled person could be executed due to something as arbitrary as a measurement error.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accordingly, the Court held in <a href="https://casetext.com/case/hall-v-florida-7#p723"><em>Hall v. Florida</em></a> (2014) that a capital offender with an IQ score slightly above 70 must be given “the opportunity to present evidence of his intellectual disability, including deficits in adaptive functioning over his lifetime.” That is, such an offender must be allowed to present additional evidence beyond their IQ score to show that they are, in fact, intellectually disabled.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Hamm</em> is such a case. Smith took five different IQ tests, four of which showed him with an IQ in the low to mid-70s. Accordingly, two lower courts looked at additional evidence of his disability, determined he is, in fact, intellectually disabled, and ruled that he must receive a sentence other than death.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In asking to execute Smith, in other words, Alabama is asking, among other things, that the Supreme Court overrule <em>Moore</em> and <em>Hall</em>, both cases that were handed down before former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">remade the Court in the Federalist Society’s image</a>. If the Court agrees, that alone would be a very significant legal development, both because it could allow intellectually disabled inmates to be executed due to a testing error, and because it would be a severe blow to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/18/22440256/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-edwards-vannoy-abortion-criminal-justice-constitution-stare-decisis">stare decisis</a> — the idea that judicial precedents shouldn’t be tossed out simply because the members of a court change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, this Court’s Republican majority has shown little regard for stare decisis, at least in cases that divide along partisan lines. Since Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation gave the Republican Party a supermajority on the Supreme Court in late 2020, the Court has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion">behaved as if it was going down a checklist</a>, overruling liberal victories such as the cases establishing a constitutional right to abortion or the line of cases permitting affirmative action in limited circumstances, and replacing them with whatever outcome the GOP prefers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, while this process has been painful for Democrats and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/supreme-court/">toxic for the Court’s approval rating</a>, it hasn’t been comprehensive — occasionally, one or more of the Republican justices signal that they will allow a previous liberal victory to remain in effect. Concurring in the Court’s decision to overrule <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, for example, Justice Brett Kavanaugh identified the Court’s past decisions <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf">protecting a right to contraception, as well as the right to marry a person of your own choosing</a>, as cases he did not intend to overrule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which is a long way of saying that there’s no good way to know if <em>Atkins</em> or <em>Roper</em> is on the Court’s checklist of past liberal decisions to be overruled. These justices’ approaches to specific cases are often idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and unbound by preexisting law — just look at the Republican justices’ recent decision holding that Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">allowed to commit many crimes while he was in office</a>. The question of whether <em>Atkins</em> survives or falls will turn on whether there are five justices who want intellectually disabled people to be executed, and nothing else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the fact <em>Hamm</em> has been relisted so many times suggests, at the very least, that there is a vocal faction within the Supreme Court that wants to use this case to aggressively reshape the law.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can be made of <em>Bucklew</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other uncertainty looming over <em>Hamm</em> is the <em>Bucklew</em> decision, which didn’t so much overrule the Court’s last six decades of Eighth Amendment precedents as pretend that they didn’t exist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Bucklew</em> involved a death row inmate who claimed that the Eighth Amendment would not allow him to be executed using Missouri’s lethal injection protocol — he said he had an unusual medical condition that would cause him to experience extraordinary pain before his death. So the question was whether the Constitution allows a state to execute an inmate in a manner that may amount to torture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gorsuch’s opinion denying relief to this inmate reads like the Court’s “evolving standards of decency” framework never existed. This phrase appears nowhere in Gorsuch’s opinion, and the only citation to <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/356/86/"><em>Trop v. Dulles</em></a> (1958), the first Supreme Court case to use that phrase, appears in Justice Stephen Breyer’s dissent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than follow longstanding law, Gorsuch asked whether capital offenders could be subjected to similar pain “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf">at the time of the framing</a>.” This is the Eighth Amendment rule long favored by the Court’s rightmost flank, including in Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissenting opinion in <em>Atkins</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scalia’s <em>Atkins</em> dissent, moreover, doesn’t simply disagree with the Court’s past decisions. It lays out many examples of how the law would change — and how much easier it would be to subject even minor criminal offenders to outlandish punishments — under a framework that looks to how things worked in the 1790s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, Scalia argues that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZD1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only “severely or profoundly” intellectually disabled people</a> enjoy some protection against execution (he argues these individuals were often “committed to civil confinement or made wards of the State” rather than being criminally punished). One of the sources Scalia cites suggests that only people with an IQ of 25 or below enjoy any constitutional protection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More significantly, Scalia also argues that the Eighth Amendment only forbids “always-and-everywhere ‘cruel’ punishments, such as the rack and the thumbscrew,” and that it does not prohibit the government from imposing excessive punishments for minor crimes. Under Scalia’s framework, if the death penalty can constitutionally be applied to murderers (and he believes it can) then it can also be applied to shoplifters. If a rapist can be sentenced to life in prison, so too can a jaywalker.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gorsuch’s <em>Bucklew</em> opinion elaborates on the sort of punishments that, under this <a href="https://www.vox.com/21497317/originalism-amy-coney-barrett-constitution-supreme-court">originalist</a> framework, are prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. He lists “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf">dragging the prisoner to the place of execution, disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and burning alive</a>” as examples.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So there is a faction within the Supreme Court that would drastically shrink Americans’ constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. This faction would allow more people to be executed. They would apparently eliminate any concern that punishments must be proportionate to the crime. And the kinds of punishments they do offer up as examples of impermissible sanctions are the kinds of things normally depicted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFFvI0IQpt8">torture scenes from movies set in the Middle Ages</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Will five justices go there? It’s impossible to know. But that a total of five justices joined Gorsuch’s opinion in <em>Bucklew</em> suggests this faction could very well prevail — if and when the Court decides to take up <em>Hamm</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court announced on Monday that<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/110424zor_8mjp.pdf"> it will hear a bizarre dispute</a> between two different federal courts about how to fix Louisiana’s racially gerrymandered congressional maps. Under existing law, one of these courts was clearly correct and the other clearly erred. But this Supreme Court is often hostile to voting rights plaintiffs, so there is some risk that the justices could change the law, permitting more racial gerrymanders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court will consider this dispute in a pair of consolidated cases, known as <em>Louisiana v. Callais</em> and <em>Robinson v. Callais</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In June 2022, Chief Judge Shelly Dick, an Obama appointee to a federal court in Louisiana, determined that state’s congressional maps were <a href="https://casetext.com/case/robinson-v-ardoin-5">an illegal racial gerrymander</a>. Under the invalid maps, Black voters made up a majority in only one of the state’s six congressional districts, despite the fact that Black people comprise about a third of Louisiana’s population.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dick ruled that “the appropriate remedy in this context is a remedial congressional redistricting plan that includes an additional majority-Black congressional district” — meaning that Louisiana must draw a new map that includes at least two Black-majority districts. Dick’s case is known as <a href="https://casetext.com/case/robinson-v-ardoin-5"><em>Robinson v. Ardoin</em></a>, and Dick is a judge of the US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A ton of litigation followed Dick’s decision, including a brief trip to the Supreme Court, but Louisiana’s attempts to appeal Dick’s ruling ultimately failed. After the Fifth Circuit, the federal appeals court that oversees Louisiana, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/13/23959252/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-louisiana-gerrymander-robinson-ardoin">rejected an attempt to toss out Dick’s ruling</a>, the state decided to give up the fight and comply with her order. The state legislature passed a new map that includes two Black-majority districts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But then an entirely different federal trial court, the Western District of Louisiana, decided to insert itself into this dispute. A new set of plaintiffs filed a suit in the Western District claiming that the new maps are unconstitutional. This case, which was known as <a href="https://casetext.com/case/callais-v-landry"><em>Callais v. Landry</em></a> while it was before the trial court, was assigned to a three-judge panel. Two of those judges — the ones appointed by former President Donald Trump — agreed with these new plaintiffs that the state’s new maps are unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Louisiana, in other words, is now subject to two competing court orders. The first, from Judge Dick, forbids it from using the old maps. The second, from the two Trump judges in the Western District, forbids the state from using the new maps it enacted to comply with Dick’s order.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court ruled last May that the state <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23a994_7mip.pdf">could use its new maps during the 2024 election</a>, so that temporarily delayed resolution of this fight. But the long-term situation is obviously untenable. Louisiana needs to be able to draw congressional maps of some kind. And it needs to know what the rules are governing how it must draw those maps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not possible so long as two entirely separate courts, each of which apparently have wildly divergent views about how to resolve racial gerrymandering disputes, are allowed to issue competing court orders.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what does the law actually say about racial gerrymandering in Louisiana?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under existing law — including the Roberts Supreme Court’s recent decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf"><em>Allen v. Milligan</em></a> (2023) — Dick is clearly correct, and the two Trump judges are clearly wrong, about what should happen with Louisiana’s maps. Among other things, <em>Milligan</em> involved a nearly identical racial gerrymandering dispute from Alabama, and the Supreme Court ordered Alabama to draw a second Black congressional district in that case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this Supreme Court, with its 6-3 Republican supermajority, is frequently hostile to voting rights claims — and it is <a href="https://www.vox.com/22575435/voting-rights-supreme-court-john-roberts-shelby-county-constitution-brnovich-elena-kagan">especially hostile to claims brought under the Voting Rights Act</a>, the law that Dick relied on in her decision. So, while the right outcome in <em>Callais</em> is clear under existing law, there’s always a risk that this Court will abandon that law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Milligan</em>, Alabama effectively asked the Supreme Court to abandon the legal framework governing racial gerrymandering cases brought under the Voting Rights Act, which the Court first announced in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/478/30/"><em>Thornburg v. Gingles</em></a> (1986), and replace it with a new test that would <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/2/23377432/supreme-court-alabama-merrill-milligan-racial-gerrymandering-voting-rights-act">render the act’s safeguards against racial gerrymandering toothless</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a 5-4 decision, the Court rejected Alabama’s request, holding instead that a lower court decision striking down Alabama’s racially gerrymandered maps “faithfully applied our precedents.” The <em>Gingles</em> framework, which the Court reaffirmed in <em>Milligan</em>, is complex. But it primarily required the <em>Milligan</em> plaintiffs to show that it was possible to draw two geographically “compact” Black-majority districts in Alabama, and that Black and white voters in the state tend to vote in separate blocs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Ardoin</em> case — the one heard by Judge Dick — is similar in all relevant respects to <em>Milligan</em>. Louisiana’s lawyers previously told the Supreme Court that <em>Ardoin</em> “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23A281/283864/20230930114301429_SCOTUS%20Emergency%20Stay%20Application%20-%20Robinson%20v.%20Ardoin-corrected.pdf">presents the same question</a>” as the one decided in <em>Milligan</em>. In its ruling against Louisiana, the Fifth Circuit concluded that “most of the arguments the State made here <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/13/23959252/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-louisiana-gerrymander-robinson-ardoin">were addressed and rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Milligan</em></a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So that really should have been the end of this dispute. Advocates who wanted the Court to abandon <em>Gingles</em> and legalize the kind of racial gerrymanders that were initially drawn by the Alabama and Louisiana state legislatures brought their case to the justices, and a majority of the justices rejected those arguments in 2023. That likely explains why, after Louisiana lost its appeal to the Fifth Circuit, it decided to give up this fight and voluntarily draw new maps.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how on Earth did the Western District wind up getting involved?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand how a second federal court wound up invalidating the very maps that Louisiana enacted to comply with Judge Dick’s order, it’s important to understand a bit of tension that has long existed in federal voting rights law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th  Amendment</a> generally prohibits race discrimination of all kinds. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has held that this amendment forbids states from <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1262_db8e.pdf">using “race as the predominant factor in drawing district lines unless it has a compelling reason.”</a> At the same time, the Voting Rights Act sometimes requires states to draw a minimal number of legislative districts where a racial minority group is in the majority. This principle has been reaffirmed in many cases, including <em>Gingles</em> and <em>Milligan</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tension arises between these two principles because, if a state knows that it must draw at least two congressional districts with a Black majority, it can’t really accomplish that task without taking account of race. To resolve this tension, the Court held in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1262_db8e.pdf"><em>Cooper v. Harris</em></a> (2017) that a state may engage in “race-based districting” when it has “a strong basis in evidence” for concluding that it must do so to comply with the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under <em>Cooper</em>, a VRA-compliant map is lawful if the state “had ‘good reasons’ to think that it would transgress the Act if it did not draw race-based district lines.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, under <em>Cooper</em>, the Western District had no business striking down Louisiana’s new map. Louisiana clearly had “good reasons” to think that it must draw a new map with two Black-majority districts because a federal court ordered it to draw a new map with two Black-majority districts, and the state’s attempts to appeal that decision were unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To avoid this conclusion, the two Trump judges responsible for the <em>Callais</em> decision largely rely on a line in <em>Milligan</em> which states that the Voting Rights Act “never require[s] adoption of districts that violate traditional redistricting principles.” They argue that the new maps, which were also drawn to protect several Republican incumbents, violate the traditional principle that legislative districts should be compact.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd6PjuzUmbnY1iEHEpylrgn4eDalLY8ml3UyhI_oWbwfSyGtyotuE-3Ufu7VZ3w3jh8rMyR7utv5TPXJ6iPCg8SdA8pb-7wcO728gYHComcutwyMCdex_AEyHqF4j-jr-dAV9qT0N02BO8yRUfkeWVrt6ld?key=y4MweDqvOApL1yFN24Pi0ls2" alt="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s a pretty strained reading of <em>Milligan</em>. While the Supreme Court did hold that the VRA doesn’t <em>require</em> states to draw ugly districts, it also said in the very same paragraph that redistricting “is primarily the duty and responsibility of the States, not the federal courts.” So <em>Millligan </em>does not <em>forbid</em> states from drawing ugly, misshapen districts so long as those districts otherwise comply with the Voting Rights Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that <em>Callais</em> falls within the Supreme Court’s mandatory jurisdiction, meaning that the justices are required to hear this case, or at least to issue an order resolving it. So the mere fact that the justices will hear what should be a very easy voting rights case does not mean that they intend to upend decades worth of law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, while the legal principles that should govern in <em>Callais</em> are crystal clear, it is always worrisome whenever this unpredictable Court takes up a Voting Rights Act case of any kind. In <em>Milligan</em>, the Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24153784/supreme-court-louisiana-gerrymander-black-voters-robinson-ardoin-callais-landry">surprised most Supreme Court-watchers</a> when it voted to leave longstanding safeguards against racial gerrymandering in place. We’ll find out soon if all five justices in the <em>Milligan</em> majority actually meant what they said in that case.</p>

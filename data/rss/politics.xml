China’s status as a global mediator, particularly in the Middle East.</strong></p><p>The “Beijing declaration”, signed by 14 Palestinian factions, also represents a significant step forward in negotiations between the groups, although it is light on detail about how to actually achieve Palestinian unification.</p><p>We blocked all entrances to the Foreign Office, completely shutting down access to the building until the police started violently dragging people across the pavement on Whitehall.</p><p>We disrupted the department in solidarity with the Palestinian people and with civil

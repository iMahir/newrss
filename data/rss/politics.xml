<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris elevated abortion rights to the heart of her campaign, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">Donald Trump is the winner of the 2024 presidential election</a>. So what does this mean for reproductive rights on the federal level?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The short answer is that there are many ways Trump could ban abortion, and the most likely way isn’t through Congress, even with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/republicans-senate-control.html">Republican-controlled Senate</a>.&nbsp;(It is not yet clear whether Republicans will take control of the House.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The long answer is that as a candidate, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373046/trump-republicans-ivf-abortion-reproductive-rights-election">waffled on his positions on abortion</a>. Despite frequently <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-was-able-kill-roe-v-wade-rcna84897">bragging</a> about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>Trump started to soften his tune in the months leading up to the election, especially as his vice presidential pick JD Vance began generating negative media attention <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jd-vance-advocated-abortion-illegal-nationally_n_66984d11e4b076f190eb37a1">for his anti-abortion views</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Election Day drew nearer, Trump <a href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1827007862830452738">began insisting</a> he’d be “great for women and their reproductive rights” but he also repeatedly dodged questions about whether he’d veto any national abortion bans that land on his desk. At the presidential debate in September, Trump refused to answer that question multiple times, insisting it wouldn’t be necessary since abortion rights are now a matter of state discretion. By October, though, he finally came out to say he would veto a federal abortion ban, posting on social media that he would “<a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1841295548109955091">not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, that’s not as reassuring as it sounds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal abortion bans in 2025 are not likely to take the form of bills landing on the president’s desk. Any bill out of Congress would still require some bipartisan agreement unless lawmakers <a href="https://www.vox.com/21424582/filibuster-joe-biden-2020-senate-democrats-abolish-trump">overturned the filibuster</a>.<strong> </strong>Republican senators have already <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/senate-republicans-say-they-will-preserve-filibuster/">promised to preserve the filibuster</a> in a Trump administration, and the anti-abortion movement, for its part, has not been counting on the GOP to push bills with a simple majority. Given the widespread support for abortion rights across the US, passing a federal ban would also be politically dangerous for congressional lawmakers from swing or moderate districts, making the near-term prospect of such efforts highly unlikely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Quite frankly, unless something really unusual happens in this election, neither side is going to have the votes in Congress to pass a national law,” Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-debate-2024-election-abortion-64c739e99ffa1ad51b973e420e1fe92d">told the Associated Press</a> in early October. “So that wasn’t really at the top of our list anyway.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They do have a list, though.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sending abortion pills by mail is more at risk</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One agenda item at the top of the anti-abortion movement’s list is enforcement of <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained">the Comstock Act</a>, an 1873 federal law that could prohibit anything associated with abortion from being sent in the mail. Such a ban could mean not only restricting abortion medication — the most common method used to end a pregnancy in the US — but also any medical equipment used during abortion procedures, like speculums, suction catheters, and dilators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don’t need a federal abortion ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Jonathan Mitchell, the legal architect <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/31/22650303/supreme-court-abortion-texas-sb8-jackson-roe-wade-greg-abbott">behind a 2021 law in Texas</a> that effectively banned abortion in that state, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html">told the New York Times</a> earlier this year. Mitchell urged anti-abortion groups to &#8220;keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election&#8221; regarding this strategy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Comstock Act was rendered moot by <em>Roe </em>in the 1970s but never formally repealed, and now, with <em>Roe </em>gone, many conservatives see it as an ideal vehicle for restricting abortion nationwide, precisely because it wouldn’t require the passage of a new federal law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For months Trump dodged journalists&#8217; questions regarding the Comstock Act, but by August, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/26/nx-s1-5090224/trump-abortion-pills-comstock">finally said</a> he would not use the old statute to ban abortion drugs in the mail. However, many people in his close orbit, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">including the vice president-elect</a>, are on record urging the opposite, and it was a core item of Project 2025, the notorious policy blueprint drafted by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">the Heritage Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/politics/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation.html">many people close to Trump’s campaign</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump could also ban abortion by appointing anti-abortion leaders to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tz2BUuzTmE">control key federal agencies</a> that could use executive power to restrict reproductive rights, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, says her top priority is to push Trump to appoint anti-abortion leaders to executive agencies so they can integrate anti-abortion policies into existing federal programs. “I think reversing the Biden-Harris abortion agenda will be vibrant, it’ll be active,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/opinion/kristan-hawkins-abortion-republicans-trump.html">told the New York Times</a> over the summer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hawkins says her group’s second priority will be to push HHS to defund Planned Parenthood. While federal funds are already barred from financing abortion, Planned Parenthood receives federal money from the Office of Population Affairs for family planning and preventive health services, including contraception, cancer screenings, and STI testing. (In 2019, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/14/20805628/planned-parenthood-title-x-trump-birth-control">issued a rule to limit this money</a>, which was <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/10/title-x-contraception-family-planning/">subsequently reversed</a> under the Biden administration.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Appointing anti-abortion leaders to agencies like the FDA and DOJ could affect anti-abortion litigation. In October, three Republican attorneys general (Raúl Labrador in Idaho, Kris Kobach in Kansas, and Andrew Bailey in Missouri) filed a lawsuit to force the FDA <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/gop-abortion-pill-republican-states-fda-mifepristone">to heavily restrict access to mifepristone</a>, one of two drugs used to induce abortions. (Though medication abortion has a lower risk of complication than many other widely available drugs, it has faced stricter regulation in the US largely for political reasons. Since 2016, the FDA has gradually reduced these restrictions, including allowing for telemedicine prescriptions.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355175/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-alliiance-hippocratic-medicine-fda">threw out a similar FDA complaint</a> over the summer, concluding the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, the Republican attorneys general believe they’ll be better able to prevail in this new attempt. Notably, they also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/health/abortion-pill-mifepristone-lawsuit.html">argue in their complaint</a> that the FDA has violated the Comstock Act by permitting abortion bills to be sent by mail. While a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/application-comstock-act-mailing-prescription-drugs-can-be-used-abortions">2022 Biden DOJ opinion ruled that</a> the Comstock Act doesn&#8217;t criminalize mailing abortion drugs if the sender lacks intent for unlawful use, a Trump DOJ could interpret the law differently. A Trump FDA also may not fight changing rules on abortion pills at all.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The judiciary awaits</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last major way Trump could promote a federal abortion ban is through federal court appointments. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first presidential term, for example, Trump appointed one of the most anti-abortion judges in the country — <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/17/23512766/supreme-court-matthew-kacsmaryk-judge-trump-abortion-immigration-birth-control">Matthew Kacsmaryk</a> — to a federal court in Texas. Kacsmaryk greenlighted the now-overturned legal opinion that the FDA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/us/abortion-pill-ruling.html">should revoke its approval of mifepristone</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s<strong> </strong>campaign has maintained close ties to Leonard Leo, the co-chair of the right-wing Federalist Society, which helped Trump vet all his anti-abortion judicial appointments in his first four years in office. (Leo also <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/supreme-court-leonard-leo-reforms-corruption-1235070458/">helps finance groups</a> to bring cases to the Supreme Court and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/03/supreme-court-amicus-briefs-leonard-leo-00127497">orchestrates strategy</a> for the conservative legal movement broadly.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The anti-abortion movement has been explicit that its long-term goal is “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24090347/alabama-ivf-ruling-fetal-personhood-abortion-embryos">fetal personhood</a>” — endowing fetuses, embryos, and fertilized eggs with full human rights and legal protections. This once-fringe idea has been gaining traction over the last few years. (Kacsmaryk also embraced the idea of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/08/texas-judge-kacsmaryk-abortion-pills-ruling-anti-abortion-rhetoric">unborn humans</a>” and fetal personhood.) At least 19 states have declared that fetuses at some stage of pregnancy are people, according to <a href="https://www.pregnancyjusticeus.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fetal-personhood-with-appendix-UPDATED-1.pdf">a report from Pregnancy Justice</a>, a group that advocates for pregnant people’s rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In February, the Alabama Supreme Court issued a decision <a href="https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility">that claimed frozen embryos</a> count as “children” under state law. In April, the Florida Supreme Court <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/4578252-florida-supreme-court-signals-readiness-to-rule-for-pre-born-personhood/">signaled openness</a> to hearing a future challenge on fetal personhood when its chief justice asked whether Florida’s constitution should include “the unborn” in its equal protection statute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in the 2022 majority opinion for <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf"><em>Dobbs v.</em> <em>Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em></a><em>, </em>the<em> </em>case that overturned <em>Roe</em>, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito seemed to lay the groundwork for a fetal personhood challenge by repeatedly emphasizing the significance of “fetal life.” Over the spring, Alito <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/justice-alito-voices-support-for-fetal-rights-in-federal-law">also seemed to endorse the idea</a> that a fetus needed the same “stabilizing treatment” in a hospital as a pregnant patient.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Codifying a fetal personhood standard could lead not only to the outright ban of abortion but also most forms of <a href="https://www.vox.com/24087411/anti-abortion-roe-dobbs-birth-control-contraception-ivf">birth control</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility">in vitro fertilization</a> (IVF). While Trump and Republican lawmakers insist they are determined to protect reproductive rights, including IVF and contraception, their anti-abortion judicial picks could do just the opposite.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 5:45 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>. For more of our 2024 campaign coverage, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers">click here</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The presidential race remains too close to call, likely coming down once again to the Rust Belt trio of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the results so far suggest former President Donald Trump improved his performance in much of the country relative to 2020, and that if Vice President Kamala Harris still manages to win, it would be by an extremely narrow margin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two swing states called by a major news outlet as of early Wednesday are North Carolina and Georgia, both of which were won by Trump. Harris likely can’t count on Arizona, the swing state where she’d polled the worst, though it will take some time to count the votes there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Georgia and Arizona indeed fall to Trump — and keep in mind they haven’t been called yet, but he looks formidable there — Harris’s path to victory depends on winning <em>all three</em> of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If she loses just one in this scenario, it’s over for her. (The other remaining swing state, Nevada, will be very slow in counting, but it would be too small to make much of a difference in the Electoral College.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All three of those Rust Belt states are still close. Trump leads the current count in all three, though many uncounted votes remain from Democratic-leaning areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But notably, outside the swing states, Trump is on track to do significantly better than he did in 2020, so a Harris win scenario depends on the Rust Belt defying an apparent nationwide shift in Trump’s favor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, Biden won Virginia by 10. As of late Tuesday, with more than 80 percent of votes in the state counted, Harris led Trump by a mere 1.7 percentage points. That margin is sure to expand when more Democratic areas count, but per the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-virginia-president.html">New York Times’s forecast of the uncounted vote,</a> she’ll likely end up with somewhere around a 5-point win, significantly worse than Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar dynamics are at play in many other states, and Trump utterly romped in Florida, winning it by about 13 percentage points. (In 2020, Trump won Florida by a little over 3 percentage points.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, it seems quite possible that Trump could win the national popular vote. It will take some time to determine that, as it would depend on the final margin in slow-counting states like California.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what really matters is how the Rust Belt states end up, and we&#8217;re still waiting to learn that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, November 6, at 1:07 am ET: </em></strong><em>This piece, originally published on the evening of November 5, was updated to include Georgia being called for Trump.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Fearless journalism needs your support now more than ever. </em></strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>B</em></strong></a><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>ecome a Vox Member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 presidential election is over — and Donald Trump is the victor. There is no doubt about the election’s legitimacy: Trump is on track to win the Electoral College by a wide margin, and potentially win the popular vote for the first time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet while the election itself was clearly on the level, what comes next may not be. Having won power democratically, Trump is now in a position to enact his long-proposed plans to hollow out American democracy from within.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and his team have developed detailed plans for turning the federal government into an extension of his will: an instrument for carrying out his oft-promised “retribution” against President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and anyone else who has opposed him. Trump’s inner circle, purged of nearly anyone who might challenge him, is ready to enact his will. And the Supreme Court, in its wisdom, has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">granted him sweeping immunity</a> from his actions in office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In nearly every conceivable way, a second Trump administration will likely be more dangerous than the first, a term that ended in over 1 million deaths from Covid-19 and a riot at the Capitol. A predictable crisis — a president consolidating power in his own hands and using it to punish his enemies —&nbsp;looms on the horizon, with many unpredictable crises likely waiting in the wings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet as dire as things are, America has reserves it can draw on to withstand the coming assault. Over the course of the country’s long democratic history, it has built up robust systems for checking abuses of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s federal structure gives blue states control over key powers like election administration. Its independent judiciary stood strong during Trump’s first term. Its professional, apolitical military will likely push back against unlawful orders. Its politically active citizenry has a proven capacity to take to the streets. And America’s world-leading media will fiercely resist any effort to compromise its independence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No country at America’s level of political-economic development has ever collapsed into authoritarianism. There are some reasonably close modern analogues, most worryingly modern Hungary, but even they are different in crucial respects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not to make an argument for complacency or naive optimism. Quite the opposite: The next four years will be American democracy’s gravest threat since the Civil War; if it survives them, it will surely do so battered, bruised, and battle-scarred.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this realism should not be cause for succumbing to despair. As grim as things feel now, it’s possible that — if people take the gravity of the threat seriously — the republic may come out intact on the other side.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Trump’s scary second-term agenda, explained</h1>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We do not know why, exactly, America’s voters have chosen to return Trump to high office. The data isn’t fully in, let alone analyzed in detail. But as murky as the electoral picture remains, certain elements of the policy future are crystal clear. Trump’s own comments, his campaign’s statements, and allied documents like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a> give us a relatively coherent picture of what the agenda will be in the next Trump administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of it resembles what you’d see from any other Republican president. Trump will appoint corporate allies to lead federal agencies, where they will work to slash regulations on issues ranging from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/03/trump-labor-union-election/">workplace safety standards</a> to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-02/climate-skeptics-are-hatching-big-plans-for-a-second-trump-term">pollution</a>. He has already proposed <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2024-09-20-trumps-tax-cut-a-rama-total-so-far-9-75-trillion/">regressive tax cuts</a> without off-setting hikes, which would increase the federal deficit in the same way as George W. Bush’s fiscal policy did. He will <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/366495/trump-medication-abortion-mifepristone">likely take steps to curtail abortion access</a>, end <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">federal police efforts to rein in abusive police</a>, and crack down on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/20/trump-lgbtq-second-term-agenda/">federal protections for trans people</a> —&nbsp;all examples of how his agenda would hurt certain groups of people, typically already vulnerable ones, more than others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s biggest breaks with his party in traditional policy areas will likely come on trade, immigration, and foreign policy. Trump has proposed a “universal” tariff on imported goods, a mass deportation campaign that detains suspected “illegals” in camps, and <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-can-t-withdraw-from-nato--but-he-could--quiet-quit">weakening America’s commitment to the NATO alliance</a>. These policies would together be a recipe for economic decline, domestic turmoil, and global chaos — <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/380060/trump-world-risks-war">at an already chaotic time</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But perhaps the most dangerous Trump policies will come in an area that traditionally transcends partisan conflict: the nature of the American system of government itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the campaign, Trump has proven himself obsessed with two ideas: exerting personal control over the federal government, and exacting “retribution” against Democrats who challenged him and the prosecutors who indicted him. His team has, obligingly, provided detailed plans for doing both of these things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This process begins with something called Schedule F, an executive order Trump issued at the end of his first term but never got to implement. Schedule F reclassifies a large chunk of the professional civil service —&nbsp;likely <a href="https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/what-mandate-for-leadership-says">upward of 50,000 people</a> — as political appointees. Trump could fire these nonpartisan officials and replace them with cronies: people who would follow his orders, no matter how dubious. Trump has vowed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">revive Schedule F “immediately”</a> upon returning to office, and there is no reason to doubt him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between a newly compliant bureaucracy and leadership ranks purged of first-term dissenting voices like former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Trump will face little resistance as he attempts to implement policies that threaten core democratic freedoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And Trump and his team have already proposed many of them. Notable examples include <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-suggests-re-elected-biden-indicted-rcna132810">investigating leading Democrats on questionable charges</a>, prosecuting <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">local election administrators</a>, using regulatory authority for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election">retribution against corporations that cross him</a>, and either shuttering public broadcasters or <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/09/what-would-project-2025-do-for-or-to-journalism/">turning them into propaganda broadsheets</a>. Trump and his allies have claimed unilateral executive authority to take all of these actions. (It remains unclear which party will control the House, but Republicans will be in charge of the Senate for at least the next two years.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, all this executive activity is aimed at turning the United States into a larger version of Hungary — a country whose leadership and policies are regularly praised by Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance, and Project 2025 leader Kevin Roberts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hungary still has elections and nominal free speech rights; there are no tanks in the streets or concentration camps for regime critics. But it is a place where everything —&nbsp;from the national elections authority down to government art agencies — has been twisted to punish dissent and spread the government’s propaganda. Every aspect of government has been bent to ensure that national elections are contests in which the opposition never has a fighting chance. It is a kind of stealth autocratization, one that maintains the veneer of democracy while hollowing it from within.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is why the second Trump presidency is an extinction-level threat to American democracy. The governing agenda Trump and his allies explicitly laid out is a systematic attempt to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/07/why-special-republican-relationship-hungary-so-worrying/679035/">turn Washington into Budapest-on-the-Potomac</a>, to deliberately and quietly destroy democracy from within.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democracy is not lost</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is important to remember that, as dire as things are, the United States is not Hungary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Prime Minister Viktor Orbán came to power in 2010, he had a two-thirds majority in the country’s parliament — one that allowed him to pass a new constitution that twisted election rules in his party’s favor and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/world/europe/19iht-hungary19.html"> imposed political controls on the judiciary</a>. Trump has no such majority, and the US Constitution is nearly impossible to amend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s federal structure also creates quite a few checks on the national government’s power. Election administration in America is done at the state level, which makes it very hard for Trump to seize control over it from Washington. A lot of prosecution is done by district attorneys who don’t answer to Trump and might resist federal bullying.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American media is much bigger and more robust than its Hungarian peers. Orbán brought the press to heel by, among other things, politicizing government ad purchasing —&nbsp;a stream of revenue that the American press, for all our problems, does not depend on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But most fundamentally, the American population has something Hungarians didn’t: advanced warning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the form of subtle authoritarianism pioneered in Hungary was novel in 2010, it’s well understood today. Orbán managed to come across as a “normal” democratic leader until it was too late to undo what he had done; Trump is taking office with roughly half the voting public primed to see him as a threat to democracy and resist as such. He can expect major opposition to his most authoritarian plans not only from the elected opposition, but from the federal bureaucracy, lower levels of government, civil society, and the people themselves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the case against despair.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As grim as things seem now, little in politics is a given —&nbsp;especially not the outcome of a struggle as titanic as the one about to unfold in the United States. While Trump has four years to attack democracy, using a playbook he and his team have been developing since the moment he left office, defenders of democracy have also had time to prepare and develop countermeasures. Now is the time to begin deploying them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has won the presidency, which gives him a tremendous amount of power to make his antidemocratic dreams into power. But it is not unlimited power, and there are robust means of resistance. The fate of the American republic will depend on how willing Americans are to take up the fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump </em><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has won the 2024 presidential election</a></em><em>.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have won a majority in the Senate, flipping the body after four years of Democratic control. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">predicted outcome</a> given how vulnerable Democrats were this cycle: While they were defending nine battleground seats, Republicans were only defending three. The GOP successfully flipped key states including West Virginia and Ohio, while holding off unexpectedly competitive challenges in places like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380855/nebraska-dan-osborn-deb-fischer-senate">Nebraska</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380707/texas-senate-race-allred-cruz-2024-election">Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans’ victories come as former President Donald Trump leads in electoral votes, with multiple swing states still outstanding. As of 2 am ET, the presidential race has not been called for either candidate, though <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/05/2024-election-results-live-coverage-updates-analysis/blue-wall-trump-battlegrounds-00187653">early results seem to suggest an advantage for Trump</a>, with Vice President Kamala Harris’s plausible paths to victory narrowing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their campaigns, Republican Senate candidates leaned heavily on critiques of Democrats’ economic policies as many voters continued to grapple with inflation and high costs of living. They also kept up fear-mongering on immigration as well, arguing that only they could offer solutions to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">border crossing surges</a>, like the one in 2023. Overall, because they weren’t in control in the Senate, Republican candidates were able to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment — and current discontent — as they campaigned to take back certain seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans’ gains could have major implications for a potential Trump or Harris administration. If Trump wins, the Republican Senate would effectively offer him a blank check on appointments, and allow him to resume stacking the courts with his judges. Depending on the outcome of House races, a GOP Senate could also enable a possible Trump administration to pursue policy priorities like rolling back the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/aca-trump-repeal-affordable-care-act/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) and renewing <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">corporate tax cuts</a>. If Harris wins, the Senate could well stymie key judicial appointees, and block her legislative goals.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Republican Senate control could mean</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The role the Senate will play in the next few years will depend heavily on who wins the presidential race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last Trump presidency was ultimately illustrative of what happens when both the White House and Senate are held by Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that scenario, Trump was able to advance his judges at a rapid pace, reshaping the Circuit Court and Supreme Court with conservative picks. In total, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-judicial-nominations-judge-appointments/">Trump was able to get 234 judges confirmed</a>, including the three who now sit on the Supreme Court who proved integral to overturning <em>Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Trump faced little backlash or accountability for his rhetoric or policy decisions throughout his term, including attempts to implement <a href="https://time.com/5322856/trump-travel-ban-republicans/">a Muslim travel ban</a> or to shut down the government as leverage for funding for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-republicans-all-but-surrender-to-trump-on-wall-despite-shutdowns-toll/2019/01/20/dc3efb96-1b56-11e9-a804-c35766b9f234_story.html">wall along the US-Mexico border</a>. Although some Republican senators spoke out, few truly vocalized their opposition to Trump or scrutinized his actions. When Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22227519/house-second-impeachment-trump-incitement-insurrection">impeached for his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/13/22280838/senate-acquits-donald-trump-impeachment-vote">only seven Republicans voted to convict</a> him — the rest voted to acquit him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Republicans maintain control of the House, a GOP Congress could also help Trump advance his legislative agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has focused more on executive actions he’d like to take (such as on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">tariffs</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">immigration</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">international relations</a>) than on a congressional agenda. However, Republicans have long expressed an interest in curbing access to the ACA. One issue lawmakers will weigh in the next year is the expiration of ACA premium subsidies, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-republican-senate-health-care-policy/">Stat reports</a>. House Speaker Mike Johnson has emphasized already that he’s interested in major “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">reform</a>” to the health care bill as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017</a> are also up for renewal, and will be another issue that lawmakers in the next Congress will need to tackle. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-trump-tax-cuts-election-2024-what-to-know/">Trump has suggested cutting</a> the corporate tax rate and has floated some income tax cuts too. Regardless of whether they take the House, Senate Republicans will likely advocate for those cuts. And Republicans could push, too, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/republicans-climate-change-fossil-fuels.html">expanded oil and gas drilling leases</a> that Democrats had previously curbed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Senate Republicans have already signaled that they plan to be as obstructionist as possible if they’re dealing with a Harris administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, both Sens. John Thune (R-SD) and John Cornyn (R-TX), two likely successors to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/29/politics/cornyn-thune-supreme-court-plans/index.html">have told CNN</a> that they aren’t sure if they would hold a vote for any potential Harris Supreme Court nominees. With the majority, the GOP can try to block <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377729/kamala-harris-supreme-court-electoral-college-senate-constitution">any Harris judicial appointment from advancing</a>, much like they once did with former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and some of his lower court picks. In the case of Garland, the GOP successfully refused to ever hold a confirmation hearing or vote for him — and were able to prevent him from getting seated on the bench.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They could do the same for other Cabinet roles as well, and they could also block legislation from advancing. Harris campaigned heavily on working to enact policies that require congressional approval, including sweeping <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/dnc-harris-speech-election-2024/card/harris-pledges-to-sign-bipartisan-border-bill-csVc4bVyNHlyx9yqnyyE">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5172251/how-much-power-does-a-president-have-when-it-comes-to-abortion-access">abortion reform</a>. Those policy goals are unlikely to become a reality in a GOP-controlled Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of whether Trump or Harris is in the White House, expect the upper chamber to play a significant role in advancing or hampering their efforts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6:07 am ET:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Donald Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>. For more of our 2024 campaign coverage,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers">click here</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though votes are still being counted and several battleground states remain to be called, we can see a handful of trends developing in the 2024 election. Former President Donald Trump is once again showing that he can turn already ruby-red parts of the country even more Republican. And in the suburbs, where Democrats have made gains throughout the Trump era, those gains seem inconsistent at best this time around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, though it’s still too early to say for sure, it appears that Trump has made large-scale inroads with voters of color, particularly in Latino communities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exit polls, the main way commentators and journalists try to make sense of the electoral trends happening nationally, are notoriously unreliable, and it will be weeks, or months, before they paint a full picture. But here are some trends that appear clear so far.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump has been able to maximize his support in rural areas</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone expected Trump to dominate in rural areas. What wasn’t clear, however, was whether he could improve on the already large margins by which he won in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it seems that he has. Early in the night, Trump built big cushions of support in Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and North Carolina. That trend continued throughout the night. In rural counties across Pennsylvania, for example, the general trend as votes were counted was that Trump was able to both increase turnout and increase his margin of support in the GOP heartland.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One obvious example of this rural surge: Lackawanna County, home to President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton, swung 5.6 points to the right from 2020 — even though Kamala Harris still looked on track to win the county by the smallest of margins.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The suburban shift toward Democrats stalled</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To offset those expected GOP margins of support in rural places, Democrats have had to rely not just on winning urban centers, but getting a boost in surrounding suburbs. Those suburbs have been trending toward Democrats since 2016 — but it’s not clear today that this leftward lurch has continued.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first clear sign of trouble in the suburbs came northern Virginia’s Loudoun County, a Washington, DC, suburb with a large concentration of college-educated voters. Biden won it by about 25 points in 2020; this year, Harris appears to have won it by just about 17 points.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Indiana’s Hamilton County, seen as perhaps an early indicator of other trends because of its Indianapolis suburbs, Harris was trailing Trump by about 6 points — running nearly even with Biden’s performance in 2020 (Trump +7).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, other suburbs around the country did continue that Democratic drift. In the suburban counties surrounding Atlanta, for example, Harris was on track to do a bit better than Biden in 2020, increasing the Democratic margin in Cobb and Gwinnett counties by about a point each.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democratic support among voters of color, especially Latinos, is continuing to erode</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pre-election polling indicated that Trump was on track to post historic gains in support from nonwhite voters. Though we don’t have great national data yet (early exit polls can be unreliable), we did see some dramatic shifts from places with large Latino populations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most obvious example is Florida. The state moved in a decidedly Republican direction, and its Latino electorate did as well. Miami-Dade County, which used to be a reliably Democratic county with a huge Cuban American population, swung for Trump by double digits. Osceola, a county with a large Puerto Rican community, also flipped for Trump, after Biden won it by 14 points. And more specifically, cities with large Puerto Rican and Cuban populations, like Kissimmee and Hialeah, saw a dramatic drop-off in Democratic support, according to Democratic firm <a href="https://x.com/carlosodio/status/1854008462826488012">Equis Research’s analysis</a>. One caveat: Florida’s Latino population is unlike those in other parts of the country&nbsp;— it’s much more diverse in terms of national origin and had been already shifting toward Republicans after 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, similar swings happened in South Texas, where Trump expanded his margins in the county he won in 2020, Zapata; flipped two more counties (Starr and Cameron); and ran nearly even with Harris in Hidalgo and Webb counties. Beyond those two states, which drifted further red, national exit polls, as unreliable as they may be, seem to be painting a broader picture of eroding Democratic support with Latinos: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls">Early results</a> suggest Democrats just barely won the majority of these voters, after exit polls in 2020 signaled Biden won about two-thirds.</p>

  <p id="dwTXTj">Donald Trump has been declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election.

In an interview on the Today programme this morning she said Trump’s victory (or apparent victory – he still has not officially hit 270 electoral college votes) was “disappointing”, and that it made the world “unpredictable”.</p><p>When it was put to her that she described him as a “racist, sexual predator” when he visited the UK during his first term as president, she replied:</p><p>Well, he is. But he is the president of the United States, and we need to work with him.</p><p>I know that many Londoners will be anxious about the outcome of the US presidential election. Many will be fearful about what it will mean for democracy and for women’s rights, or how the result impacts the situation in the Middle East or the fate of Ukraine. Others will be worried about the future of NATO or tackling the climate crisis …</p><p>The lesson of today is that progress is not inevitable. But asserting our progressive values is more important than ever - re-committing to building a world where racism and hatred is rejected, the fundamental rights of women and girls are upheld, and where we continue to tackle the crisis of climate change head on.</p> <a

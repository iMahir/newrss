<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats are increasingly panicked about Joe Biden’s 2024 chances after Thursday’s debate. But what will that panic result in?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The party is in uncharted territory. Doubts about Biden’s ability to defeat Trump have grown and speculation about whether he could be convinced to drop out of the race is mounting. Calls for Biden to quit are suddenly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">widespread</a> in the media, even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html">among</a> <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/honor-demands-joe-biden-step-aside">commentators</a> who had previously defended the president. Top Democrats are reportedly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/biden-trump-presidential-debate-analysis/index.html">having similar discussions</a> behind the scenes, but the extent and seriousness of those discussions is not yet clear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First off: Don’t expect anything to happen immediately. No one can outright force the president of the United States to quit the race, and he would not do so on a whim. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, Biden’s aides <a href="https://x.com/kaylatausche/status/1806675665845903645">are telling reporters</a> he has no plans to drop out. If top Democrats, Biden’s own most trusted advisers, and his family members urge him to reconsider, that could change. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that process would take some time — likely weeks, particularly given the complicated question of what would happen next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, despite a great deal of uncertainty about what’s next, there appear to be three plausible options for where we’re headed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1) Biden sticks it out</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Often, when pundits are hyping a supposedly game-changing political moment, it’s useful to take a step back and skeptically ask: Will anything actually change?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden won every state in the Democratic primaries this year, and the <a href="https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P24/D-HS.phtml">overwhelming majority</a> of delegates are obligated to vote to nominate him at the convention by party rules. Those delegates are typically party loyalists trusted by the Biden team and state Democratic parties. They will not somehow revolt against him and depose him at the convention against his will.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean it’s certain that Biden will remain on the ticket. But basically, the only way he’s leaving the race is if he decides to do so himself — likely after being urged to do so by people he trusts and party bigwigs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new chorus of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/25/opinion/thepoint/krugman-biden-must-withdraw?smid=url-share">calls</a> from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/opinion">New York Times opinion writers</a> for Biden to drop out is an ominous development for him. Former Democratic aides who are now media commentators, like <a href="https://www.politico.com/video/2024/06/28/theres-still-time-van-jones-says-biden-should-be-replaced-1346384">Van Jones</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4745670-mccaskill-biden-debate-performance/">Claire McCaskill</a>, are saying similar things. But we have not yet seen similar public defections from currently serving elected Democrats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How intense will the pressure get? In part, that depends on the personal choices of Biden’s family members, his trusted advisers, and top Democrats, who will all have to decide whether they want to try and nudge him out or stand by him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their decisions will likely be shaped in part by post-debate polling. In the optimistic scenario for Biden, there’s little change and he can simply ignore his critics, grit his teeth, and weather the storm. But the worse the polling looks, the more panic will rise and the more isolated he’ll be.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2) Biden quits the race and endorses a successor </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Biden does decide to drop out, one way that could play out is that he’d endorse an intended successor at the same time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The obvious choice would be Vice President Kamala Harris. But the obvious problem with that obvious choice is that many Democrats think Harris has her own serious political weaknesses. That includes Biden himself, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2022/12/20/the-juicy-new-biden-book-00074849">reportedly called Harris</a> a “work in progress” early in his term. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/politics/kamala-harris-biden-reelection-effort/index.html">report earlier this year</a> claimed Harris was still struggling to penetrate what she called the “bubble” of Biden campaign thinking.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Biden had clearly made Harris a trusted partner, helped prepare her for succession over the past several years, and viewed her as ready for prime time, a Biden-for-Harris swap would be an easier case to make. But none of that is really true.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Could Biden endorse someone else? In theory, he <em>could</em> pluck a Democratic governor somewhat at random — Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California are often mentioned. He could then call on the party to unite behind that person, cross his fingers, and hope it happens. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in addition to infuriating Harris and her supporters (passing her over for a handpicked white nominee would be quite controversial), that decision would lack any democratic legitimacy. And if any faction in the party or wannabe candidate are sore enough, they could make their own play for delegates at the convention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In contrast, every Democrat who voted in the primaries knew they’d be getting VP Harris — and potentially President Harris, should Biden not make it through a second term. So if Biden does try to avert the possibility of convention chaos by anointing a successor, she’s by far the most rational choice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3) Biden quits the race and there’s an open convention</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other option, if Biden chooses to drop out, is that he <em>doesn’t</em> try to pick a successor and simply says the party should figure it out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the obvious venue for such a discussion would be at the Democratic convention in late August.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent decades, the major parties’ national conventions have been coronations, in which the winner of the most delegates in the primaries gets the nomination. But in the days of yore, the conventions were where the nominee was actually decided — typically, in backroom deals among party power brokers who controlled the delegates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the convention was “open” again due to Biden’s withdrawal — freeing up the delegates to vote their conscience — the process would likely play out very differently in the modern media and social media environment. It would be far more public. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html">Ezra Klein’s interview with Elaine Kamarck</a> has more specifics on how this could play out.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ideally, an open convention would be a fair venue for all the contenders in the party to make their respective cases, resulting in a fair vote (or multiple rounds of balloting), and eventually a nominee with majority support at the convention that the party can unite behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, this is more small-d democratic than Biden trying to pick a successor in advance. It lets thousands of delegates decide, rather than just the power players at the top who stood beside Biden for so long.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one problem is that Democratic Party delegates don’t have very much democratic legitimacy themselves. They were not picked to pick a president — they were picked to rubber-stamp Biden’s nomination. And they don’t truly represent the public. The only real rationale for letting them pick the nominee is that it’s too late and logistically difficult to redo the nationwide primary process. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other risk is that an open convention devolves into a chaotic mess that divides and embitters the party rather than uniting it, and makes Democrats look awful to the public on national television.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The convention is less than two months away, so preparation for an actual open process would really need to begin soon if it’s going to happen. So all eyes will be on Joe Biden as he determines which path he will take.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no way to sugarcoat President Joe Biden’s debate performance on Thursday night: It was a disaster. He muttered, babbled, and failed to pounce on Donald Trump’s lies and threats to democracy. By Friday morning, the country’s liberal commentators were telling Biden to step down — and, behind closed doors, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/06/28/democrats-wake-up-to-a-nightmare-00165710?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000015d-a357-df20-adff-b3ff37130000&amp;nlid=630318">many Democrats were saying the same thing</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid this gloom, I found a ray of hope from an unusual source: Astead Herndon, the New York Times reporter who has been <a href="https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1755692285537271992">banging on about the political risks of Biden’s age for months</a> (and taking <a href="https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1800975561688482180">a lot of Democratic fire</a> for doing so). After being proven spectacularly right on Thursday night, Herndon didn’t take a victory lap — he looked to the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think the election is over. I think it’s just starting,” <a href="https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1806533355766169673">he wrote on Twitter/X</a>. “We’re finally out of the [delusion] phase. Country and parties both.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Herndon’s comment stood out not just because it cut against the chorus of gnashing teeth, but because it pointed to <em>why</em> everything might not be doomed. If we truly were in a mass delusion about Biden’s ability to campaign, and now that’s ending, it opens up new possibilities for the 2024 election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And not just that. If the Democratic Party does prove capable of convincing Biden to step aside for a more inspiring candidate, it might even help address a deep concern about the future of the country itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden as a symptom of national decline</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For months —&nbsp;maybe even years — American politics <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/americans-dismal-views-of-the-nations-politics/">has been mired in malaise</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are lots of reasons: Lingering <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-inflation-economy-vibecession-cbs-explains/">anger about inflation</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/pandemic-politics-malaise.html">legacy of the pandemic</a>. Deep and <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/trust/archive/winter-2024/navigating-the-challenges-of-the-us-political-landscape">seemingly intractable polarization</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think a large part of it was the uninspiring prospect of a Trump and Biden rematch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Poll after poll showed that Americans were dissatisfied with the prospect of a 2020 rematch. Most of the country didn’t want this choice and still doesn’t. It’s conventional wisdom that “double haters” — voters who dislike both Biden and Trump — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/23/double-haters-biden-trump-deciders/">are the most decisive swing voters in the 2024 election</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We all know the reasons this dire matchup was going to happen. While Trump is unpopular with the public and the GOP elite, he has an unshakable grip on the Republican base. And though Biden is even less popular, no serious Democrat was going to risk torpedoing the party’s general election chances against Trump by launching a bitter primary challenge they’d almost certainly lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the fact that things are this way is exactly the problem. When political parties offer people choices they hate, for whatever reason, people become (even more) disillusioned with their functioning. The “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691248554/the-hollow-parties">hollow parties</a>,” as two political scientists recently described them, feel like just another symptom of America’s broader political brokenness.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden’s departure as a (possible) symbol of national renewal</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most plausible scenario is that Biden simply weathers the current PR storm and stays atop the ticket. If that happens without him doing <em>something</em> to prove the debate catastrophe was a one-off, it’ll simply reaffirm that the institutions designed to safeguard American democracy are as broken as everything else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have institutions to handle this. Biden could just step down. But we could also have an open convention. The party could nominate someone else. But the institutions are as moribund as the candidate: they have not seen use in many years,” <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/king-leer?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=112019&amp;post_id=146076182&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=7ttw&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">writer John Ganz</a> observed on Friday morning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But at the same time, something feels <em>different</em> about the current wave of pressure on Biden to quit the race.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In February, after special counsel Robert Hur released a report suggesting that Biden had a poor memory, most liberals and Democrats <a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/2024/2/23/24081128/joe-biden-age-mental-fitness-brokered-dnc-kamala-harris">insisted the president was being smeared</a>. After the debate, the liberal opinion-making world is in lockstep: Joe Must Go. And the quotes anonymous Democrats are giving to connected reporters are unprecedented.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think the president has one week to prove he is not dead,”’ a swing-state Congress member told <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1806690977077239890">Slow Boring’s Matt Yglesias</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can imagine a scenario where this level of panic, combined with <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jill-biden-must-step-up-now-to-help-oust-joe-biden">someone</a> from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/06/biden-trump-debate-2024/678826/">Biden’s inner circle</a> telling him the truth, might reach the president and convince him that his time is up. All of a sudden, the idea of Biden’s departure has left the realm of fantasy and entered the blurry world of uncertain probability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In such a scenario, the Democratic party could <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">avoid the chaos of a nasty primary or contested convention</a>; Biden could, in consultation with other party leaders, pick a successor and endorse them. The party would have months to rally behind <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/28/who-replace-biden-2024-election-democrats">whoever it was</a>: Vice President Kamala Harris, a Cabinet member like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, or a popular and successful governor like Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. For a party whose Washington leadership is dominated by boomers, its young bench is surprisingly deep.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This would do more than improve the Democratic party’s chances against Trump: It would show Americans that their institutions actually can do surprising, and maybe even impressive, things. It would provide concrete evidence that we aren’t stuck in a downward spiral of political sclerosis, that the unexpected can happen, and that sometimes it might actually be good.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I certainly don’t want to suggest that replacing Biden will fix everything, either for Democrats narrowly or for the country more broadly. In our polarized system, the election will remain close no matter what; the country’s problems run far deeper than the two old men running for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s important not to let realism lapse into nihilism. Just because few things have changed American politics of late doesn’t mean nothing can. And we shouldn’t underestimate the importance of the person in the top job: The mere fact of Barack Obama’s identity <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X">altered American politics at such a profound level</a> that we still haven’t fully grappled with the consequences.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s rare to see a clear pathway toward rebooting American politics. But Biden’s disastrous debate performance has created an opening for one. It’s up to him to take it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mark Robinson, the embattled Republican nominee for governor in North Carolina, wrote many troubling things during his days as a poster on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum">the porn forum Nude Africa</a>. But one Robinson comment sticks out as especially confusing: “I’m a black NAZI!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The notion of a Black man expressing fealty to a movement premised on his inferiority feels absurd, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HcQ87RFN5k"><em>Chappelle’s Show</em> sketch</a> come to life. Yet the absurdity points to something real. As strange as it seems, there’s a disturbing number of Black and Latino Americans who hold extreme right beliefs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two of the most prominent antisemitic voices in the country today, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23519717/antisemitism-hatred-jews-violence">Kanye West</a> and <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/candace-owens">Candace Owens</a>, are Black Trump supporters. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23484314/trump-fuentes-ye-dinner-white-nationalism-supremacy">Nick Fuentes</a>, the white supremacist who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, is of Mexican descent. Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/proud-boys-leader-sentenced-22-years-prison-seditious-conspiracy-and-other-charges">sentenced to 22 years in prison</a> for his role in the January 6 riot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/opinion/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-latinos-racism.html">is Afro-Cuban</a>. Mauricio Garcia, a Hispanic mass shooter who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/07/1174631515/a-mass-shooting-at-an-outlet-mall-in-dallas-left-at-least-9-dead-7-injured">killed eight people</a> at a Dallas-area shopping center in 2023, had <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/6/2/why-white-supremacists-are-not-always-white">posted neo-Nazi rhetoric on his social media pages</a> before his attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Academic research suggests these are not merely a handful of cherry-picked examples. There are non-trivial numbers of right-wing Black and Latino people who express extreme right-wing ideas — up to and including outright bigotry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, two academics —&nbsp;Eitan Hirsh and Laura Royden — <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10659129221111081">published the results</a> of a massive national survey on the prevalence of antisemitic beliefs in the United States. Their study found that antisemitic attitudes were significantly more common on the right than on the left. But it also found notable racial divides between right-wingers, with <a href="https://www.eitanhersh.com/uploads/7/9/7/5/7975685/minority_antisem_v3.1.pdf">Black and Latino conservatives being about 20 percentage points more likely</a> to express antisemitic ideas than their white conservative peers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recent studies have also found that, among Latinos, political conservatism predicts <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8B9730B52C23226D306A6096E0BCB4A8/S0003055422000545a.pdf/div-class-title-prejudiced-when-climbing-up-or-when-falling-down-why-some-people-of-color-express-anti-black-racism-div.pdf">higher levels of racial resentment toward Black</a> people and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/abs/hispanics-para-trump/BF09A48E9470FDFEDBF0C7EA0DBA2696">greater skepticism about the role of racism</a> in the ongoing social marginalization of Black people. Another <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/84/4/860/6205964">recent study</a> found that Latino conservatives express higher rates of hostility toward undocumented immigrants than their liberal or moderate peers, as well as higher support for lowering legal immigration rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A separate study of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739986315604424">white and Black Americans found</a> that, in both groups, “prejudicial attitudes toward Latinos … are the most consistently significant factors in shaping opinions about the number of immigrants to admit and the consequences of immigration.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to say that most nonwhite conservatives are bigoted, or that racial minorities are more likely to hold bigoted attitudes in general than white Americans. All of the available research confirms common sense: that white people are by far more likely to be white supremacists. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this evidence also suggests that certain things that seem like common sense —&nbsp;that Black people like Mark Robinson can’t be Nazis by definition — simply don’t match reality. Bizarre as it seems, given traditional extreme-right attitudes toward racial minorities, there are high-profile Black and Latino Americans who hold bigoted and extreme beliefs — and a small but notable percentage of the general population in both groups who agree with them. (Though Robinson denies writing the Nazi post, an overwhelming amount of evidence points to him as the author.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding nonwhite extremism</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do we make sense of this phenomenon?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One theory is that a lot of this is rooted in ideas about Americanness. Hostility toward other minority groups is, for some Black and Latino people, a way of solidifying their own place in the country — of distinguishing themselves as good Americans from the bad Other.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Journalist Paola Ramos suggests such an explanation in her just-released book <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741645/defectors-by-paola-ramos/">Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America</a></em>. After spending a day with Pedro Antonio Aguero, a far-right activist who obsessively patrols the Southern border looking for undocumented migrants, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/latino-border-vigilante-pedro-antonio-aguero/679969/">Ramos writes</a>, “I got the feeling that by hunting them, he was distancing himself from them, and from his own foreignness.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some academic research points to similar conclusions. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8B9730B52C23226D306A6096E0BCB4A8/S0003055422000545a.pdf/div-class-title-prejudiced-when-climbing-up-or-when-falling-down-why-some-people-of-color-express-anti-black-racism-div.pdf">One experiment</a> presented Latino respondents with written materials downplaying Latino status in America. Some respondents saw a news story suggesting Latino people were doing poorly in the United States on metrics like educational attainment; others saw the same story with an additional line comparing Latino and Black outcomes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Individuals who saw the comparison story expressed notably higher negative attitudes toward Black people afterward —&nbsp;with the spike interestingly concentrated among <em>liberal</em> Latinos (who were less biased than conservatives before exposure but equally biased afterward). This, the academics theorized, is because conservative Latinos already cared a great deal about their Americanness, and so had already factored that sense of status threat into their overall worldview.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her book <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/american-while-black-9780190053550"><em>American While Black</em></a><em>,</em> the University of Maryland’s Niambi Carter argues Black skepticism about immigration is rooted in fear that “whites may favor immigrants over black people in hiring decisions, housing, and other social interactions.” It is, she writes, a “conflicted nativism” born out of Black insecurity in their own standing and social status as Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is just one theory, and one that doesn’t explain all the facts. Some things, like the unusually high rates of antisemitism among Black and Latino conservatives, are a bit harder to fit into the script.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their paper on race and antisemitism, Hersh and Royden conclude that “the roots of antisemitic attitudes among minority groups are broad rather than narrow and are not well-explained by commonly proposed theories.” Basically, they say, no one really knows why it seems that antisemitism is disturbingly popular in those groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, this is a subject that calls for caution. The phenomenon of extreme-right politics is fairly new, or at least is only newly documented. As something we’re just beginning to grapple with, we can’t really say for sure <em>why</em> it’s happening. Social science and journalism are hard work, and we don’t have enough of either on this topic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The one thing we can say for sure is that Mark Robinson calling himself a “black NAZI” is outlandish — but not as outlandish as it might seem. There are more people like him, and they will play a role in defining the American right’s future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since it unexpectedly became a viral phenomenon earlier this year, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a> has loomed extraordinarily large over the presidential campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the debate stage, Kamala Harris <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">called it</a> “a detailed and dangerous plan” that Donald Trump “intends on implementing if he were elected again.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, meanwhile, insists we should pay no attention to that <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">922-page policy plan</a> behind the curtain, claiming that he has “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">nothing to do</a>” with it and has “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html">no idea</a> who is behind” it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, Project 2025, an initiative put together last year by the right-wing Heritage Foundation to plan for the next GOP administration, was shaped by longtime <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/07/trump-heritage-project-2025-roberts/">close allies</a> of Trump. Detailed planning for a second Trump term agenda along these lines is very real, and though the Project 2025 initiative itself has seemingly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/08/02/project-2025-trump-inside-story-00172299">fizzled out</a>, other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/us/politics/trump-conservative-partnership-institute.html">groups</a> have <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/07/22/inside-the-trump-plan-for-2025">picked</a> up the slack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, many of Project 2025’s key proposals — to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce#:~:text=along%20these%20lines.-,1)%20Concentrating%20power%20in%20the%20presidency,-%3A%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20allies%20believe">centralize presidential power</a>, crack down on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce#:~:text=surprise%20medical%20billing-,Immigration,-%3A%20Deny%20loan">unauthorized immigrants</a>, deprioritize <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce#:~:text=Energy%20and%20environment%3A">fighting climate change</a>, and eliminate the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/politics/department-of-education-shut-down-trump/index.html">Department of Education</a> — are fully and openly supported by Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Trump’s intentions are less clear on a vitally important issue where Project 2025 made some particularly extreme proposals: abortion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project’s plan called for using presidential power to aggressively restrict abortions in several ways. Trump, wary of these proposals’ unpopularity, has said during the campaign that he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/trump-comstock-enforcement-00175068">won’t support</a> some of them. He also evidently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/29/g-s1-20187/trump-abortion-amendment-4-florida-ivf-funding-reproductive-rights">feels hesitant</a> to outright disavow the social conservatives who have long been a key part of his base.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris, meanwhile, wants to associate Trump with the most extreme version of the conservative anti-abortion agenda. “Understand in his Project 2025 there would be a national abortion ban,” she <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">said at the debate</a>. That isn’t strictly true, in that the project does not call for any explicit&nbsp; ban, but it does include a proposal that some experts say could lead to a “<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-sweeping-consequences-of-the-far-rights-plan-to-effectuate-a-backdoor-national-abortion-ban-in-project-2025/">backdoor abortion ban</a>,” depending on how it is implemented. Furthermore, it is certainly true that anti-abortion activists got key appointments in Trump’s administration last time and expect to score such appointments again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, Trump is caught between his fear of electoral defeat if he backs social conservatives’ unpopular ideas and his desire to reward their loyalty to him and keep them by his side. That explains Trump’s delicate dance in which he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html">says</a> Project 2025 has some “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” ideas but never quite specifies what those bad ideas are, since doing so might make his supporters angry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If he wins, the question will be whether Trump feels freed up to reward his longtime allies with control over federal abortion policy, much as he did last time around when he appointed the Supreme Court justices who overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Project 2025 has a sweeping set of proposals designed to restrict abortion in the United States</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2164096734_904ea6.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.72998978273,100,78.540020434539" alt="People stand talking in and around a Project 2025 banner and table bearing books in a convention center." title="People stand talking in and around a Project 2025 banner and table bearing books in a convention center." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The Heritage Foundation&#039;s Project 2025 booth at the National Conservative Conference in Washington, DC, on July 8, 2024. | Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While Trump may not have been personally involved in Project 2025, much of it was clearly written in the hope of appealing to him. The group’s key policy document conspicuously avoids taking sides on key issues where Trump has broken with conservative dogma, like trade and the future of Social Security and Medicare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the one issue where they really got out in front of Trump, it seems, is abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Project 2025’s policy plan was put together in the months after the Supreme Court achieved social conservatives’ long-held priority of overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. The anti-abortion movement, though, does not want to stop with returning abortion policy to the states. It argues that abortion should be understood as the murder of unborn children, and it wants to use federal power to cut down further on abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Conservatives in the states and in Washington, including in the next conservative Administration, should push as hard as possible to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction in America,” Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/362917/jd-vance-project-2025-book-kevin-roberts-trump">wrote in the foreword</a> to Project 2025’s policy plan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan recommends many anti-abortion policies, but three in particular stand out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>1) Enforcing the Comstock Act</strong>: Project 2025 calls for prosecuting “providers and distributors of abortion pills that use the mail,” via an old anti-obscenity law called the Comstock Act — a law that, my colleague Ian Millhiser <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained">writes</a>, “has not been seriously enforced for nearly a century.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reproductive rights activists <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/reproductive-freedom/anti-abortion-extremists-want-to-use-the-150-year-old-comstock-act-to-ban-abortion-nationwide">have warned</a>, with alarm, that the Comstock Act could be used to enforce “a backdoor abortion ban” nationally. That’s because the very broad law says it’s illegal to send not only any pill, but any “thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion” through the mail or across state lines in interstate commerce. If it is seriously enforced, they argue, it would be effectively illegal to send abortion clinics basic supplies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If the Comstock Act were being enforced, it would preempt state laws that protect abortion rights, and states that have ballot initiatives, and states that have other protective legislation,” UC Davis law professor Mary Ziegler <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/trump-could-use-the-1873-comstock-act-to-ban-abortion-nationwide-heres-how-mary-ziegler/">told Mother Jones</a> in April.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some anti-abortion activists have a similar interpretation. “We don’t need a federal ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Jonathan Mitchell, an influential conservative lawyer (who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/08/trump-lawyer-arguments-supreme-court-00140604">represented Trump</a> in one legal proceeding), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html">told the New York Times</a> in February. But, he added, “the extent to which that’s done will depend on whether the president wants to take the political heat and whether the attorney general or the secretary of Health and Human Services are on board.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>2) Banning the abortion pill mifepristone: </strong>Asserting that “abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-Roe world,” Project 2025 calls for revoking FDA approval of the pill mifepristone, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/21/24105984/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-pills-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine">is used</a> in about half of US abortions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because mifepristone has been under legal challenge, many abortion providers have prepared for such a ban and said they can switch to a different regimen requiring only the drug misoprostol. But they fear that drug would become the next target of anti-abortion activists, as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/25/1240282129/mifepristone-supreme-court-fda-medication-abortion-explainer">NPR’s Selena Simmons-Duffin wrote</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>3) Demanding data from states on who is getting abortions:</strong> Complaining that liberal states are “sanctuaries for abortion tourism” (because red state residents can travel there for the procedure), Project 2025 says that HHS needs to ensure every state reports to the feds “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders,” including data such as “the mother’s state of residence.” The document recommends cutting federal funds to states if they refuse to provide this data.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump just can’t seem to quit anti-abortion activists</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1258598639.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A woman holds a pro-life sign as she listen to Trump speak in Greensboro, North Carolina, on June 10, 2023. | Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s those above proposals from Project 2025 that have proved so politically inconvenient for Trump during this campaign. He has sounded the refrain that he merely wants to let states decide on abortion policy, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/trump-comstock-enforcement-00175068">saying</a> “the federal government should have nothing to do with this issue.” But he also constantly promises that new details on his intentions for federal policy are forthcoming — details that somehow never arrive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked last month about enforcing the Comstock Act, Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmfGRdlBq38&amp;t=342s">seemed to say</a> he wouldn’t, but he did&nbsp;hedge a bit: “No, we will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no.” On banning mifepristone, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/08/trump-abortion-pill-mifepristone-news-conference/">Trump campaign’s line</a> is that the Supreme Court has settled the matter — which makes no sense because the court merely <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355175/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-alliiance-hippocratic-medicine-fda">ruled on a procedural issue</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Trump is claiming women will have nothing to fear from his abortion policies if he wins. But there are many reasons to wonder whether to believe him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that some of Trump’s most important political allies are people deeply committed to restricting abortion in the United States. Take, for instance, his vice presidential nominee, JD Vance. In 2022, Vance called for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">enforcing the Comstock Act</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html">said</a>: “I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump&#8217;s key appointees who’d be tasked with setting federal policy in his second term would also likely include many committed social conservatives. Notably, the chapters of Project 2025 that touch on abortion were written by two important Trump administration officials: Roger Severino, who served in the Department of Health and Human Services, and Gene Hamilton, who served in the Justice Department (and is a longtime close ally of Trump policy guru Stephen Miller).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump “had the most pro-life administration in history and adopted the most pro-life policies of any administration in history,” Severino <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html">told the New York Times in February</a>. “That track record is the best evidence, I think, you could have of what a second term might look like if Trump wins.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/06/books/books-of-the-times-the-art-of-political-relationships.html">classic political saying</a>, “Dance with the one that brung ya,” explaining why politicians feel compelled to stick with their loyal supporters. While Trump may be currently trying to strike a more moderate tone on abortion, he is a transactional person and he knows that social conservatives are among his most important and loyal supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was demonstrated at the end of August: After several days in which Trump had taken heat from anti-abortion groups, he announced that, on a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/29/g-s1-20187/trump-abortion-amendment-4-florida-ivf-funding-reproductive-rights">Florida abortion ballot measure</a>, he’d stand with them.</p>

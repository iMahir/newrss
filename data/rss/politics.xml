 According to the Associated Press (AP), the order comes in response to rocket fire that Israel says originates from the area. It’s the second evacuation issued in a week in an area designated for <strong>Palestinians</strong> fleeing other parts of Gaza. Many Palestinians have been uprooted multiple times in search of safety during Israel’s air and ground campaign.<br><br>
 On Monday, after the evacuation order, multiple Israeli airstrikes hit around Khan Younis, killing at least 70 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry, citing figures from <strong>Nasser hospital</strong>.<br><br>
 The area is part of a 60-square-kilometer (roughly 20-square-mile) “humanitarian zone” to which Israel has been telling Palestinians to flee to throughout the war.</p><p>The AP reports that much of the area is blanketed with tent camps that lack sanitation and medical facilities, and have limited access to aid, <strong>United Nations (UN)</strong> and humanitarian groups say. About 1.8 million Palestinians are sheltering there, according to Israel’s estimates. That’s more than half Gaza’s prewar population of 2.3 million.</p><p><strong>An Israeli official has criticised US vice-president Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the presidency, after she said it was time for the war in Gaza to end given the suffering being caused by the fighting. </strong>Harris’s remarks at a press conference, after a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, reflect the growing pressure on the Israeli prime minister to reach a deal with Hamas to end the fighting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jul/27/middle-east-israel-gaza-war-hamas-khan-younis-latest">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jul/27/middle-east-israel-gaza-war-hamas-khan-younis-latest</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jul/27/middle-east-israel-gaza-war-hamas-khan-younis-latest</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 07:36:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kamala Uses Trump’s Favorite Photo Against Him in First Campaign Ad]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/kamala-uses-trump-favorite-photo-135604091.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/kamala-uses-trump-favorite-photo-135604091.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 13:56:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA['Biden should bring the Americans home’: Freed Hamas hostage on ceasefire deal]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-bring-americans-home-freed-173630121.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-bring-americans-home-freed-173630121.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 17:36:30 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I met Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), Donald Trump’s new choice for vice president, in the summer of 2022. I was <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23271726/cpac-goes-to-israel">covering a conservative conference in Israel</a>, and Vance was the surprise VIP attraction. We chatted for a bit about the connections between right-wing movements across the world, and what American conservatives could learn from foreign peers. He was friendly, thoughtful, and smart —&nbsp;much smarter than the average politician I’ve interviewed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet his worldview is fundamentally incompatible with the basic principles of American democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance has said that, had he been vice president in 2020, he would have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/05/vance-trump-upend-democracy/">carried out Trump’s scheme for the vice president to overturn the election results</a>. He has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html">fundraised for January 6 rioters</a>. He once called on the Justice Department to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/07/trump-dictatorship-retribution-jd-vance-robert-kagan/">open a criminal investigation</a> into a Washington Post columnist who penned a critical piece about Trump.&nbsp;After last week’s assassination attempt on Trump, he attempted to whitewash his radicalism by blaming the shooting <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360557/trump-assassination-attempt-republican-response-political-violence-irresponsible">on Democrats’ rhetoric about democracy</a> without an iota of evidence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This worldview translates into a very aggressive agenda for a second Trump presidency. In <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-host-abruptly-ends-interview-jd-vance-supreme-court-remarks-no-no-george">a podcast interview</a>, Vance said that Trump should “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in the US government and “replace them with our people.” If the courts attempt to stop this, Vance says, Trump should simply ignore the law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You stand before the country, like Andrew Jackson did, and say the chief justice has made his ruling, now let him enforce it,” he declares.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The President Jackson quote is likely apocryphal, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/23055620/supreme-court-legitimacy-crisis-abortion-roe">the history is real</a>. Vance is referring to an 1832 case, <em>Worcester v. Georgia</em>, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the US government needed to respect Native legal rights to land ownership. Jackson ignored the ruling, and continued a policy of allowing whites to take what belonged to Natives. The end result was the ethnic cleansing of about 60,000 Natives — an event we now call the Trail of Tears.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For most Americans, this history is a deep source of shame: an authoritarian president trampling on the rule of law to commit atrocities. For Vance, it is a well of inspiration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">J.D. Vance is a man who believes that the current government is so corrupt that <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets">radical, even authoritarian steps, are justified in response</a>. He sees himself as the avatar of America’s virtuous people, whose political enemies are interlopers scarcely worthy of respect. He is a man of the law who believes the president is above it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The authoritarian wing of the authoritarian party</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">J.D. Vance wasn’t always like this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He grew up poor in Middletown, Ohio — escaping a difficult childhood to make it to Yale Law and, subsequently, to the lucrative world of venture capital. This narrative served as the backbone of his 2016 book, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, that turned into a mega-bestseller: a book that seemed to explain Trump’s appeal to America’s downtrodden. It put Vance on the national map.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Vance of <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> was very different politically. Back then, he took a conventional conservative line on poverty, describing the working class as <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/43/a-hillbilly-left/">beset by a cultural pathology encouraged by federal handouts</a> and the welfare state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2016 Vance <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-trumps-potential-running-mates-harshly-criticized-him-in-the-past">was also an ardent Trump foe</a>. He wrote a New York Times op-ed titled “Mr. Trump Is Unfit For Our Nation’s Highest Office,” and wrote <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/04/19/americas-hitler-old-j-d-vance-message-turns-up-in-heated-senate-primary/">a text to his law school roommate</a> warning that Trump might be “America’s Hitler.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Eight years later, Vance has metamorphosed into something else entirely. Today, he pitches himself as an economic populist and cosponsors legislation with Sen. Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-vance-bipartisan-group-of-senators-renew-push-for-legislation-to-claw-back-big-failed-bank-executive-pay">curtailing pay for failed bankers</a>. In an even more extreme shift, he has morphed into one of Trump’s leading champions in the Senate —&nbsp;backing the former president to the hilt and even, at times, outpacing him in anti-democratic fervor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I spoke to Georgia state Sen. Josh McLaurin (D) —&nbsp;the former law school roommate who had received Vance’s “America’s Hitler” text —&nbsp;I asked him how the Vance he knew evolved into the Vance we see today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The through line between former J.D. and current J.D. is anger,” McLaurin told me. “The Trump turn can be understood as a lock-in on contempt as the answer to anger” — specifically, contempt directed at Vance’s political enemies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McLaurin’s comments suggest that Vance’s conversion to Trumpism is genuine. I’m inclined to agree, though the timing of his MAGA conversion surely is convenient: He converted to right-wing populism just in time to run for a vacant seat in Trumpy Ohio.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, whether Vance truly believes what he’s saying is secondary to the public persona he’s chosen to adopt. Politicians are not defined by their inner lives, but the decisions that they make in public&nbsp;— the ones that actually affect law and policy. Those choices are deeply shaped by the constituencies they depend on and the allies they court.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it is clear that Vance is deeply ensconced in the GOP’s growing “national conservative” faction, which pairs an inconsistent economic populism with an authoritarian commitment to crushing liberals in the culture war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug">cited Curtis Yarvin</a>, a Silicon Valley monarchist blogger, as the source of his ideas about firing bureaucrats and defying the Supreme Court. His Senate campaign was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/jd-vance-win-ohio-primary-00029881">funded by</a> Vance’s former employer, Peter Thiel, a billionaire who <a href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/">once wrote</a> that “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s a big fan of Patrick Deneen, a Notre Dame professor who recently wrote a book <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/15/23734340/patrick-deneen-regime-change-review">calling for “regime change” in America</a>. Vance spoke at an event for Deneen’s book in Washington, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054">describing himself</a> as a member of the “postliberal right” who sees his job in Congress as taking an “explicitly anti-regime” stance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance is also an open admirer of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a right-wing politician who has systematically torn his country’s democracy apart. Vance praised <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-viktor-orban-smart-decisions-face-the-nation/">Orbán’s approach to higher education</a> in particular, saying he “made some smart decisions there that we could learn from in the United States.” The policies in question involve using national dollars to <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/01/viktor-orban-seizes-control-of-hungarys-universities">impose state controls over universities</a>, turning them into vehicles for disseminating the government line.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a profile of Vance, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054">Politico reporter Ian Ward</a> quotes multiple leading Republican figures —&nbsp;specifically, the leaders of the faction trying to turn these postliberal ideas into practice — saying that they see Vance as a leading advocate for their cause.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Top Trump advisor (and current federal inmate) Steve Bannon told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054">Ward</a> that Vance is “at the nerve center of this movement.” Kevin Roberts, the president of the right-wing Heritage Foundation and the driving force behind Project 2025, told Ward that “he is absolutely going to be one of the leaders — if not the leader — of our movement.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enacting Trump’s dark ambitions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is little doubt that Vance will continue in this role if elected vice president. He would enable all of Trump’s worst instincts, and put a brake on none — deploying his considerable intellectual and intrapersonal gifts toward bending the government to Trump’s will.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Trump’s first term, he faced considerable opposition from inside his own administration. People like Defense Secretary James Mattis and Vice President Mike Pence served as brakes on Trump’s most radical impulses, challenging or even refusing to implement his (illegal) directives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance’s ascendance represents the death of this “adults in the room” model. Backed by people drawn from the lists of loyal staffers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/us/politics/republican-president-2024-heritage-foundation.html">being prepared by places like Heritage</a>, Vance would not only support Trump’s radical impulses but seems likely to spearhead efforts to implement them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He would be a direct conduit from the shadowy world of far-right influencers, where Curtis Yarvin is a respected voice and Viktor Orbán a role model, straight to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2004, Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean described himself as hailing from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/20/uselections2004.usa8">the Democratic wing of the Democratic party</a>.” If the GOP under Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/6/15/22522504/republicans-authoritarianism-trump-competitive">has indeed evolved into an authoritarian party</a>, then Vance hails from its authoritarian wing.&nbsp;</p>

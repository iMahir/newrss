But I think if you look around the world and you look around the democratic world, then you can see that politics is getting uglier, more violent, more polarised in extreme ways, and these are very troubling developments.</p><p>We’ve got a big choice to make as democratic societies, we’ve got an opportunity here to step back from the normalisation of that violence, to make sure that we disagree in civil ways and not in violent ways, and that we settle our difference with votes not violence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jul/15/australia-news-live-brittany-higgins-linda-reynolds-royal-visit-king-queen-energy-cost-of-living-housing-foreign-policy">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jul/15/australia-news-live-brittany-higgins-linda-reynolds-royal-visit-king-queen-energy-cost-of-living-housing-foreign-policy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jul/15/australia-news-live-brittany-higgins-linda-reynolds-royal-visit-king-queen-energy-cost-of-living-housing-foreign-policy</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 23:39:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump rally shooting: what we know about the suspected gunman]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican who donated to a progressive Super Pac</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jul/14/trump-rally-shooting-assassination-attempt-shooter-thomas-matthew-crooks-pennsylvania-latest">Trump rally shooting – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/14/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-names-20-year-old-from-bethel-park-as-subject-involved">FBI names suspected shooter</a></li></ul><p>The early portrait that has emerged of the 20-year-old Pennsylvania man who authorities say <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-trump-pennsylvania-rally-shooting">tried to assassinate Donald Trump</a> at a campaign rally in the state on Saturday before secret service agents shot him to death is a complicated and so far sparse one.</p><p>Thomas Matthew Crooks resided in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, a predominantly white, generally affluent suburb of Pittsburgh.

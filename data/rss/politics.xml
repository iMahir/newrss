<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Editor’s note, July 13, 9:40 pm</strong>: This is a rapidly evolving news story. It will be continuously updated as verified information comes in.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Saturday, July 13, in-person supporters and television audiences heard what sounded like gunfire as Donald Trump addressed a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania. Shortly after, as Secret Service agents rushed the stage, Trump’s face looked as though it was smeared with blood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While many details are still unknown, it appears someone has attempted to kill the former president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of this writing, much of the evening’s events remain murky. Amid rampant rumor and speculation, here are the facts as we know them right now, and what we still do not know about the night and the apparent assassination attempt.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we know</h2>

<ul>
<li>The events were televised live on Fox News. Keeping in mind that video footage from a single angle is sometimes misleading, here is what viewers saw and heard:</li>
</ul>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING NEWS: The Secret Service confirms that Trump is &#039;safe&#039; after the former president was rushed off rally stage following reports of possible gunshots in Butler, Pennsylvania. <a href="https://t.co/JCEJ1ZhSqQ">pic.twitter.com/JCEJ1ZhSqQ</a></p>&mdash; Fox News (@FoxNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1812269913362276613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<ul>
<li>The Secret Service’s <a href="https://twitter.com/secretsvcspox/status/1812288378596982908?s=46&amp;t=LVLwPwruc4koXd6hdIOe8Q">latest statement</a> explains, “at approximately 6:15 pm, a suspected shooter fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue. US Secret Service personnel neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased … One spectator was killed, two spectators were critically injured.”</li>



<li>In a <a href="https://x.com/CaitrionaPerry/status/1812264988918386888">statement</a>, the Trump campaign confirmed the former president “is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility.”</li>



<li>Trump himself <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112782066045321247">posted on Truth Social</a>, “I want to thank The United States Secret Service, and all of Law Enforcement, for their rapid response on the shooting that just took place in Butler, Pennsylvania. Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured. It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country.”</li>



<li>President Joe Biden <a href="https://x.com/phil_mattingly/status/1812274318141014032?s=46">issued a statement saying</a>, “I’m grateful to hear that [Trump is] safe and doing well. I’m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information … There’s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it.”</li>



<li>Biden also <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1812282482881941750/video/1">briefly addressed the nation</a>, stating, “There’s no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick. …&nbsp;We cannot condone this.” The Biden presidential campaign <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-rally-incident/card/biden-campaign-to-pull-down-television-ads-yWBcGSbQDl4lfoGSgXOk">has temporarily pulled advertising</a> in the wake of the shooting.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we don’t know</h2>

<ul>
<li>The shooter’s identity and motive are unknown.</li>



<li>The cause of Trump’s injury is unclear. Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger <a href="https://x.com/MerylKornfield/status/1812263916497506711">stated</a> that the former president was grazed by gunfire. Axios reporter Juliegrace Brufke cited a source claiming that a <a href="https://x.com/juliegraceb/status/1812269074367320509">bullet hit glass</a> (perhaps from Trump’s <a href="https://x.com/jeffgoldesq/status/1812272053040615873">teleprompter</a>) which in turn caused Trump’s injury.</li>



<li>Trump himself seems to believe that a bullet caused the injury, writing on Truth Social, “I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</li>



<li>The identities of any other injured or killed audience members at the rally have not been released to the public.</li>



<li>The weapon or weapons used in the attack, whether firearms or a high-caliber air rifle, have not been identified by investigators.</li>



<li>The Secret Service has not yet commented on how an armed person or persons were able to come within range of the former president.</li>
</ul>

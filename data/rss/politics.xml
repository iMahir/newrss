Vladimir Putin is ‘afraid’ of Ukraine’s Kursk occupation</p><p>We are restarting our live coverage of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Russia’s war in Ukraine</a> and will give you the latest updates throughout the day.</p><p>Here are the latest developments:</p><p><strong>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believes the war with Russia is “closer to the end” than many believe and called on allies to strengthen Ukraine’s army</strong>. In excerpts of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-zelenskyy-ukraines-war-russia-closer-end-appeals/story?id=113936136">an interview</a> with ABC News’ Good Morning America, set to be broadcast in full on Tuesday, the president said: “I think that we are closer to the peace than we think … We are closer to the end of the war.” He added: “That’s why we’re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It’s very important.” Zelenskyy told ABC that Vladimir Putin is “afraid” of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show">Ukraine’s Kursk operation</a>, in which it has taken more than 1,000 square km of Russian territory.</p><p>Zelenskyy is in the US to attend sessions at the UN general assembly as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/21/biden-letting-ukraine-strike-deep-within-russia-key-to-ending-war-zelenskyy-says">to present a “victory plan”</a> to US President Joe Biden and presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.</p><p><strong>After a bipartisan meeting with members of the US Congress, Zelenskyy said “decisive action now could hasten the just end of Russian aggression against Ukraine next year”.</strong> The US played a “critical role” in protecting freedom around the world, he said in a Telegram post, and praised the US Congress and both main parties for their “unwavering commitment to this cause”.</p><p><strong>His comments came as Republican presidential candidate Trump suggested Zelenskyy wanted Harris to win the November election</strong>. “I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,” Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania. “He wants them [the Democrats] to win this election so badly.” Trump said if he wins the election, he would call Putin and Zelenskyy and urge them to reach a deal to end the war.</p><p><strong>Zelenskyy also held talks in New York with German, Indian and Japanese leaders on Monday trying to shore up support for Kyiv’s war efforts.</strong> “We talked about how to make a just peace closer,” Zelenskiy said on his Telegram messaging app after meeting with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. “The main thing is to maintain unity.” He said he had discussed energy aid with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and that Delhi and Kyiv were “dynamically developing” their relations after a meeting with prime minister Narendra Modi.</p><p><strong>Jails controlled by Russia are deliberately withholding medical care for Ukrainian prisoners, with doctors in one prison even taking part in what it called “torture”, according to a commission mandated by the UN rights council</strong>. The commission, set up by the Human Rights Council to investigate violations in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, had already concluded that Moscow’s occupying forces were using torture “systematically”. But in his oral report to the council, commission chair Erik Mose said torture had become a “common and acceptable practice”, with Russian authorities acting with “a sense of impunity”.</p><p><strong>Russian forces launched the latest of a series of strikes on Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday evening, killing one person, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said</strong>. A city official, quoted by public broadcaster Suspilne, put the injury toll at five, including a 13-year-old girl. Strikes on the city earlier in the day and the previous night wounded at least 23.</p><p><strong>Russian forces have begun storming the eastern Ukrainian town of Vuhledar, a stronghold that has resisted Russian attack since the beginning of the war, according to Russian war bloggers and state media</strong>. Russian state media said the hilltop town in the Donetsk region, which some cast as a fortress due to its enduring resistance to Russian attack, was caught in a pincer movement by Russian forces and that battles were under way in the east of the settlement.</p><p><strong>Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the UN general assembly,</strong> <strong>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said</strong> <strong>it was clear that Russia was receiving new weapons, including Iranian missiles despite Tehran’s repeated denials.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/24/volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/24/volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/24/volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 07:28:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Boeing union voices anger as company makes ‘final’ offer in bid to end strike]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Union declines to put planemaker’s proposal for 30% pay rise over four years and improved pension to a vote</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/sep/24/china-stimulus-blitz-lift-growth-pound-high-dollar-euro-bank-of-england-business-live">Business live – latest updates</a></li></ul><p>The union representing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/13/boeing-union-strike">33,000 striking Boeing workers</a> has reacted with anger at what the aircraft maker called its “best and final” pay offer for a 30% rise over four years.</p><p>The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), Boeing’s largest union, declined to put the offer to a vote, saying the proposal was not negotiated with the union and it fell short of members’ demands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/24/boeing-final-offer-strike-pay-rise">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/24/boeing-final-offer-strike-pay-rise</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/24/boeing-final-offer-strike-pay-rise</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 07:29:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starmer to deliver Labour conference speech with left alarmed by plan for crackdown on benefit fraud – UK politics live]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>PM to deliver message of qualified optimism but expected announcement on benefit fraud concerns left of party</p><p>Good morning. <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> is giving his speech to the Labour confernece this afternoon and, as the Guardian reports, his overall message will be one of qualified, long-term optimism. Another leader might have dressed this message up in poetic rhetoric, but Starmer will be using a straightforward cliche, telling the audience “there’s light at the end of the tunnel”. He will say:</p><p>The truth is that if we take tough long-term decisions now, if we stick to the driving purpose behind everything we do: higher economic growth - so living standards rise in every community; our NHS facing the future - waiting lists at your hospital down; safer streets in your community; stronger borders; more opportunities for your children; clean British energy powering your home; making our country more secure ... then that light at the end of this tunnel, that Britain that belongs to you, we get there much more quickly.</p><p>The legislation will allow fraud investigators to compel banks to hand over information about people’s finances if there is a suspicion they are claiming benefits they are not entitled to.</p><p>It will also give them powers of “search and seizure” of people’s property in cases involving organised criminal gangs that are exploiting the benefits system.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/24/keir-starmer-labour-conference-speech-latest-live-politics-news">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/24/keir-starmer-labour-conference-speech-latest-live-politics-news</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/24/keir-starmer-labour-conference-speech-latest-live-politics-news</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 07:27:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia says it's the bigger person for not cutting Europe's natural gas supply — but that's not all there is to it]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-bigger-person-not-025405718.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-bigger-person-not-025405718.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 02:54:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data scientist nails the Trump gaffe that started what looks today like a building Harris landslide]]></title><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-scientist-nails-trump-gaffe-184136943.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-scientist-nails-trump-gaffe-184136943.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 18:41:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

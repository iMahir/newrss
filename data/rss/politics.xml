</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump announced that he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/matt-gaetz-attorney-general?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google">intends to nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)</a> to serve as his attorney general. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz is a longtime Trump loyalist, who will likely be tasked with remaking the Department of Justice. The department has traditionally adhered to strong norms against interference by the president; Trump and his allies have been explicit <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">in arguing that should change</a>. Trump has also repeatedly called for legal action against his political enemies, including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">promising</a> to “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Enforcing those sorts of threats would fall to Gaetz, if he is confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before being nominated to be attorney general, Gaetz was probably best known for two things. One is his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/1/23898555/kevinn-mccarthy-speakership-matt-gaetz">longstanding feud with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-CA), who was eventually ousted in no small part because of Gaetz. The other is the string of sexual misconduct allegations. Gaetz denies these allegations, and the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">dropped its investigation into them in 2023</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Gaetz does end up running that same department, he’ll be in a uniquely powerful role. He would be tasked with overseeing all federal prosecutions, providing legal advice to the president and the Cabinet, and would have the final say on any legal stance that the United States takes in court. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of greater significance perhaps is the fact that Gaetz would have enormous authority over who is prosecuted, who is allowed to get away with committing federal crimes, and who might be targeted for politically motivated prosecutions in an authoritarian administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has repeatedly promised “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">retribution</a>” against his Democratic rivals. And his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court ruled last July that he can order the Justice Department to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">bring politically motivated prosecutions without consequence</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the first Trump administration, Trump reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18105462/trump-clinton-comey-order-justice">order the Justice Department to prosecute</a> his former political opponent Hillary Clinton and former FBI director James Comey, but was dissuaded from doing so by White House Counsel Don McGahn. Gaetz’s strong support for Trump, by contrast, makes it seem he’s much less likely to resist such an order.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Just who is Matt Gaetz?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has a law degree, and he <a href="https://gaetz.house.gov/about">did previously practice law in northwest Florida</a>. He’s been a representative since 2017, and became known both for stunts on the House floor — like wearing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/gaetz-coronavirus-gas-mask/index.html">gas mask</a> to protest masking policies during the coronavirus pandemic — as well as his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/23/20929023/house-republicans-impeachment-stunt-trump">staunch support for Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, it was revealed that Gaetz was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">the subject of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The allegations arose out of his relationship with Joel Greenberg, a former county-level tax collector who was<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html"> sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> by a federal judge in 2022. Greenberg pled guilty to a wide range of crimes, including underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, identity theft, and conspiring to defraud the federal government. Judge Gregory Presnell, who sentenced Greenberg, said that he’s “never seen a defendant who has committed so many different types of crimes in such a relatively short period.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to CNN, Greenberg also “cooperated extensively with the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sex-trafficking probe into GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz</a>.” Among other things, Greenberg reportedly told investigators that he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4751778-matt-gaetz-joel-greenberg-sex-trafficking-florida/">witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl</a>. (Gaetz in 2021 issued a blanket denial of the allegations via a statement from his office, writing: &#8220;No part of the allegations against me are true.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a general rule, sex offenses such as soliciting prostitution are handled by state-level prosecutors, as the Constitution only gives the federal government <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">limited authority over sex crimes</a>. The US Justice Department can get involved, however, in narrow circumstances. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Justice Department’s investigation into Gaetz looked into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">whether he had sex with this teenager and paid for her to travel with him</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423#g">federal crime</a> to transport someone across state lines, with the intent that they engage in prostitution or “illicit sexual conduct.” The most serious violations of this statute carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">eventually decided not to charge Gaetz</a>. Its reasons for declining to do so have not been made public, but the lack of charges does not necessarily clear him of the allegations. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">House ethics investigation into Gaetz remains ongoing</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to ABC News, one woman told the House committee investigating Gaetz that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">the member of Congress paid her for sex</a>. Others have said they were paid to attend parties that Gaetz also attended, where attendees used drugs and had sex. Again, Gaetz has denied any misconduct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of yet, it’s unclear whether a majority of senators will vote to confirm Gaetz as attorney general. But there’s some evidence that many Republicans will be turned off by the sex crimes allegations against Gaetz, and by his generally poor reputation on Capitol Hill. In 2023, for example, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said that “<a href="https://x.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761">there’s a reason why no one in the [Republican] conference defended</a>” Gaetz after seeing some of the evidence against him.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sen. Markwayne Mullin on Matt Gaetz: “We had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor … of the girls that he had slept with. He’d brag about how he would crush ED medicine and chase it with an energy drink so he could go all night.”<br><br>Gaetz responds: “This is a lie” <a href="https://t.co/h55hj0ag29">pic.twitter.com/h55hj0ag29</a></p>&mdash; Manu Raju (@mkraju) <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1856798502484910130">New York Times columnist Ezra Klein writes</a>, Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz should be read as an effort to gauge whether Republican senators will permit him to take absurd and dangerous actions. “These aren&#8217;t just appointments,” Klein writes of Gaetz and Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, “They&#8217;re loyalty tests. The absurdity is the point.”</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has begun naming members to his White House team, offering a strong signal about the direction he’ll take on important issues, including foreign policy, immigration, and climate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s picks have included multiple immigration hardliners, underscoring his commitment to proposals like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportation</a>, as well as a number of staffers who hold adversarial stances toward China and Iran and supportive positions of Israel. Notably, most of Trump’s selections are longtime loyalists who could put up less opposition to his policy proposals than staffers did during his first administration. And he’s selected a number of people who have little to no experience in the subject matter they’ll be overseeing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first administration, many of Trump’s Cabinet members oversaw significant changes to the executive branch, including Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who were critical to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/">curtailing worker protections</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos">attempting massive cuts to education spending</a>, respectively. Trump has indicated he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb">wants to go further</a> and <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1855692242981155259">move faster this time around</a> and that he wants to ensure he’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/default/donald-trump-staffs-up-second-term-only-maga-loyalists-need-apply-2024-11-11/">surrounded by like-minded staff</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of the people Trump has named and the roles these appointees could play.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-961479096.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.727373918039,100,78.545252163922" alt="Tom Homan, sitting behind his name plate and speaking." title="Tom Homan, sitting behind his name plate and speaking." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Tom Homan, ex-ICE acting director. | Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="tom-homan-former-ice-acting-director-has-been-named-border-czar"><strong>Tom Homan</strong>, <strong>former ICE acting director, has been named “border czar”&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Homan was acting ICE director during the first Trump administration and oversaw the implementation of the family separation policy during his tenure from 2017 to 2018. He’s also long backed <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-makes-tom-homan-father-of-family-separation-in-charge-of-mass-deportation/">Trump’s desire to deport unauthorized immigrants</a>, previously noting that if invited to join the administration, he intended to “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">run the biggest deportation operation this country&#8217;s ever seen</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan worked for ICE during former President Barack Obama’s administration as well, and has also served as a police officer and Border Patrol agent. He’s been in lockstep with Trump on implementing punitive immigration policies and called <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-what-to-know/">for ICE to deport a wide range of unauthorized immigrants</a>, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">those who don’t have criminal histories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">wrote in a Truth Social post.</a> “There is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The “border czar” is not an official role that requires Senate confirmation;&nbsp;the secretary of homeland security is the actual Cabinet official overseeing the border. However, Homan appears poised to have a major say over policy and will weigh in on proposals at both the northern and southern borders, according to Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Homan’s efforts in the first Trump administration and his commitment to sweeping deportations this term indicate that the president-elect is fully focused on his promise to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">remove a large number of unauthorized immigrants from the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182126474.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107" alt="Stephen Miller speaking at a Trump rally.

The crowd behind him hold “Trump will fix it” signs." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Stephen Miller. | Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="trump-policy-aide-stephen-miller-has-been-named-deputy-chief-of-staff-and-policy-adviser"><strong>Trump policy aide Stephen Miller has been named deputy chief of staff and policy adviser</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373479/stephen-miller-mass-deportation-camps-trump-agenda">Miller is a staunch Trump loyalist and policy adviser</a> who pushed many of the harshest immigration policies during the president-elect’s first term. He has advocated for a travel ban and family separations in the past, and he’s a chief architect and booster for the idea of the mass deportations Trump has promised this term as well. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html">Miller has said of deportations.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has not yet formally announced the appointment, though Vice President-elect JD Vance has already <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1856004703672324263">posted his congratulations to Miller</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is another political appointment that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but the role is set to focus heavily on providing Trump with policy guidance — likely focused on immigration, given Miller’s expertise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Between this appointment and Homan’s, Trump has made clear that his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">promised mass deportations</a> will be one of his top policy goals when he retakes office.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162179387.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.742099199347,100,78.515801601307" alt="Kristi Noem speaks at a podium in a white jacket" title="Kristi Noem speaks at a podium in a white jacket" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. | Scott Olson/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Scott Olson/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="kristi-noem-has-been-tapped-for-homeland-security-secretary"><strong>Kristi Noem has been tapped for Homeland Security secretary</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>The two-term South Dakota governor is a longtime Trump loyalist and was on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">his shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Ahead of Trump making his VP selection, Noem became enmeshed in scandal after she <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24145840/kristi-noem-puppy-killing-book-trump-vp">admitted to shooting her dog, Cricket, because of behavioral issues</a>, generating overwhelming backlash.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Noem was known for refusing to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/opinion/kristi-noem-south-dakota-coronavirus.html"> impose a mask mandate</a> during the pandemic, and for refusing to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/politics/kristi-noem-cpac-south-dakota-governor-covid-mandate/index.html">implement statewide business closures</a> despite public health concerns. Noem was also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html">banned by multiple Native American tribes </a>from visiting tribal lands in the state due to claims she’s made that they’ve been infiltrated by cartels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On immigration, Noem has often echoed Trump’s hardline rhetoric suggesting that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristinoem/reel/DCIV983xbLS/?hl=en">many unauthorized immigrants are criminals</a>, and she backed his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a significant role given the agency’s notable&nbsp;purview over the administration’s policies at the southern border. DHS includes key subagencies like ICE as well as Customs and Border Protection. The secretary role requires Senate confirmation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Noem is one of several picks that signal Trump’s investment in punitive immigration policies this term such as mass deportation — and aggressive border security.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1167012750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.8120095111577,100,80.375980977685" alt="Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie" title="Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Fox News host Pete Hegseth | John Lamparski/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="John Lamparski/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="pete-hegseth-has-been-tapped-for-secretary-of-defense"><strong>Pete Hegseth has been tapped for secretary of defense</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A co-host of Fox News’s <em>Fox and Friends Weekend</em> show, Hegseth is a veteran who previously served in Afghanistan and Iraq but who has little senior national security experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth has taken controversial positions in the past, including advocating for soldiers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/media/fox-news-pete-hegseth-trump-pardon-war-crimes/index.html">who’ve committed war crimes to be pardoned</a> and stating that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/pete-hegseth-defense-cabinet-trump-women-b2646223.html">women shouldn’t be fighting in combat</a>. He’s written multiple books about his military service, often criticizing the military for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2e8d60f-7ac3-40a2-a252-5b7ab81622af">“wokeness” and prioritizing diversity</a> — and has said he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/">supports firing senior leaders who advance these ideas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth has expressed his support for Israel as well as an adversarial stance toward Iran. In addition to working as a television host, Hegseth previously led the advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, which is funded by the Koch brothers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary/">Trump wrote in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Secretary of Defense oversees the military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This person serves as a key adviser to the president on international conflicts and military policy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past officials in this role have often struggled to work with Trump, with five people cycling through it during his first term — and many of them criticizing his ability to govern.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth would need to be confirmed by the Senate for this role.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Hegseth’s nomination seemed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-defense-secretary-pentagon-2d8030921ecef933778cf92afd40ec72">take many lawmakers and military leaders off guard</a> given his dearth of experience. His inflammatory positions about wokeism in the military and pardoning of war crimes have also spurred concerns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth is among the many Trump picks poised to be strong defenders of Israel, and who advance a more traditionally conservative viewpoint on foreign policy.&nbsp;Like Trump, however, Hegseth has expressed skepticism of NATO and the contributions of US allies. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="john-ratcliffe-has-been-selected-as-cia-director"><strong>John Ratcliffe has been selected as CIA director</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>The former director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term, Ratcliffe is another longtime loyalist who’s being elevated in the upcoming administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, Ratcliffe helped aid Trump’s efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-cia-director-trump.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-cia-director-trump.html">investigate President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden </a>in the House, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/30/politics/ratcliffe-unverified-intelligence-concerns/index.html">and was also criticized</a> for declassifying intelligence about Russian operations at Senate Republicans’ behest while serving as the director of national intelligence. Members <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/intelligence-agencies-john-ratcliffe/index.html">of the intelligence community told CNN</a> that his past experience and track record made him a less disruptive choice compared to others who may have been considered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A House lawmaker prior to his time in the first Trump administration, Ratcliffe was known for his fierce defenses of the president-elect during his first impeachment proceedings. He’s also been a vocal critic of the Chinese government’s intelligence operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The CIA director oversees the United States’s intelligence-gathering operations around the globe. This official plays a key role in advising the president and overseeing how this intelligence is used.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Ratcliffe is the latest Trump loyalist to be installed in a pivotal position and questions remain about how committed he might be to opposing the president-elect. Trump has called for <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-has-promised-to-overhaul-u-s-intelligence-setting-up-collision-course-with-spy-agencies">an overhaul of intelligence agencies</a> that he’s viewed as challenging his authority.</p>

Marco Rubio. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="marco-rubio-has-been-tapped-for-secretary-of-state"><strong>Marco Rubio has been tapped for secretary of state</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Rubio is serving his third term as a Florida senator and is known for his adversarial position toward China, Iran, and Cuba, as well as his focus on <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/08/03/how-marco-rubio-runs-trumps-latin-america-policy-1972792">US-Latin American relations</a>. He currently sits on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, and though he’s taken foreign policy positions aligned with Trump’s isolationist rhetoric lately, he has previously supported international alliances and interventionist approaches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also expressed strong support for Israel, and emphasized he isn’t interested in a ceasefire in the region until the country has defeated Hamas. He’s backed Ukraine aid in the past as well, though he opposed more recent packages and has urged an end to the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also shifted considerably on certain issues like immigration: Early in his career, he was a chief proponent of immigration reform in the Senate, including a path to citizenship for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-answers-for-his-failed-2013-immigration-plans-again/">unauthorized immigrants,</a> and his rhetoric has grown more hardline and similar to Trump’s over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,”&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/">Trump said in a statement.</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is one of the most powerful in the administration and key to shaping US foreign policy. The secretary of state is the chief envoy of the US in other countries, and offers counsel for how to approach different international relationships. Secretaries of state are also often dispatched to help mediate conflict. The role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Like the selection of Rep. Mike Waltz for National Security Adviser,<strong> </strong>Rubio’s naming suggests that Trump may be open to a more traditionally conservative and aggressive approach to foreign policy.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2173723479.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Michael Waltz" title="Michael Waltz" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="michael-waltz-has-been-picked-as-national-security-adviser"><strong>Michael Waltz has been picked as national security adviser</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A member of Congress from Florida, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-picks-rep-mike-waltz-former-green-beret/story?id=115753630">Waltz is also a former Green Beret</a> who served in Afghanistan. He worked on foreign policy under President George W. Bush, and has sat on the Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs Committees in the House. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While on the Hill, Waltz became known for his hardline, aggressive stances on China and Iran and for being a vocal critic of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The national security adviser is a key foreign policy aide to the president; historically, they provide advice on both military and diplomatic matters. The role does not require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has clashed heavily with past individuals in this role including John Bolton, who has said<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bolton-excoriates-trump-fresh-introduction-his-memoir-2024-01-30/"> he’s “unfit” to serve as president again.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Waltz is one of multiple hawkish foreign policy picks Trump has made. That suggests the Republican Party wing that advocates for intervention and action on the world stage — rather than the restrained, more isolationist faction — may get a large platform in a second Trump administration.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162329710.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." title="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="elise-stefanik-has-been-tapped-for-un-ambassador"><strong>Elise Stefanik has been tapped for UN ambassador</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Once a moderate, Stefanik — currently part of Republican House leadership — has become a vocal Trump loyalist in recent years as her New York district shifted right.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/19/20966940/elise-stefanik-impeachment-hearing-donald-trump-adam-schiff">Stefanik first burst onto the national stage</a> as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, grilling witnesses as part of Trump’s first impeachment proceeding in the lower chamber in 2019. More recently, she went viral for her questioning of college presidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/elise-stefanik-republican-antisemitism-hearings.html">during a hearing on antisemitism</a> and their handling of student protests over Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a top House Republican, Stefanik has amplified Trump’s 2020 election denials and hewed so close to the president-elect that she was once on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Stefanik is also known for her <a href="https://www.vox.com/21262150/house-republican-women-candidates">efforts to recruit and support more Republican women</a> for House seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s taken a pretty standard conservative stance on foreign policy: Stefanik has been a prominent supporter of aid to Israel while balking at continuing support for Ukraine. She backed early tranches of Ukraine aid but joined other Republicans in arguing that more recent aid could be better applied domestically. Stefanik has previously questioned aid to the United Nations, including to its Relief and Works Agency, which has been vital to providing humanitarian aid to Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Elise is an incredibly strong, tough and smart America First fighter,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-chooses-rep-elise-stefanik-serve-us-ambassador-united-nations-rcna179558">Trump said in a statement about the role</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The UN ambassador serves as a vital envoy for US interests; given the country’s financial support for the body and its role on the UN Security Council, the ambassador has major influence regarding how the organization utilizes its resources and who serves in its leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last year, UN officials have been increasingly critical of Israel’s attacks on Gaza as thousands have died, health care systems have been assaulted, and famine has struck. As ambassador, Stefanik could criticize these positions and call for defunding UN relief programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>The pick suggests that the Trump administration could once again ramp up its disagreements with the United Nations, after attempting to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/02/trump-stealthily-seeks-to-choke-off-funding-to-un-programs/">curb funding for certain UN initiatives</a> in Trump’s first term. At that time, the administration also pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/trump-israel-palestinians-human-rights.html">citing its criticisms of Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stefanik’s naming could also underscore <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ukraine-russia-war-threatens-cut-aid-election-2024/">the president-elect’s skepticism</a> of additional aid to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162539091.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida | Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="matt-gaetz-has-been-tapped-for-attorney-general"><strong>Matt Gaetz has been tapped for attorney general</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is:</strong> Gaetz is a conservative firebrand and longtime Trump supporter who is known for his disruptive presence in the House. Previously, he was a chief antagonist of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and has threatened multiple government shutdowns over concerns that conservative demands weren’t being met on issues like immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has sat on the Armed Services and Judiciary committees in the House and has also faced an investigation over his alleged involvement in sex trafficking of a minor. (The DOJ ultimately declined to charge him.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s announcement of the position centered heavily on Gaetz’s supposed willingness to root out alleged bias toward the president-elect at the agency. “Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359" data-type="link" data-id="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359" rel="nofollow">Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role:</strong> The attorney general heads the Department of Justice and oversees the enforcement of federal laws. The DOJ conducts investigations of possible violations of these laws and is also responsible for holding federal officials accountable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past Trump Attorney General  Jeff Sessions was previously forced out when the president-elect disagreed with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348">his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. </a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Gaetz is another Trump loyalist who’s poised to help use the agency in a way that aids the president-elect’s aims. Republicans have long complained of targeting and bias at the DOJ and that could prove to be a major focus of his time there. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="lee-zeldin-tapped-as-environmental-protection-agency-administrator"><strong>Lee Zeldin tapped as Environmental Protection Agency administrator</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Zeldin is a former Republican House lawmaker who ran a failed campaign for the New York governor’s seat in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin did not previously sit on committees focused on environmental policy in the House, and&nbsp;focused on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134203429/new-york-governor-election-results-kathy-hochul-lee-zeldin">crime and inflation during his gubernatorial run</a>. That year, he came within a notably close margin of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul as a Republican running in a traditionally blue state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin has said some of his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-taps-lee-zeldin-lead-environmental-protection-agency-rcna179658">first priorities</a> will be to “roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,” and to work on US “energy dominance.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The EPA is responsible for crafting policies that protect clean water and air, and also plays a major role in approving regulations to combat climate change. The administrator position is a Senate-confirmed role.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Trump promised to take a very different approach to the environment than the Biden administration, including by <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">exiting international climate agreements</a> and focusing on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">expanding fossil fuel production</a>. Zeldin’s nomination suggests those promises will be a priority, as will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">rescinding Biden-era environmental protections</a> that curbed carbon emissions for businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-will-co-lead-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency"><strong>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency</strong>”</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who Musk is: </strong>A massive and vocal Trump advocate, Musk has used his platform on X (formerly known as Twitter) to boost the president-elect as well as misinformation about numerous topics, including noncitizen voting and election fraud.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk is known for leading several companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and for increasingly becoming part of Trump’s inner circle. Musk has also faced <a href="https://qz.com/tesla-elon-musk-ev-factory-wage-law-violations-lawsuit-1851391624">allegations of labor violations at his companies</a>, and for past attention-seeking efforts, like trying — and failing — to help a group of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17576302/elon-musk-thai-cave-rescue-submarine">Thai youth trapped in a cave in 2018</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’ll lead something called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, alongside former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The moniker for the department is a nod to the cryptocurrency Musk once endorsed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies &#8211; Essential to the &#8216;Save America&#8217; Movement,&#8221; Trump wrote in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2180840404.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.791470441211,100,72.417059117577" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who Ramaswamy is: </strong>A 2024 presidential candidate and biotech entrepreneur, Ramaswamy framed himself as an outsider trying to challenge the establishment during the GOP primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ramaswamy also aligned himself closely with Trump during his run, and has made much of his platform dedicated to combating “wokeism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Department of Government Efficiency doesn’t currently exist and a new government agency can’t be created without the approval of Congress. It’s likely that this agency will exist outside of the government instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s purportedly focused on slashing bureaucracy, government spending, and waste.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>This position speaks to the prominence that Musk has achieved in Trump’s orbit, and Ramaswamy in far-right circles, despite a lack of government and policy experience.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182885052.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729339346038,100,78.541321307924" alt="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." title="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Susie Wiles, Trump’s senior national adviser. | Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="susie-wiles-has-been-named-chief-of-staff"><strong>Susie Wiles has been named chief of staff</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Wiles, a longtime Florida campaign operative, helped run Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state and was a Trump senior national adviser in 2024. She’s heavily credited for the success he had during the Republican primary in 2024 and had previously aided Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during his gubernatorial run in 2018 prior to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/09/ron-desantis-susie-wiles-reaction-00188586">falling out between the two</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wiles has also been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-susie-wiles-00188391">corporate lobbyist</a> and worked with a spectrum of Republicans in the past, including former Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Florida Sen. Rick Scott.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Susie is tough, smart, innovative … universally admired and respected,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff/">Trump said in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The chief of staff is effectively a gatekeeper who helps shape the president’s priorities and offers policy counsel. The position is the most prominent political appointee in the White House and is not Senate confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html">Trump’s former Chief of Staff John Kelly</a> has been a major Trump critic, describing him as a “fascist” who favors a “dictator approach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Wiles <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-is-susie-wiles-the-woman-behind-trumps-historic-return-to-the-oval-office">has been credited</a> with professionalizing Trump’s campaign operations and reining in some of the chaos that has marked his past operations. That said, his campaign was still <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/30/trump-poisoning-the-blood-racism">rife with racist remarks</a> that echoed authoritarians as well as frequent lies <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html">about former Vice President Kamala Harris’s </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mveuxlccbV0">policies and identity</a>. Kelly has said he <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-susie-wiles-chief-staff-campaign/">attempted to restrain the president</a> during his first term, though it was still plagued by in-fighting and tumultuous policies on everything from climate to immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that two of his most vocal supporters, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1856658569124262092/photo/1">will lead</a> the “Department of Government Efficiency.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1856658569124262092/photo/1">Trump said</a>. “It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re wondering why you’ve never heard of this department before, it’s because it doesn’t exist. Despite the misleading name — executive departments <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/13/department-of-government-efficiency-musk-ramaswamy/">can only be established by Congress</a> — Trump simply appears to be forming a new <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74lgwkrmrpo">presidential advisory commission</a> or task force to offer guidance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So at first glance, this commission might seem entirely unserious. Its acronym, “DOGE,” is an apparent homage to the meme cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-surges-amid-donald-trump-elon-musk-joining-doge-crypto-news-19508910.htm">that Musk often promotes</a>, and the coin’s value <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=dogecoin+surge&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">surged after Trump</a> made the announcement. It’s also somewhat ironic that a commission looking for government inefficiency and waste requires not one but two co-chairs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the project isn’t only an inside joke, it’s also part of Trump’s existing plan to decimate the federal workforce. His campaign called for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/07/trump-dc-federal-workforce-cuts/">relocating government workers</a> out of Washington, DC, and making significant cuts to civil service jobs — an attempt to dismantle what Trump and his allies call the “deep state,” even though these jobs are often necessary to keep the federal programs running — and “DOGE” shows that he’s at least starting to execute that plan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump didn’t acknowledge that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is new, nor did he really explain what it will look like. He only <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1856658569124262092/photo/1">offered vague details</a>, like how the commission would “provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &amp; Budget to drive large scale structural reform.” The commission, in other words, is unlikely to have any regulatory teeth on its own, but there’s little doubt that it can have influence on the incoming administration and how it will determine its budgets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What Musk and Ramaswamy want, and why it’s dangerous</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it’s still unclear what this commission will look like or how big it will be, there’s plenty of reason to take the threat that it poses seriously. On the campaign trail, Musk, who served as a Trump surrogate, promised to find <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/13/department-of-government-efficiency-musk-ramaswamy/">$2 trillion</a> that could be eliminated from the federal government’s $6.75 trillion budget. And Ramaswamy, who ran against Trump in the Republican primaries but later campaigned for him, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump.html">has proposed</a> laying off 75 percent of the federal workforce and abolishing agencies like the FBI, IRS, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/384779/department-of-education-trump-musk-betsy-devos">Department of Education</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scale of those cuts would be catastrophic. In October, Musk himself <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship">said his plan</a> to slash the federal budget would cause economic turmoil, cause markets to crash, and “necessarily involve some temporary hardship.” Experts have also said Musk’s $2 trillion figure is more than merely aspirational — it’s practically impossible to find that much money to cut without putting <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-department-of-government-efficiency-trump/index.html">social programs on the chopping board</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can&#8217;t get to cuts of the size they&#8217;ve been throwing around without gutting things people really care about and count on,” Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship">Eric Levitz wrote</a>, if Trump doesn’t cut Social Security, Medicare, or defense spending, he would need to cut other government programs by up to 80 percent: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">That would involve gutting all social services for low-income Americans, food inspections, air safety, health insurance subsidies, and infrastructure investments, among countless other things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The commission, which Trump said will conclude its work within two years, is also riddled with conflicts of interest. Musk’s company SpaceX, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump.html">has more than $10 billion</a> in government contracts, and agencies like NASA are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/08/boeing-spacex-stranded-iss-astroanuts/679613/">already overly dependent on it</a>. The federal government has also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-legal-list-tesla-x-spacex-court-cases-investigations">been investigating</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/tech/sec-sanctions-elon-musk-testimony-twitter-probe/index.html">filing lawsuits</a> against Musk’s companies, and Musk himself has often <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91196851/spacex-musk-faa-chief-safety-standards">complained about</a> his companies facing too much government oversight. Now, Musk will be advising the next president on which agencies he should try to eliminate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The “Department of Government Efficiency” isn’t necessarily a new idea</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians always promise to end government waste, and a frequent target is the civil service. Under the Clinton administration, for example, Vice President Al Gore led the <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2013/04/what-reinvention-wrought/62836/">National Partnership for Reinventing Government</a>, an initiative aimed at streamlining the federal bureaucracy by eliminating unnecessary jobs and rolling back wasteful spending. While the project succeeded in some respects, it also created bad outcomes. The reduction in the federal workforce <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2013/04/what-reinvention-wrought/62836/">wasn’t especially well targeted</a>, and as a result, people with necessary and special skills left, which made it harder for the government to actually work better, as promised.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Ronald Reagan — who in his inaugural address <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/inaugural-address-1981#:~:text=They%20will%20go%20away%20because,problem%3B%20government%20is%20the%20problem.">said</a>, “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,” — also promised a massive scaling back of the federal government’s reach. He had plans to abolish major government agencies, like the Education and Energy Departments, and <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/remarks-signing-federal-employee-hiring-freeze-memorandum-and-cabinet-member">imposed a hiring freeze</a> on the first day of his administration. But Reagan’s plan to reduce the federal government’s footprint failed, and by the time he left office, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-reagans-vaunted-starve-the-beast-plan-failed/">there were more people employed</a> by the federal government than when he started. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s plan to dramatically reduce government spending and downsize the federal workforce will likely run into similar hurdles. Part of the reason Musk and Ramaswamy might have a hard time finding legitimately wasteful spending is because the federal workforce hasn’t grown all that much. The federal government employs about 3 million full-time workers — <a href="https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CEU9091000001">roughly the same as</a> in the late 1960s. And while that number is much higher (about 10 million) when you take contractors into account, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-true-size-of-government-is-nearing-a-record-high/">that also hasn’t changed much</a> since the 1980s, mostly ebbing and flowing but not exponentially increasing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The newly created commission is especially unlikely to succeed in finding significant sources of waste — at least nowhere near $2 trillion — because it’s probably not going to go after areas of spending that actually need better accounting, like the Pentagon, which has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-fails-audit-sixth-year-row-2023-11-16/">failed its audit</a> six years in a row. But that doesn’t mean the commission won’t recommend any cuts, and the scale that Musk and Ramaswamy are hoping for will almost certainly have a negative impact on the economy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while the announcement of the commission might have excited some Republicans and <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-surges-amid-donald-trump-elon-musk-joining-doge-crypto-news-19508910.htm">meme-coin investors</a>, they should know that if this commission succeeds, there <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship">might be a recession</a> on the other side.</p>

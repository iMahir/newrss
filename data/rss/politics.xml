<p class="has-text-align-none">When President Joe Biden announced Sunday he was dropping out of the presidential race, a chorus of Democratic Party officials breathed a sigh of relief. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent weeks, Democratic bigwigs ranging from Nancy Pelosi to Barack Obama had been ratcheting up a pressure campaign to get Biden to step aside. Back in 2022, former Obama adviser and current political pundit David Axelrod was one of the first prominent Democrats to suggest Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/11/us/politics/biden-2024-election-democrats.html">should withdraw.</a> But yesterday’s news left him with mixed emotions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When I got the news yesterday, I was very, very sad,” Axelrod told <em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Sean Rameswaram Monday morning. “I thought he was a tremendous asset in the White House. Always enjoyed being with him, always appreciated the points that he was making. I think history will be a lot kinder to him than voters are right now, for the things that he’s accomplished.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen to Sean Rameswaram’s full conversation with Axelrod and follow <em>Today, Explained</em> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. Below is a transcript of their discussion, edited for length and clarity. </p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP8691595294" width="100%"></iframe>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You were part of this mounting call for [President Biden] to step aside. Did you think that was actually in the cards? Did you think the party was capable of what it’s going through right now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I thought it was almost inevitable after the debate. The debate kind of crystallized what had been a big and growing problem, which was doubts about his fitness to serve another four years. Those were not just magnified, but calcified by the debate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then you had the bookend of Trump and the assassination attempt. And his preternatural marketing instincts to find the precise spot to take the hero pose. The two things read weakness and strength, which was the essence of the Trump message that the world was out of control. “Biden is not in command. He’s weak. Trump is strong. Vote for Trump.” That was their whole campaign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now they have a complication because they don’t have Biden. So, it does change the nature of the race. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the people who were calling for Biden to step aside are now jubilant, if not endorsing Vice President Harris. Your friend and former colleague, former President Barack Obama, has not yet done that. What do you think is going on there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think he wanted to prescribe for the party what the party should do, but rather be available to be a force for pulling the party together once the party made its choice. I think what’s very clear as we sit here this morning, the day after the president made his announcement, is that Kamala Harris is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. I don’t think there’s any real debate about that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She very quickly consolidated support in a way that should actually inspire some confidence, because that’s a political task and she did it. She did it very well. I think the last of the prospective opponents will endorse her and she’ll move on to the business of choosing a vice presidential candidate.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you don’t think she’s going to do what the Republicans did and wait until the DNC to announce who’s going to be on the ticket with her?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think she can, because they are committed to an early vote of the delegates to nominate two candidates in order to accommodate all the states filing deadlines for the fall ballot. They’re scheduled to meet next week to codify the ticket. I don’t think that they really can put this off until the convention. I anticipate that we’ll know relatively quickly who the vice presidential nominee is going to be.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You host a podcast with a Republican strategist named Mike Murphy, who’s anti-Trump, but he’s one of the few voices saying that it’s happening too fast with Harris. Do you understand his perspective on that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do, but I think that she would be the nominee if there were a process or if there were not a process, for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One, she has more of a relationship with the delegates to the convention. Biden-Harris delegates were chosen by the Biden campaign. And so they’re naturally going to gravitate towards her. The composition of those delegates favors her. I think she might have benefited from more of a competition just to show that she could win. But I get Mike’s point of view. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the reasons why I spoke out as early as I did about my concerns about the president moving forward was that had he made this decision last year, we would have had a Democratic primary. In the Democratic primary is how you pressure test these candidates. Remember, Ron DeSantis was viewed as a behemoth in the fall of 2022, and then he had to go through the nominating battle, and he ended up not faring as well. You do find out about people through that process. That said, she’s been vetted quite a bit. She ran for president. She’s been vice president for three and a half years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No matter what level of politics you’re at, there’s no training for it. There’s no simulator you can pop into to find out what the pressures of a presidential campaign are like. In many ways, the campaign simulates the sort of relentless pressure that presidents themselves will feel. She’s experienced that, she has been swimming in the deep end of the pool, and that, to me, is a big thing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other thing is she has apprenticed. She has been in those rooms. She has been in those meetings. She knows a lot about what the presidency entails. That, too, is something that’s very hard to learn, on the fly. So I think she’s got a lot of arguments on her side for this.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems like the Republicans really want to come after Biden, and now Harris, probably, on immigration, on inflation. Does Harris have the same weaknesses as Biden there, if not even more so?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, they will try to depict her as the immigration czar, and I’m sure they’ve got about 100 ads in the can on this. But the truth is, she’s not Joe Biden. She can chart her own course now. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m old enough to remember the ’68 campaign when Lyndon Johnson quit. Ultimately, his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, became the presidential candidate, and the heavy burden of Vietnam hung over him. He ended up losing by a point, but he also was like 20 points behind when he got nominated. And if that race had gone another month, another week, I should say he would have won. So, you know, she needs to chart her own course. Talk about what she would do. I think there are also points on this immigration issue that are vulnerabilities for Trump.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Are you looking forward to that debate?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh, yes. You know, what’s interesting is that the addled old man on the platform is not going to be Joe Biden this time.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. She’ll be an even more historic president, obviously. Do you think she leans into that, or do you think she leans into the issues? She leans into Donald Trump’s various criminal battles, what have you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen, when Barack Obama was running for president, we never talked about the historic nature of his candidacy because we thought that was obvious. Others might be talking about it, but he always said, I am proudly of the Black community, but I’m not limited to it, and I’m not running to be the first Black president or the Black president. I’m running to be president of the United States. The people who step forward and say, you can’t bypass her because she’s the first Black woman vice president? They were diminishing her. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case they should have been making and should be making today is why she’s the best candidate, why she has the best chance to win, what she brings to this race. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm among some folks about the historic nature of the race. But there are a lot of voters for whom other things are more important. And they want to know, are we going to have someone who understands our lives and is fighting for us? The more she focuses on that, I think the greater her chances of success.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You started saying that the news yesterday made you sad, but you obviously helped turn hope into a political strategy in 2008. Do you feel hopeful right now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do, because I think that what was not a race yesterday is a race today. I see the enthusiasm that the vice president has generated in the first 24 hours. She raised $46 million in a matter of hours, online and small donations. That’s a record. It’s a gauge of enthusiasm which has been absent. So I am encouraged by what I see. It’s better to have hope than despair. And this morning, a lot of Democrats have hope that they didn’t have yesterday morning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a very long time in American politics, the primary question of presidential candidate likability was voters asking themselves, “Could I have a beer with them?” But over the course of the social media age, a new gut check has emerged to test a president’s ability to capture the internet’s attention: Does this person make a good meme?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After four years of a president for whom the answer was “not really” (with a minor caveat for <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23300286/biden-dark-brandon-meme-maga-why-confusing-explained">“Dark Brandon</a>,” which was funny for precisely one second), Democrats now have a candidate who can actually compete with Trump in the court of internet opinion. On social media timelines the world over, Vice President Kamala Harris is currently being made into <a href="https://x.com/JoePostingg/status/1815387172469387530">frenzied supercuts</a> where she dances, laughs, and delivers her now-iconic <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">metaphor about coconut trees</a> as she expounds on being “unburdened by what has been.” She’s being <a href="https://x.com/Saweetney/status/1813264361840148935">edited into pop songs</a> and remixed <a href="https://x.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870">queening out to “Brat,”</a> the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/354634/charli-xcx-brat-album-review">Charli xcx album that’s become this summer’s</a> biggest cultural breakout and digital shorthand for unapologetic, messy hedonism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Memeability is an ineffable quality with undeniable electoral repercussions: Obama’s grabby slogans and punchy graphic design made him infinitely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/11/obamas-yes-we-can-thank-michelle-for-that/">more memeable</a> than standard-issue Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney, while Trump’s exaggerated facial expressions and off-the-cuff remarks can admittedly be very funny (who could forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NRUJbivhnE">his reaction</a> to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death as “Tiny Dancer” played?) when they’re not overtly cruel. In both cases, the candidates’ ubiquitous internet presence spoke to their wider ability to capture young people’s attention and energy, even when the memes themselves were barely legible to the average voter. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Democrats have been handed the blessing of completely organic Kamala memes. The out-of-context clips and creative edits of the vice president, usually steeped in at least some level of irony, gained steam following <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Biden’s disastrous performance</a> at the June presidential debate, when swaths of voters were clamoring for a change in candidate and turned to the next most likely option.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Suddenly, mentions of the “KHive” were everywhere, referring to Harris’s supporters during her 2020 campaign, as were viral clips of Harris singing <a href="https://x.com/pIanetMEDIA/status/1589854533865607168?lang=en">“The Wheels on the Bus,”</a> theatrically sharing <a href="https://x.com/rayofvenuss/status/1814096303854403711">Thanksgiving turkey recipes</a> seconds before snapping to attention for an interview, and talking about her favorite subject, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymail/video/7394381952989596959">Venn diagrams</a>. Harris is particularly prone to being memed: Many people on the internet have <a href="https://x.com/gayest_tone/status/1808249313455493491?s=46&amp;t=eeeaRs85C85Eh6UanNOWaQ">described her kooky persona</a> as “your Xanned out aunt,” thanks to her propensity to burst into a high-pitched cackle at any moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Only recently has Harris herself embraced the jokes, now that she’s officially running for president with Biden’s backing. Should you visit the campaign’s <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ">account</a> on X, you’ll notice a lime green banner with “kamala hq” written in the “Brat” font, an homage to the album cover. After Charli xcx <a href="https://x.com/charli_xcx/status/1815182384066707861">tweeted</a> “kamala IS brat,” Harris followed her on both X and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fellow Democratic politicians have followed suit, with Illinois Gov. <a href="https://x.com/JBPritzker/status/1815401261690208303">J.B. Pritzker asking</a>, “You think I just fell out of a coconut tree?” as his way of winkingly endorsing Harris (or perhaps gunning for a VP nomination), while Hawaii Sen. <a href="https://x.com/brianschatz/status/1815175570990276937">Brian Schatz posted</a> a photo of himself climbing a literal coconut tree.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>This, ultimately, is the power of memeability, or the talent of a candidate to transcend politics and become a legible cultural brand</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is this the beginning of a campaign that, for the first time since 2008, Democrats have actually found &#8230; fun? In 2016, the MAGA crowd delighted in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/9/21/12893656/pepe-frog-donald-trump">memes circulated on red-pill forums</a> that depicted Trump as a cartoonish strongman who was exactly as hateful and despotic as the left feared. Everything that made him invigorating to his fans — an unlikely nominee who captured a certain kind of irony-poisoned nihilistic impulse on the internet — now seems to be working in progressives’ favor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until recently, 2024 promised to be one of the most uninteresting elections in history. After a series of extremely unpredictable events (a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357876/biden-trump-debate-cnn-won-step-down-atlanta">poor debate performance</a>, an <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates">assassination attempt</a>, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-rehoboth-beach-harris-2024-ef4d643927247c59868607a80129c190">case of Covid</a>, and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">historic dropout)</a>, Harris has now filled a most unlikely role: a Democratic presidential nominee who’s entertaining to watch, even if you don’t agree with everything she stands for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, ultimately, is the power of memeability, or the talent of a candidate to transcend politics and become a legible cultural brand. It has played a crucial role in elections since before anyone used the term: Memeability is Bill Clinton playing the saxophone on <em>Arsenio Hall,</em> and it’s Howard Dean’s awkward scream that lost him the 2004 Democratic nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates have always attempted to stage this kind of virality — Hillary Clinton’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vvbwmj/hillary-clinton-accidentally-became-a-vine-meme">“I’m just chilling in Cedar Rapids” Vine</a><em>, </em>for one<em> —</em> but the moments that truly take off lock into the absurdist, chaotic energy of the internet and are almost impossible to predict. Clinton never cracked that particular formula, whereas Harris has done it while barely even trying.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Ryan Long, the 22-year-old senior at the University of Delaware who created one of the most <a href="https://x.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870">viral Kamala “Brat” video edits</a>, puts it, “She’s the perfect candidate for the TikTok generation. I’ve gone so deep into the Kamala Harris YouTube archives, and there are just so many moments of her laughing and dancing.” The clips, he adds, stand in stark contrast to the stagnant mood coloring the Biden camp over the past year. “Kamala just brings new energy and the possibility of change,” he tells me. “She does such a good job of embodying ‘Brat’ summer.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t long ago that Harris was dubbed “Copmala” by liberals and leftists <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record">dismayed by her “tough on crime” criminal justice record</a>. The vibe online has shifted significantly since then, and the left seems ready to <a href="https://x.com/thetolerantweft/status/1815142058555744734">embrace the absurdity</a> and <a href="https://x.com/chickenstrip007/status/1808154777634890089">make peace</a> with the candidate they’ve been handed. Though <a href="https://x.com/julesterpak/status/1815444787375599814">some online</a> have warned the Harris campaign against leaning into the jokes and memes too heavily or risk coming across as corny and try-hard, it’s just as easy to imagine large portions of voters excited about the prospect of a candidate who can — convincingly! — laugh along with them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps progressives have finally learned from Trump, who understood that memes, even when they were theoretically unflattering, could help craft the persona that won him the presidency. There’s an infallibility that comes with being in on the joke, and now that the Harris campaign has joined in, the attacks from the right don’t stick as they might have with a different candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was the RNC who made the <a href="https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811">four-minute video</a> splicing together every time Harris used the phrase “unburdened” back in December. Now, the most popular quote tweet of that <a href="https://x.com/nikicaga/status/1815128527886303620">post reads</a>, “The RNC staffer that posted this is getting executed as we speak,” referring to how the right’s criticisms of Harris have, so far, backfired. That Trump’s <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1814796045173272846">epithet for her is “Laughin’ Kamala”</a> feels particularly uninspired when compared to “Sleepy Joe” and “Crooked Hillary” — laughing is, after all, a famously fun and good activity. The Harris campaign <a href="https://x.com/BMeiselas/status/1815226127121826009">even gleefully reposted</a> a tweet advising Republicans to drop the “unburdened” jokes because “[t]hey’re going to spin that into marketing for her campaign.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What this all amounts to is a viral marketing stunt that any presidential candidate would pay millions for, but one that no strategist or ad agency could create. It’s all entirely organic, forged from the fires of a truly bizarre and unpredictable time, and the feeling that a little chaos might be exactly what American politics needs. For once, it really does seem like we can become unburdened from what has been. And perhaps Kamala Harris will be laughing all the way to the Oval Office.&nbsp;</p>

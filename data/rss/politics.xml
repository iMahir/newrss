On Saturday, as more than 2,000 medical and community workers prepared for the start of the vaccination campaign, medics in Nuseirat, one of the Gaza Strip’s eight historic refugee camps, said separate Israeli strikes killed at least 19 people, including nine members of the same family. More than 30 other people were killed in a series of strikes in other areas of Gaza, medics said.</p><p><strong>Israel’s military said its forces killed two people in separate incidents in the occupied West Bank</strong>, after one infiltrated an Israeli settlement and another shot at soldiers after his car exploded, Reuters reports.</p><p><strong>At least 40,691 Palestinians have been killed and 94,060 wounded in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October,</strong> the Gaza health ministry said in a regular update on Saturday.</p><p><strong>The World Health Organization has said it has already delivered 1.2m doses of polio vaccine to Gaza, with 400,000 more to follow</strong>, as part of an emergency campaign after the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/16/gaza-sees-first-polio-case-in-25-years-as-un-calls-for-mass-vaccinations"> first case of the childhood disease</a> in the war-hit coastal strip in quarter of a century. The WHO said that Israel’s military and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have agreed to three separate, zoned three-day pauses in fighting in Gaza to allow for the first round of vaccinations of 640,000 children against polio.</p><p><strong>The director-general of the WHO has called for a ceasefire ahead of plans to vaccinate 640,000 children in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> against polio.</strong> “Humanitarian pauses are welcome, but ultimately, the only solution to safeguard the health of the children of Gaza is a ceasefire,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.</p><p><strong>The UK is “deeply concerned” by Israel’s military operation in West Bank and “deeply worried by the methods Israel has employed”</strong>, a statement from the Foreign Office said.</p><p><strong>Israeli border police killed a senior Hamas commander in the West Bank and two Hamas gunmen on Friday, the Israeli military said. </strong>The Israeli military said its troops identified and killed Hamas leader, Wassem Hazem, while he was driving. When two others in the car - whom the military also identified as militants – attempted to flee, troops killed both in an airstrike.</p><p><strong>The Israeli military said on Friday it had wrapped up a month-long operation in southern and central Gaza that it said killed more than 250 Palestinian fighters.</strong> “The troops of the 98th Division have completed their divisional operation in the Khan Younis and Deir el-Balah area, after about a month of simultaneous above and underground operational activity,” a military statement said.</p><p><strong>A broader regional war in the Middle East where conflict already rages between Hamas and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> remains a “significant risk”,</strong> the head of the UN peacekeeping force warned on Friday. United Nations undersecretary-general for peace operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said: “There is still a very significant risk of escalation at the regional level. We are still very much in a very, very dangerous type of situation.”</p><p><strong>The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has launched a process that could lead to sanctions on Israeli ministers he said were responsible for “unacceptable hate messages” against Palestinians. </strong>Borrell said he had begun consultations with the EU’s 27 member states on whether they consider it “appropriate including in our list of sanctions some Israeli ministers [who] have been launching unacceptable hate messages against the Palestinians” and made proposals that “go clearly against international law” and incite war crimes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/01/middle-east-crisis-live-israeli-military-says-bodies-of-six-hostages-recovered-in-gaza">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/01/middle-east-crisis-live-israeli-military-says-bodies-of-six-hostages-recovered-in-gaza</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/01/middle-east-crisis-live-israeli-military-says-bodies-of-six-hostages-recovered-in-gaza</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 04:37:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exclusive-China's Sinochem plans to exit US shale JV with Exxon, sources say]]></title><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-chinas-sinochem-plans-exit-210103376.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-chinas-sinochem-plans-exit-210103376.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 21:01:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

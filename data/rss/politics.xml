<p class="has-text-align-none">If you were a Roman citizen around 200 BCE, you might have assumed that Rome was going to last forever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, Rome was the greatest republic in human history and its institutions had survived several invasions and all kinds of disasters. But Rome’s foundations started to weaken less than a century later, and by 27 BCE, the republic had collapsed. It then transformed into an empire, and even though the Roman state persisted, it was no longer a representative democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fall of the Roman Republic is both complicated and straightforward: The state became too big and chaotic; the influence of money and private interests corrupted public institutions; and social and economic inequalities became so stark that citizens lost faith in the system altogether and gradually fell into the arms of tyrants and demagogues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that sounds very familiar, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edward Watts is a historian at the University of California San Diego and the author of two books on ancient Rome. One, from 2018, is called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Republic-Rome-Fell-Tyranny/dp/0465093817"><em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny</em></a>, and the other, from 2021, is <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-eternal-decline-and-fall-of-rome-9780190076719?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome</em></a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Mortal Republic</em> is probably the best thing I’ve read on Rome’s history, both because it lays out what went wrong and why, and because it attempts to explain how the lessons of its decline might help save fledgling republics like the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I invited Watts on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about those lessons and why he thinks the American republic is in danger of going the way of ancient Rome. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You told me several years ago that you thought America might be in the beginning stages of a similar decline as Rome. Where do you think we are in that process today?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was much more optimistic in 2018 than I am now. What I saw in 2018 was a set of imbalances. I saw a primal scream by the American electorate that said, “We do not like what we&#8217;ve got.” And I saw hints that we might have violence injected into our political life. I had no idea that within two years that violence would take the form that it did and it would come so close to actually destroying the political system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was talking to a friend from Italy a couple of weeks ago about January 6, and he was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, it&#8217;s a blip.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s game this out. They came very close to actually getting in there when the representatives were present in the chamber, it was something like 15 minutes between when the representatives left and when the rioters got in. What would happen if they actually had gotten in and seized some representatives or disrupted the vote?&#8221; And my friend said, &#8220;Well, they would call in the army.&#8221; Who would call in the army? Who is actually legitimately in charge at that point? Who does the army answer to?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was the situation Rome found itself in. Once you break a system, there are no rules governing what happens and all of the institutions that depend on that system free-float. And I think we don&#8217;t appreciate how close we came to a moment where that was our government, or our lack of government. And in Rome that happened and it was profoundly devastating, hundreds of thousands of people died because of that. It&#8217;s not something that we should play with.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both the Roman political system and our own system were designed to be slow-moving with the idea that change should happen ploddingly and deliberately. Do you think, in retrospect, that trade-off wasn&#8217;t worth it for Rome? That it was too hard and too convoluted and therefore incapable of being responsive enough to what was happening?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where the 2,000-year lifespan of the Roman state is so important. Over and over in Roman history, there are these moments where people step back and say, “What we have is broken.” But because you have leaders and because you have a tradition of adapting, most of the time Rome doesn&#8217;t blow up all of these traditions and systems it inherited. It tries to find ways to amend them and to adapt them and to create new ways to make them more responsive to the needs of its citizens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The empire was built initially as a kind of Italian enterprise to extract stuff from all of these other places that it controlled. But by the early part of the third century [CE], every single free person in the Roman Empire was a citizen of the Roman state. And so this model of Italians extracting things from colonial subjects was gone. You couldn&#8217;t run an empire that way anymore because you have 6 million Italians and 60 million other Roman citizens. And so the third century was a process of trying to figure out how you remake a society that was originally devoted to sending resources into Italy and make it responsive to the needs of all of those people everywhere.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Would you say that adaptability, that expansion of the circle of citizenship, was the key to Rome&#8217;s survival for that long?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, and I think that&#8217;s a lesson we should take away from Rome. What Rome was able to do from its very earliest point, from the point when there were Roman kings, was to identify who could contribute to its society and find ways to empower people who were initially [on the] outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So some of the first Roman kings actually weren&#8217;t Roman. They were chosen because they were the best people for the job. The third-to-last king, Tarquinius Priscus, wasn&#8217;t even born in Rome. He actually grew up in a city in Etruria (present-day central Italy) and moved to Rome because it was a place where you were allowed to rise as high as your talents would permit. This society wouldn&#8217;t block you because you weren&#8217;t of the right background.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was deeply ingrained in what Roman society was, and I think that&#8217;s a lesson for us. You have to remain grounded in the things that make your country function, but you have to also acknowledge that there are people who may not have been born in a position of authority who have something to contribute. And if you&#8217;re going to make your society function in the long term, you have to find a way to bring them in, not just because it&#8217;s fair, but because they make your country better.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s interesting about Rome is that they experienced something like 150 years of political dysfunction and a brutal civil war before they finally scrapped the republic for an empire. That’s a long period of steady decline. Do you believe America has that much time to get its political affairs in order as a country?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just in the last four years, we&#8217;ve had people try to storm Congress and two <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360489/trump-shot-thomas-matthew-crooks-secret-service-butler-rally">assassination attempts</a>. It took Rome a really long time to get to the point where they were willing to do that. And the fact that we&#8217;re barely talking about those assassination attempts is stunning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Rome, there was a sort of creative tension that usually functioned well, but sometimes didn’t, between individuals who wanted to push change and systems that were designed to resist rapid change. In 27 BCE, Augustus figures out how to create a regime where he is the dominant figure for the rest of his life, but there are a couple of moments before that where individuals make choices that could have gone differently, but they have enough faith in the integrity of the system, and they have enough trust in the aesthetics of that system, that they do not go that far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The moment that jumps out to me immediately is Sulla, who was a dictator. He won a civil war, he murders Roman citizens in a fashion that is totally contrary to what a Roman state is supposed to do, or what any state is supposed to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Sulla fundamentally believed that a republic is important. He seized power and he occupied a position of authority as an autocrat for a couple of years and then gave the republic back because he believed that was important to do. He did not need to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And I think that&#8217;s a moment where we should reflect on whether some of the people who could find themselves in a position similar to Sulla in the United States would make that same choice. Would they walk away after changing whatever they wanted to change? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You once told me that people like Trump pop up in an old republic every generation or so, when things reach a certain point, and either the system reboots and gets back on the tracks or it goes the other way. I’m not really asking you to weigh in on the politics here, but I am asking you, as a historian, what you make of Trump as a symptom of deeper problems in the country.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where the tension between the system and the individual becomes so important because there are moments where republican systems are not working and an individual does seize the momentum and seize the opportunity to potentially refashion them in whatever way that person wants. They could do like Sulla or Caesar. Sulla seizes the republic, he kills a lot of people, but he turns it back, he restructures it. He believes in the republic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caesar also takes over the republic, and what he wants to do is create a republic that is truly a republic. Caesar, I think, deeply believed that there are certain aspects of the republican structure and of this idea of a citizen-held political community that he did not want to transgress, even if it would cost him his life. It was much more important to him to have a republic than it was to make himself safe. He made that choice knowing full well that it was a choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What I find alarming about Trump is I do not believe he cares whether this country is a republic or not. And so if he takes power and he has the ability to remake the state, he&#8217;s not going to remake it as a republic. He&#8217;ll remake it as whatever he decides he wants it to be, but he has no deep commitment to the idea of the republic, and that&#8217;s different from every Roman who takes power.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the many lessons we might draw from Rome’s collapse, what do you think is really worth reflecting on in this political moment?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the biggest point — and I&#8217;m afraid the ship has already sailed — is that violence should never be a part of politics. Once it&#8217;s there, it is very hard to make it go away without even more violence that ultimately neutralizes the people willing to do it. Violence has no part in a representative political system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think the other thing that is really important for us to understand is that you cannot wait or hope that a single individual is going to fix the problems in a society or fix the problems in a political system. If you have a political system that has functioned reasonably well and has been adaptable over the course of decades or centuries, that&#8217;s a very valuable thing. It creates rules, it creates assumptions, it creates a state of play where everybody more or less knows when you do X, this is how the system is going to respond. If you destroy that, you have nothing. And if you destroy that because of an individual, you just have that individual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Very occasionally, you will get an individual who creates something that maybe isn&#8217;t even better but is at least something. Most of the time the person who destroys does not have the capacity to create. And so you&#8217;re going to replace something that has governed just about every aspect of your civic and personal lives for your entire existence, and probably, in the United States, for the existence of 10 generations of your ancestors potentially. If you throw that away for an individual, you&#8217;re making a really significant bet. And if that individual is somebody that you don&#8217;t 100 percent trust is capable of creating something different, you are throwing away an incredibly valuable thing for nothing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On an unseasonably warm October afternoon, I did something I’ve done just about every fall since 2009: I made my way to Howard University’s (HU) campus to celebrate homecoming. It’s an event that’s reached almost hagiographic status: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLCOIcb41Y">name-checked</a> in rap songs and even <a href="https://thehilltoponline.com/2024/10/28/supermodel-anok-yai-returns-to-the-yard-for-howard-homecoming/">launching modeling careers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The energy in October at my alma mater is always frenetic: You see students and alumni dressed their best, babies in strollers on the yard wearing HU onesies, and friends who have stayed connected across decades gathering once more at what’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-untold-story-of-how-howard-university-came-to-be-known-as-the-mecca-212245">lovingly referred to as the Mecca</a>. This year, the excitement in the air was even more palpable. For lack of better phrasing, the vibe was different. On one hand, the obvious culprit was that the university was celebrating its 100th homecoming. On the other hand, that difference may have something to do with the fact that the school’s most famous alumna (at least right now) could soon become arguably the most powerful person in the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris wasn’t on campus — she has spent part of her fall at the homecomings of  historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in swing states and not bright blue DC — but you wouldn’t know that looking around. Howard does not have a political affiliation, but vendors gathered outside the entrance to the football game hawking bucket hats with Harris’s name on them; her sorority sisters wore T-shirts with her face embroidered in pink and green; people fanned themselves with Harris/Walz fans while R&amp;B singers entertained the crowd; and children in HU gear played in a bouncy house as their parents looked on. Despite its nonpartisan stance, the university is where Harris plans to be the night of the election, in a way creating a homecoming all her own.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, Howard is not a place with large numbers of Donald Trump supporters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Black voters are not a monolith, and the student body at Howard — one of the nation’s most prestigious universities —&nbsp;is not a representative sample of all Black voters. Indeed, some polls suggest that Black voters may be supporting Trump in higher numbers than in either of his previous two runs —&nbsp;a shift that some observers believe will be large enough to mark a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373535/3-theories-gop-donald-trump-nonwhite-voters-hispanic-black-latino-asian">racial realignment</a>” in American politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the polls paint a murky picture. A recent NAACP survey found <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/28/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/aarp-survey-00185978">Black men were backing off their support for Trump</a> and coming toward Harris in the final stretch before the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some experts are skeptical that, after the election, the “racial realignment” will materialize. Enter Andra Gillespie, a political scientist and associate professor at Emory University who specializes in Black political participation.&nbsp;“The story of the cycle may very well be that people are overhyping the extent of Black defections away from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She points her finger at polling — or rather, the lack thereof — for Black voters specifically. While there has been plenty of <a href="https://youtu.be/In9Pqm9YlIo?si=VC53K-uLienjIi8x">polling with enough respondents</a> to get a clear picture of the electorate, Gillespie argues that the numbers of Black voters within those samples don’t provide a clear enough picture of Black voters. I spoke with Gillespie in October about the number of votes Trump may get from Black voters, and how even getting just 80 percent of the Black vote worries Democrats. We also talked about the roles education and age play within this segment of the electorate, and whether we’re seeing shifts based on those factors. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about the Harris campaign’s struggles with Black voters lately. Can you lay out what that struggle looks like? Are we talking about Black people leaving the Democratic Party en masse?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No. The first problem has been making a lot of conjectures based on sample sizes that have huge margins of error. So you&#8217;re looking at very noisy data. This started when Joe Biden was still the Democratic nominee for president. We forget that the number that comes out in surveys is the midpoint of a range of multiples. That&#8217;s why surveys are always plus or minus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was some evidence of [Black support] softening. We don&#8217;t know — because [Biden] dropped out of the race — whether or not people would have solidified their support for Donald Trump. Joe Biden was likely going to perform somewhere in the neighborhood of what he had done before and the numbers that you were getting, especially in the winter and early spring were suggesting that Donald Trump could get 30 percent of the African American vote. If your margin of error is minus 10, that means that that number could, in real life, be as low as 20 percent, which would suggest a gain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I&#8217;m thinking back to the Obama years, and 20 percent would be a lot.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Twenty percent would be a lot since nobody&#8217;s come close or even in the high teens since Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. So yeah, it would be unprecedented. But that&#8217;s what 100 people were saying or 150 people, or sometimes 200 people were saying in a survey in March or in February.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to be very clear: Donald Trump could actually improve his share of African American voters. I&#8217;m not saying that that&#8217;s impossible. But what&#8217;s a more likely scenario is that he makes a marginal gain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking at the numbers from the New York Times/Siena College poll that came out [recently], Trump&#8217;s numbers are in what I would call the normal range for a Republican candidate. What everybody was concerned about was the fact that Kamala Harris is pulling in below 80 percent on that poll. The upper bound of the margin of error would put that number into the low 80s, which would still be underperforming. But she still has three weeks from an election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Eighty percent of any demographic sounds like a lot of voters, but it&#8217;s framed as a problem for the Harris campaign.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a problem for the campaign because Black people make up the base of the Democratic Party; it becomes a problem when she&#8217;s reliant on them turning out voting almost unanimously for her and in high numbers and in key battleground states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a state like Georgia, for instance, most white people are Republicans. Black people make up more than half of the Democratic Party in the state of Georgia. If they have anemic turnout or start to vote for the Republican or other candidates in the race, there just aren&#8217;t many other votes that she can pick up. For a state like Georgia to be competitive, you&#8217;ve got to perform at historical averages, which means she needs to be doing 90 percent or better. And she needs Black turnout to be proportional to their actual numbers in the electorate: 30 percent of voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You also have to care about it in the Blue Wall states, because even though Black people don&#8217;t make up as large a proportion of the population when you&#8217;re talking about margins, that could easily be 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 votes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I want to get into one of the narratives we&#8217;ve seen this election cycle, and that&#8217;s this flip in the parties when it comes to education. One of the narratives that we see emerging is that&nbsp;Democrats are </strong><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-a-college-degree-is-one-of-the-best-predictors-of-which-candidate-voters-support"><strong>now the party</strong></a><strong> of those </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/opinion/gender-education-gap.html"><strong>with college degrees</strong></a><strong> — your lawyers, your doctors; and Republicans are more the party of the working class — your blue-collar workers, maybe without a college degree. How do you see that playing out among Black voters?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think one thing that should be noted is 2016 was the year that pundits discovered that working-class white voters were Republican. That trend actually started a long time ago. I&#8217;ve seen graphs that chart this back to the mid-1970s, where you can see a decline in the number of non-college-educated white voters who are voting Democratic in elections. People just discovered it because Donald Trump ran on a populist platform, but he wasn&#8217;t doing anything revolutionary or new there at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So yes, we now accept that education correlates with party identification, and voting behavior with college-educated voters being more likely to vote Democratic these days. If you go back and you look at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-black-likely-electorate.html">that New York Times/Siena College poll</a>, and you look at the breakdown in terms of support for Harris and Trump based on college education, you don&#8217;t see much of a difference in terms of support among Black voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are more conservative Black people who are still identifying as Democrats than Republicans, and the reason why is because of race. People who have a strong racial identity, people who perceive that the Democratic Party is the better party to handle issues related to race and civil rights. My friend, Tasha Philpot at the University of Texas, has noted that Black people aren&#8217;t necessarily putting the same weight or emphasis on social conservatism in the same way that white people might.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If education is not this predictor for who Black people will vote for, is it a predictor of if they will vote or not?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we&#8217;re looking at support for Harris, there’s only a percentage point difference [between Black voters with and without a bachelor’s degree]. I see differences in age — that&#8217;s actually not that unusual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We expect that younger people have weaker partisan attachments because they&#8217;re new to the electoral process. Older age cohorts, the oldest Black Americans uniformly, have made up their minds. I think part of the push on HBCU campuses is to get a group of young Black voters who are probably the most likely to show up because they&#8217;re the most resourced to be convinced to support Kamala Harris and to convince their friends to do that as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that they&#8217;re not strong Democrats could be a harbinger of things to come, but it&#8217;s going to take me 20 years to figure out what these folks are doing when they&#8217;re in their late 30s before I would be willing to say, “We&#8217;re witnessing a realignment of Black voters away from the party.” But I think that there&#8217;s still the question of who’s actually going to show up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I think it&#8217;s interesting because you mentioned that the Harris campaign is on this HBCU tour. They’re going to your Spelmans, your Morehouses, to talk to these young voters who are most likely to be resourced and most likely to show up to the polls. Every election year we hear the phrase “Black people are not a monolith” and that&#8217;s always been true. But I think of W.E.B. DuBois and this idea of the </strong><a href="https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/the-talented-tenth/"><strong>Talented Tenth</strong></a><strong> – that one of the jobs of the Black elite is to achieve racial progress. But that leaves out the other 90 percent of Black people. How have we seen this dynamic between education, class, and politics play out through the years?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think it’s important to keep in mind <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-fallacy-of-the-talent_b_613510">DuBois repudiated the idea of the Talented Tenth</a>. Part of the reason why college students in general are more resourced is, by being in college, they are picking up skills that are actually going to help them navigate civics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As they get older, their education is going to prepare them for jobs that might actually give them more flexibility to be able to vote easier than others who might have shift work where their schedule is predetermined for them. All of those things accumulate and matter in terms of predicting a person&#8217;s likelihood of turning out to vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, colleges end up reducing the costs of voter registration and voting. If you are on a college campus where your office of student life has put out voter registration materials so that all you have to do is basically pick one up as you&#8217;re walking out of a cafeteria, that&#8217;s a lot easier than somebody who is living in an apartment downtown who then has to go to a county board of elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do we know why Trump has been able to peel away some of these Black voters? What are the factors there?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am skeptical of how effective he has actually been, and we&#8217;ll see how those numbers play out on Election Day. I would not be surprised at a marginal gain of a percentage point or two, but he was never getting the 30 percent that he claimed to get. If I think about those marginal gains, there have been outreach efforts to African American men the Republican Party has been engaged in for a long period of time that actually predates Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The message that Trump has used to try to reach out — which has usually been worded in a really offensive way — actually harkens back to a strategy that Richard Nixon used to try to reach out to Black voters. Keep in mind, Richard Nixon didn&#8217;t do that badly, relatively speaking, among Black voters, despite the Southern Strategy, and it was because he used this strategy called Black Capitalism. He wanted to appeal to Black voters by talking about how Republican policies were more conducive to entrepreneurship and economic prosperity. And when you heard Donald Trump four years ago, trying to talk about his Platinum Plan — which, arguably, he may have <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ice-cube-donald-trump-platinum-plan-1075709/">ripped off from Ice Cube</a> — that&#8217;s a play toward Black capitalism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">[Trump] in particular has benefited from having been in the public eye, having been sort of like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/11/06/trumps-rap-sheet/">name-check for financial success</a>. It&#8217;s not surprising that there&#8217;s some people who would ascribe very positive traits to him and to his presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do you see all of this playing out and evolving beyond 2024? What will you be looking out for in the years to come when it comes to the Black electorate?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that we are still kind of in a post-1964 paradigm, where Black people are going to be overwhelmingly Democratic in their voting orientation. I expect that the ratio is going to still be somewhere in the neighborhood of about nine to one in favor of Democrats, give or take a couple of points.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let&#8217;s say that Republicans incrementally gain two to three percentage points per election cycle among Black voters. Then 20 years from now I might say, “Black people have been engaging in a secular realignment away from the Democratic Party and what we see is Republicans becoming more competitive over time.” If that happens and we start to point to the trend line, then we are going to start to go back to 2020 and 2024 and see that as the beginning of the shift. But if we are in the beginning of the shift — I don&#8217;t know that yet. It&#8217;s way too early for me to say that. I think the thing that will make it change is not Donald Trump.</p>

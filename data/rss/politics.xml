The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the victims were private security guards. The Jordanian ministry <a href="https://x.com/ForeignMinistry/status/1832888267600957606">said</a> the attack was being investigated and that it “rejected and condemned violence and targeting civilians for any reason”. Israel announced the closure of its land crossings with Jordan, and later said all would reopen on Monday.</p><p><strong>Speaking after the attack, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was “a difficult day”, </strong>adding: “A loathsome terrorist murdered in cold blood three of our civilians.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose role is largely ceremonial, urged all parties to investigate the incident to prevent repeats.</p><p><strong>An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed a senior aid official and four members of his family.</strong> Gaza’s civil defence group, which fights fires and rescues people trapped in rubble, said its deputy director for northern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, Mohammed Morsi, had been killed in an airstrike. The organisation said four members of his family also died in the bombing of Morsi’s house in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, north-east of Gaza City.</p><p><strong>Huge numbers of Israelis again poured into the streets on Sunday to protest against the government’s failure to secure the return of remaining hostages in Gaza</strong>. The new protest came a week after one of the largest demonstrations of the war after the discovery of another six dead hostages in Gaza, and after Netanyahu pushed back against pressure for a ceasefire deal and declared that “no one will preach to me”.</p><p>The <strong>Qatar Red Crescent</strong> and the UN agency for <strong>Palestinians</strong> (Unrwa) signed an agreement on Sunday, with $4.5m from a Qatari state development fund, to aid more than 4,400 stranded Palestinian workers and patients from Gaza in the West Bank.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/09/middle-east-crisis-seven-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-iran-linked-military-site-in-syria-says-war-monitor">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/09/middle-east-crisis-seven-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-iran-linked-military-site-in-syria-says-war-monitor</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/09/middle-east-crisis-seven-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-iran-linked-military-site-in-syria-says-war-monitor</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 06:38:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine’s ‘dragon drones’ rain molten metal on Russian positions in latest terrifying battlefield innovation]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-dragon-drones-rain-molten-040119035.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-dragon-drones-rain-molten-040119035.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 19:49:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[German Chancellor Scholz calls for faster progress toward ending Russia's war on Ukraine]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/german-chancellor-scholz-calls-faster-170039458.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/german-chancellor-scholz-calls-faster-170039458.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 17:00:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump threatens lawyers, donors and election officials with prison for 'unscrupulous behavior']]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-threatens-lawyers-donors-election-032056229.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-threatens-lawyers-donors-election-032056229.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 03:20:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine mourns dead from major Russian strike, vows response with underground weapons production]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-destroys-scores-russian-drones-090858879.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-destroys-scores-russian-drones-090858879.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 09:08:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

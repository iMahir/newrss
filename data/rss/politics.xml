<p class="has-text-align-none">This spring, an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/25/trump-biden-americans-illegal-immigration-poll">eye-opening poll</a> from Axios suggested what once seemed unthinkable: Four in 10 Democrats were open to the idea of the US government deporting undocumented immigrants en masse. Though that share of support might seem high, other polls conducted since have found something similar, suggesting Americans at large are open to harsher, more Trumpian immigration policies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, as attention-grabbing as some of the headlines on support for mass deportations have been (and as Donald Trump and his allies continue to talk about his plans for such), those polls may not accurately capture the mood of the American electorate. Support for a policy of mass deportation, while superficially high, rests on two related complications: substantial confusion among voters about what it might actually entail, as well as a generalized desire to do something — anything — on immigration, which <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642887/inflation-immigration-rank-among-top-issue-concerns.aspx">polls frequently report</a> to be among Americans’ top issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That disconnect is because standalone polls and headlines do very little to capture the complexity of many Americans’ feelings about immigration, which often include simultaneous, and apparently contradictory, support for more immigrant-friendly policies alongside draconian ones. The real answer, more specific polling by firms like Pew Research Center suggests, lies somewhere in the middle: A good share of voters, it seems, are fine with increasing deportations. Some might even want the kind of operation Trump is floating. But many also want exceptions and protections for specific groups of immigrants who have been living in the US for a while, or have other ties to the country.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Taking a deeper look at polling on immigration</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in August, the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/09/27/trump-and-harris-supporters-differ-on-mass-deportations-but-favor-border-security-high-skilled-immigration/">Pew Research Center</a> dug into the question of mass deportations by asking registered voters their opinions on immigration levels, the value of immigrants, and what kind of exceptions they might endorse to allow undocumented immigrants to remain in the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results were messy, but showed two distinct things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, support for “mass deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally” received majority support: 56 percent of registered voters “strongly or somewhat” favored such a proposal. That majority of voters included, unsurprisingly, 88 percent of Trump voters; it also included about 3 in 10 supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The August findings align with Pew’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/15/what-would-improve-the-u-s-immigration-system/">earlier research, conducted in January 2024</a>, which found a majority of Americans think “increasing deportations” of people who are living in the US illegally would improve the US immigration system and reduce southern border crossings. Republican respondents in that survey were essentially uniform in supporting such a policy; Democrats were divided, with similar shares (about 30 percent) saying deportations would make things better or worse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, both of Pew’s surveys found Americans were also supportive of more friendly policies for undocumented immigrants, like a pathway to citizenship. The August report notes that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/09/RE_2024.09.27_Voters-on-Immigration_TOPLINE.pdf">about 6 in 10</a> registered voters say that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to “stay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met.” And a similar share, 58 percent, favored “allowing undocumented immigrants to legally work and stay in the country if they are married to a US citizen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sahana Mukherjee, one of the Pew Research Center analysts behind the August deep-dive on “mass deportations,” told me that as many as 40 percent of registered voters who support mass deportations also support a policy that would allow undocumented spouses of US citizens to remain in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That share varies based on which candidate these voters support: About a third of Trump supporters who back mass deportations support such a plan, while about 60 percent of Harris supporters who back mass deportations do. But this group of voters with overlapping priorities suggests that when taking the temperature of the public, being open to mass deportations isn’t the same as supporting a specific policy. Support changes when you get into the details of who could be affected.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Mukherjee said, about 40 percent of registered voters who support mass deportations — one-third of the Trump supporters who do so, and two-thirds among the same pool of Harris supporters — also endorse the idea of undocumented immigrants being allowed to remain in the US “if certain conditions are met.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other high-quality polls second these nuanced, seemingly contradictory feelings: A September <a href="https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/76/25/c50efe0b45bf80f50cbbb6ed38a7/scripps-news-ipsos-poll.pdf">Ipsos</a> poll found 54 percent of American adults supported a mass deportation plan, while, at the same time, 68 percent would also support a “pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar dynamics hold true among Hispanic and Latino respondents, with a twist: While about 4 in 10 Latinos in the two most recent high-quality polls of these voters backed some kind of deportation program, a much higher share also supported some kind of pathway to citizenship.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-hispanic-likely-electorate.html">New York Times-Siena poll</a> of Hispanics from October, for example, found 67 percent of Hispanics backed a pathway to citizenship for “all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States” while 45 percent supported deporting immigrants living illegally in the US. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25177909-nbc-news-telemundo-cnbc-latino-voter-poll-topline-results-september-17-23-2024">poll from NBC/Telemundo</a> in September showed similar levels of support for deportations, while 87 percent of Hispanics backed a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought as children to the US, and 91 percent supported that pathway for undocumented spouses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Making sense of these policy nuances</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why do voters hold seemingly conflicting views on immigration? Pro-immigrant advocates argue that there isn’t a contradiction here — those competing numbers instead represent people who don’t understand exactly what “mass deportation” means or what a deportation program would look like in practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans might not understand that deportations of all undocumented immigrants would include deportations of DACA recipients and longtime neighbors or friends who have been living normally and are bedrocks of local communities, advocates and researchers say — rather than only recent arrivals, or those few migrants who commit violent crimes yet get outsize media and political attention, who they may view differently.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mukherjee said there’s also a degree of nuance that issue and horserace polls might not be picking up, since they aren’t necessarily equipped to ask in-depth questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We asked about one requirement specifically in the survey, which is looking at if you&#8217;re married to a US citizen, but it remains to be seen whether there are other requirements that people are also thinking about,” Mukherjee said. “What we hear about in everyday discourse, in the media, is if you have a child who is US born, or if you yourself came as a child. We didn&#8217;t get into this in the survey, but it&#8217;s possible these are some of the requirements people were thinking about, and perhaps that could be influencing that share of people who support both.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, when it comes to complex policy options, and especially to immigration policy, Americans can be idiosyncratic in their opinions. Surveys that don’t specify what “mass deportation” means may also be tracking inflated support for the kind of hardline stance the Trump/Vance campaign is offering, Steven Kull, the director of the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland, told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Questions that are just like, ‘do you favor or oppose mass deportation’ I think are very limited in their value, because you don&#8217;t know what it means,” Kull said. “All people know is ‘deport a large number of people.’ And 1,000 people is a lot of people. Ten thousand is a lot of people. It&#8217;s not clear that it&#8217;s 11 million — that the policy is to deport 11 million — and that it would entail a massive operation, and all that has to be clear to really understand what public opinion is on the issue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kull’s team instead has <a href="https://publicconsultation.org/immigration/swing-state-survey-majorities-favor-path-to-citizenship-over-mass-deportation-while-strengthening-the-border/">run surveys</a> of national samples and groups of swing-state voters that provide additional information and arguments in favor and against either mass deportations or pathways to citizenship. The result, again, is complex, but support for mass deportations falls <a href="https://publicconsultation.org/ss-immigration/ss-im-im/">when presented against</a> the option for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants provided they meet specific requirements.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There is some appeal to the idea [of mass deportation] — let’s be clear about that. But it’s not that people have it all crystallized in their mind,” Kull said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How is this playing out on the campaign trail?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Immigration reform advocates and some Democratic strategists are doing their best to highlight that nuance when advising Democrats on how to respond to Trump’s escalating rhetoric around immigration and immigrants. They urge Democrats to be clear about just who would get caught up in a broad mass deportation scheme — and to contrast that with a more “balanced” Democratic approach to immigration and the border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a private memo prepared for national Democratic campaigns looking to address Trump’s mass deportation position and shared with Vox, strategists argue that this polling picture presents Democrats with a narrow path to repudiate the Trump approach while acknowledging the real concerns some voters have with recent waves on migration in the Biden years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have more than enough reason to believe that voters, when asked their opinion on deportations, take it to mean the deportation of people who have <em>recently crossed the border</em>, as well as known criminal elements,” the strategists advise. They highlight Trump running mate JD Vance’s October debate statement explaining this deportation scheme (emphasis original to the memo):</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">“So we&#8217;ve got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we do is <em>we start with the criminal migrants</em>. About<strong> </strong><em>a million</em> of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Vance position as stated here is likely popular,” the strategists explain. “That is why Harris and Democrats cannot allow him to frame his position in that way, especially when we know their actual plans call for the deportation of all undocumented immigrants (including spouses and Dreamers).”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Complex feelings on immigration and potential deportation programs offer Democrats an opportunity to stake out more moderate ground when discussing immigration policy — and to prevent immigration opponents from defining the terms of the debate over policy. They’re also an important reminder that it can be perilous to trust top-line numbers and polling results without digging into the details, or presenting voters with more options to begin with. Recent polls all show a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, yes, but they also show that there is room for pro-immigrant candidates to shape the national debate and make a vocal case for Americans <em>and</em> immigrants.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Genocide is often referred to as the “crime of crimes,” a designation developed after the Holocaust and reserved for a very specific form of mass atrocity that deserves the highest condemnation. It should be unthinkable that Israel, home to the descendants of many Holocaust survivors, would perpetrate such a crime, and yet it has been accused —&nbsp;by <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976">human rights groups</a>, academics, and even <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/26/24051839/icj-south-africa-genocide-case-israel-gaza">South Africa</a> — of committing genocide in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those accusations aren’t new. They became more widespread shortly after Israel responded to the October 7, 2023, attack by Gaza-based militant and political group Hamas with a bombing and ground campaign that left <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142687">more than 5,000</a> dead in the first weeks of fighting. But in the year since the war in Gaza began, the question is whether the evidence supporting these claims has grown.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last October, my Vox colleague Sigal Samuel and I <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/13/23954731/genocide-israel-gaza-palestine">interviewed scholars</a> about how to think through those allegations of genocide. At that time, some were willing to definitively call what was happening in Gaza a genocide. But most were hesitant, citing the high threshold required to establish genocide under international law. Several said “crimes against humanity” or “war crimes,” which hold equal weight under international law, had likely been committed, but withheld judgment on genocide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The debate has evolved since then, along with conditions on the ground in Gaza, which is in ruins. The Palestinian death toll now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-palestinians-statistics-40000-7ebec13101f6d08fe10cedbf5e172dde">exceeds 40,000</a>. A Refugees International <a href="https://www.refugeesinternational.org/reports-briefs/untangling-the-reality-of-famine-in-gaza/">report</a> published in September found evidence of a “severe hunger crisis in Gaza and found consistent indications that famine-like conditions occurred in northern areas during the first half of 2024,” in part due to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken">Israel’s obstruction of aid deliveries</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">South Africa has brought its case accusing Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has issued <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/26/24051839/icj-south-africa-genocide-case-israel-gaza">preliminary rulings</a> ordering Israel to improve access to humanitarian aid in Gaza and to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShyWUEMJgkA">halt its operation in Rafah</a>, the enclave’s southernmost city. Israel has also <a href="https://www.vox.com/palestine/369736/west-bank-violence-jenin-raid-settler-idf-israel-gaza-hamas">tightened its grip</a> on occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank. And there is no end to the fighting in sight: <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/375125/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-iran-invasion-gaza">Long-feared regional war has now come to Lebanon</a>, and ceasefire negotiations have repeatedly stalled.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In light of those developments, I went back to the scholars we cited and spoke to last fall to see if their thinking about allegations of genocide against Israel had changed over the last year. Of the five who responded, most of them were now more confident the legal requirements for genocide had been met. If an official determination of genocide by the ICJ follows, that could have critical legal and political consequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what the scholars had to say.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How genocide is defined</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, some background: There are different ways to conceptualize genocide, but the ICJ is concerned only with its legal definition under the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf">Genocide Convention</a>, the international treaty criminalizing genocide that went into effect in 1951 and has been ratified by 153 countries, including Israel and its closest ally, the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ICJ is the judicial branch of the United Nations and handles disputes between nations, typically involving <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/list-of-all-cases">resources and borders</a>, though it has heard genocide cases in the past. It is distinct from the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes individuals accused of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity; that’s where <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/350915/icc-arrest-netanyahu-israel-sinwar-hamas-khan-prosecutor-gallant-idf-haniyeh">arrest warrants</a> for top Israeli and Hamas leaders have been sought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A nation must bring genocide charges against another at the ICJ, providing evidence that the state itself (not just certain individuals) committed genocide. The accusing nation can also petition for provisional measures before a final ruling, including an interim court order to stop the violence, though the ICJ has no means of actually enforcing such rulings. For the court to have jurisdiction, both parties generally have to be signatories of the Genocide Convention. They will then make their case to the court through written briefs and oral arguments. A final ruling often takes years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the Genocide Convention, genocide is “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”:</p>

<ul>
<li>Killing members of the group</li>



<li>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group</li>



<li>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part</li>



<li>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group</li>



<li>Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those five physical acts can be measured, but it turns out “intent to destroy” is incredibly difficult to prove — and that has been the sticking point in the debate over whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, where the physical component of the crime is already demonstrably satisfied given the overwhelming number of Palestinian civilian casualties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Intent has been central to nearly every other debate over genocide as well, and the high bar for proving intent has made international court findings of genocide rare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Only <a href="https://theconversation.com/genocide-70-years-on-three-reasons-why-the-un-convention-is-still-failing-108706">three genocides</a> have been officially recognized under the definition of the term in the Genocide Convention and led to trials in international criminal tribunals: one against Cham Muslim and ethnic Vietnamese people perpetrated by Khmer Rouge leaders in Cambodia in the 1970s, the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and the 1995 Srebrenica Massacre in Bosnia. (The Holocaust occurred before the adoption of the 1948 Convention.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">UN investigations found the mass killings of <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/08/ten-years-after-yazidi-genocide-un-syria-commission-inquiry-calls-justice">the Yazidis by ISIS</a> in Iraq and of <a href="https://www.state.gov/burma-genocide/">the Rohingya in Myanmar</a> constituted genocide. Though the US <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/05/genocide-returns-to-darfur">called</a> the killing of the Masalit and other ethnic groups in the Sudanese region of Darfur between 2003 and 2005 “genocide,” a UN investigation <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-un-has-ruled-out-genocide-darfur">ruled it was not</a>. That may have caused the conflict to extend longer than it would have if a finding of genocide had been made, and gave the Sudanese government diplomatic cover to continue its campaign, despite widespread international condemnation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Is Israel committing genocide?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the first scholars to say Israel was committing genocide was <a href="https://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/page.cfm?siteID=58&amp;pageID=11&amp;action=details">Raz Segal</a>, a professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University, who called it a “<a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/a-textbook-case-of-genocide">textbook case</a>” in Jewish Currents just days after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Ahead of the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s attack, he told me he wished he had been wrong. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I fully stand behind my description of Israel&#8217;s attack on Gaza as a ‘textbook case of genocide’ because we&#8217;re still actually seeing, nearly a year into this genocidal assault, explicit and unashamed statements of intent to destroy,” he said. “The way that intent is expressed here is absolutely unprecedented.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He said public statements by people with command authority in Israel — including state leaders, Cabinet ministers, and senior army officers — have repeatedly demonstrated genocidal intent that has been realized in the scale of the violence and destruction in Gaza. Other scholars I spoke to<strong> </strong>pointed to statements from Israeli officials last October, <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/node/203454">cited in the ICJ’s January preliminary ruling</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called for a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/9/23910159/israel-gaza-siege-palestinians-hamas-humanitarian-crisis">complete siege</a>” on Gaza and <a href="https://x.com/business/status/1749486243036193057">stated</a> “we are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly,” apparently in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/01/israel-south-africa-genocide-case-fake-quotes/677198/">reference to Hamas</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Israeli President Isaac Herzog <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-gaza-isaac-herzog_n_65295ee8e4b03ea0c004e2a8">said</a> it was “an entire nation out there that is responsible” for Hamas’s attack on Israel in reference to Palestinians.&nbsp;</li>



<li>And Israel Katz, former Israeli minister of energy and infrastructure, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/12/no-electric-switch-will-be-turned-on-until-captives-free-israel-says">vowed</a> “no electric switch will be turned on, no water tap will be opened and no fuel truck” would enter Gaza until Hamas returned its Israeli hostages, suggesting Palestinians would face collective punishment.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several other scholars who Vox spoke with last fall, at that point reluctant to say Israel was committing genocide as defined by the Genocide Convention, now appear to agree with Segal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Any early hesitation I had about applying the &#8216;genocide&#8217; label to the Israeli attack on Gaza has dissipated over the past year of human slaughter and the obliteration of homes, infrastructure, and communities,” said <a href="https://epp.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/adam-jones/">Adam Jones</a>, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia who has written a textbook on genocide. “There is plenty of this demonization and dehumanization on the other side as well, but whatever peace constituency existed in Israel seems to have vanished, and there is a growing consensus for genocidal war, mass population transfer, and long-term eradication of Palestinian culture and identity.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among other things, Jones noted Israeli leadership’s recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/middleeast/netanyahu-gaza-hamas-expulsions-plan-intl/index.html">plans to expel the entire remaining civilian population of northern Gaza</a> and turn the territory into a military zone where no aid would be allowed as influencing his thinking on the issue. There is no indication of whether civilians would ever be allowed to return. This could be taken as an example of the kind of “state or organizational plan or policy” necessary to prove genocidal intent, he said. Though the plan, if it has been implemented, has not yet been seen to completion, it can still serve as evidence of intent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://kroc.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/ernesto-verdeja/">Ernesto Verdeja</a>, a professor of political science and peace studies at the University of Notre Dame, said it could be “called a genocide, even in a narrow legal sense, for several months now” given the accumulation of Israeli attacks clearly and consistently targeting the civilian population in Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A major tipping point for Verdeja and many other human rights experts was Israel’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/5/6/24150729/israel-rafah-hamas-ceasefire-gaza-cairo-khan-younis-idf-gallant-netanyahu">ground offensive in Rafah</a> in May. The Israeli military had been pushing civilians increasingly into the southern city, which connects Gaza and Egypt, telling them it was a safe zone while it pursued Hamas to the north. But by August, an estimated <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/08/27/satellite-imagery-shows-vast-destruction-in-rafah/">44 percent of all buildings in Rafah</a> had been damaged or destroyed in heavy bombing. Israeli forces took over and shut down the Rafah border crossing, limiting the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. They <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877">killed civilians camping in tents</a> in a humanitarian zone. When the ICJ ordered Israel to stop its offensive in Rafah, Israeli officials <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl/index.html">condemned the ruling</a> and said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-icj-order-halt-rafah-offensive-what-next-rcna154102">it was open to interpretation</a>, despite the fact that many human rights lawyers argued it was unambiguous. The assault on Rafah <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-icj-order-halt-rafah-offensive-what-next-rcna154102">continued</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I wouldn&#8217;t say [Rafah was] necessarily the defining moment, but I think it&#8217;s indicative of a broader pattern where we see a genocidal campaign really crystallizing,” Verdeja said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.tcd.ie/law/people/beckerma">Michael Becker</a>, a professor of international human rights law at Trinity College, Dublin, said, overall, the above incidents and others mean<strong> </strong>“South Africa has an ever-expanding repository of evidence that it can put before the [ICJ] as further evidence of genocidal intent,” which includes evidence suggesting Israel “has not meaningfully sought to comply” with the ICJ’s orders so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some scholars still disagree. <a href="https://www.international.ucla.edu/israel/person/2520">Dov Waxman</a>, a professor of political science and Israel studies and the director of the UCLA Y&amp;S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies, <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/letters/on-a-textbook-case-of-genocide">wrote</a> last year in response to Segal’s piece in Jewish Currents that accusing Israel of genocide required “stretching the concept too far, emptying it of any meaning.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Waxman has since qualified his stance, but still believes “Israel&#8217;s actions in the Gaza Strip — though too often brutal, inhumane, and indiscriminate — do not meet the international legal criteria of the crime of genocide.” He told me that he “can understand why many regard those actions as genocidal” given the extent of the death and destruction in Gaza and the “bellicose and extreme rhetoric of some Israeli officials, including senior government ministers, can be characterized as potentially genocidal because of the way Palestinians are dehumanized.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But he still finds evidence of the requisite “intent to destroy” lacking. He said “a few horrendous public statements” made by Israeli politicians serve as only “quite limited and weak” support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Based on my understanding of the motives behind the Israeli government&#8217;s actions, I do not think there is an intent to commit genocide,” Waxman said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the scholars we cited in our previous story, he was the only one who responded to my request for new comment who still did not think Israel’s actions qualify as genocide.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Does it matter if the ICJ calls it genocide?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question is how much calling Israel’s incursion in Gaza genocide will make any practical difference. It will not reverse the death and destruction. The ICJ has no means of stopping the Israeli government even if the court eventually finds it guilty of genocide. That ruling may be years away, and the ICJ’s rulings against other countries have been previously ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the word “genocide” carries a certain weight in the public consciousness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I do think it is really important, simply because of the symbolic status of genocide,” Verdeja said. “To be guilty of genocide is, at least in public discourse and also in terms of just global politics, something that&#8217;s such a strong condemnation that it really signals the barbarity of the Israeli state’s policy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such condemnation could lead to significant political changes: Should the ICJ find Israel did commit genocide, that could limit the degree to which the US and its allies can continue to support Israel, Verdeja added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, it’s unclear how the ICJ will rule. And even if it does not issue a finding of genocide, that does not preclude the international community from taking action to stop what’s unfolding in Gaza, Segal said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don&#8217;t think we have to sit on our hands and wait for these institutes to tell us yes or no genocide when we all see genocide in front of our eyes,” Segal said. “The process of radical change in the system has already begun. Israel is very isolated today in the world, and the US is also isolated.”</p>

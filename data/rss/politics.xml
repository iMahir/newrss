<p class="has-text-align-none">In an extremely normal turn of events, a far-right magazine recently published an essay consisting entirely of edited passages from <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American Reformer is a prominent evangelical magazine —&nbsp;one whose politics are extreme enough that calling it “Christian nationalist” might be a bit mild. Its co-founder, Josh Abbotoy, once called for an authoritarian to seize power —&nbsp;a “<a href="https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2023/10/is-a-protestant-franco-inevitable">protestant Franco</a>,” as he put it — in order to “reestablish order” in America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, we learned the magazine had been the victim of a prank. James Lindsay, a prominent right-wing pundit, had submitted the aforementioned adaptation of Marx and Engels’s work and gotten it published. The essay’s publication, per Lindsay, is proof that the far right is <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2024/12/a-communist-manifesto-for-christian-nationalists-testing-the-woke-right/">basically the same as the far left</a>: that it is, in his words, part of a “woke right” corrupting conservatism from within.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Manifesto</em> prank was fairly silly, as is the “woke right” concept in general. But it points to something bigger and more important: a struggle over what exactly the Trumpist revolution in conservative politics is supposed to accomplish, and how philosophically ambitious its war on the American status quo ought to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fundamentally, this a version of the same fight the right has been having since Donald Trump entered the Republican primary back in 2015: What defines “true conservatism?” Yet the difference is that Lindsay, American Reformer, and almost all of the other right-wingers who eventually weighed in on this are all Trump supporters. This is less about whether Trumpism should be the reigning ideology of the right than about what Trumpism actually stands for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the tensions between the sides here show just how unstable the Trump coalition truly is&nbsp;—&nbsp;and how divided it may become when forced to make actual choices while in power.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Anatomy of a hoax</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Lindsay revealed the hoax <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2024/12/a-communist-manifesto-for-christian-nationalists-testing-the-woke-right/">in a December 3 essay</a>, he made the stakes plain: His aim was to vindicate the concept that his enemies inside the broader right-wing tent are best described as “the woke right.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These enemies include, broadly speaking, a series of radical right-wing factions of a more religious or collectivist bent, such as Protestant Christian nationalists, Catholic integralists, and white nationalists. Lindsay believes that they threaten the American project in much the same way as the left — treating citizens not as individuals but as groups to be pitted against each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calling something “woke” on the right is to delegitimize it. And Lindsay wanted proof that his enemies deserved the insult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I suspected that the so-called Woke Right really is Woke; many people disagreed; and I wanted to test that hypothesis instead of arguing about it to very little effect,” he writes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So he picked a prominent target — American Reformer is a well-known magazine on the Protestant far-right —&nbsp;and got it to publish an adapted version of what Lindsay considers the most “woke” text in history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I figured there’s nothing more definitively Woke than the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, so I think we can … get on with calling them the Woke Right after this,” <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2024/12/a-communist-manifesto-for-christian-nationalists-testing-the-woke-right/">he writes</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, <em>The</em> <em>Communist Manifesto</em> was written nearly 200 years before the word “woke” came into wide use. And many modern Marxists are deeply opposed to the social justice left, which they see as a form of shallow identity politics that distracts from the more fundamental class struggle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Lindsay, like many on the right, deeply believes that “wokeness” is a species of communism (he wrote <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/03/james-lindsay-race-marxism-book-review-crt-liberalism">a bestselling book titled <em>Race Marxism</em></a>). This is because he sees them as structurally<em> </em>similar doctrines, in that both define society by antagonisms between oppressed and oppressor groups. Lindsay terms Christian nationalism a “woke right” doctrine because it sees the world in a similar fashion. The only real difference, he claims, is who they treat as the oppressed and the oppressor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The edits to the <em>Manifesto</em> are designed to underscore this point — to show how easy it is to take a left-wing worldview focusing on group conflict and restructure it to fit the Christian nationalist narrative of a white Christian uprising and liberalism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like much of Lindsay’s output, this claim is more than a little simplistic. Take his adaptation of the <em>Manifesto</em>’s <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/comninel/courses/4090pdf/manifest.pdf">famous preamble</a> about the “specter” of communism “haunting Europe”:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">A rising spirit is haunting America: the spirit of a true Christian Right. Moreover, all the existing powers of the American Regime since the end of the Second World War have aligned themselves against it and its re-emergence from the shadows of American civic life, politics, and religion—the Marxist Left and its neo-Marxist “Woke” descendant, the liberal establishment, the neoconservatives, and their police and intelligence apparatuses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure, the texts are similar: Both argue that the status quo political establishment is aligned against an insurgent alternative. But any ideology that sees itself to be the enemy of the political status quo will make such claims. When you swap out enough nouns, the actual meaning of the text changes so much that it’s hard to say the ideas remain all that similar.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why the hoax matters</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the problems with Lindsay’s approach, it generated a huge response among online conservatives — with <a href="https://x.com/KonstantinKisin/status/1865824554737676465">prominent</a> <a href="https://x.com/L0m3z/status/1865927727318179934">voices</a> <a href="https://x.com/Cernovich/status/1864162335277109332">weighing</a> <a href="https://x.com/PerfInjust/status/1864118724933935588">in on</a> <a href="https://x.com/SwipeWright/status/1866131339763675645">both</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/oHgdX4jp__8">sides</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chris Rufo, the right’s leading anti-woke activist, argued that Lindsay and his allies were expanding the word “woke” beyond any reasonable definition. “There is nothing necessarily ‘woke’ about identity, grievance, and oppression, which are universal concepts in politics. America&#8217;s founders, for example, completed their revolution using those concepts,” <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1865106113638863180">he wrote</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seth Dillon, founder of the Babylon Bee, responded with a defense of Lindsay’s position.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Wokeness doesn&#8217;t accurately identify legitimate, real-world oppression—it points instead to intangible, unfalsifiable, elusive ‘systemic’ oppression and calls for deconstruction or revolution on a false premise,” <a href="https://x.com/SethDillon/status/1865218563834831336">he wrote</a>. “There are some clear examples of this on the right, and saying so doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re expanding the definition of ‘wokeness’ so broadly that it would apply even to a justified revolution.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dillon’s comment is revealing because it points to the real stakes of the “woke right” debate. His definition of “woke” —&nbsp;basically any revolutionary movement whose aims he doesn’t agree with — is less a rigorous intellectual argument than an effort at boundary policing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the Trump era, the right is self-consciously revolutionary. It believes that the American political status quo is rotten, and that some kind of transformative political change is necessary in order to save America from a vicious, dangerous left.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are profound disagreements over just how far the right-wing revolution should go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like Lindsay still describe themselves as liberals in the philosophical sense, committed to limited government and individual rights. For them, the Trump movement is about defending the founders’ values against an overreaching left (even if the means they employ in this fight are themselves illiberal). By contrast, the “woke right” they oppose are all avowed opponents of philosophical liberalism. Protestant Christian nationalism, integralist Catholicism, white nationalism — all of these doctrines see Trump as the tip of a revolutionary spear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet merely labeling these factions “illiberal” carries little weight on the modern Trumpy right. Therefore, Trump-aligned liberals have to reach for a nastier term —&nbsp;one hated by everyone on the right —&nbsp;to try and push their foes out of the coalition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hence, “woke right.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I would expect this kind of infighting to get more intense, not less, as Trump returns to government. Governing requires policy choices, and policy choices have a way of forcing these kinds of fundamental splits to the fore. So while the American Reformer hoax may be a silly, low-stakes affair, it points to some fairly fundamental divides in the broad-tent Trump coalition —&nbsp;ones that will only assume more significance in the coming years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has been talking for years about pardoning the people who took part in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and he could do so on day one of his second term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a March <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112079753989223875">post</a> on his social media network Truth Social, he said he would “Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/01/donald-trump-pardons-january-6-us-capitol-attack">In 2022</a>, Trump promised full pardons and apologies, and claimed he was financially supporting people associated with the insurrection. All that culminated last weekend when, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8SoMbuPidE">NBC News’s Kristen Welker,</a> Trump again said that he may pardon people who had been convicted of crimes related to the insurrection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those pardons would be well within the president’s powers. And they would be a remarkable victory for a collection of groups that have spent the last few years agitating for them. They would also provide Trump with a political win, allowing him to simultaneously reward some of his most fervent supporters while also undermining a legal system he has long claimed is unjust.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who are the insurrectionists? What charges do they face?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are roughly 1,500 arrested, charged, or imprisoned January 6 insurrectionists, and among their number are all sorts of people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The January 6 defendants aren’t just hard-boiled leaders of militant groups; the insurrectionists included an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/g-s1-30586/bobs-burgers-actor-sentenced-prison-capitol-riot#:~:text=Trump's%20Terms-,Former%20'Bob's%20Burgers'%20actor%20sentenced%20to%201%20year%20in%20prison,6.">actor</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/gym-owner-pleads-guilty-to-assaulting-officer-in-jan-6-riot">small-business owners</a>, and even a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/jan-6-rioter-known-as-qanon-shaman-sentenced-to-41-months">self-proclaimed shaman</a>, many of whom voiced a belief in conspiracy theories. However, some of the January 6 insurrectionists were affiliated with a variety of radical anti-government movements, most notably the <a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/publication/extremist-groupmovement-affiliations-january-6-capitol-rioters">Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers</a>, right-wing paramilitary groups <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys">recognized as hate groups</a> by the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/oath-keepers">Southern Poverty Law Center.</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those convicted have been found guilty of a range of crimes, from low-level offenses like trespassing or property damage to grave offenses like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/25/23737575/oath-keepers-sentencing-conviction-january-6-insurrection-capitol-attack-riot">seditious conspiracy.</a>   </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did pardoning the insurrectionists become a cause for those on the far right?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The push for freeing insurrectionists has its roots in the false assertion, popularized by Trump, that the 2020 presidential election was rigged. That false claim, based on a variety of conspiracy theories, asserts that the 2020 election was improper; thus the insurrectionists were justified in taking action. Furthermore, the insurrectionists’ supporters claim, Justice Department investigations into Trump show that it is weaponized against those on the right, and that makes the prosecution against insurrectionists improper and invalid. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has encouraged this line of thinking, repeatedly claiming that the DOJ is being weaponized against him and his supporters, often saying, as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-deliver-fiery-post-indictment-speech-georgia-rcna88561">he did following an indictment</a>, “They&#8217;re coming after you — and I&#8217;m just standing in their way.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the trials of insurrectionists unfolded, several groups began to work to draw attention to the trials and recast them as persecution. One leader of these efforts is Micki Witthoeft, the mother of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ashli-babbitt-capitol-siege-a15c7e52a04d932972b7a284c7a8f7df">Ashli Babbit</a>t, a woman shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer during the insurrection. (The officer was investigated by the DOJ; he was cleared of any wrongdoing.) Witthoeft moved to Washington, DC, from San Diego to support January 6 defendants and hold vigils in support of the cause.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/20/donald-trump-jan-6-hostages-campaign/73023337007/">supported the narrative</a> that January 6 defendants are the victims, with Babbitt cast as a martyr and the convicted as <a href="https://stophate.com/january-6">“political prisoners</a>.” To be clear, they’re in prison not for expressing political beliefs but for interfering with the political process, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/proud-boys-biggs-pardon.html">committing serious violence, and other crimes</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, there is a constellation of pro-insurrectionist groups, like Justice for January 6 (J4J6), <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/trump-january-6-rioters-pardons/index.html">American Patriot Relief, J6 Pardon Project,</a> and <a href="http://stophate.com">stophate.com,</a> all of which have called for pardons. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/proud-boys-biggs-pardon.html">Proud Boys leadership</a> has requested clemency, and a slew of other groups and individuals associated with the January 6 insurrectionists have asked for pardons, too. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens if Trump does pardon the insurrectionists?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A pardon would help validate two arguments that Trump has made: that the Justice Department was weaponized against him and his supporters and that the 2020 election was “rigged.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would also help to fully bring the insurrectionists — many of whom are aligned with the far right — into the GOP fold.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think we can look at the movement behind the pardoning, the desire for those individuals to be pardoned, as part and parcel of the mainstreaming of the extremist elements that comprised the Stop the Steal movement now becoming a centralized part of a mainstream political party in the United States,” Matthew Kriner, managing director of the Accelerationism Research Consortium (ARC) at Middlebury Institute, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">January 6 insurrectionists have already started <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/05/jan-6-protesters-run-for-office-526545">running for office themselves</a>, and once freed, those now imprisoned could join their number. Groups like <a href="https://lookaheadamerica.org/j6questionproject/">Look Ahead America</a> are not only advocating on behalf of January 6 defendants, but also engaging in <a href="https://lookaheadamerica.org/about/">political organizing</a>, including voter registration, turnout, and lobbying efforts — all on behalf of the Republican Party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pardoned insurrectionists could also go back to the groups that radicalized them in the first place. Some of these groups, like the Oath Keepers, have essentially collapsed following the imprisonment of their leaders, but right-wing antigovernment groups are still plenty active in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A pardon would mean that some of the more extreme insurrectionists could see themselves as having been “given a permission structure to use politically motivated violence,” Kriner said. It’s “a clean slate for them to come back and essentially pick right back up where they were before.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>A Vox reader asks: There is a perception in the United States that Republicans do a better job supervising the economy, but is this true in fact?</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the 2024 election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/elections/trump-harris-economy-poll.html">polls showed </a><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/elections/trump-harris-economy-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters believed</a></span> President-elect Donald Trump would be better for the economy than President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris. That sentiment often repeats in many election cycles because <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50605-which-issues-americans-think-democratic-and-republican-parties-handle-better-poll">Americans tend to think</a> Republicans are better at handling the economy than Democrats. In 2012, for example, polls showed that voters <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/voters-trust-romney-obama-economy-2012-4">trusted Mitt Romney</a> more on the economy than <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/poll-romney-has-economic-advantage-obamas-fairness-message-resonates-flna910335">Barack Obama</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a lot of reasons why voters would think this. Republicans have a long history of branding themselves as the pro-business party that will cut taxes and eliminate red tape. Meanwhile, Democrats run on strengthening regulations, and even though those can be popular proposals (like, say, raising the minimum wage), voters get concerned that those policies will hinder business.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s a disconnect between how voters feel about Republicans’ management of the economy and the historical record. Since World War II, <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/historical-puzzle-us-economic-performance-under-democrats-vs-republicans">there’s been a consistent pattern</a> of the economy faring better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones. More jobs have been created under Democrats, for example, who also saw higher rates of GDP growth. And economic downturns tend to happen under Republicans: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/investing/stock-market-election-trump-biden/index.html">Ten of the last 11 recessions</a> started under a Republican administration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do the numbers say?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First things first: The economy has expanded more under Democrats than Republicans. Since 1945, Democratic presidents oversaw, on average, 4.1 percent annual GDP growth, whereas Republican administrations had an average GDP growth rate of 2.5 percent, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/investing/stock-market-election-trump-biden/index.html">according to CFRA Research</a>, an investment research firm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to job creation, both Biden and Harris highlighted Trump’s poor record: During his first term, the United States lost more jobs than it had gained — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/08/trump-jobs-record/">the worst jobs record</a> of any president in modern history. In Trump’s defense, the Covid pandemic, a once-in-a-century kind of event, is the reason so many jobs were gone by the time he left office. But while Trump can point to Covid as the reason for his bad performance, the truth is that Republicans still have a significantly worse jobs record than Democrats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Going back to President Harry Truman, Democrats have added more than twice the amount of jobs as Republicans (70.5 million jobs under Democrats compared to 29.1 million under Republicans), <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/bidens-claim-that-trump-will-be-first-president-with-negative-jobs-record/">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even the stock market — which, it should be noted, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2024/01/24/its-normal-that-the-stock-market-and-economy-are-on-different-pages/">does not always reflect</a> the actual health of the economy — has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/investing/stock-market-election-trump-biden/index.html">performed better</a> under Democratic leadership. According to CFRA Research, the S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/investing/stock-market-election-trump-biden/index.html">saw an average annual gain of 11.2 percent</a> under Democrats and 6.9 percent under Republicans since 1945.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inflation is a more complicated story: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/21/inflation-better-republicans-vs-democrats-presidents/73044054007/">According to the American Economic Association</a>, the inflation rates were, on average, lower under Democrats than Republicans from 1945 to 2016. But while that might make it seem like Democrats have a better record, researchers found that inflation rises under Democrats and falls under Republicans. More than that, two presidents are now remembered for unusually high inflationary periods: Biden and Jimmy Carter, both Democrats.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are the numbers just a coincidence?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might think it’s hard to argue with numbers. When you look at the past 80 years, it’s clear that the economy has performed better when Democrats are in the White House. But the reality is that it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why that is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Even those of us who believe that Democrats may have pursued better policies than Republicans, overall, have a hard time explaining the big observed gap in performance,” <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/historical-puzzle-us-economic-performance-under-democrats-vs-republicans">writes Jeffrey Frankel</a>, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who served on President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. “After all, many other powerful and unpredictable factors impact the economy, often dwarfing the effect of any policy levers that the president can control.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other experts agree. Economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, who dug into economic performance under different presidents, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140913">found that the reason</a> the economy has done better during Democratic tenures has less to do with specific fiscal or monetary policies and more to do with factors that presidents have little control over, including oil shocks, consumer sentiments, and the global economic environment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean that economic policies don’t matter. But policies sometimes take years to have an impact and their effects might only be felt well beyond a specific presidency. And when expansions or recessions happen, it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly what went right (or wrong) and when.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when it comes to the numbers, the verdict is clear. And back in 2004, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k2og1ZmZhw">even Trump agreed</a>: “It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

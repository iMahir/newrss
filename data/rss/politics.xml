to areas in northern Israel that were evacuated after attacks by Hezbollah in Lebanon; US secretary of state heads to Cairo, his 10th visit to region since war began</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war">See all our Israel-Gaza war coverage</a></li></ul><p>Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.</p><p>Israel has expanded its stated goals of the war to include enabling residents to return to communities in northern Israel that have been evacuated due to attacks by Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p><strong>Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has said the Palestinian militant group had the resources to sustain its fight against Israel</strong>, with support from Iran-backed regional allies. In a letter to the group’s Yemeni allies, the Houthis, he said “we have prepared ourselves to fight a long war of attrition … our combined efforts with you” and with groups in Lebanon and Iraq “will break this enemy and inflict defeat on it”.</p><p><strong>Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes killed 16 people in the Gaza Strip on Monday</strong>, including five women and four children. A strike flattened a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 10 people there, according to officials at the Awda hospital, which received the bodies. Another strike on a home in Gaza City killed six people, according to the civil defence first responders.</p><p><strong>UN secretary general António Guterres has said that “nothing justifies” the collective punishment of the Palestinian people</strong>. “We all condemn the terror attacks made by Hamas, as well as the taking of the hostages, that is an absolute violation of international humanitarian law,” he said, before adding “the truth is that nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that is what we are witnessing in a dramatic way in Gaza”.</p><p><strong>Osama Hamdan,</strong> <strong>a senior Hamas official, told Agence France-Presse that new generations of fighters have been recruited since the 7 October attacks. </strong></p><p><strong>Polio vaccination coverage in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> has reached 90%, the head of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency said on Monday, adding that the next step was to ensure hundreds of thousands of children got a second dose at the end of the month. </strong>The campaign, which began on 1 September, aims to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza under 10 years of age against polio.</p><p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to New York on 24 September, </strong>the first day of the high-level general debate by world leaders at the annual UN general assembly, his office has said. It said the Israeli prime minister is scheduled to stay until 28 September in the US, which he had visited in July for official talks and a congressional address.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/17/middle-east-crisis-live-netanyahu-expands-gaza-war-aims-blinken-heads-to-egypt">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/17/middle-east-crisis-live-netanyahu-expands-gaza-war-aims-blinken-heads-to-egypt</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/17/middle-east-crisis-live-netanyahu-expands-gaza-war-aims-blinken-heads-to-egypt</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 07:22:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Man who appeared intent on killing Trump wrote a book urging Iran to assassinate the ex-president]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/man-accused-trying-kill-trump-134644431.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/man-accused-trying-kill-trump-134644431.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 13:46:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[White House condemns 'irresponsible' Elon Musk post on assassination attempt]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-condemns-irresponsible-elon-155300161.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-condemns-irresponsible-elon-155300161.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 15:53:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

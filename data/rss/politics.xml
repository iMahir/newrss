<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris lost the presidential election and Democrats lost control of the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when you zoom in on the details of that result, there’s a striking pattern: Democratic Senate candidates are outperforming Harris. Or, put another way, Republican Senate candidates are doing worse than Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the outcome of a state’s US Senate race has increasingly matched the outcome of its simultaneous presidential race. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/17/13666192/voting-congress-presidency">Ticket-splitting</a> has decreased in our era of polarization and partisanship. The vast majority of people voting for a presidential candidate also vote for their party’s Senate candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But not everyone does that. And there’s still some variation in how much better or worse Senate candidates do compared to the top of the ticket. Looking at that variation can provide clues about what sorts of candidates overperform (even if they don’t actually win).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It can also help shape our understanding of national trends. Was there a nationwide backlash against all Democrats? Or was the backlash mostly limited to the presidential candidate?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Republican Senate candidates overperformed Trump in <a href="https://x.com/awprokop/status/1324406190533738497">most swing states</a>, suggesting that Trump was a drag on the GOP. This year, Democratic Senate candidates overperformed Harris in almost every key race — though often it wasn’t by enough for Democrats to win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how the Senate candidates in key races performed compared to Harris. The counts aren’t yet finalized so the margins are subject to change, but this is <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/">how things looked</a> as of early Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nebraska</strong>: Independent Dan Osborn’s vote share is about 7 points higher than Harris, but he lost.</li>



<li><strong>Montana</strong>: Sen. Jon Tester’s vote share is also about 7 points higher than Harris. He also lost.</li>



<li><strong>Ohio:</strong> Sen. Sherrod Brown’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris. He lost.</li>



<li><strong>Arizona</strong>: Rep. Ruben Gallego’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris and he’s currently leading even though Harris seems on track to lose there.</li>



<li><strong>Texas</strong>: Rep. Colin Allred’s vote share is about 3 points higher than Harris, but he failed to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz.</li>



<li><strong>Nevada</strong>: Sen. Jacky Rosen’s vote share was about 2 points higher than Harris. Her race is too close to call.</li>



<li><strong>Wisconsin: </strong>Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s vote share was less than 1 point higher than Harris’s, but Baldwin defeated her challenger, Eric Hovde, while Harris lost the state.</li>



<li><strong>Michigan and Pennsylvania</strong>: Both Democratic Senate candidates in these states (Rep. Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Sen. Bob Casey) have vote shares about 1 point higher than Harris’s. Neither race has been called.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pattern was also evident in less competitive races like Minnesota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Virginia, where Democratic Senate candidates outperformed Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One notable exception to Tuesday’s down-ballot overperformance trend was Florida, where Debbie Mucarsel-Powell did about the same as Harris (and lost). There’s also Maryland, where Angela Alsobrooks won but did significantly worse than Harris — but that has an obvious explanation in that the state’s popular former governor, Larry Hogan, was the Republican Senate nominee (though his popularity wasn’t enough to power him to a win in an otherwise blue state).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why were there so many voters casting their ballots for Trump and Democratic Senate candidates?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some might argue for racism or sexism explaining Harris’s struggles, but I’d note that several of the Democratic candidates who overperformed Harris were nonwhite or female. Others might argue that she was a uniquely flawed candidate or campaigner, but President Joe Biden was on track to do much worse if he’d stayed in the race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My suspicion is that Harris’s electoral struggles were more about Biden’s unpopularity and her association with his administration than any newfound love of the American public for the Republican Party generally. (This is also reflected in the House of Representatives contest currently looking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html">somewhat close</a> and in Democratic success at the state level in <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/11/06/nc-democrats-break-gop-legislative-supermajority">places like North Carolina</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call them the “I don’t like Republicans much, but the economy was better under Trump” voters. Biden lost them, and Harris failed to get them back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1992, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/17983746/year-of-the-woman-1992">voters sent a record number of women to Congress</a>, leading the media and political scientists to call it the “Year of the Woman.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the final votes are counted in the 2024 election, we might have a new way of referring to the 2024 election: The Year of the Man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exit-polls-2024-men-women-voting-key-swing/story?id=115529817" data-type="link" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exit-polls-2024-men-women-voting-key-swing/story?id=115529817">won men by 10 points this year</a>, according to early exit polls, a result that could change once the final votes are tallied. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, seemed to win women by 10 points — but if the exit polls are correct, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/">she lost ground with women compared to Biden’s 2020 results</a>. The exit polls also suggest a rightward shift for <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/20">Latino men</a>. In marshaling men’s votes, and holding on to a slim majority of white women, Trump was able to overcome his weaknesses with the broader swath of female voters and build a dominant lead, allowing him to decisively capture the presidency. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exit polls are notoriously unreliable, and it will likely be days before we have a clear sense of how Trump won. But there’s no denying that Trump tailored his campaign to appeal to men. Trump spent the months leading up to Election Day engaging in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/09/trump-bro-vote-hawk-tuah-girl-00183129">intense outreach to male voters,</a> appearing on podcasts and doing interviews with influential media figures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">Logan Paul,</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368563/theo-von-trump-interview-podcast">Theo Von</a>. He portrayed himself as a strong leader capable of restoring the nation’s lost glory — returning it, in other words, to a time when men were undisputedly at the top of the social hierarchy. After a man <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371981/trump-shooting-ryan-wesley-routh-golf-club">attempted to assassinate</a> the former president at a rally this summer in Pennsylvania, Trump stood defiantly with blood on his face and his fist raised in the air, projecting an air of strength that was praised as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/360711/trump-fist-pump-photo-explained-expert-media-savvy-politics">iconic</a>. Throughout the campaign, Trump demonstrated the aggressiveness that has defined his life in the public arena, relentlessly attacking his Democratic opposition, the media, and anyone he deemed insufficiently supportive. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump specifically sought to get <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-young-men.html">young men of all races</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/opinion/gender-education-gap.html">men without a college education</a> to the polls. It was a risky strategy because the voters Trump was seeking have historically been among the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hunts-elusive-2024-election-prize-infrequent-voters-2024-09-09/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hunts-elusive-2024-election-prize-infrequent-voters-2024-09-09/">most difficult to mobilize</a>. But in appealing to them, Trump hoped to pull off another win <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/upshot/why-trump-won-working-class-whites.html">similar to that of 2016</a>, when he won men by 11 points. In 2020, Biden was able to defeat Trump in part by erasing his large advantage with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">male voters.</a> This year, it seems, Trump won men back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many reasons why male voters have been dissatisfied in recent years and might have been receptive to his messaging. Inflation has made the cost of living <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/09/why-more-americans-are-struggling-even-as-inflation-cools.html">painful for millions of people</a> post-pandemic. Men are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/boys-left-behind-education-gender-gaps-across-the-us/">falling behind women in education</a>. Their wages are<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/04/1133586707/boys-men-labor-force-jobs-gender-gap-workforce"> stagnating</a> or declining as women’s wages grow, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/21/why-more-men-are-dropping-out-of-the-workforce.html">fewer of them</a> are working. They are struggling with an <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/01/01/why-men-are-lonelier-in-america-than-elsewhere?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;utm_source=google&amp;ppccampaignID=18151738051&amp;ppcadID=&amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxKy5BhBbEiwAYiW--1KIlPZ7kQLGxTAZAqP3a1sDZF_CIJWjBZE4KG4Xq77D2MihvaaOaBoCKWcQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">epidemic of loneliness</a> that doesn’t seem to be affecting women the same way. Feminism has gone mainstream, making some men feel like they aren’t as valued.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What lessons should women take from this election? The polls leading up to the election showed a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380132/gender-gap-election-harris-trump">massive gender gap</a>, with women preferring Kamala Harris by double digits and men preferring Donald Trump by the same. Since 1980, female voters have preferred Democrats, and in general, <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout">they have registered and voted in greater numbers than men</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s struggles with women were largely of his own creation. As a candidate in 2016, he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/3/21544482/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations">accused by multiple women of sexual assault</a>, and was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13205842/trump-secret-recording-women">caught on tape</a> bragging about sexual assault. It wasn’t enough to dissuade voters from electing him. As president, he appointed the Supreme Court justices who helped <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-was-able-kill-roe-v-wade-rcna84897">overturn federally protected abortion rights</a>. Now, there are abortion bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html">in more than 20</a> US states, including some that don’t make an exception for victims of rape and incest. Last year, Trump was found <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db">legally liable </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/">for rape.</a> He has repeatedly criticized women he doesn’t like, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/trump-nancy-pelosi-liz-cheney-women.html">including Kamala Harris and Rep. Nancy Pelosi</a>, in crude, sexist, and vulgar terms. In the days leading up to the election, recordings of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/382550/jeffrey-epstein-tapes-donald-trump-friendship">convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein calling Trump his closest friend</a> became public.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of it was enough to convince voters not to give him another shot at the most important job in the country. It seems that his winning coalition included white women, a majority of whom voted for Donald Trump in 2024, according to exit polls, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">just as they did four years ago</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a very real moment, it looked as though female voters, as a broader, multiracial group, might help send a Democrat to the White House, like they did in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, it wasn’t enough. American voters have now twice chosen Trump over eminently qualified women.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Trump won, women took to the streets in a historic protest. In the next election cycle, the United States <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18024742/midterm-results-record-women-win">elected more women to Congress than ever before</a>. That helped pave the way for a new generation of women leaders, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/elections/female-candidates-president.html">the six women who ran for president as Democrats</a> in 2020. It’s possible that will happen again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, it will take several more days to tally the final votes, and figure out what they mean. But one conclusion seems obvious. Donald Trump ran a campaign geared toward dissatisfied men. It worked.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election was powered by a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382807/trump-leading-harris-2024-electoral-college">remarkably consistent nationwide trend</a> of voters turning against the Democratic ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris performed worse than President Joe Biden did in 2020 nearly everywhere: in big cities and rural areas, in blue states and red ones.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the conventional explanations for why a campaign fails —&nbsp;things like messaging choices, or whether candidates campaigned enough in the right places — <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/">cannot account for such a sweeping shift</a>. Such factors matter on the margins and among specific demographic groups, but Harris received a decisive, across-the-board rebuke.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To explain what truly happened, we need to look at global trends as a point of comparison. And when we do, a clear picture emerges: What happened on Tuesday is part of a worldwide wave of anti-incumbent sentiment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 was the largest year of elections in global history; more people voted this year than ever before. And across the world, voters told the party in power —&nbsp;regardless of their ideology or history — that it was time for a change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We saw this anti-incumbent wave in elections in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359363/uk-french-election-results-2024-britain-england-france-biden">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-its-majority-this-weeks-election-mmegi-newspaper-2024-11-01/">Botswana</a>; in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353785/india-election-2024-modi-bjp">India</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/north-macedonia-parliament-approves-new-nationalist-dominated-government-2024-06-23/">North Macedonia</a>; and in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-koreas-2024-general-election-results-and-implications">South Korea</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355328/south-africa-apartheid-cyril-ramaphosa-anc-jacob-zuma-mk-elecitons-parliament">South Africa</a>. It continued a global trend begun in the previous year, when voters in <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/poland-democracy-wins/">Poland</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/17/24003970/argentina-president-javier-milei">Argentina</a> opted to move on from current leadership. The handful of 2024 exceptions to this general rule look like true outliers: The incumbent party’s victory in Mexico, for example, came after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-democracy-polarization-unhappy-719d47908aca0b421ff3b9bef33e350c">20 straight defeats for incumbents across Latin America</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given Trump’s victory, we can confidently say the United States is not exceptional. Three different <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2024-exit-polls-fears-american-democracy-economic-discontent/story?id=115529546">exit polls</a> found that at least <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/exit-poll-results-72-americans-unhappy-way-us-going-1980904">70 percent</a> of Americans were <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/election-exit-poll-seven-in-10-voters-say-us-going-in-wrong-direction/">dissatisfied</a> with the country’s current direction, and they took it out on the current ruling party. (While exit polls are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/exit-polls-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X04.ZwKX.5orIonRhVE1e&amp;smid=url-share">based on preliminary, rather than comprehensive, data</a> sets, it is notable that so many polls appear to be picking up on the same trend.) Trump registered as the change candidate despite being a former president himself, and the voters rewarded him accordingly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once we start thinking about the US election result as part of a global trend, rather than an isolated event, we can start to make a little more sense of what just happened here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why you can’t understand Trump’s victory without the global trend</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reading the American press today, you see a lot of focus on granular campaign choices. Did Harris lose because she <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14048557/Democratic-Party-blame-game-Kamala-Harris-election-loss-Joe-Biden-Tim-Walz.html">picked the wrong vice president</a>? Emphasized <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380750/harris-trump-closing-message-fascism-democracy-authoritarianism">the wrong issues</a>? Targeted <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/11/harris-trump-election-messaging-populism-elites">the wrong kinds of voters</a>? Appeared on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/kamala-harris-election-loss-joe-rogan-podcast/">the wrong kind of media</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps one of these theories will prove to have merit. We don’t have enough data yet to be sure. But if the story were fundamentally about messaging or targeting, you’d expect her to improve on Biden’s total in some places and do worse in others. The problem is that none of them on their own can explain a truly uniform shift across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can’t explain Harris’s defeat in terms of losses with the white working class when she also seems to have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198">done worse than Biden with nonwhite workers and college graduates based on early data</a>. You can&#8217;t focus primarily on her stance on Gaza alienating Arab and Muslim voters when her margin of defeat was far larger than the defections in that group. Ditto with Latinos, and every other subgroup that postmortems are beginning to focus on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Uniform swings call for uniform explanations. And the most plausible one, given global context, is anti-incumbency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The central plot lines of the [2024 election] are already clear, and not that dissimilar from four years ago,” the political scientist <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/">John Sides writes at Good Authority</a>. “In 2020, an unpopular incumbent lost reelection. In 2024, an unpopular incumbent’s party lost reelection.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such an explanation makes more sense than a pure focus on ideology. In fact, the global context suggests that a Republican president likely would have also performed poorly if they were in office. While some right-wing insurgents have performed well in the past two years, most notably Javier Milei in Argentina, right-wing incumbents have often underperformed —&nbsp;with ruling conservative parties in Britain, India, and Poland all suffering notable setbacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we are indeed seeing America fall in line with the global pattern, it clarifies some of what just happened. But it also raises a new, difficult question: Why are people so<em> </em>dissatisfied with their governments at this particular point in time?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One credible answer is inflation. Countries around the world experienced rising prices after the Covid-19 pandemic and attendant global supply chain disruptions, and <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/06/two-studies-explore-americans-perception-of-inflation/">voters hate inflation</a>. Even though the inflation rate has gone down in quite a few places, including the United States, prices remain much higher than they were prior to the pandemic. People remember the low prices they’ve lost, and they are hurting —&nbsp;hurting enough that they see <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/3-reasons-bidens-strong-economy-is-unpopular.html">an otherwise-booming economy as a failure</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much sense as the inflation story makes, it remains an unproven one. We’ll need a lot more evidence, including detailed data on the US election that isn’t available yet, to be sure whether it’s right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we can be fairly confident, given reams of polling data showing Americans were dissatisfied with the country’s direction, that a desire for a change in leadership played at least some role in Trump’s return to power — part of a global trend away from stability and toward upheaval, however chaotic or even dangerous it will prove to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that it is clear Donald Trump will become president again and will have a Republican Senate and almost certainly a Republican House to back him, it’s important to ask: What will he do with these majorities? And given <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/presidents-2021-budget-would-cut-food-assistance-for-millions-and-radically-restructure">his track record last time</a>, what will it mean for poor Americans and the programs they rely on?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Trump won the presidency, in 2016, I <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/22/13641654/paul-ryan-trump-poverty-safety-net">wrote a piece predicting</a> a huge rollback of the safety net. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), with its massive expansion of Medicaid and patient protections, would be repealed; Medicaid itself would see its funding slashed and its guarantee of coverage to poor people eliminated; food stamps would be cut deep and maybe turned over to the states, much as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform">welfare for single parents was in 1996</a>, largely destroying that program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was wrong. Trump, and especially then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, did try to <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/president-trumps-full-fy-2018-budget">do all of that</a>, but in the end <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed">enough Republicans realized</a> repealing the ACA wasn’t viable. Medicaid and food stamps survived more or less intact. A Democratic House after the 2018 midterms and, more importantly, a global pandemic, meant that by 2020, the safety net was <a href="https://www.vox.com/22348364/united-states-stimulus-covid-coronavirus">significantly stronger</a> than in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do not know that the same scenario will play out in 2025, and I certainly hope the pandemic part does not repeat. But despite the devastating electoral blow to Democrats, there are reasons for safety net supporters to be optimistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Senate is solidly Republican but not a total blowout, and four defections would be enough for a bill to fail. With Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, who <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16054700/senate-obamacare-repeal-john-mccain-susan-collins-lisa-murkowski">opposed Obamacare repeal in 2017</a>, still in the chamber, it’s not difficult to imagine them and two allies blocking serious changes again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The House results will not be known exactly for weeks but look, if anything, closer. And while House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853">surely wants to slash the safety net</a>, he is not Ryan. Shrinking government is not his all-consuming passion the way it was for 2017’s House speaker, who once famously said he <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/17/14960358/paul-ryan-medicaid-keg">dreamed of cutting Medicaid while drinking out of kegs</a> as a college student.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what Republicans might attempt to do to safety net programs, and why achieving it might be difficult.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Health care programs will shrink, but serious cuts will be challenging to pass</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On health care, Republicans have one victory that’s more or less baked in. As part of the 2021 stimulus package, Joe Biden and the Democratic Congress adopted <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22360870/american-rescue-plan-act-premium-tax-credit-health-insurance">expanded subsidies for the ACA’s marketplaces</a>. If you were an individual or small business buying private insurance, the tax credits you received to offset premiums were larger. Subsidies were no longer cut off for people making over 400 percent of the poverty line (about <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines">$125,000 for a family of four</a>), and subsidies for people below that were made more generous. These provisions were later extended through the end of 2025 as part of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23282217/climate-bill-health-care-drugs-inflation-reduction-act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to imagine a Republican Congress voting to extend these measures past next year, though insurance companies will certainly <a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/extending-individual-market-subsidies-will-provide-much-needed-relief-for-hardworking-american-families">lobby</a> for it. Trump’s past budgets have also <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55958#:~:text=repeal%20subsidies%20for%20health%20insurance%20coverage%20purchased%20through%20the%20marketplaces%20established%20by%20the%20ACA">zeroed out</a> subsidies for private health insurance entirely, which would be a much larger shift.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But subsidies for private insurance are a relatively small part of federal spending on health care. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/topics/health-care#:~:text=PROJECTIONS%20FOR%20MAJOR%20HEALTH%20CARE%20PROGRAMS%20FOR%20FY%202024">This fiscal year</a>, they amount to $125 billion —&nbsp;very significant, but piddling next to $858 billion on Medicare and $607 billion on Medicaid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/07/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-says-donald-trump-intends-to-cut-med/#:~:text=%22fight%20for%20and%20protect%20Social%20Security%20and%20Medicare%20with%20no%20cuts.%22">promised not to cut Medicare</a>, much as he did in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/25/14376014/trump-social-security-medicare-mulvaney">2016</a>, and while his budgets as president did envision spending reductions, they were <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/q-did-trump-propose-deep-medicare-cuts-no">mostly minor</a> and came from cutting provider payments rather than limiting eligibility.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He did, repeatedly and explicitly, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-administration-budgets-and-programs-for-people-of-limited-means/#medicaid-aca">propose cutting Medicaid</a>. The most recent Trump budget to explicitly lay out its plans, for fiscal year 2020, entailed at least $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the ACA over a decade, per the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55958#:~:text=Reduce%20Federal%20Spending%20for%20Health%20Care">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO). At that time, the agency was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-05/55151-budget_update_0.pdf#page=16">projecting</a> $6.2 trillion in 10-year spending on non-Medicare health programs, meaning Trump was calling for a cut of over 17 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump waffled on how clear he wanted to be in calling for Medicaid cuts. His 2021 budget was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56301#:~:text=Finally%2C%20some%20of,care%20system.4">too vague</a> for the CBO to even model. But when he was clear, the proposals had three steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeal the ACA&#8217;s Medicaid coverage expansion and replace it with a “block grant” for states to spend how they like on health programs.</li>



<li>Place a “per capita cap” on the rest of Medicaid, meaning states would only be granted a set amount per covered person by the federal government, regardless of what health care they actually received.</li>



<li>Impose a work requirement, specifically to “require able-bodied, working-age individuals to find employment, train for work, or volunteer” in order to receive Medicaid.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What unites these proposals, especially the per-capita cap and block grant, is that they mean Congress and the White House don’t have to make granular decisions about who specifically is covered and for what. They can simply cut spending and pass decisions on how to spend what’s left to the states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without knowing the exact cap and block grant amounts for the future, it&#8217;s hard to say exactly how big these cuts would be, but the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&#8217; Gideon Lukens and Allison Orris analyzed <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/changing-medicaids-funding-structure-to-a-per-capita-cap-would-shift-costs-to">how Medicaid would&#8217;ve been cut if per-capita caps had been put in place</a> in 2018. By 2020, most states would&#8217;ve had to slash spending on disabled enrollees (by 12 percent in Pennsylvania and 13 percent in Kentucky); seniors would have seen cuts in 21 states, including cuts of around 17 percent in California; children would have seen cuts in 28 states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The point here is not the specific numbers but that the idea can, in practice, amount to significant reductions in resources for the program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is not much room to cut Medicaid without reducing access to the program. Physicians are already paid <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00611">about 28 percent less by Medicaid than by Medicare</a>, and Medicare in turn pays <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-01/57422-medical-prices.pdf#page=10">roughly 22 percent less</a> than private insurers. Medicaid, in other words, pays maybe half of what private insurance pays. Further cuts to prices paid to providers would almost certainly reduce the number who accept the program, making it that much harder for poor people to find care. More likely, states would respond to federal cuts by restricting eligibility and kicking people off the program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Trump can make these plans a reality depends strongly on what moderate Republicans (like Murkowski and Collins in the Senate and Don Bacon and David Valadao in the House) feel about them. While we don’t know margins for sure right now, it’s looking like <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/of-republican-senate-seats-after-election?tid=1730906142830">Republicans will have 53 Senate seats</a> and <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/of-republican-house-seats-after-election?tid=1730906160388">fewer than 225 House seats</a> (they need 218 to pass a bill there). That means that even a small number of defections would be enough to defeat legislation, even legislation that is advanced through the budget reconciliation process and thus needs only 50 Senate votes plus Vice President-elect JD Vance’s tie-breaker.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Murkowski and Collins alone wouldn’t be able to sink a Medicaid cuts bill, but they would only need two other defections to help them. Remember that in 2017, the bill that Sen. John McCain famously killed with them by making a thumbs-down motion on the Senate floor was the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16054700/senate-obamacare-repeal-john-mccain-susan-collins-lisa-murkowski">so-called “skinny repeal,”</a> which would have only repealed the individual mandate and a few other provisions. The idea was that this bill could then go to a conference committee with the House’s Obamacare repeal bill, where they’d hash out a compromise measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some Republicans who voted for the skinny repeal, like Lindsey Graham and Ron Johnson, did so only after being promised that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/obamacare-partial-repeal-senate-republicans-revolt.html">House’s bill, which included deep Medicaid cuts, would never become law</a>. There was rather deep opposition to passing sweeping cuts, even outside the three Republicans who blocked the Senate bill. As West Virginia Republican Shelley Moore Capito <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/18/15988388/shelley-moore-capito-obamacare-repeal">said that summer</a>, “I did not come to Washington to hurt people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this suggests to me that getting 50 votes for sweeping Medicaid cuts in the Senate will be rather difficult. More difficult still might be the House, where Republicans will have to defend a number of seats where Kamala Harris won and where candidates will not want to enter 2026 midterms with votes to shred Medicaid hanging on them like albatrosses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Food stamps face brutal cuts</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially called food stamps, is perhaps the most important safety net program for people who are very poor. <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/snap/characteristics-fy22">Seventy-five percent of recipients are at or below the poverty line</a>, and over 1 in 5 report having no other source of income besides food stamps. The share of single parents living on less than $2 a day is nearly 10 percent before you include SNAP benefits. Food stamps <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/5/18650492/2019-poverty-2-dollar-a-day-edin-shaefer-meyer">take the number below 3 percent</a>, slashing it by over two-thirds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the program <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/breadlines-knee-deep-in-wheat/paper">grew out of efforts to prop up crop prices</a> by redirecting “surplus” crops to poor people, it is the province of the Department of Agriculture, and is renewed every five years in a “farm bill” controlled by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. The last farm bill, from 2018, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12233">expired on September 30</a>, meaning that writing a new farm bill will be one of Congress’s main priorities early next year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Glenn Thompson, the Republican chair of the House Ag Committee, released <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/farmbill/">his proposed farm bill</a> in May. Its most striking provision would <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/house-agriculture-committee-farm-bills-30-billion-cut-to-future-snap-benefits-and">limit the ability of the Department of Agriculture to update its Thrifty Food Plan</a>, upon which SNAP benefit levels are based. This would amount to a $30 billion cut over a decade, and is a response to the Biden administration updating the Thrifty Food Plan, which resulted in a nearly 30 percent hike in benefit levels.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump&#8217;s past budgets have <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/presidents-2021-budget-would-cut-food-assistance-for-millions-and-radically-restructure">envisioned much more sweeping cuts</a>. His last one proposed a nearly 30 percent cut to the program, including new work requirements on top of those already in the program and a plan to shift a big share of the program into a &#8220;Harvest Box,&#8221; a plan in which households would not get to choose the food they buy but instead be sent a monthly box of shelf-stable foods that the government picks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, I suspect the Harvest Box plan in particular will struggle to get traction, in part because major retailers like <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/walmart-dominates-the-retail-field-in-snap-grocery-market-share">Walmart and Kroger</a> rely on revenue from customers using food stamps and will fight efforts to redirect funds from them to government provision of food. What’s more, farm bills usually go through regular order, meaning that they’re subject to the filibuster and will need Democratic support in the Senate, which will not be forthcoming for sweeping cuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, Trump has been consistent about wanting to restrict SNAP as a program and will have Ag Committee chairs in both houses who are broadly on his side. The potential for sharp cuts is definitely present.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 2021 child tax credit is gone, but the credit might improve all the same</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An area where Trump is unlikely to sign sweeping cuts and might even oversee modest expansions is the child tax credit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">ran on reviving the 2021 version of the child tax credit</a>, which expanded it from $2,000 to as much as $3,600 per child and for the first time made it fully refundable, so poor Americans could benefit even if they were out of work. She also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/15/nx-s1-5077776/kamala-harris-child-tax-credit-housing">proposed a “baby bonus” of $6,000</a> to families with newborns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those dreams are dead for at least the next four years. But with the 2017 Trump tax cuts expiring next year, including their doubling of the child credit from $1,000 to $2,000, changes are likely coming to the credit all the same. While returning to 2021 is impossible, it’s likely that the end result will direct more money to poor Americans than the credit does under current law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have been insistent that any credit include a “phase-in,” or a provision stating that families must have some earnings to receive the child tax credit. But within that framework, they’ve expressed openness to increasing the amount working families receive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance notably <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/">called for a $5,000 baby bonus</a>, only to be one-upped by Harris’s $6,000 bid. This past year, Republican Jason Smith, the chair of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, cut a deal with Democrat Ron Wyden, the outgoing chair of the Senate Finance Committee, to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/16/24035922/child-tax-credit-wyden-smith-deal">expand the child credit</a> by altering the way it phases in. Smith will still be the head tax-writer in 2025 and is likely to push for this provision to stay in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The complication is that Republicans face a wide array of expiring tax provisions next year, and while some, like <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/09/18/chief-senate-gop-tax-writer-floats-alternative-cost-estimate-for-2025-package/">incoming Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo</a>, suggest they don’t want to pay for extending those provisions, the reality of higher interest rates (meaning government deficits are now more costly to run) suggests that they probably can’t pass everything they want. Given a wish list that runs from extending those cuts to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage">exempting tips</a> and <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/what-would-trump-campaign-plans-mean-social-security">Social Security income</a> from taxation to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-says-hell-make-interest-car-loans-tax-deductible-if-domestically-built-2024-10-22/">letting people deduct interest on car loans</a>, that means that expensive provisions like child tax credit expansions will likely get squeezed. It’s hard to say what exactly will make it into the final package.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the least-trumpeted changes of the past half-century is the steady growth of America’s safety net. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59510">In 1979</a>, the average lower-income American got $5,300 from government programs aimed at poor people. In 2019, that number was $15,800. America&#8217;s commitment to poor people more than tripled, and the result was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/3/10/23632910/poverty-official-supplemental-relative-absolute-measure-desmond">marked reduction in poverty</a>. Trump’s reelection threatens that trend. But his first term, and those of Presidents Bush and Reagan before him, were not enough to reverse it. There are reasons to think it could continue even through the next four years.</p>

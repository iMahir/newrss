She said she was not transferring “sensitive” material to her private email account and that she only emailed government documents to that account because she wanted to use two laptops at the same time when working from home during Covid.</p><p>But that’s not very practical when you are reading a lot of documents online and you simultaneously need to write lengthy documents and pieces as part of your work. Sometimes you need two screens.</p><p>So it’s a bit tedious as an explanation. There’s nothing to do with spies or state secrets here … There was nothing sensitive that was transferred.</p><p>Listen, I was never actually advised that that was not permissible, and we were in a strange scenario where a lot of that was done during Covid and lockdown, when there was a lot of working from home, and I wasn’t getting as many papers in physical copy.</p><p>If you look back at the records, there have been some of my colleagues who have been found to be using their personal emails many years ago. I’m not going to name any names. But you can find that out as well. So it’s not particularly unusual, I would say, amongst ministers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/22/david-gauke-sentencing-ministry-of-justice-shabana-mahmood-uk-politics-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/22/david-gauke-sentencing-ministry-of-justice-shabana-mahmood-uk-politics-latest-updates</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/22/david-gauke-sentencing-ministry-of-justice-shabana-mahmood-uk-politics-latest-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 09:30:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1,100 more prisoners set for early release as minister admits recall rate ‘very high’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Shabana Mahmood says she wants latest emergency release amid overcrowding in England and Wales jails to be the last</p><p>The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has admitted the proportion of people released early from prison who are being recalled is “very high”, as the government prepares to free more inmates to relieve an overcrowding crisis.</p><p>Mahmood said figures would not yet be available for the number of prisoners who had been returned after the first wave of prison releases in September, but said it was likely they would be high.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/22/prison-recall-rate-after-early-release-very-high-says-minister-england-wales">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/22/prison-recall-rate-after-early-release-very-high-says-minister-england-wales</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/22/prison-recall-rate-after-early-release-very-high-says-minister-england-wales</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 09:10:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Donald Trump urges Christian voters to participate in 2024 election – US politics live]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Republican candidate claims that Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms during event in North Carolina</p><p>Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog.

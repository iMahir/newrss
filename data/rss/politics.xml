Today we’ll be continuing to keep an eye on Congress, where lawmakers are mulling how – or if – to deal with the question of whether to call on <strong>Joe Biden </strong>to halt his re-election campaign after a devastating debate performance that raised questions about his age and ability to win in November. Biden has scored the surprising and weighty endorsement of the progressive congresswoman <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> (AOC), who has in the past clashed with Biden over policy. Biden’s meeting with the <strong>Congressional Black Caucus</strong> also went well for the president, with members of the caucus <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/08/black-house-democrats-cbc-biden-congressional-black-caucus/">reportedly</a> presenting unified support for Biden. That kind of institutional support on the Hill will help Biden, but it hasn’t quelled anxieties about his re-election bid – and more members of Congress could rally around his ouster still.</p><p>Here’s what else we’re following today:</p><p><strong>House Democrats</strong> are scheduled hold a 9am all-member meeting at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump </strong>will hold a rally in Florida this afternoon. With less than a week to go before the Republican National Convention, Trump is expected to name a running mate any day now.</p><p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> will speak in Nevada on Tuesday to shore up support for the Biden-Harris ticket in the battleground state.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jul/09/biden-democrats-election-trump-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jul/09/biden-democrats-election-trump-latest-updates</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jul/09/biden-democrats-election-trump-latest-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:03:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia said it prevented a Ukrainian attempt to hijack a missile-carrying strategic bomber]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-said-prevented-ukrainian-attempt-115138219.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-said-prevented-ukrainian-attempt-115138219.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 11:51:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jon Stewart Shuts Down 1 Of The Biggest Arguments Against Replacing Biden]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/jon-stewart-shuts-down-1-062055963.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/jon-stewart-shuts-down-1-062055963.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:20:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Egypt's Sisi and CIA's Burns discusss Gaza ceasefire efforts]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/egypts-sisi-cias-burns-discusss-110124748.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/egypts-sisi-cias-burns-discusss-110124748.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 11:01:24 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Canada’s two main rail lines locked out rail workers early Thursday morning amid tense contract negotiations between the railways and the Canada Teamsters Rail Conference, which represents nearly 10,000 rail workers. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/latest-lockout-railways-ongoing">said his government would resolve the dispute,</a> and late Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/canada/canada-freight-trains.html">officials ordered the two sides</a> to enter arbitration proceedings. Even if they are successful, however,<strong> </strong>the work stoppage could have a serious impact on the Canadian economy, as well as supply chains in both the US and Canada.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rail companies, Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC), and the union have been negotiating for months, but remain far apart. Though CN ordered its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-national-railways-canadian-pacific-lock-out-teamsters-union-workers-2024-08-22/">6,000 union employees back to work on Friday</a>, the CPKC lockout continues, and CN workers have filed notice that a strike could begin Monday. The companies argued a lockout was necessary to ensure a safe and controlled drawdown of operations and that if they waited for operators to walk off the job, the companies wouldn’t have had time to secure hazardous materials or work out supply arrangements with key customers. The two rail lines facilitate the transit of people and about $740 million worth of goods across the country’s vast interior each day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, the impact of the work stoppage is mainly on the Canadian economy, but because about 75 percent of Canadian exports —&nbsp;including coal and agricultural products —&nbsp;are sold to the US, there could be an impact on the US supply chain if the dispute isn’t resolved soon.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What went wrong with Canadian railways&nbsp;and what it means for Canada’s supply chain</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two railway systems had contracts with the Teamsters union that expired in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cn-rail-cpkc-shut-canada-rail-network-labor-talks-deadlocked-2024-08-22/">December 2023</a>. Since then, each side has accused the other of refusing to accept reasonable terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The union’s primary concerns, <a href="https://teamsters.ca/blog/2024/08/22/cn-and-cpkc-begin-work-stoppage/">according to its public communications</a>, have been over worker safety and rest periods, as well as predictable scheduling. They also claim that Canada National is issuing them unworkable relocation notices —&nbsp;forcing workers to move for months at a time in order to deal with staffing shortages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rail workers voted to authorize a strike as early as May of this year, claiming that the rail companies weren’t bargaining in good faith and were attempting to undercut progress on working conditions, proposing a shift to an hourly wage rather than a salary for some positions, and removing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cpkc-says-possible-canada-rail-strike-unlikely-before-mid-july-2024-05-23/">scheduling provisions for adequate rest</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Across Canada, we have trains [that] are carrying goods, they are carrying energy, they are carrying chemicals,” François Laporte, national president of Teamsters Canada, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76nnpyrnlo">told the BBC</a> Thursday. “And we want to make sure that those [trains] are operated by people who get the proper rest, who are safe, who are not fatigued.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Canadian railways carry goods like coal and potash —&nbsp;<a href="https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-and-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/potash-facts/20521">an important ingredient in fertilizer</a> —&nbsp;as well as cooking oil, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/21/canada-rail-strike-lockout-teamsters/">propane, and frozen food</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many shipments both within Canada and between Canada and the US were already paused; by Tuesday, CPKC had already stopped shipments that started in the US and were bound for Canada. Under the work stoppage, around 2,500 US train cars bound for Canada will be halted each day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some organizations, like the US Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the National Cotton Council warned of devastating effects on the US supply chain and economy should the work stoppage persist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cotton Council, among others, claimed in a Monday letter to President Joe Biden that the work stoppage could cause “harmful consequences for Canadian and American agricultural producers, the agricultural industry, and both domestic and global food security” if it persisted, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/21/canada-rail-strike-lockout-teamsters/">the Washington Post reported</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though it’s difficult to say exactly what the impact will be on the US economy, some prices on agricultural products could go up should the work stoppage stretch on, affecting consumers already struggling with high food costs. Sanitation could be affected, as the chlorine that many sanitation departments rely on to treat wastewater is shipped from Canada. The automotive industry could be impacted, too; <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/08/22/us-industries-prepare-for-hit-from-canadian-rail-strike/">according to June numbers from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>, automobiles and auto parts made up the bulk of rail shipments from the US to Canada in June. Some US auto plants could be forced to shut down before the week is out if there’s no agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Container ships unable to unload at Canadian ports will likely need to reroute to the US, potentially causing a backup at US ports,&nbsp;which could cause supply chain disruptions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Supply chain problems will become more pronounced the longer the lockout continues. The Canadian government had two options to try to solve the problem: either <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76nnpyrnlo" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76nnpyrnlo">pass return-to-work legislation</a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5087448/canada-railways-strike-union-labor">force the companies and the union into private arbitration</a>. The companies had signaled openness to arbitration, though the union<strong> </strong>did not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible the arbitration process will only paper over the real disputes without solving them, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-block-us-railroad-strike-2022-12-02/">as the US return-to-work legislation in December 2022 did</a>. Without a resolution and a new contract, forcing the workers to return to their trains will only kick the problem down the track.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, August 23, 2024, 4 pm ET: </strong>This story, first published on August 22, has been updated to reflect the Canadian government ordering the rail companies and union into arbitration</em> <em>and the end of CN’s lockout order.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Vice President Kamala Harris reintroduced herself to the nation and laid out her case against Donald Trump, her opponent was, essentially, live-tweeting a political freakout.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?” the former president and Republican presidential nominee posted on his platform Truth Social about 20 minutes into Harris’s acceptance speech. That was about the point when she turned away from giving her family history and tracing the biographical milestones that brought her into politics to go after Trump’s criminal convictions and civil liabilities and calling him “an unserious man.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. How he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States — not to improve your life,” Harris said in her address. “But to serve the only client he has ever had: himself.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s response? To post a supercut of Harris interview and speech clips, captioned by the <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113009074794208002">question</a> “WONDER WHY [KAMALA HARRIS] WON’T DO INTERVIEWS?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so the non sequiturs and spontaneous bursts of anger continued to flow from the former president for the rest of the night. “WHERE’S HUNTER?” he asked, in reference to President Joe Biden’s convicted son, as Harris talked about her upbringing in Oakland, California. “Look, it’s Crazy Nancy Pelosi looking on, saying, ‘Where’s Crooked Joe?’” he narrated at the end of the speech, when former Speaker Nancy Pelosi was shown on screen clapping for Harris as the balloons dropped.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It didn’t end there. He&#8217;d proceed to call into Fox News and <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113009759551567410">Newsmax</a> telecasts to “discuss Marxism in America” — trying to zero in on one complaint (“why didn’t she do the things that she’s complaining about?”) before spinning out into a variety of grievances as he <a href="https://x.com/grynbaum/status/1826822518746796366">seemed</a> to <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1826822871924310250">accidentally press</a> a bunch of different buttons on his phone’s keypad as he talked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a way, Trump’s reactions last night are a throwback to some of the classic Trump traits that defined his 2016 campaign and presidency: the angry tweets, the rambling press conferences, the tiffs with journalists, and the attempts to throw anything at the wall and see what sticks. It can appear chaotic and messy from the outside, but then again, this all worked in 2016 and nearly worked in 2020. How this all plays out in 2024, against a fresh Democratic candidate who Trump has struggled to define, remains to be seen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that seems to be the biggest effect that Harris’s speech has had on Trump: to scramble Trump’s strategy, to put him on the defensive, and to bog him down with a litany of attacks that he can’t effectively rebut.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s clear there are some attacks that Trump is especially concerned about.<strong> </strong>On Newsmax, he embraced the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, then tried to argue for exceptions to abortion bans as he admitted that the “issue is not one that leans toward us.” He then criticized Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation-backed blueprint of policy proposals for a second Trump term, as being the product of “far-right” thinkers who he wants nothing to do with — even though his own running mate J.D. Vance is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/362917/jd-vance-project-2025-book-kevin-roberts-trump">intrinsically tied</a> to the movement and the architects of this vision staffed his first administration or have deep ties to Trump’s team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Fox News, host Bret Baier gave Trump the opportunity to distance himself from the demise of the bipartisan border security bill Biden and Harris had worked to negotiate with Republican members of Congress. Trump’s lobbying against the bill has been a go-to cudgel for Harris and Democrats when rebutting accusations that they are weak on immigration policy and border security and criticizing Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, Trump embraced his responsibility. “The bill was horrible,” he said. “It was a joke. She doesn’t need a bill. I didn’t have a bill.” And he took a seemingly random dig at Joe Biden: “Now Joe is missing. He’s on a beach in California.” Then he rambled on about his visit earlier Thursday to the southern border in Cochise County, Arizona: “It’s a dangerous place. I was being told by Secret Service and a lot of other law enforcement, ‘Sir, it’s really dangerous here, I think it’s time to leave.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s lack of any coherent campaign message contrasted sharply with Harris’s speech and the DNC’s carefully choreographed convention. And while it’s hard to know how much that matters to voters, it certainly seemed evident to Trump’s interviewers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Baier and co-host Martha MacCallum traded glances at each other as Trump shouted into the phone. As Trump tossed out his oft-repeated line about “many” of the “millions” of people “pouring into our country coming from mental institutions and insane asylums,” MacCallum interrupted him with another question. As Harris has worked to reconsolidate female, Hispanic, Black, and young voter support for her party, do he and his campaign have a strategy to recover his short-lived gains with these voters that polls had been showing before Biden dropped out?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No, she’s not having success, I’m having success. I’m doing great with the Hispanic voters. I’m doing great with Black men,” he snapped back. “No, it’s only in your eyes that they have that, Martha. We’re doing very well in the polls.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’d then go on to praise the Republican governor of  Georgia, Brian Kemp, who had just appeared on Fox News. “He was very nice and he said he wants Trump to win. … I think we’re going to have a very good relationship with Brian Kemp.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The praise was notable and a bit odd — Trump has long blamed Kemp for losing him the state in the 2020 election because the governor would not back Trump’s claims of voter fraud or attempts to overturn the election. Just a few weeks ago, during an August 3 visit to Georgia, Trump had launched into a 10-minute tirade against Kemp, calling him “a bad guy. He’s a disloyal guy. And he’s a very average governor. &#8230; Little Brian, little Brian Kemp. Bad guy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Thursday night on Fox News, as polls have shown a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/us/elections/kamala-harris-trump-az-nc-ga-nv.html">narrowing</a><a href="https://www.wjbf.com/top-stories/emerson-poll-shows-harris-leads-trump/"> race</a> in that state, Trump seemed to be walking back his personal insults of Kemp. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hosts pivoted to one more topic — about the chances that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. drops out of the presidential contest and endorses him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump wouldn’t say if he’d accept Kennedy’s endorsement, noting that they’ll be in different parts of Arizona on Friday. But he launched into a minute-long rant (the whole interview was about nine minutes long) about how he thinks both RFK Jr and Joe Biden were treated unfairly by the Democratic Party (“they threw Joe Biden out of the party.”). At that point, the Fox hosts seemed to have heard enough and cut Trump’s interview short.</p>

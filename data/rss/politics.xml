It did not rise high enough this time, but it continues to rise and our victory has simply been deferred.”</p><p><strong>RN leader Jordan Bardella called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a “disgraceful alliance” </strong>that would paralyse France.</p><p><strong>Macron can choose who he wants as prime minister but many within his alliance have said they will not work with France Unbowed, the hard left party led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon which is the largest in the NFP alliance. </strong>The president could ask a Socialist or Greens MP but they may not be willing. A centrist candidate could also be an unpopular choice as Macron’s alliance lost so many seats in the election.</p><p><strong>Mélenchon said Macron “must invite the New Popular Front to govern”</strong>. “The will of the people must be strictly respected,” he said.</p><p><strong>Raphael Glucksmann, from the Socialist party and part of the NFP, urged his alliance partners to act like “grown-ups”.</strong> “We’re ahead, but we’re in a divided parliament,” he said. “We’re going to have to talk, to discuss, to engage in dialogue.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jul/08/france-election-2024-live-updates-legislatives-results-macron-melenchon-le-pen-attal-ensemble-rn-nfp">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jul/08/france-election-2024-live-updates-legislatives-results-macron-melenchon-le-pen-attal-ensemble-rn-nfp</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jul/08/france-election-2024-live-updates-legislatives-results-macron-melenchon-le-pen-attal-ensemble-rn-nfp</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 04:14:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chicago homeowner stunned after getting a notice that his property taxes skyrocketed from $1,800 to over $30K]]></title><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chicago-homeowner-stunned-getting-notice-101600890.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chicago-homeowner-stunned-getting-notice-101600890.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 10:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inflation data, Powell speaks, and big banks report earnings: What to know this week]]></title><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-data-powell-speaks-and-big-banks-report-earnings-what-to-know-this-week-141737717.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-data-powell-speaks-and-big-banks-report-earnings-what-to-know-this-week-141737717.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 14:17:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How France's Macron went from a successful political newcomer to a weakened leader]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/frances-macron-went-successful-political-060452054.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/frances-macron-went-successful-political-060452054.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 06:04:52 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

 Maryland is a deep-blue state with an abortion referendum on the ballot and a surprisingly competitive Senate race that could help determine the balance of power in Congress. Ahead of Harris’s remarks, Maryland Democrats and reproductive rights leaders emphasized the stakes in November.<br><br><strong>Angela Alsobrooks, </strong>the Democratic nominee for the state’s open seat, said Trump was “proud as a peacock” for setting in motion the fall of Roe, and warned that Republicans saw the state as an opportunity to win back control of the chamber.<br><br>
 Speaking before Harris, she said of Republicans: “Make no mistake about it. They would take the first opportunity to ban abortion nationwide.”<br><br>
 Alsobrooks faces<strong> Larry Hogan,</strong> the state’s former two-term Republican governor, who, in a sign of the fast-shifting politics of abortion, has recast himself as “pro-choice” and said he supports the state’s abortion referendum.<br><br>
 Maryland senator <strong>Chris Van Hollen, </strong>a Democrat, urged voters who want to protect access to abortion to send Alsobrooks with him to the Senate. <br><br>
 “Larry Hogan’s undergoing some election year conversion like none other I’ve ever seen,” the senator said, pointing to Hogan’s record as governor, when he vetoed a law that would have expanded abortion access.</p><p>“A vote for Larry Hogan is a vote to put the Maga Republicans in charge of the United States Senate.”<br><br>
 In November, Maryland voters will decide whether to approve a constitutional amendment enshrining the right to abortion and “reproductive freedom,” in the state’s constitution. It is widely expected to pass because of broad support for protecting abortion access, which is legal in the state.</p><p>Trump has not denied, much less shown remorse, for his actions. Instead, he proudly takes credit for overturning <em>Roe</em>.<br>
 In a court of law, that would be called an admission. Some would say, a confession.</p><p>…</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jun/24/biden-trump-debate-abortion-roe-updates">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jun/24/biden-trump-debate-abortion-roe-updates</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jun/24/biden-trump-debate-abortion-roe-updates</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 16:19:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Supreme Court rejects challenge to Connecticut law that eliminated religious vaccination exemption]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-rejects-challenge-connecticut-134032511.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-rejects-challenge-connecticut-134032511.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 13:40:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netanyahu receives warning from panel probing submarine purchase]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/netanyahu-receives-warning-panel-probing-101758219.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/netanyahu-receives-warning-panel-probing-101758219.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 10:17:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia is crumbling from within]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-crumbling-within-142947072.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-crumbling-within-142947072.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 14:29:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

 The premier, <strong>Steven Miles,</strong> will today announce he will ban logging in between 50,000 and 60,000 hectares of high value ecosystem within the Eastern Hardwoods region in Wide Bay, north of Brisbane.<br><br>
 In addition, a new park to protect the greater glider will be established in the south-east Queensland bioregion.</p><p>The state government will also appoint an advisory group to develop a 30-year plan for the sector. It will include representatives from the timber industry, forestry experts, the conservation sector, First Nations peoples, the Australian Workers’ Union, construction sector and outdoor recreational groups.</p><p>Queensland’s timber industry is the backbone of the housing and building sectors.<br><br>
 That’s why I’m doing what matters to support timber workers and the industry to continue building our state, while also increasing our protected area estate.<br><br>
 The terms of reference released today map out our priorities as a government – that is, timber supply security, environmental protections, jobs and diverse employment opportunities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jun/26/australia-politics-live-labor-coalition-greens-parliament-julian-assange-saipan-wikileaks-fatima-payman-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-nuclear-emissions-newington-question-time">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jun/26/australia-politics-live-labor-coalition-greens-parliament-julian-assange-saipan-wikileaks-fatima-payman-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-nuclear-emissions-newington-question-time</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jun/26/australia-politics-live-labor-coalition-greens-parliament-julian-assange-saipan-wikileaks-fatima-payman-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-nuclear-emissions-newington-question-time</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 04:29:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Julian Assange live news: WikiLeaks founder heads to Australia as US ambassador Caroline Kennedy declares ‘longstanding and difficult’ case closed]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hearing brings to an end a legal battle spanning more than a decade.

The White House last month gave Israel an ultimatum of 30 days to improve conditions or risk losing military support. As the deadline expired on Tuesday, international aid groups said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> had fallen far short.<br><br>

Warren condemned the Biden administration’s decision to continue supplying arms to its ally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/elizabeth-warren-biden-gaza">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/elizabeth-warren-biden-gaza</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/elizabeth-warren-biden-gaza</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 19:24:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israeli strikes intensify on three fronts as Lebanon talks reach critical stage]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>IDF hits Gaza, Syria and Beirut suburbs, as analysts say raids could be aimed at forcing hand of Hezbollah in negotiations</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/14/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-crimes-humanity-accusations-palestinians-gaza-lebanon">Middle East crisis – live updates</a></li></ul><p>Israel has intensified its air offensives on three fronts, launching dozens of new strikes in Lebanon, Gaza and Syria as negotiations for a ceasefire on its northern border reach a critical point.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 30 targets had been struck in the southern suburbs of Beirut in 48 hours and described continuing efforts to “dismantle and degrade” the military capabilities of the militant Islamist organisation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/israeli-strikes-intensify-on-three-fronts-as-talks-with-hezbollah-reach-critical-stage">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/israeli-strikes-intensify-on-three-fronts-as-talks-with-hezbollah-reach-critical-stage</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/israeli-strikes-intensify-on-three-fronts-as-talks-with-hezbollah-reach-critical-stage</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:55:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK charity declares ‘refugee homelessness emergency’ as numbers hit record high]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Naccom report says gaps in state support have led to more than 1,940 refugees having no accommodation</p><p>Homelessness among refugees has doubled in the last year to reach record levels as charities hand out tents and sleeping bags to those forced to live on the streets for the first time, according to research.</p><p>The No Accommodation Network (Naccom), an umbrella organisation for 140 frontline organisations working with asylum seekers, refugees and other migrants across the UK, has collated the data and shared it with the Guardian.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/uk-charity-declares-refugee-homelessness-emergency-as-numbers-hit-record-high">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/uk-charity-declares-refugee-homelessness-emergency-as-numbers-hit-record-high</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/uk-charity-declares-refugee-homelessness-emergency-as-numbers-hit-record-high</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 19:14:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump transition: RFK Jr expected to be nominated to lead health department, report says – live updates]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Pick needs Senate confirmation and could spark controversy among Trump’s Republican allies, given Kennedy’s anti-vaccine stance and conspiracy theories</p><p>An independent central bank is “fundamental” to getting good economic outcomes, a senior Federal Reserve official said on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p><p>The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to act independently to tackle both inflation and unemployment – primarily by raising and lowering interest rates.

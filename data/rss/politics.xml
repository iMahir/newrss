<p class="has-text-align-none">Five years ago, standing in front of a crowd of some 20,000 people in Oakland, California, Kamala Harris announced that she was running for president. “My whole life, I’ve only had one client: the people,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that President Biden has dropped out of the race and Harris has become the presumptive Democratic nominee, it’s fair to start asking what, exactly, she plans to do for her client if she wins in November. Despite Harris’s long career and remarkable rise in politics — she has served as the San Francisco district attorney, California’s attorney general, US senator, and, most recently, vice president — it’s still difficult to predict what her campaign, let alone presidency, will look like. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Harris has been vice president for three years and ran a presidential campaign in the 2020 cycle, she’s managed to avoid being neatly pigeonholed into any ideological box. Unlike candidates Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who are easily remembered for their Medicare-for-all or wealth-tax proposals, Harris’s 2020 campaign fizzled out with few, if any, policy ideas or slogans being closely associated with it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At any point in her two-decade political career, she could fit the description of a number of “types” of Democrat: centrist, moderate, progressive, liberal, establishment, or outsider. But besides her “<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/kamala-harris-wrote-a-good-book-about">smart-on-crime</a>” identity, none of those labels has ever effectively captured her way of thinking or how she would govern as president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might have been by design. “Policy has to be relevant,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html">Harris told the New York Times in 2019</a>. “That’s my guiding principle: Is it relevant? Not, ‘Is it a beautiful sonnet?’” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her allies and those who have worked with her in the past describe her as a pragmatist — a fact that makes it hard for the public and press to decipher her vision for the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This may be the best way to understand Harris: She doesn’t necessarily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127005330/https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-unstoppable-rise-of-kamala-harris">believe in a big ideological mission</a> to remake government or society, but instead considers government as a tool to concretely help improve the lives of as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, through practical means, like lowering the cost of medication, expanding access to broadband internet, and fixing roads and bridges. Aiming at smaller targets can effect change to bigger interconnected problems, like lowering inflation, expanding access to health care, and protecting reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She thinks about policy and law not from a place of the words on a page, but the ways in which those words impact the lives of everyday people,” said Democratic California Sen. Laphonza Butler, a longtime adviser and friend to Harris. “She tends to see gaps and see around corners and make sure that the policy can work for everyone.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 2015 profile of her in San Francisco Magazine underscored that incrementalist approach. “I don’t admire grand gestures,” Harris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127005330/https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-unstoppable-rise-of-kamala-harris">was quoted as saying</a>. “I admire goal achievement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What those goals are, exactly, has remained unclear throughout her career. Even as recently as her last run for president, they weren’t entirely defined: As one person who sat in on a meeting with Harris about whether she should run later <a href="https://x.com/IsaacDovere/status/1815412205522719095/photo/1">put it</a>, “We launched into a void, without a worldview,” the journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere has reported.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Harris hits the campaign trail anew, many more voters will want to hear what her vision for the country is beyond defeating Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, what does Harris actually want to achieve if she makes it to the Oval Office?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris’s 2020 campaign gave voters an incomplete picture</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last election cycle, Harris’s career as a prosecutor seemed to guide much of her campaign: Her <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/kamala-harris-prosecutor-for-the-people/">slogan</a> — “Kamala Harris, for the people”<em> </em>— was how <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-2020-oakland-1128563">she introduced herself in court</a>; her ads focused on her <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1197243216132804608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197243216132804608%7Ctwgr%5E341a78b4244eb8e416847db91740560bc1295366%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fkamala-harris-trump-attack-ad-viral-1235064809%2F">record prosecuting sexual predators</a>, banks, and big corporations; and her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-prosecute-trump.html">promise to Democratic voters</a> was that she’d be the best candidate to “prosecute the case” against Donald Trump in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as she campaigned, Harris’s messaging on policy was often muddied. She supported big ideas like Medicare-for-all, on the one hand, but emphasized that she’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html">“not trying to restructure society”</a> on the other. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of her policy positions were also never clear, in part because she flip-flopped on several occasions. There were multiple times, for example, when she seemed to support abolishing private health insurance while campaigning on Medicare-for-all, but she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-walks-back-her-hand-moment-health-insurance-democratic-n1024756">walked back on that position when pressed</a> on whether her plan would leave room for private insurers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one high-profile moment during the campaign, she went after Biden’s record on desegregation during a debate, skewering him for opposing court-ordered school busing programs in the 1970s. But in the days after her attack on Biden, Harris gave <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/harriss-views-on-busing-come-under-question-after-her-debate-criticism-of-bidens-past-position/2019/07/04/b197c6cc-9e71-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html#">only vague answers</a> about whether she supported federally mandated busing, leaving many to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-busing.html">wonder whether there was actually any daylight</a> between her position and Biden’s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aides who have worked with her in the past chalk some of this up to Harris’s “literalism” — what they say is a focus on the lived experience of the people who elected her and how policies and stances may need to change with the times or as reality sets in. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s someone who thinks about the user experience of government, how it works, how it operates, how people are experiencing it, and she wants to make it better in literal ways, as opposed to theory,” said Daniel Suvor, who served as Harris’s chief of policy when she was California attorney general.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was, however, at least one clear and consistent message throughout her 2020 campaign: that she was the best candidate to defeat Trump in that cycle. And while defeating Trump might not be a long-term agenda, it’s also not necessarily an insufficient reason to run for the presidency. After all, that’s what Biden repeatedly said <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-motivated-joe-biden-to-run-for-president">inspired him to run</a> in 2020 and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-says-he-has-to-run-for-president-because-trump-is-running/">again in 2024</a>. And if Trump does indeed pose a long-term threat to democracy, then beating him at the ballot box can be a legacy-defining achievement in and of itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does Harris’s vice presidency tell us about her priorities?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris struggled to define herself during the 2020 primaries, accepting the offer to serve as vice president only made that struggle <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/517325-kamala-harris-from-historic-to-invisible/">harder</a>. Early on, there were signs that Biden might want to empower his number two and make her a governing partner, as he said he would during the campaign. His pre-election talk about being a “bridge” to a new generation of leaders also cemented the idea that his vice president might be primed to be his successor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it quickly looked like Harris would be sidelined — and that’s what the public and press eventually assumed occurred. Questions swirled around what her portfolio would include. Harris ended up doing a little bit of everything, contributing to the sense of ambiguity and that her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html">tenure suffered from a lack of focus</a>. She asked for one specific priority (voting rights) and received another more nebulous task (addressing <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">root causes</a> of migration).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first priority was easy to define: securing the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/president-biden-taps-vice-president-harris-lead-efforts-pass-voting">passage</a> of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html">reportedly</a> made the decision to focus on this task after spending time talking to other Black leaders in the Democratic Party, including those focused on ballot access and voting rights, such as Stacey Abrams.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s when she made a departure from the pragmatism that had previously defined her, despite the grim odds of the legislation passing in a tied Senate, let alone breaking a filibuster with 60 votes. She saw voter access as an issue that could unite various factions of the Democratic Party, and on which she could carry on the party’s legacy of fighting for civil rights — meaningful given her own historic place as the first Black woman vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was warned about the low chances of this kind of legislation passing, but still, she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/15/harris-voting-rights-push-527186">tried</a>, meeting with various activist groups and advocates to build popular support. Her work on Capitol Hill was more limited as the president himself tried to lobby senators. Despite an emotional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/11/us/biden-harris-voting-rights">last-minute push</a>, the chance of abolishing the filibuster was essentially zero, killing the effort.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her second priority, pegged to immigration, came as an assignment she did not ask for: leading diplomatic efforts and engagement with the countries of Mexico and the Northern Triangle to address the root causes of migration. It was essentially the same assignment Biden had received from Barack Obama eight years before, but it quickly spun into a greater political mess, one that will continue to be a vulnerability for Harris in the general election. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The task was diplomatic, neither focused on border security nor the immediate response to the influx of migrants and people seeking asylum. But that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">distinction</a> was muddled by the press, Republicans and the right, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/4/1/22359917/biden-border-mixed-messaging-crisis">even</a> the White House.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Things changed for Harris when the <em>Dobbs </em>decision overturned <em>Roe v. Wade </em>and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. The vice president quickly seized on the issue, talking naturally and practically about the decision’s real-world implications — in large part because it dealt with two constituencies she has always prioritized: mothers and children, a former Harris adviser said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She traveled to battleground and Republican-run states, explained the ties between abortion rights and other reproductive and individual rights, and became the administration’s point person on the issue. Harris’s thinking and strategizing on how to talk about reproductive rights in the aftermath of the <em>Dobbs</em> decision also fit the larger theme of how she thinks about policies and initiatives: considering who is affected, and how long it will take to achieve justice. And it will be a centerpiece of the campaign she runs now.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What would a Harris presidency look like?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Harris’s career has made clear is that she’s more likely to pursue incremental progress than big, ambitious ideas. That’s why if elected, it’s likely that her administration would simply be an extension of the current one rather than a disruption.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the campaign trail this week, several priorities have come into focus, with the economy and affordability still at the top of the list. Harris continues to talk about prioritizing the middle class, just as Biden did: “Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said at her first major campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. “When our middle class is strong, America is strong.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To support that swath of Americans, improving the care economy — those services that focus on children and the elderly — could be one of the major policy areas she may come to prioritize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She would zero in on a straightforward policy agenda, said Carmel Martin, who served as the vice president’s domestic policy adviser from 2022 to 2023: a focus on “economic progress while bringing down inflation, expanding access to services that people need — health care being at the front of the line — and protecting reproductive rights.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has already shown signs of this focus, saying in a campaign address on Monday that she believes “in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty; where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth; and where every person has access to paid family leave and affordable child care.” All of these stances are essentially what Biden has pitched before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that Harris has shown she’s not a hardened ideologue means that she can be swayed by political headwinds, giving social movements an opportunity to push various agendas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the country’s most transformational legislation, for example, didn’t come directly from presidents who were ideological hardliners, but rather from presidents who were willing to listen to social movements and public sentiment — as was the case during the Civil Rights Era.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will Harris help or hurt the Democrats’ chances in November?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Usually, by the time a presidential candidate makes it to the general election after a grueling primary campaign, their policy priorities and ideology are relatively clear. Barack Obama, for example, offered a vision for a post-George W. Bush America — promising to end the US “forever” wars, address economic inequality, and unite the country around the common desire for hope and change. By contrast, Donald Trump offered a distinctly dark vision for the country, building a backlash coalition by injecting more racism and xenophobia into mainstream American politics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Biden was largely viewed as a centrist who campaigned on defending democracy and a return to normalcy after the rise of Trumpism and the devastating effects of a pandemic, specifically touting his vested interest in pursuing bipartisanship.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris, however, is starting a campaign essentially from scratch, without having gone through a primary process. As a result, voters haven’t been properly introduced to her as a candidate for the presidency.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her lack of a clearly defined ideological position up to this point in her career might now prove an asset: She has a unique opportunity to reintroduce herself to the country and offer a new vision for the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Harris does over the next few weeks will help to shape voters’ opinions of her. That doesn’t mean she can entirely evade her past — her <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record">record as a prosecutor</a> will likely keep coming up — or that she won’t be haunted by past policy positions. For now, though, she’s likely to focus on Trump’s baggage and the danger he poses to democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The script writes itself: the prosecutor against the convicted felon,” California Sen. Alex Padilla said. “That&#8217;s what this race has become.”</p>

	<figcaption>Police officers patrol by the Arc de Triomphe ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris, France on July 23, 2024.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not as if no one was thinking about security issues when Paris was awarded this summer’s Olympics back in 2017. Just two years earlier, the French capital had been the scene of one of the worst terrorist attacks in European history, when Islamic State gunmen killed <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Paris-attacks-of-2015">more than 130 people</a>. That attack came only a few months after a massacre at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo<em>. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then-French <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/world/europe/olympics-2024-paris.html">President François Hollande said</a> that when he was lobbying for the Olympics in 2016, he was asked by International Olympic Committee officials “whether Paris would be able to organize safe Games.” He made the case that not only would Paris be ready, but an Olympics in the City of Light would be the “most beautiful answer we could give to fundamentalism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seven years later, the Olympics are finally coming to Paris in a very different era with a very different landscape of security threats. While the attention of governments and the media has largely <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/352855/war-on-terror-biden-isis-al-qaeda">shifted away from terrorist groups like ISIS</a>, the group and its affiliates have demonstrated they can continue to carry out major attacks, including a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/23/24109865/moscow-crocus-city-hall-theater-terrorist-attack-russia-isis-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war">horrific recent one in Moscow</a> with a death toll similar to what Paris suffered in 2015. The Olympics also take place against the backdrop of the October 7 attacks, Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, and a global surge in antisemitism, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240125-anti-semitic-acts-nearly-quadrupled-last-year-in-france-says-jewish-organisation">France very much included</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympics, which were originally <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22918000/beijing-olympics-world-peace-russia-ukraine-war">meant to mark a period of truce from war</a>, are also taking place in a Europe embroiled in the biggest armed conflict since WWII. The impact of the war in Ukraine will be visible during the competitions themselves: Russian and Belarusian athletes are barred from competing under their countries’ flags, though some will be present as “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/09/1218406353/russian-belarus-athletes-ioc-2024-olympic-games">individual neutral athletes</a>.” A recent string of mysterious events, including arson attacks, has also raised concerns that Russia could attempt to disrupt the games in retaliation for France and other Western countries’ support of Ukraine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympics have been the target of political violence in the past – mostly famously the killing of 11 members of the Israeli team at the 1972 games in Munich by a Palestinian militant group and a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/13/eric.rudolph/">bombing by a right-wing anti-abortion extremist</a> at the 1996 games in Atlanta. Al-Qaeda was also known to have <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/al-qaeda-targeted-olympics-jews-court-20040520-gdiymj.html">planned to attack the 2000 Sydney Olympics</a> but ultimately didn’t follow through.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Large sporting events, with their massive crowds and built-in global media attention, will always present a tempting, if presumably well-defended target. Though it’s less remembered today than the slaughter at the Bataclan rock venue during the 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, one terrorist attempted and failed to enter the Stade de France where 80,000 people including the French president were watching a France-Germany soccer match.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not surprisingly, security levels at the Games are high with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/paris-olympics-security-police-military-terrorism-34b168e7a511e22ce7119a91932d2759">heavy police and military presence </a>in Paris, as well as the controversial use of artificial intelligence technology for video surveillance. But notably, the opening ceremonies on Friday evening will be held for the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-olympic-games-opening-ceremony-all-you-need-to-know">first time outside a stadium</a>, with athletes parading in boats along the Seine. It promises to be a beautiful sight — but it will also be a security headache, set out across a sprawling metropolis rather than a closed and controlled location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One US security official who spoke with Vox said that all Olympics pose their particular concerns, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/26/sport/olympic-security-overview/index.html">terrorism in London in 2012</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/weeks-from-olympic-games-rio-worries-about-rising-crime-police-cutbacks/2016/06/08/16343886-2c0b-11e6-b9d5-3c3063f8332c_story.html">crime during</a> Rio de Janeiro in 2016 to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/10/05/national/2020-games-cyberattacks/">cyberattacks at the last summer games in Tokyo</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Paris in 2024, the official said, “you have everything.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ISIS: Down but not out</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, French police <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/french-officials-foil-olympics-terrorism-plot-/7638153.html">arrested an 18-year-old Chechen national</a> who was accused of plotting to attack a soccer game at the Paris Olympics, alleging that he “wanted to attack spectators, but also security forces and die as a martyr.” A month earlier, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/france-spain-tighten-security-champions-league-games-citing-islamic-state-2024-04-09/">security was tightened</a> at Champions League soccer games around the continent after ISIS threatened to launch drone attacks on the elite European club tournament.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been no known comparable threat to the Olympics, but the attack on the Crocus Concert Hall near Moscow that killed <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/23/24109865/moscow-crocus-city-hall-theater-terrorist-attack-russia-isis-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war">more than 130 people in March</a> was a wake-up call to many officials: While greatly diminished, the threat from groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS has not disappeared. “If you can do Moscow, you can do Paris,” Gilles Kepel, a French expert on terrorism, <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/04/29/beware-global-jihadists-are-back-on-the-march">told the Economist</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Responsibility for the Moscow attack was claimed by Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), the group’s Afghan affiliate in Afghanistan and Central Asia. (Khorasan is a historical name for a region that includes Afghanistan and parts of several neighboring countries.) In the years since the dismantling of ISIS’s territorial “caliphate” in parts of Syria and Iraq, ISIS-K has emerged as arguably the most dangerous and high-profile of the group’s global affiliates. It carried out a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-vows-revenge-after-biggest-attack-since-1979-revolution-2024-01-04/">bombing that killed more than 100 people</a> in Iran at the beginning of this year, as well as the attack in Kabul that killed 13 US troops and more than 100 Afghans during the chaotic evacuation of US personnel from Afghanistan. Authorities in Europe have broken up several alleged <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-charges-six-suspected-isis-k-members-over-attack-plots-2024-04-24/#:~:text=Germany%20charges%20seven%20suspected%20ISIS%2DK%20members%20over%20attack%20plots,-By%20Reuters&amp;text=BERLIN%2C%20April%2024%20(Reuters),prosecutor's%20office%20said%20on%20Wednesday.">ISIS-K plots</a> in recent months. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say the ISIS of today operates differently than it did in its heyday. Many of the attackers involved in the 2015 massacre had traveled to Syria for on-the-ground training. That’s no longer feasible. “All these things used to be done from ISIS hubs, but ISIS doesn’t have territory anymore. It’s totally dematerialized,” Wassim Nasr, a Paris-based terrorism analyst with the France 24 television network, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ISIS operatives in Europe aren’t quite the proverbial “lone wolves” either. They interact online with what Nasr called “cyber-coaches” abroad who advise them on planning and logistics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result, Nasr says, is that ISIS operatives in Europe are likely less trained and less able to carry out attacks than their predecessors. “That’s the difference from 10 years ago,” he says. “The European recruits who could have done this [carried out a successful attack on a high-security event like the Olympics] are now either dead or in jail.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A US security official told Vox that while authorities aren’t taking ISIS’s decline for granted, particularly in light of the Moscow attack, they see no sign of an active threat. “You have a lot of aspirational chatter online,” the official said. “What we’re not seeing is those aspirational views turned into anything concrete.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">October 7 and the war in Gaza have, of course, raised the level of tension as well. Israel’s presence at the games may drive some protests, as it did at the recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-gears-up-eurovision-final-amid-israel-protests-dutch-controversy-2024-05-11/#:~:text=There%20was%20also%20booing%20when,slogan%20%22United%20by%20music%22.">Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden</a>. French authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/france-give-24-hour-protection-israeli-olympics-team-amid-gaza-tensions-2024-07-22/">announced this week</a> that the Israeli Olympic team would be given 24-hour protection after a left-wing lawmaker said the team was not welcome and should be protested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US official said street protests, whether about Gaza or anything else, were not a major security concern and that French authorities were well-equipped to handle them: “It’s the national pastime here. It’s what the French do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A greater concern is that the events in the Middle East could inspire violent one-off attacks by individuals. Europol recorded over a <a href="https://www.icct.nl/publication/terrorism-threat-2024-paris-olympics-learning-past-understand-present">dozen jihadist terror plots in Europe</a> in the nine months following October 7 compared to just six in all of 2022. These include the ISIS sympathizer who <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20231017-killer-of-french-school-teacher-claims-attack-for-islamic-state-group">stabbed a schoolteacher to death</a> in Northern France in October, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67604591">killing of a German tourist</a> in a hammer and knife attack near the Eiffel Tower in December.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moscow rules</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the first time in years, European security officials may be worried less about non-state groups like ISIS than about a hostile government. The continent has been on increasingly high alert for acts of sabotage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/europe-on-high-alert-after-suspected-moscow-linked-arson-and-sabotage">orchestrated by the Russian government</a>, linked to the war in Ukraine. Russian agents have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541">accused of plotting sabotage attacks</a> against military targets in Germany, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f8207823-f5e1-4caf-934d-67c648f807bf">interfering with railways in the Czech Republic</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/suspects-alleged-russia-linked-uk-arson-attack-face-trial-next-year-2024-05-10/#:~:text=United%20Kingdom-,Suspects%20in%20alleged%20Russia%2Dlinked%20UK%20arson,to%20face%20trial%20next%20year&amp;text=LONDON%2C%20May%2010%20(Reuters),British%20court%20heard%20on%20Friday.">arson attacks in the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/europe-on-high-alert-after-suspected-moscow-linked-arson-and-sabotage">Lithuania</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, it was reported that US and German authorities had foiled a Russian plot to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot/index.html">assassinate the CEO of Rheinmetall</a>, Germany’s largest defense contractor and a significant contributor of ammunition to the Ukrainian war effort. US military bases across Europe were recently placed on high alert because of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/intelligence-russian-sabotage-threat-us-bases-europe/index.html">intelligence about potential Russian sabotage attacks</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, a Russian-Ukrainian man <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/06/27/man-arrested-with-explosives-near-paris-airport-was-part-of-vast-russian-sabotage-campaign_6675959_7.html#:~:text=The%2026%2Dyear%2Dold%20Russian,sabotage%20campaign%20orchestrated%20by%20Moscow.">was injured while making explosives</a> near Paris’s Charles De Gaulle airport. French authorities say he had been planning to attack a hardware store in Paris as part of a Moscow-orchestrated sabotage campaign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the recent NATO summit in Washington, Gabrielius Landsbergis, foreign minister of Lithuania, referred to these events saying, “I’m not sure it can be called “hybrid events” or “gray zone events any longer. It’s quite clear that [these are] terrorist attacks by a hostile neighboring country against NATO countries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Petter Nesser, an expert on terrorism in Europe with the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, told Vox that while it can be very difficult to attribute some of these events to Russia directly, it is clear that “Russia wants to sow discord and weaken cooperation among European states to help them have their way in Ukraine. They have shown in the past they can use their spy networks and proxies to sow discord.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The exclusion of Russia and Belarus — at least officially — from the Games may make them an even more tempting target for sabotage. This need not take place in physical space. The Olympics are always the target of cyberattacks, and British authorities have alleged that Russia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/19/russia-planned-cyber-attack-on-tokyo-olympics-says-uk">plotted large-scale cyberattacks</a> against the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 before they were postponed due to the coronavirus. French organizers say these Games are facing an “unprecedented level of threat” online, and not just from the Kremlin. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The AI eye in the sky</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the numerous threats, Olympic organizers have promised to turn the French capital into the “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-paris-corruption-terrorism-crime-2c64905237dbd8fb6ed2aa6dde92a08a">safest place in the world</a>” during the games, an effort that involved the deployment of some <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-olympics-olympic-games-security-e8f9b8812dc06dae22ffdfad9d15858e">30,000 police per day</a> — and up to 45,000 during the Opening Ceremony — including reinforcements from around 40 countries. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Authorities are also using a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics-how-france-plans-use-ai-keep-paris-2024-safe-2024-03-08/">controversial artificial intelligence system to</a> analyze images captured by surveillance cameras around the city in real-time to identify potential threats such as unusual behavior, abandoned objects, or weapons. French legislators had to <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/tech-24/20230324-france-passes-controversial-ai-surveillance-bill-ahead-of-2024-olympics">amend the country’s laws</a> last year to allow for deployment of the new technology. The system was successfully tested at a Depeche Mode concert in Paris in March. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Privacy advocates worry that the use of the system opens up the floodgates to future use of AI technology to undermine privacy and criminalize what authorities deem to be aberrant or unusual behavior in crowds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When the next event comes up in another country, they will, of course, look at France and whether or not there was a political reaction,” Patrick Breyer, a German minister of the European Parliament who organized an open letter protesting the use of the system, told Vox. “There’s a risk this will become standard procedure in connection with large events.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before every Olympics, there is a tendency in media coverage to <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/pre-olympics-bummers.html">accentuate the negative</a>: terrorist risk, political controversy, shoddy facilities, crime, environmental damage. Once the Games start and the athletes are on the court or off the blocks, these issues tend to be brushed aside, for better or worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All indications so far are that the Paris Olympics will be a safe and successful Games. US security officials who spoke with Vox emphasized that for all the threats, they have no concerns about the French authorities’ ability to handle them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since 1993, before every Olympics the UN General Assembly has voted to urge member-states to observe the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/olympic-truce">Olympic Truce</a>, which calls for a cessation of hostilities during the course of the Games. This Olympics was no different, with the vote passing in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympic Truce has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/what-is-the-olympic-truce-5ea915f2f856d2b1c5edba2e9fc23cbe">always been more aspiration than reality</a>, and between the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, not to mention countless other conflicts around the globe, we can be sure that war won’t come to a pause during the two weeks of the Paris Games. But as International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/un-general-assembly-adopts-olympic-truce-for-paris-2024">said at the UN that day</a>: “The Olympic Games are the only event in our fragile world where people can still come together in peace and harmony.” The hope can only be that the thousands of athletes and the millions of spectators who will gather in Paris can be kept safe from a fragile world beyond the Games.</p>

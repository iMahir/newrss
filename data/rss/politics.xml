<p class="has-text-align-none">By now, you’ve probably heard the message loud and clear from Democrats: This election is all about unity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Today, Explained</em> podcast team has been at the Democratic National Convention in  Chicago this week, and inside and outside the perimeter of the United Center, Democrats are buzzing with exuberance and relief: They now believe they have a real shot at winning the White House in 2024, and the party’s toughest issues are not a welcome topic of conversation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tonight, after accepting the party’s nomination earlier in the week from the campaign trail, Kamala Harris will appear in Chicago to close out the convention, carrying the mantle of the “renewed sense of hope” that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/367899/michelle-obama-dnc-convention-speech-2024-hope">Michelle Obama</a> — and the rest of the Democratic Party — have bestowed upon her. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, though, <em>Today, Explained </em>sat down with three Black women delegates for Harris to ask about the thorniest challenges, from Gaza policy to identity politics, that Democrats will face in these next 11 weeks before Election Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The delegates are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Illinois Lt. Gov. <a href="https://ltgov.illinois.gov/">Juliana Stratton</a>, 58 </li>



<li><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Hala_Ayala">Hala Ayala</a>, former Virginia State General Assembly member, 51  </li>



<li><a href="https://mojenkins.com/">Mo Jenkins</a>, precinct chair in Harris County, Texas, 25</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All three committed to cast their votes for Harris and consider it their role to support and defend Democratic Party policies. But we picked at the party’s scabs a little bit and found that even the most faithful Democrats were willing to acknowledge that Black voters and nonvoters are no longer the assured bloc of support they have been for decades and that the Israel-Palestine conflict has caused a worrisome fissure between the official party and young progressives. <br><br>Here&#8217;s what they had to say. You can hear more of the discussion <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> on <em>Today, Explained.</em> </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2166931587.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.75214828329,100,78.49570343342" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A delegate turns their back in protest during a ceremonial roll call vote during the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> <strong>Gaza and the US policy on Israel remain an open sore for young progressives</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans’ disapproval of Israeli military actions in Gaza eased this summer, but 48 percent still disapprove, according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646955/disapproval-israeli-action-gaza-eases-slightly.aspx">Gallup poll</a> conducted in June. This week, thousands of protesters, mostly <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/12/6/23990673/keffiyeh-symbolism-palestinian-history">keffiyeh</a>-clad and young, were waiting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris — or “Genocide Joe and Killer Kamala,” to them — in Chicago. On Monday, they gathered at Union Park and marched along a circuitous route outside the convention center to demand that the US end aid to Israel. They will march the same route Thursday ahead of Harris’s acceptance speech.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a live issue for many voters, but especially people like Hala Ayala, who is of Lebanese descent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ayala points out that Harris called for an &#8220;immediate ceasefire&#8221; back in March, and told us she’d met Harris and felt seen on the issue of Gaza. “I took that authentically because that&#8217;s who she is, and I took that as there&#8217;s more work to be done,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue of Gaza is also fraught for Gen Z politician Mo Jenkins. Nearly 50 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaning young adults under 30 say they <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/younger-americans-stand-out-in-their-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/">sympathize more with Palestinians</a> than Israelis, according to Pew. That doesn’t always line up with the party’s loyalties: The Biden administration just approved the sale of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-approves-20-billion-weapons-sales-israel-hamas-backs-out-cease-fire-talks/">$20 billion in arms to Israel</a> over the next five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When her Black constituents complain to her about pro-Palestinian activists refusing to back a Black woman candidate for president or not paying enough attention to ignored wars in Sudan or Congo, Jenkins said she tells them that she needs to join the system in order to bring about change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When they ask why she’s leaving them in the cold, her response is: “‘I&#8217;m not leaving you in the cold … We&#8217;re going to end up in the Arctic if I don&#8217;t do the work necessary to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president.’”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>The Democratic Party no longer has the default support of Black Americans</strong></strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It won’t be clear until after the election whether Black voters will turn out for Harris as they have for Democratic candidates in the past, but much has been made in recent months about flagging party support among Black Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/are-black-voters-really-leaving-democratic-party-election-2024/">Data supports</a> the idea that the once-reliable Dem bloc has splintered considerably since 2008, with more Black would-be voters saying they plan instead to cast a vote for former President Donald Trump. This was certainly true when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, and now, even with Harris as the Democrats’ candidate for president, a significant share of Black voters are still leaning toward Trump. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seventy percent of Black voters polled in July picked Harris over Trump on a hypothetical ballot, up from 59 percent who backed Biden in May and June polls, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. But Trump&#8217;s share of the Black vote also rose slightly, to 12 percent in July from 9 percent in May and June.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2166910710.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.694600113617,100,78.610799772766" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Charlamagne tha God was an outspoken critic of President Joe Biden’s candidacy and told Vox this spring that Black people “shouldn’t be beholden to any political party in this country.” | Bryan Bedder/Variety via Getty ImagesBryan Bedder/Variety via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Bryan Bedder/Variety via Getty ImagesBryan Bedder/Variety via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ayala, the Woodbridge, Virginia-based delegate, says the party is well aware of this shuffling of allegiances: “Yeah, there&#8217;s been a separation [between Black men and women on politics]. We&#8217;ve seen it. Like, we can&#8217;t deny that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jenkins said her Black male constituents in Houston often tell her they are voting for Trump “because he put a stimulus check in my hand.” She said she’ll remind them that their checks “<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/did-adding-trumps-name-slow-down-mailing-stimulus-checks-course-it-did">got delayed</a> because he wanted his name on it. … I think it&#8217;s a confusion about the policy process.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her concern is whether she and other Democrats can effectively set the record straight and make a case to enough of these Trump-interested Black voters ahead of Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>Identity politics could be a stumbling block</strong></strong></strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This has been a very identity- and social justice-forward DNC. That is a realm Kamala Harris is comfortable in, but it also raises the question for Democrats: Will a focus on identity help them win the White House in November?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many analysts have urged the Harris campaign to avoid talking outright about her race and gender. We asked our roundtable about the theoretical 49-year-old white man in Michigan, a toss-up vote who has voted Democrat in the past. Will Harris talking about her identity as a Black and South Asian woman undermine her chance of getting his vote?<br><br>Stratton, the Illinois lieutenant governor, said emphatically that the Democratic Party also needs to talk about economic issues that impact the whole middle class, to draw voters like him in with discussions of “workers’ rights and making sure that we stand with organized labor. There are a number of things that we&#8217;re going to have to lay out when we talk about reducing gas prices and food prices and all of those other things.<br><br>&#8220;Those are things that everyday Americans are going to want to know.” </p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When Vice President Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz as her running mate, many pundits <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kamala-harris-tim-walz-moderate-liberal-progressive-centrist.html">lamented her decision</a>. In their view, the Democratic nominee should have chosen a vice presidential candidate who could mitigate her liabilities, and balance out her party’s ticket — such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, Harris had been a liberal senator from one of America’s most left-wing states and then had run <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html">an exceedingly progressive primary campaign</a> in 2020. To win over swing-state undecideds, she needed to demonstrate her independence from her party’s most radical elements. And selecting the popular governor of a purple state — who had defied the Democratic activist base <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/josh-shapiro-vice-president-school-choice-voucher/">on education policy</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/josh-shapiro-israel-gaza-vice-president-harris">Israel’s war in Gaza</a>— would do just that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz, in this account, was just another liberal darling: As Minnesota governor, he had <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/06/why-are-minnesota-democrats-so-progressive.html">enacted a litany of progressive policies,</a> including restoring the <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2023/02/minnesota-supreme-court-state-can-bar-felons-from-voting-until-probation-ends/">voting rights</a> of ex-felons and creating a <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/24/you-belong-here-minnesota-house-passes-trans-health-refuge-bill?gclid=CjwKCAjwm4ukBhAuEiwA0zQxk5RdtxtcOM0fkfu6rK75hb7lRLLdAum34DpJQvpg5GJQ4ZL6OiHtzRoC5lcQAvD_BwE">refuge program for trans people</a> denied gender-affirming care in other states. Picking Walz might thrill the subset of Americans who would vote for Harris even if she burned an American flag on live TV and lit a blunt with its flames. But it would do nothing to reassure those who heard two words they did not like in the phrase, “California liberal.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there is more than one way to balance a ticket. Or so Harris’s team believes, if the third night of the Democratic National Convention is any guide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday night, Democrats used Walz’s nomination to associate their party with rural American culture and small-c conservative moral sentiments, while remaining true to a broadly progressive agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz may not be especially distinct from Harris ideologically. But he is quite different demographically and symbolically. Harris is the half-Jamaican, half-Indian daughter of immigrant college professors who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. Walz was born into a family whose roots in the United States went back to the 1800s, and raised in a Nebraska town of 400, where ethnic diversity largely consisted of several different flavors of Midwestern white (Walz himself is of <a href="https://www.irishecho.com/2024/8/walz-roots-traced-to-wexford">German, Irish, Swedish</a>, and <a href="https://www.luxcitizenship.com/tim-walzs-luxembourgish-roots-a-unique-connection-to-the-grand-duchy/">Luxembourgish</a> descent). Harris is an effortlessly cool veteran of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=UbDK0z5V0UQ">red carpets</a>. Walz is a dad joke that has attained corporal form. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her person and biography, Harris represents the America that has benefited unequivocally from the transformations of the past half-century — the cosmopolitan, multicultural nation that has greeted the advance of racial and gender equality with relief, and the knowledge economy that’s taken to globalization with relish. Walz, by contrast, was shaped by the America that feels more at home in the world of yesterday, at least as it is nostalgically misremembered — a world where moral intuitions felt more stable, rural economies seemed more healthy, and the American elite looked more familiar; the America that put Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in other words.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or at least, the Harris campaign has chosen to associate Walz with all of that America’s iconography, attempting to make it feel as included in the Democratic coalition as possible — without actually ceding much ground to conservative policy preferences. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The introduction to Walz’s speech Wednesday night looked like it could have been scripted by a chatbot asked to generate the antithesis of a “San Francisco liberal.” A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh6Ei1TU2Sg">video montage</a> celebrated Walz’s diligent work on his family farm growing up, his service in the US military, skills as a marksman, and — above all — success as a football coach. Democrats leaned especially hard on that last, most American item on Walz’s resume. Just before the party’s vice presidential nominee took the mic, a group of his former players decked out in their gridiron garments marched on stage to a fight song (not to be confused with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc">Fight Song</a>”). </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tim Walz&#039;s old football team is in the house! <a href="https://t.co/c1LqY5xL9P">pic.twitter.com/c1LqY5xL9P</a></p>&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1826458984351453485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s current persona is surely a half-truth. Unmentioned Wednesday night was that fact that, his parochial roots notwithstanding, Walz is a cosmopolitan intellectual who wrote a <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/lauded-by-former-students-tim-walz-wrote-his-masters-thesis-on-holocaust-education/">graduate thesis on Holocaust education</a> and has been to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/19/nx-s1-5081407/tim-walz-china-study-abroad">China roughly 30 times</a>. Still, the basic picture that Democrats aimed to paint rang true: Walz’s former students and players appeared to genuinely revere him, and the love between him and his family was palpable. It is possible to be worldly, liberal, and a quintessentially normal Midwesterner. And if Walz is not the latter, he certainly plays a good one on TV.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz put that persona to fine use in his address to the DNC. As both he and Harris have been doing <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367389/dnc-2024-kamala-harris-policies-trump-dangerously-liberal">throughout their young campaign</a>, Walz attempted to sell a liberal agenda in conservative terms. He framed social liberalism and safety net programs as logical extensions of rural American neighborliness, saying that growing up in a small town taught him that the “family down the road, they may not think like you do, they may not pray like you do. They may not love like you do. But they’re your neighbors. And you look out for them. And they look out for you. Everybody belongs. And everybody has a responsibility to contribute.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The antithesis of small-town, middle American values was not California progressives, in Walz’s telling, but Republican zealots. Speaking of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, the conservative movement’s blueprint for a second Trump admiration, Walz said:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Here’s the thing. It’s an agenda nobody asked for. It’s an agenda that serves nobody, except the richest and the most extreme amongst us. And it’s an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need.</em><em> </em><em>Is it weird? Absolutely. Absolutely. But it’s also wrong, and dangerous.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is some basis for believing that Democrats might be able to win over a small but significant fraction of Republican-leaning independents by wrapping center-left policies in conservative packaging. Some political scientists <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2019/05/political-messages-values-matter-policy">have found</a> that when moderate and conservative voters are presented with a progressive, Democratic economic policy idea — that is justified on the grounds that it will help uphold “the values and traditions that were handed down to us: hard work, loyalty to our country and the freedom to forge your own path” — some do respond favorably (as do liberal voters, who take no offense at such abstract, traditionalist pieties).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Walz tying himself to rural American symbology — or Harris tying herself to “Coach Walz” — will be enough to blunt Trump’s attacks on the Democratic nominee’s supposed “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4834669-trump-fake-photo-harris-communist/">communism</a>” remains to be seen. But the Democratic ticket is at least trying to make right-leaning Midwesterners feel like they belong (even if they do not think like Democrats do).</p>

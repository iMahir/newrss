<p class="has-text-align-none">Doug Emhoff is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-second-gentleman.html">just a guy</a> who loves his wife.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At countless <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-07-25/doug-emhoff-joins-call-for-wifes-black-queer-supporters-tells-of-learning-biden-was-out" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-07-25/doug-emhoff-joins-call-for-wifes-black-queer-supporters-tells-of-learning-biden-was-out">fundraisers</a> and campaign events, he gushes about his spouse of 10 years, vice president and current presidential candidate Kamala Harris. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband.html">gives interviews</a> about the importance of men supporting the women in their lives. He visits <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/07/24/doug-emhoff-husband-of-kamala-harris-campaigns-in-portland/">Planned Parenthood clinics</a> to champion reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is revolutionary stuff for the spouse of a top political leader, but Americans are so starved for high-profile male feminists — especially guys who don’t demand praise or <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/iexplorer/woke-bae-day">take themselves too seriously</a> — that Emhoff has claimed a prominent spot in the cultural zeitgeist. He’s a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/17/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff">zaddy</a>, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/style/doug-emhoff-dunit-merchandise.html">pinup</a>, <a href="https://x.com/onedankmom/status/1815968661888184686">“TikTok’s white boy of the month.”</a>  He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/style/doug-emhoff-dunit-merchandise.html">his own dedicated fan base</a> (which Vanity Fair has questionably christened <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/second-gentleman-doug-emhoffs-insatiable-fanbase">the D-Unit</a>). And now, as America’s potential first-ever “first gentleman,” he’s taking his biggest stage yet: On Tuesday, Emhoff will be speaking at the Democratic National Convention, and then is expected to introduce his wife as she accepts the Democratic nomination two nights later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last man to help his wife campaign for president was former President Bill Clinton, who brought his own baggage to the role, and sometimes struggled not to make the campaign <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/10/05/496670378/is-bill-clinton-helping-or-hurting-his-wifes-campaign">all about him</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff, by contrast, has so far been able to serve as an advocate for his wife — and for American women in general — without hogging the spotlight himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, he’s already had to address a long-ago affair that <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/08/kamala-harris-president-campaign-2024-husband-doug-emhoff.html">challenges his loyal wife-guy image</a>. And, if Harris is elected, he’ll have to chart his own course as the first man to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/fila/learn/historyculture/first-lady.htm">hold a quasi-official role</a> that, for centuries, has been defined by women.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The role of first spouse is already changing, with first ladies <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/jill-biden-make-history-1st-lady-hold-paid/story?id=75317759">keeping their jobs</a> and playing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/opinion/michelle-obama-book-becoming.html">larger role in public life</a>. Emhoff could have the opportunity — and, some might argue, the responsibility — to transform it even further, ushering in a new era when a first spouse is not always a wife, and when young men can look to the White House to learn not just how to lead, but how to follow.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So who is Doug Emhoff, and what do his history and background say about how he might approach the role of first gentleman?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“I’m just, you know, a husband”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff and Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/22242368/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband-vice-president">met in 2013</a>, and by all accounts were quickly smitten with each other. “The moment I met Kamala, I knew I was in love,” Emhoff <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/doug-emhoff-first-gentleman-vice-president-kamala-harris?utm_medium=social&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_brand=gq&amp;utm_social-type=owned">wrote in GQ</a> in 2021. He was a successful lawyer, and she was already the attorney general of California. They married in 2014, and Harris <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a27422434/kamala-harris-stepmom-mothers-day/">became “Momala”</a> to his two teenage children from his first marriage, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/cole-ella-emhoff-kamala-harris-vance-childless-rcna163820">Cole</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/style/ella-emhoff-met-gala.html">Ella</a> (who have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/us/politics/kamala-harris-stepmom-cole-ella-emhoff.html">objects of public fascination</a> in their own right).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris and Emhoff maintained their separate careers, even as she ran for president in 2020 — until Joe Biden chose Harris as his running mate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the campaign trail, Emhoff served as his wife’s No. 1 fan and enthusiastic if slightly goofy surrogate. “I’m just, you know, a husband, and I’m here to tell people why I love Kamala,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-second-gentleman.html">reportedly told</a> Chasten Buttigieg, another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/politics/political-spouse-chasten-buttigieg-doug-emhoff.html">popular political husband</a>, in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Harris became vice president, Emhoff appeared to take his role as second gentleman seriously, visiting the Library of Congress to learn more about <a href="https://x.com/DouglasEmhoff/status/1350462742457688066">previous second spouses</a>. “I understand that I am the first gentleman to hold this role,” he said at the time, “and I certainly do not want to be last.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Comments like that have made him a popular <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/17/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff">crush</a> among feminists and progressives, who <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff">call him a “hot Jewish dad”</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/style/doug-emhoff-dunit-merchandise.html">buy mugs</a> with his face on them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff presents his support for his wife not just as an act of love, but as an example of what a feminist husband can look like. “Lifting women up so that they can carry out important roles is a very manly thing,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband.html">said in a 2022 interview</a>. “That is not taking away opportunities from men.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, how should a first gentleman be?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the role was invented in the 18th century, the first lady was simply supposed to “serve as the President’s hostess at social events,” <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/cas/jellison">Katherine Jellison</a>, a history professor at Ohio University who has studied first ladies, told Vox in an email. Eleanor Roosevelt is widely seen as the first presidential spouse to become a “public figure in her own right” and to champion a public-service cause, Jellison said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though her immediate successors, Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower, didn’t follow that pattern, Jackie Kennedy devoted herself to the <a href="https://www.nypap.org/preservation-history/jacqueline-kennedy-onassis/">preservation and restoration of the White House</a> and other historic buildings, and every first lady since has devoted herself to at least one cause or issue, Jellison said. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/dr-jill-biden/">Jill Biden</a>, for example, works with military families and on the administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot/">cancer research initiative</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last three first ladies have also challenged Americans’ expectations that the role would be filled by “a white, U.S.-born woman who identifies primarily as a homemaker,” Jellison said. Michelle Obama, America’s first Black first lady, also came from a powerful career as a lawyer and hospital administrator — and <a href="https://qz.com/work/1477671/in-becoming-michelle-obama-recalls-falling-in-love-at-work">had been her husband’s superior</a> at work. Melania Trump was an immigrant, the first first lady to be born outside the US in <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-could-be-first-non-us-born-first-lad/">nearly 200 years</a> (she also often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/opinion/sunday/want-melania-trump-in-the-white-house-pay-her.html">bowed out of the social aspects</a> of the role). Jill Biden has continued her career as a <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/jill-biden">community college professor</a> and has served as a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/13/jill-biden-democrats-2024">crucial adviser</a> to her husband.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The women who have most recently held the role of first lady reflect the greater diversity of American womanhood in the 21st century,” Jellison said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over time, the first lady’s hostess role has diminished — for example, neither <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/21/politics/trump-white-house-china/index.html">Melania Trump</a> nor Jill Biden chose a pattern of official White House china, a tradition <a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-timelines/white-house-china-service">since the 19th century</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As first gentleman, Emhoff would have the opportunity to go a step further, reflecting the diversity of relationships in America today — including those that began <a href="https://www.vox.com/22242368/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband-vice-president">later in life</a>, create <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/us/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff-family-inauguration.html">blended families</a>, and allow space for a female partner to hold a high-powered, even all-consuming, job.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff is likely to bring his own priorities to the White House if his wife does end up there. “He might continue to follow Jill Biden’s lead and keep his ‘day job’ teaching law at Georgetown University,” Jellison said. He would also probably continue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/world/europe/doug-emhoff-antisemitism-paris.html">speaking out against antisemitism</a>, an important role for him both personally and politically. He would be the first Jewish first spouse, as well as a key Jewish surrogate in the administration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of “the nice men of the left”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that Harris is running for president, Emhoff’s brand of feminist masculinity stands in stark contrast to the more combative styles embraced by high-profile men across the aisle. When vice-presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance began to get renewed attention for his comments calling Harris a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/dear-j-d-vance-childless-cat-ladies-are-people-too.html">“childless cat lady,”</a> Emhoff responded that the remark had “hurt [his] feelings.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You’re telling a lot of people in this country and this world that they don’t matter,” he said in <a href="https://cafe.com/stay-tuned/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff/">an interview</a> with Vox Media <a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/stay-tuned-with-preet">podcast host</a> and former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s also shown himself able to talk easily about reproductive health care, something <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/366495/trump-medication-abortion-mifepristone">Trump certainly can’t match</a>. On a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/tim-walz-doug-emhoff-democrats-nice-men-of-the-left.html">recent visit to a Planned Parenthood clinic</a>, he talked about a “post-<em>Dobbs</em> hellscape” in which “you can’t get a Pap smear; you can’t get basic care.” He’s also <a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-southeast-advocates/news/second-gentleman-of-the-united-states-doug-emhoff-joins-planned-parenthood-southeast-advocates-and-men4choice-encourages-men-to-be-active-allies-for-choice">described abortion restrictions</a> as “affecting all Americans, not just women.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s earned him praise from progressives, with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/tim-walz-doug-emhoff-democrats-nice-men-of-the-left.html">Rebecca Traister of New York magazine</a> describing Emhoff and presumptive vice presidential nominee Tim Walz as the “nice men of the left.” These men, Traister writes, “are presenting a different definition of masculine strength tied to women’s liberation and full civic participation and all but declaring it a new norm.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Emhoff had an easier job as second gentleman than he has as a top surrogate in his wife’s campaign, or than he’ll have if she wins. As his profile rises, he’s had to own up to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/doug-emhoff-affair.html">an affair he had</a> during his first marriage, with a teacher at his children’s school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions,” he said in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/doug-emhoff-affair.html">a statement to the Times</a>. “I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The revelation of the affair threatens to tarnish Emhoff’s uxorious image somewhat — “What happens when it comes out that a wife guy has been a less-than-perfect spouse in the past?” <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/08/kamala-harris-president-campaign-2024-husband-doug-emhoff.html">Heather Schwedel asks at Slate</a>. For now, many Americans seem willing to forgive (one X user <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/08/kamala-harris-president-campaign-2024-husband-doug-emhoff.html">called him</a> a “born-again wife guy”). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if Emhoff does find himself in the role of first gentleman, he’ll face more scrutiny — and new challenges.&nbsp;<br>Above all, however, Emhoff would have a chance, at a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24078282/zyn-pouches-tucker-carlson-schumer-republicans-2024">difficult</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns"> </a><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns">moment</a> for American masculinity, to show what it’s like to be a man in an important but secondary role. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His last four years in public life have been built on the idea that there is dignity, honor, and joy in backing up the woman you love. In a time when women’s autonomy feels <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/354635/divorce-no-fault-states-marriage-republicans">ever more in question</a>, it may be the most important contribution he can make.</p>

She is as committed to our reproductive and civil rights as she is to taking on corporate greed.”</p><p><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> outlined the historic nature of Harris’s nomination: “I see the freedom to look our children in the eye and say, ‘In America, you can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you,’ and mean it. And you know what? On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris, raising her hand and taking the oath of office as our 47th president.”</p><p>Speakers from red states gave personal accounts of the <strong>impacts of abortion bans</strong>. Hadley Duvall, from Kentucky, described how she was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant at age 12: “I can’t imagine not having a choice. But today, that’s the reality for many women and girls across the country because of Donald Trump’s abortion bans.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/20/election-dnc-donald-trump-kamala-harris-barack-michelle-obama-updates">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/20/election-dnc-donald-trump-kamala-harris-barack-michelle-obama-updates</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/20/election-dnc-donald-trump-kamala-harris-barack-michelle-obama-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 10:17:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2024 Florida Primary live updates: Polling sites prepare for voters]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/2024-florida-primary-live-updates-091317843.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/2024-florida-primary-live-updates-091317843.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 09:13:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Suspension of most Columbia students disciplined over Gaza protests is removed]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/suspension-most-columbia-students-disciplined-012640294.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/suspension-most-columbia-students-disciplined-012640294.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 01:26:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[She says Israeli military killed her husband and daughter.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans at the highest levels of government and politics — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pushes-baseless-claim-immigrants-eating-pets-rcna170537">including former President Donald Trump</a> —<strong> </strong>are pushing a bizarre message: that Haitian immigrants are killing and eating pets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The claim is false, but that didn’t stop <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pushes-baseless-claim-immigrants-eating-pets-rcna170537">Trump from spreading it during Tuesday evening’s presidential debate</a>, declaring that “the people that came in” are “eating the pets of the people that live” in Springfield, Ohio.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strange idea that Ohio is home to pet kidnappers and eaters was popularized in part by that state’s senator,<strong> </strong>JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee. On Monday morning, Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833148904864465117">posted</a> on X the false claim that “reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” In the same tweet, he claimed that “Haitian illegal immigrants” are “causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The claim has caught fire among the GOP and has now made it all the way to the party’s leader. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the record, there is no evidence that any Haitian immigrant ate a cat in Springfield, Ohio, or anywhere else in the United States, for that matter. But the lack of factual evidence hasn’t stopped the GOP from pushing the nativist narrative, which seems designed to play off bigotry and suspicion against the mostly Black population of Haitian immigrants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 300,000 previously unauthorized migrants from Haiti <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/g-s1-7061/migrants-haiti-tps-immigration-parole">received temporary protected status in June</a>, which means these Haitian immigrants are now — despite Vance’s Monday suggestion otherwise — legally present in the United States. Still, Trump and other Republicans’ attacks on these immigrants come at a moment when more <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris">Americans have grown skeptical of immigration</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after President Joe Biden took office, the United States experienced a surge of migrants at its southern border — much of it <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality">fueled by unrest</a> in several Caribbean and Latin American nations following the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans used this wave of migration to attack Biden’s border policies, and to claim there was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality">crisis at the border</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/9/26/23875580/new-york-city-migrant-crisis-influx-eric-adams">busing efforts</a> by Republican leaders in border states sent large groups of migrants to cities and towns across the country, putting many Americans face to face with migrants <a href="https://www.vox.com/24063986/cities-migrant-crisis-border-overwhelmed-shelters">for the first time</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this comes amid a competitive 2024 presidential race, where both candidates have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370958/harris-trump-debate-winners-losers">rushed to frame themselves as tough on immigration</a>. Trump has long <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris">campaigned on restricting immigration</a>, while Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/369177/democrats-kamala-harris-truce-immigration-progressive-border-security">touted a strict border security bill</a> that she supports — and which Trump pushed his fellow Republicans to kill.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These factors — perhaps most of all the rise in anti-immigrant sentiment — probably explain why a sitting senator felt it was wise to share a meme claiming that if Americans don’t vote for former President Donald Trump, immigrants will eat your cats, and why a former president repeated the vile claim during a national debate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where the hell did the false claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets come from?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that Haitians are roaming the streets kidnapping pets seems to have emerged from Vance’s state of Ohio.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Springfield’s Police Division said on Monday that there have been <a href="https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/springfield-police-say-no-reports-of-pets-stolen-after-viral-social-media-post/3WSIZQNHQVE4NP4TS5BVHBB2PY/">no reports</a> of any pets being stolen or eaten in that city. However, there apparently was an incident in Canton, Ohio — a nearly three-hour drive from Springfield — where a woman was charged with cruelty to animals for allegedly killing and eating a cat. But there’s no evidence that this woman is an immigrant or of Haitian descent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that lack of evidence, the woman appears to have been identified as of Haitian descent in <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/how-did-fake-news-about-haitian-migrants-eating-cats-spread-from-a-malaysian-propagandist-to-jd-vance/">far-right tweets</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent days, the completely unsubstantiated slur against Haitian immigrants began to spread outside of far-right spaces after several prominent right-wing figures credulously tweeted it out. On Sunday, provocateur Charlie Kirk <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1832883283199471676">tweeted the claim</a>, including a screenshot from a pseudonymous Facebook post suggesting that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are butchering and eating dogs. Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1832968811890237947">billionaire Elon Musk</a> chimed in to claim that “people’s pet cats are being eaten.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By Monday morning, the claim had spread to Vance — before being picked up by other prominent elected Republicans, official Republican Party accounts, and Trump himself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Republicans want nativist sentiment to be front and center in this election</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance has long sought to stoke anti-Haitian sentiment in Springfield, a small Ohio city that recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/springfield-ohio-school-bus-crash-haiti-immigrants.html">attracted as many as 20,000 Haitians</a> seeking jobs in newly opened factories and warehouses. Tensions grew between the new immigrants and some of the city’s more longtime residents after a Haitian immigrant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a fatal bus crash in 2023. Vance has claimed that the city is “overwhelmed” by the new residents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, skepticism of immigration <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris">spiked nationally</a> in recent years as the amount of migration at the southern border grew.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/temp.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.137387245316,100,51.725225509367" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Nicole Narea/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s not surprising that many prominent members of the Republican Party, a party that frequently <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/rnc-trump-rachel-morin-family-speech-1926639">flags isolated crimes committed by immigrants</a> to fuel nativist sentiment, latched onto an unfounded internet rumor about Haitians and cats as “proof” that immigrants present a problem (that Republicans can fix).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, none of this context changes the fact that Republicans at the pinnacle of the party, including sitting US senators and even the party’s two nationwide candidates, see no downside to spreading racist, completely unfounded rumors based on random social media posts spread by far-right trolls.</p>

And CNN’s snap poll suggested that voters thought Harris won by a margin of 63% to 37% – nearly as big a margin as Trump achieved over Biden last time around.

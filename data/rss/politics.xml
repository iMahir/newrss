<p class="has-text-align-none">There is not one contradiction at the heart of the incoming Trump administration’s political project. There are two.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first centers on economic policy&nbsp;— or, more fundamentally, the role of government itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One camp, exemplified by <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/383859/musk-trump-vance-silicon-valley">Elon Musk</a> and traditional big business, sees Trumpism as a celebration of individual greatness and unfettered capitalism. The second camp, including economic nationalists and RFK Jr.’s crunchy hippy types, believes Trumpism has a mandate to try to transform American society, including by attacking the practices of large corporations that do not fit their nationalist vision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second centers on foreign policy —&nbsp;or, more fundamentally, the purpose of America in the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One camp, exemplified by Secretary of State pick Marco Rubio, sees the United States as the world’s rightful leader,&nbsp;one that has not only a right but an obligation to assert its will across the globe. Another camp, exemplified by Secretary of Defense pick Pete Hegseth, sees the United States as a more ordinary country whose interests are served by being less involved in other countries’ issues like the Ukraine war, but being more violently involved when core American interests are at stake.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, there are areas of overlap between these groups. Both sides of the role-of-government divide believe that America will be well-served by a mass deportation campaign; both sides of the foreign policy divide support aggressively confronting China and waging a global war on jihadist groups like ISIS.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet these overlaps are limited and partial points of convergence between deeply divided ideological currents. The real connective tissue between the various Trump 2.0 factions is disdain for the cultural left and the “deep state” in Washington. The anti-left culture war has become, more or less, the central ideological principle of the modern Republican Party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the campaign trail, it’s easy for Trump’s diverse set of allies to join together based on this shared animosity. But when governing, the administration will be forced to make choices in areas where its leaders disagree at a fundamental level, leading not only to internal conflict but potentially even policy chaos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Trump coalition’s contradictions, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every administration has its internal disagreements. Typically, however, those disputes take place within a relatively narrow band: The political party they hail from is mostly clear on what it stands for and why. The Biden administration, for example, has generally agreed on a more redistributionist economic policy, even if certain policy issues, like how large the post-Covid stimulus should be, were subjects of major internal debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump-dominated GOP, by contrast, is ideologically adrift. Its nominal ideology is Trumpism, but Trumpism has little in the way of a defined ideological core. Its core tenets, total personal fealty to Trump and a generalized illiberal nationalism, are flexible, admitting of a wide band of different policy visions on a host of different issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the first Trump administration, the main fight was over just how much deference Trumpist impulses deserved. You had Trump in the Oval Office, but he was surrounded by establishment figures like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and chief of staff John Kelly, who saw their job as curbing his worst impulses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the second Trump administration, the situation will be very different. The Mattis and Kelly types have either been purged from the party or forced to bend the knee. The question now is not whether Trumpism is leading the party, but what Trumpism actually stands for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to think about the divides on this question is which part of the classic “make America great again” slogan the various camps emphasize: America or greatness.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to domestic policy, the “greatness” side includes folks like Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and traditional Republican business elites. They see the attack on “the deep state” as, in part, a war on government red tape that stands in the way of progress, innovation, and the entrepreneurial spirit. Trump, for them, is proof that one man can change the world if left to his own devices. They aim to unleash similar spirits across the country and, non-coincidentally, advance their own business interests in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “America” camp, by contrast, is more inclined to emphasize collective solutions to America’s collective problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The chief advocates of mass deportations and across-the-board tariffs, like Steven Miller and Peter Navarro, are almost by definition not free marketeers. JD Vance aims to rebuild America along more conservative Christian lines, including by curbing the power of secular big business when he believes it threatens the organic unity of American society properly conceived. RFK Jr. and the “make American healthy again” movement see the war on government not as a campaign to shrink government per se, but rather to redirect its energies toward the problems they think really matter (vaccines, fluoridated water, and other such crank health concerns).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The foreign policy divide falls along similar lines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like Rubio and national security adviser pick Michael Waltz fall on the “greatness” side. They believe that the United States is destined to lead the world and ought to work to ensure that it remains safely atop the global power hierarchy. Challengers to the existing American-led order like Russia and especially China must be aggressively confronted, and hostile dictatorships like Iran must be brought in line by force if necessary. The American continents must be dominated, Monroe-doctrine style, advocating a far more aggressive policy toward Latin American leftist dictatorships like Venezuela and Cuba (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/marco-rubio-venezuela.html">as Rubio did in Trump’s first term</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other camp, including Hegseth and director of national intelligence pick Tulsi Gabbard, espouses a kind of narrower nationalism. Though they believe in American military strength, they care far less about aggressively protecting the existing political order. If Russia wishes to seize part of Ukraine, they suggest, that’s not really an American concern. The United States should instead be preoccupied with killing its enemies, advancing its narrowly construed interests, and protecting its border — up to and including <a href="https://www.lonestarlive.com/news/2024/11/defense-secretary-nominee-us-military-strikes-on-mexican-cartels-might-be-needed.html">launching a war in Mexico to battle drug cartels and human traffickers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t mean to say that these camps are fundamentally opposed. They are part of the same administration and share many of their boss’s core insights and enemies. They all agree to “make America great again” as a slogan but disagree on which parts of it to emphasize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In practice, this might lead to a whole host of predictable and significant conflicts inside the administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When RFK Jr. moves to put new <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/">regulatory barriers in the way of pharmaceutical research</a>, will Big Pharma and biotech executive Vivek Ramaswamy try to stop him?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When billionaires suggest financing the extension of Trump tax cuts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/18/gop-targets-medicaid-food-stamps/">by cutting the social safety net</a>, will Christian populist JD Vance stand up for the meek?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Marco Rubio pushes for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-nicolas-maduro-venezuela/">regime change in Venezuela</a>, will alleged anti-imperialist Tulsi Gabbard try to make him back off?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of these conflicts are hypothetical. Each is eminently predictable based on what the personalities involved have done in the past and promise to do in the future. If left unresolved, they threaten to create a kind of policy incoherence, with different aspects of the US government working at direct odds with each other, depending on who they answer to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If and when Trump steps in to resolve them, will he do so consistently? Will he say one thing publicly and do another privately, as so often happened in his first term? Or will the resolution so consistently favor one group over another that we can finally start saying Trumpism has a little more meat on its ideological bones?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is only one honest answer: We don’t know. But we can be sure the stakes are high for the Republican Party, the country, and most likely the entire world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Long before he officially pursued the presidency, Donald Trump railed against US trade deals. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510680463/donald-trumps-been-saying-the-same-thing-for-30-years">interviews dating back to the 1980s</a>, he told journalists that deals that benefited Asian and Middle Eastern trading partners consistently “ripped off” the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over decades, that charge may have turned into <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/trump-inroads-union-workers-pennsylvania/75962349007/">a winning election strategy</a>. As a first-term president and in his  2024 campaign, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/election2024/candidate-tracker/donald-trump">Trump argued that a lopsided global trading system</a> is not only responsible for a deficit between the US and China, but also behind a decline in American manufacturing and jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Trump has made a second-term promise to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/trump-tariff-plan-explained-expect-high-drama-and-a-slow-rollout">raise tariffs</a> — the taxes on imported goods that must be paid when they enter the US — even higher on China and other countries, while resurrecting those jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/">footwear, apparel, and auto-part companies</a> say they expect to pass the cost of such tariffs on to American consumers. <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-macroeconomic-and-price-estimates-tariffs-under-both-non-retaliation-and-retaliation">Yale University’s Budget Lab</a> projects that Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost the average American household up to $7,600 a year with initial price hikes as high as 5 percent. Those higher costs could potentially backfire on the president-elect’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/">campaign promise to make inflation “vanish completely.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s trade strategy is one that Greg Ip, chief economics commentator at the Wall Street Journal, says is a major departure from almost 80 years of US policy. In a conversation with Noel King, co-host of the <em>Today, Explained </em>podcast, Ip described how it might play out and have massive implications for the global economy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trade is a reality of economic life these days. What is Trump’s theory on it and how does it differ from his predecessors?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the United States, since the 1940s at least, there&#8217;s been a bipartisan consensus that more trade is good. And this came from a bipartisan view that this made our workers more productive, because they had bigger markets to sell into. It benefited our consumers because they got cheaper goods and a greater variety of goods. And it was also good for the US geopolitically because it helped us increase our economic bonds to countries that thought the same way we did, politically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump comes along and he argues: This entire regime has been much more to the advantage of other countries than it has been to the United States. Countries like Japan and then Germany and now China have taken advantage of the United States’s fixation on free trade to increase their trade surplus with the US, sell us lots of manufactured goods, and not buy very much from the United States. So his entire mission, from his first term, and now into this one, is to reverse that relationship and, he hopes, force those countries to buy more from the US, and Americans to buy more from each other instead of from importers. That&#8217;s the theory, anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> Donald Trump had a chance to do all of this from 2016 to 2020 when he was in office. What did he do?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He did raise tariffs, for example, in a series of rounds of tariff increases. He imposed tariffs on a wide range of products from China. And this was pursuant to a long-running case that complained that China was just systematically unfair to the United States, stealing our technology and putting up barriers to US exports to China. Then he imposed a variety of more bespoke tariffs on particular products.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So at the end of that first term … had Donald Trump gotten what he wanted? Had his plan worked?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the test of Donald Trump&#8217;s trade policy was a smaller trade deficit, then no, he didn&#8217;t really achieve what he wanted. The trade deficit when he left office was larger in dollar terms than when he entered office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Did some manufacturing jobs come back? Possibly. But there also appear to have been some costs. There were industries that had to pay more for their inputs because of tariffs, and they lost sales and possibly jobs. And some of our trading partners retaliated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our trade deficit with China did begin to shrink. At the same time, though, you saw our trade deficit with Mexico and Vietnam grow. And what that told us is that some businesses responded to Trump&#8217;s tariffs not necessarily by bringing production back to the United States, but by moving it to another country — out of China, into Vietnam, into Mexico — that were not quite as affected by the tariffs.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What are Donald Trump&#8217;s plans for a second term?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He wants to, number one, come down even harder on China. Instead of just putting tariffs on about half of China&#8217;s imports, he&#8217;s talked about a tariff on all Chinese imports of as much as 60 percent. And instead of sparing traditional US allies, he wants to impose an across-the-board tariff on everybody, of say, 10 to 20 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there&#8217;s a very big caveat to this, which is that we don&#8217;t really know if Trump will end up doing exactly what he&#8217;s talked about.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that Trump likes tariffs, but we also know that Trump likes to make deals. So, as in his first term, we might see that the threat of tariffs is primarily a leverage instrument —&nbsp;you know, a negotiating chip — in which he goes to countries that he thinks treat the United States unfairly and says, “Here are some things we want you to do differently. And if you do as we ask, then we won&#8217;t hit you with the tariffs that I&#8217;ve talked about.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How close can Donald Trump come to really and truly changing the way the world does trade?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s possible that Trump presses ahead with exactly what he said, raises tariffs on everybody, and then all those countries retaliate. They export less to us, we export less to them, trade shrinks, and everybody is worse off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s another possibility here, which is that a lot of folks in the United States and in other countries say, “You know, he&#8217;s right. The trading system was fundamentally good, but it went off the rails at some point. We need to get together. We need to remake that thing.” So I think another possibility is that we end up a few years from now with a different trading system, and perhaps a more realistic view of how China, above all — but some other countries, [too] — have not been playing by the rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think, as we learned from his first term, one thing with Donald Trump — you can be sure of this — is that you should expect the unexpected.<br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">the fall of <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>, Democratic lawmakers and reproductive rights advocates have maintained a clear strategy: Win a more progressive Democratic trifecta in 2024, eliminate the Senate filibuster, and pass comprehensive federal protections. When reporters asked about contingency plans — particularly given polls suggesting full Democratic control was unlikely — such questions were dismissed, cast as premature or defeatist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, with Donald Trump&#8217;s return to power and Republicans set to control Congress, that strategy is drawing fresh questions. The GOP has signaled some openness to compromise: While campaigning, Trump said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/19/politics/trump-abortion-ban-rape-incest/index.html">he supported abortion exceptions</a> in cases of “rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother,”<strong> </strong>and he promised to mandate insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Several Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/27/congress/maces-ivf-alternative-00143590">backed</a> <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/opinion/2024/03/11/congressman-mike-carey-says-hes-working-to-make-ivf-affordable/72886283007/">their own</a> <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-mccormick-pa-senate-race-family-policies-20240626.html">fertility treatment</a> bills. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7056/cosponsors">backed a Democratic-led IVF measure</a> and speaks openly about <a href="https://midhudsonnews.com/2024/08/04/rep-lawler-wants-to-help-families-conceive-children/">his family&#8217;s consideration</a> of the procedure. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) has <a href="https://www.ernst.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ernst-works-to-promote-access-to-safe-effective-birth-control">pushed legislation</a> to expand over-the-counter contraception.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But reproductive rights organizations are doubtful. &#8220;We are not willing to compromise when it comes to our ability to make decisions about our bodies, lives and future,&#8221; Gretchen Borchelt, of the National Women&#8217;s Law Center (NWLC), said on a press call the day after the election. “What is the compromise that would provide relief for Amber Nicole Thurman&#8217;s family who&#8217;s grieving her every single day?&#8221; added NWLC’s president Fatima<strong> </strong>Goss Graves, referring <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death">to a patient who died from sepsis</a> after being denied care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox asked six major advocacy groups if they would consider pushing for new federal protections under a Republican-led Congress, be it for IVF, birth control or abortion. Most avoided giving a direct answer, instead directing the conversation to Republican accountability and the harm caused by abortion bans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stance reflects a deeper calculation: that accepting anything less than people deserve —&nbsp;meaning access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care for any reason —&nbsp;would legitimize restrictions and undermine the broader fight for bodily autonomy. When asked about pursuing partial protections versus holding out for more Democrats, groups choose waiting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are really looking at this from a defensive position,” said Ryan Stitzlein, the vice president of political and government relations at Reproductive Freedom for All, the group formerly known as NARAL. “We <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373485/project-2025-abortion-ban-trump-comstock-mifepristone">read Project 2025</a>, we are very familiar with the folks in leadership on the Republican side … and are preparing for them to levy attacks on reproductive freedom at all levels of government on the administrative side.” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Polling suggests there may be political opportunities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the Biden era&#8217;s surprising bipartisan deals on thorny issues from <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/23/23180893/senate-gun-control-bipartisan-bill-2022-pass">gun control</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act">climate change</a>, there were never similar attempts to forge bipartisan compromise on reproductive rights. When a small group of Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation in 2022 to codify elements of <em>Roe</em>, abortion rights groups <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/22/23306142/kaine-collins-codify-roe-abortion-congress">quickly rejected the idea</a>, arguing in part that it did not go far enough. Even on issues like IVF and birth control, where Republican support seemed possible and anti-abortion groups held less sway, there were no serious efforts to find common ground. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, while many Republicans have sought to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/01/anti-abortion-movement-ivf-war-00149766">reassure voters that they support IVF</a>, their voting record thus far tells a different story. Many of those same lawmakers co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which could severely restrict fertility treatments by granting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24090347/alabama-ivf-ruling-fetal-personhood-abortion-embryos">legal personhood</a> from the moment of conception. Republicans have largely <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/17/republicans-block-ivf-bill-00179626">voted against Democratic IVF legislation</a>, while claiming they&#8217;d support narrower fertility treatment bills and criticizing Democrats for not being open to working on amendments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, polling suggests potential political opportunities. About <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/us/politics/republicans-birth-control-ivf.html">80 percent</a> of voters say protecting contraception access is &#8220;deeply important&#8221; to them, and 72 percent of Republican voters had a favorable view of birth control. IVF is even more popular: <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4507514-overwhelming-majority-americans-support-keeping-ivf-legal-for-women-poll/">86 percent of Americans</a> think it should be legal, <a href="https://www.iwv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/executive-summary-KAConsulting-poll-contraception.pdf">including 78 percent</a> of self-identified &#8220;pro-life advocates&#8221; and 83 percent of evangelical Christians. Americans&#8217; support for abortion rights <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/support-for-abortion-access-has-risen-since-supreme-court-overturned-roe-v-wade-poll-finds">has intensified</a> since the fall of <em>Roe</em>, and this reality shaped some Republicans’ rhetoric on the campaign trail. Newly elected Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Dave McCormick <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-mccormick-pa-senate-race-family-policies-20240626.html">ran on a platform</a> of fighting restrictions on fertility treatments and proposing a $15,000 tax credit for IVF.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some policy strategists have suggested that, regardless of Republican sincerity, Democrats and abortion rights groups might benefit from pushing votes on new IVF and birth control bills, even if they offer limited protections or codify certain provisions that advocates oppose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such moves could either win new concrete protections or expose Republican resistance. But Democratic leadership and abortion rights groups for now seem uninterested in this approach, preferring to maintain pressure for comprehensively restoring rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We haven&#8217;t seen a genuine effort from Republicans that they engage in this conversation,” Stitzlein said. “We’ve seen them propose bills to try to save face in response to <em>Dobbs</em> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility">Alabama IVF ruling</a>.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should Democrats keep their red line on abortion exceptions?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political math around abortion exceptions would seem straightforward. Trump ostensibly supports them. Most Americans, including many Republicans, believe abortion should be legal in cases of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">rape, incest, and threats to the</a><strong><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn"> </a></strong><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">parent’s life</a>. And women are being demonstrably harmed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html">lack of workable exceptions in state bans</a> today. One recent study estimated that more than 3 million women in the US will experience a pregnancy from rape in their lifetime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet when asked whether they would consider seeking federal protections for abortion exceptions during Republican control as a harm reduction measure, established advocacy groups showed no interest, pointing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/23997727/kate-cox-texas-abortion-ban">patients like Kate Cox</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">Amanda Zurawski</a> who almost<strong> </strong>lost their lives or fertility<strong> </strong>despite state bans with exceptions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;As we are seeing across the country, exceptions often don&#8217;t work in practice, so people should not take comfort in those or rely on them,&#8221; Rachana Desai Martin, chief government and external relations officer at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This position stems from a core belief: that any engagement with exceptions would validate the broader framework of restrictions. Some doctors on the ground in states with restrictive bans have bemoaned the lack of support they’ve received for carving out exceptions. “I worry that reproductive rights advocates may be digging into untenable positions and failing to listen to those affected most by the current reality,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/opinion/medical-exceptions-abortion-tennessee.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">wrote one</a> maternal-fetal medicine physician in Tennessee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the question of codifying emergency medical protections, Planned Parenthood Action Fund stressed in an email that, &#8220;narrow health exceptions or those that focus only on emergencies are a disservice to patients and their health care providers because every pregnancy is unique.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The position is particularly notable given these <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/supreme-court-refuses-to-say-whether-emtala-requires-hospitals-to-provide-stabilizing-abortions/">same groups&#8217;</a> <a href="https://reproductivefreedomforall.org/news/reproductive-freedom-for-all-statement-on-supreme-court-decision-on-emergency-abortion-care-case/">strong</a> <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-statement-on-leaked-supreme-court-decision-in-emtala-case">defense</a> of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) at the Supreme Court this year. The groups argued that EMTALA — which requires hospitals to provide “stabilizing treatment,” including emergency abortion care — represents a crucial federal protection for women in medical crises. Yet when asked about codifying the Biden administration’s interpretation of EMTALA or similar protections through legislation, the groups demurred.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Internationally, exceptions have served as imperfect stepping stones to broader rights. Colombia&#8217;s journey from total ban to full decriminalization began with three abortion exceptions in 2006 — for health risks, fatal fetal conditions, and rape. Over 16 years, advocates used these flawed measures to help build public support and legal precedent for expanding access, ultimately leading to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/05/10/1097570784/colombia-legalized-abortions-for-the-first-24-weeks-of-pregnancy-a-backlash-ensu">decriminalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">India and Spain followed similar trajectories. India&#8217;s 1971 Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act initially permitted abortion only for specific circumstances like health risks and rape. Advocates used this limited framework to gradually build broader rights — first emphasizing public health arguments around unsafe abortions, then expanding to gender equality concerns. This incremental approach led to significant expansions <a href="https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/acts_parliament/2021/Medical%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy%20Amendment%20Act%202021.pdf">in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.scobserver.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/X-v-Principal-Secretary-Health-and-Family-Welfare-Department-Govt.-of-NCT-of-Delhi-Anr.pdf">2022</a>, including extended gestational limits and broader access for unmarried women. Spain&#8217;s path from its restrictive 1985 law to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2010/03/spain-expands-legal-access-abortion">its 2010 legalization</a> up to 14 weeks followed a similar pattern, with advocates particularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/world/europe/11spain.html">leveraging Spain’s mental health exception</a> to create de facto broad access.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These tensions — between principle and pragmatism, between long-term strategy and immediate needs — have taken on new urgency as patients in the US encounter the limitations of state-level abortion exceptions. In Louisiana, which has exceptions for protecting life, health, and fatal fetal conditions, almost no legal abortions <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/new-orleans/2023/06/26/abortion-rate-louisiana-post-roe">have been reported</a> since its ban took effect. Doctors say <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">ambiguous laws and criminal penalties</a> make them unwilling to test the rules. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But rather than pursue clearer federal standards around exceptions, advocacy groups are betting on abortion rights becoming more prominent as restrictions continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Americans will continue waking up to stories of women who died preventable deaths because they were denied access to essential health care and voters will continue to see these bans wreak havoc on their families and communities,” declared a post-election strategy memo from Emily’s List, National Women’s Law Center Action Fund, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and Reproductive Freedom for All. “With anti-abortion politicians in power, abortion rights will only grow in salience for voters in elections to come.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Working with Republicans on even limited protections could also undercut the narrative of GOP extremism — a message advocacy groups see as crucial for winning in 2026 and 2028.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A high-stakes political bet</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite abortion rights proving less galvanizing in the most recent election than Democrats had hoped, reproductive rights groups are betting that voter attitudes will shift as restrictions continue. Currently, 28 million women, plus more trans and nonbinary people of reproductive age, live in states with abortion bans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;We have no interest in shrinking our vision,&#8221; Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive &amp; Gender Equity, said, &#8220;but the politicians who will soon govern a majority pro-abortion country would do well to expand theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an interview with Vox, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said she will work with anyone in Congress who wants to collaborate in good-faith to protect abortion rights, but stressed that as Democrats move into the minority, “the onus will be on Republicans” to come to the table and negotiate with them in a serious way. Asked about potential deal-breakers, Smith declined to discuss specific provisions in the abstract, saying she would wait to see complete proposals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith&#8217;s view captured the movement&#8217;s current predicament: “We have been saying for several years after <em>Dobbs</em> that the way to protect people&#8217;s access to abortion is to win elections for people who are willing to protect those rights. And that didn&#8217;t happen, so there is no magic solution here.”</p>

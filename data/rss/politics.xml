And he has a very specific prediction that Joe Biden would make the historic decision to opt out of the race by August 9. “The issue with President Biden isn’t if, it’s who,” Maher said during Friday’s airing of “Real Time with Bill Maher.” “Who will replace him? Because he is not going to be the Democrats’ candidate for president in 2024, all due respect.”]]></description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-maher-has-this-prediction-for-joe-biden-by-august-9-/articleshow/111715933.cms</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-maher-has-this-prediction-for-joe-biden-by-august-9-/articleshow/111715933.cms</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 13:39:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK universities need rescue package to stop ‘domino effect’ of going under]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Experts say the next head of the Office for Students must oversee a programme that will protect higher education</p><p>The new head of the Office for Students (OfS) will have to oversee rescue plans to avoid a “domino effect” with a number of universities going under, experts have warned.</p><p>The new government’s Department for Education (DfE) announced on Tuesday that it had accepted the resignation of the OfS’s controversial chair, James Wharton, a former Tory MP who ran Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign.

She is 25 years old, and when she got involved with the party some years ago – standing as a councillor in 2019 – she was a teenage mother living in temporary accommodation. Although everyone in her family and community supported Labour, she was attracted by the Conservative message of aspiration. “It was that fundamental belief in prosperity and being able to build yourself up, and just do whatever you want to do,” she says. Most people in her age group do not share this view: just 8% of people under 25 voted Conservative on 4 July. In 2019, it was 21%. With so few in their age group supporting the party, young Conservative members are a vanishingly small number. Even Edwards, a committed activist who is out knocking on doors in every local and general election, is uncertain. “During this campaign, that fire and that passion for young voters just wasn’t there,” she says. “So how can I convince people on the doorstep?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/13/meet-the-young-tories-fighting-to-change-their-old-party-where-do-we-go-now">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/13/meet-the-young-tories-fighting-to-change-their-old-party-where-do-we-go-now</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/13/meet-the-young-tories-fighting-to-change-their-old-party-where-do-we-go-now</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 14:40:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lauren Boebert is laughed at on the House floor as she’s fact-checked by EPA head]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/lauren-boebert-laughed-house-floor-141818077.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/lauren-boebert-laughed-house-floor-141818077.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 15:47:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Al Sharpton delivers eulogy for Black man who died after being held down by Milwaukee hotel guards]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/al-sharpton-delivers-eulogy-black-203839169.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/al-sharpton-delivers-eulogy-black-203839169.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 20:38:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia loses ‘astronomical’ 70,000 troops in 60 days]]></title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-loses-astronomical-70-000-060000133.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-loses-astronomical-70-000-060000133.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A viciously xenophobic demagogue — who fomented an insurrection against the US government less than four years ago — is on <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/prediction-model/president">track to win the White House this fall</a>. And the only remotely viable alternative to him, for now, is a massively unpopular, geriatric Democrat who just <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">advertised his inability to speak</a> in complete sentences on national television.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the reality that confronts us in the wake of Joe Biden’s catastrophic performance at <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Thursday night’s presidential debate</a>. A comprehensive account of how we arrived at this grim moment would require a multi-volume history. But one cause of our current predicament is worth highlighting: Democratic presidential candidates repeatedly failed to select running mates with an eye to their party’s long-term best interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice presidents do not always go on to become presidential nominees. But they very often do. In partisan primaries, few résumé items are more advantageous than a tenure as a beloved president’s heir apparent. Given this reality, a presidential nominee should aim to pick a running mate whom they consider <em>highly</em> electable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, the last two Democratic presidents did not prioritize political chops when selecting their veeps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barack Obama didn’t choose Joe Biden because he thought that the then-Delaware senator would make a great Democratic nominee in 2016. To the contrary, by most accounts, Obama thought that Biden would be a totally nonviable candidate by the time his own hypothetical presidency ended. And he reportedly selected Biden precisely for that reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to senior Democrats who spoke with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/joe-biden-and-barack-obamas-one-sided-embrace.html">New York magazine’s Gabriel Debenedetti</a> in 2019, Obama had assumed that Biden would be too old to run for president by 2016. And he reasoned that this fact would render Biden an especially loyal second-in-command: Bereft of political aspirations of his own, Biden would have no compunction about putting Obama’s interests and goals above all else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As it happened, Obama misjudged his running mate in more ways than one. In hindsight, it appears likely that Biden would have been a stronger nominee in 2016 than Hillary Clinton — Obama’s hand-picked successor — proved to be. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Obama was certainly correct that — even eight years ago — Biden, then 71, was much older than an ideal presidential candidate. Instead of making the Delaware senator his running-mate, or putting his thumb on the scales for Clinton, Obama should have found a veep who was in his or her political prime and boasted a demonstrable capacity to compete in a swing state. Instead, he put his own campaign and future administration’s interests over the long-term best interests of the Democratic Party, likely damaging his own legacy in the process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s choice of Kamala Harris in 2020 was even more misguided. When he made that choice in August 2020, there was little basis for believing that Harris was one of the most politically formidable Democrats in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris had just mounted an exceptionally lackluster bid for the presidency. Then a California senator, Harris had entered the race for the Democratic nomination with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-more-billionaire-donors-than-any-other-democratic-candidate-2019-11">strong donor support</a> and an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/kamala-harris-first-good-month-poll-of-the-week/index.html">early surge in the polls</a>. Despite these early advantages, Harris failed to maintain — let alone build out — her coalition over the ensuing months, and her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nor was Harris’s electoral track record before 2020 especially encouraging. She had never won an election in a swing state or competitive district. And in her first statewide race in deep blue California in 2010, Harris defeated her Republican rival by less than 1 percentage point. Two years earlier, Barack Obama had won that state by more than 23 points.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that Biden was 77 in August 2020, the likelihood that his running-mate would one day become his party’s standard-bearer was unusually high. It was entirely plausible that health problems would force him to retire before the end of his first term, let alone his second. And were Harris to become an incumbent president, no other Democrat would stand a chance of defeating her in a contested primary. For these reasons, Biden’s primary consideration in choosing a running-mate should have been his or her electability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, he put enormous weight on demographic considerations. “I think he came to the conclusion that he should pick a Black woman,” former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/biden-harris.html#:~:text=In%20the%20end%2C%20Mr.%20Biden,might%20be%20expected%20to%20govern.">told the New York Times</a> in the summer of 2020. “They are our most loyal voters and I think that the Black women of America deserved a Black vice-presidential candidate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without question, it is desirable for a vice presidential candidate to energize the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituencies. That is one dimension of electability. But it is not obvious that Harris actually possessed that capability; after all, her 2020 campaign resonated so little with Black voters in South Carolina that she was forced to withdraw before that state’s primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any case, the ability to appeal to swing voters is much more electorally valuable than a penchant for pleasing loyal Democrats. Turning out a Democratic voter who would otherwise stay home increases your margin by 1 point; flipping a Republican voter into your column increases it by 2. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The desire to give historically marginalized groups representation at the apex of American power is a righteous one. Such representation does have the potential to shift cultural perceptions about race and gender in a progressive direction (although, as Obama’s presidency showed, it also <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/5/18052390/trump-2018-2016-identity-politics-democrats-immigration-race">has the potential to catalyze a reactionary backlash</a>). But such diffuse cultural shifts are ultimately of less consequence than public policy, above all for the most vulnerable in American society. Working-class Black women have more to lose from a Congress that <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/biggest-outrage-of-trumpcare-continues-to-be-medicaid-cuts.html">guts Medicaid</a> and a civil rights division that prioritizes <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/01/trump-reverse-racism-civil-rights">anti-white discrimination</a> than they have to gain from seeing someone of their race and gender squander a national election. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, there were plenty of non-white-male Democrats with a proven record of appealing to swing voters for Biden to choose from. Amy Klobuchar had repeatedly won landslide victories in light blue Minnesota. Tammy Duckworth had unseated a Republican incumbent in a purple Illinois House district before subsequently winning election to the Senate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had demonstrated her appeal to Rust Belt independents. Tammy Baldwin had repeatedly won Senate races in Wisconsin. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, Biden opted for a running mate who few in the party considered to be an optimal general election candidate, despite the fact that — were Biden to win — there was a high probability that Harris would be her party’s standard-bearer at some point in the near future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past two years, Harris’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">poor poll numbers</a> — and Democratic <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/30/harris-democrats-worry/">insiders’ lack of confidence in her political acumen</a> — reduced pressure on Biden to step down, and allow his party to run a less aged and unpopular nominee. Many party leaders seemed to reason that Biden was a safer bet than his vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Thursday night, it looks like this view was mistaken. For all her liabilities, Harris’s approval rating is somewhat <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">better than Biden’s</a> at this point. The vice president has some gifts as an orator and no shortage of vitality. Given the immense difficulty of coordinating behind a non-Biden candidate at this late date, there’s a plausible case that she is now the Democratic Party’s best option. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Considering the importance of keeping Trump out of power, however, we deserve a better option. And if Obama and Biden had prioritized their party’s long-term best interests when choosing their running mates, we would likely have one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that a federal law, providing that anyone who “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-fischer-64">obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so</a>” commits a very serious federal crime, does not actually apply to everyone who obstructs, influences, or impedes an official proceeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worse, the Court does so in a case involving a January 6 insurrectionist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Approximately <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/25/24108640/supreme-court-january-6-insurrection-fischer-united-states-obstruct">330 people</a> who allegedly participated in that insurrection are charged with violating the statute at issue in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-5572_l6hn.pdf"><em>Fischer v. United States</em></a>, including Donald Trump. So Friday’s decision could potentially undermine much of the Justice Department’s ability to prosecute hundreds of people who attacked the US Capitol.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the surface, in other words, the <em>Fischer</em> decision could not play more into the growing narrative that the Supreme Court is a partisan institution that protects the interests of the Republican Party, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/22/24133424/supreme-court-donald-trump-immunity-january-6-president">and of Trump in particular</a>. How else can one explain the Court’s decision that the anti-obstruction law does not do what it says it does?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The full story of <em>Fischer</em>, however, is slightly more nuanced. For one thing, while five of the justices in the majority are Republicans, Biden-appointed Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson joined these five in the majority. Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the dissent, which was joined by the Court’s two remaining Democrats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, while Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion does not read the obstruction law according to its plain text, it does rely on rules governing statutory interpretation that the Court has, at least, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/25/24108640/supreme-court-january-6-insurrection-fischer-united-states-obstruct">applied in less politically charged cases</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Fischer</em>, in other words, is less a case about justices tying themselves into knots in order to help out January 6 defendants than it is a case about how easy it is for judges to read a seemingly unambiguous law in multiple ways. The rules governing statutory interpretation are not clear, and it is not even certain when judges should apply one of those rules as opposed to a different one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that means each of the justices could have chosen either outcome in the <em>Fischer</em> case.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what did <em>Fischer</em> actually hold?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Fischer </em>case involves a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512">federal law with two separate subsections</a>. Subsection (1) applies to anyone who “corruptly &#8230; alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, subsection (2), the provision many January 6 defendants are accused of violating, applies to someone who “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Barrett writes in dissent, the most natural reading of this statute is that anyone who broke into the US Capitol to disrupt certification of the 2020 election “can be tried for ‘obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding.’” Subsection (2) of this law “is a very broad provision.” The case that it applies to January 6 defendants “seems open and shut.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, the overwhelming majority of lower court judges who heard similar cases reached the same result as Barrett.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberts’s reading of the statute is, to put it mildly, less intuitive. He claims that subsection (2)’s broad language is “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-5572_l6hn.pdf">linked to its ‘surrounding words</a>.’” So subsection (2)’s broad language is “limited by the preceding list of criminal violations” in subsection (1).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Therefore, under Roberts’s reading, subsection (2) must be read to only capture activities similar to the ones described in subsection (1) — that is, activity like altering, destroying, mutilating, or concealing a record or document. The way that plays out, according to Roberts, is that January 6 defendants can only be charged under this statute if they created false evidence or otherwise impaired “the availability or integrity of other things used in an official proceeding beyond the ‘record[s], document[s], or other object[s]’ enumerated in (c)(1), such as witness testimony or intangible information.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s stipulate that Roberts’s interpretation of the statute is super confusing and that it does not comport with the way most English speakers would read this law. The oddest thing about <em>Fischer</em> is that there are actually some Supreme Court precedents that support Roberts’s decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consider <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3213681007315665467&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Yates v. United States</em></a> (2015), which involved a very similar dispute in a much less politically charged case. The law in <em>Yates</em> targeted anyone who “knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object” with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation or proceeding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The defendant was a commercial fisherman who caught undersized red groupers, then ordered a crew member to toss these fish overboard “to prevent federal authorities from confirming that he had harvested undersized fish.” <em>Yates</em> asked whether these undersized fish are a “tangible object” within the meaning of the federal statute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Remarkably, a majority of the justices concluded that they are not. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s plurality opinion concluded that a court should “avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words,” and thus the term “tangible object” should be read “to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of tangible objects involving records and documents.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ginsburg’s opinion only garnered four votes, but Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion saying that the question in <em>Yates</em> is “close,” but that largely agreed with Ginsburg’s reasoning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that <em>Yates</em> exists, Roberts’s <em>Fischer</em> opinion isn’t entirely ridiculous. The uncomfortable reality about <em>Fischer</em> is that a judge who wants to crack down on January 6 defendants can read the law according to its plain text, as Barrett did, while justices who wish to reach a different result can rely on <em>Yates</em>, as Roberts did.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What actually happened in this case is that five of the Court’s Republicans read the law in a way that minimizes the law’s impact on a particularly lawless band of Trump supporters, and they were joined by the Court’s sole former public defender. Read into that what you will.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The point is simply that previously established rules governing statutory interpretation give judges a great deal of leeway to reach a variety of results in many cases.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court handed down what is likely to be one of its most consequential modern-day decisions on Friday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf"><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></a> fully consolidates the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">Court’s dominance over federal agencies</a> within the executive branch of government. It is a radical reordering of the US separation of powers, giving the one unelected branch of government all of its own power, plus much of the power that Congress has vested in the executive branch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Loper Bright </em>overrules a decades-old decision, known as <em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council</a></em> (1984), which held that courts typically should defer to federal agencies when those agencies determine federal policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While this decision will undoubtedly be celebrated by Republicans — and especially Republican lawyers in conservative legal<strong> </strong>organizations like the Federalist Society, which have <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/10/24025127/supreme-court-chevron-deference-loper-bright-relentless-raimondo">pushed for a decision like <em>Loper Bright</em> for years</a> — the six Republican justices responsible for <em>Loper Bright</em> will likely come to regret Friday’s power grab. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Loper Bright</em> transfers a simply astonishing amount of policymaking authority from federal agencies that collectively employ tens of thousands of people, to a judiciary that lacks the personnel to evaluate the overwhelming array of policy questions that will now be decided by the courts. This problem will be felt most acutely by the Supreme Court itself, which has only nine justices staffed by a bare handful of law clerks and a skeletal administrative staff.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s decision to seize this power is all the more puzzling because it has already given itself sweeping authority to veto nearly any decision by an executive branch agency that, in the Court’s words, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">involves a matter of “vast ‘economic and political significance.’”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s Republican majority, in other words, is already the final word on any policymaking question that Congress delegated to a federal agency, which triggers a partisan controversy. <em>Loper Bright</em> expands the Court’s authority so that it is also the final word on thousands of questions that hardly anyone cares about at all —  questions like what the cable television rates should be on one of Hawaii’s islands, or how much nitrogen can be discharged by a wastewater treatment plant in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The specific policy question in <em>Loper Bright</em>, for example, is whether the government or fishing vessels must pay for federal observers that sometimes must accompany those vessels while at sea — a question that virtually no one who doesn’t own a fishing vessel has any reason to care about whatsoever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So <em>Loper Bright</em> makes the courts, and ultimately, the Supreme Court, responsible for resolving thousands of low-stakes policy questions, which often cannot be resolved simply by reading the law’s naked text.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The justices, in other words, can look forward to missing their children’s basketball games, skipping out on date nights with their spouses, and not really doing much of anything at all besides deciding the crushing weight of cases that are about to land on their desks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to Hell, justices of the Supreme Court. It is a Hell of your own making.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what is <em>Loper Bright</em> actually about?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Loper Bright</em> overrules a Reagan-era Supreme Court decision known as <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/"><em>Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council</em></a> (1984), which held that when a federal statute delegating policymaking authority to an agency is ambiguous, courts typically should defer to the agency’s reading of that statute rather than trying to resolve the ambiguity itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reasons for this deference were twofold. As <em>Chevron</em> explained, “judges are not experts” in the kind of difficult policy questions that come before federal agencies. Think of questions like whether a product derived from red rice yeast, which purportedly helps promote healthy cholesterol levels, counts as a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17763944631660966083&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">“drug” or a “dietary supplement</a>” under federal law? Under <em>Chevron,</em> this question would be decided by FDA officials who’ve spent decades studying drugs and dietary supplements. Now it will be resolved by political appointees with law degrees and black robes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other justification for <em>Chevron</em> is democracy. “While agencies are not directly accountable to the people,” the Court said in <em>Chevron</em>, the leaders of agencies are political appointees, and they answer to a president who is accountable to the voters. And so “it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such policy choices,” rather than placing that power in the hands of unelected political appointees who serve for life.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Chevron</em> was initially <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">celebrated as a triumph by many prominent Republicans</a>. It was 1984 and President Ronald Reagan was cruising to a landslide reelection, and Republicans appeared likely to control federal agencies for years into the future. Many federal courts, meanwhile, were still dominated by liberal Johnson and Carter appointees who were prone to striking down the Reagan administration’s deregulatory actions. So <em>Chevron</em> meant that those courts would have to butt out and let Reagan and his appointees determine the direction of government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of its biggest cheerleaders was Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative icon, who predicted in a 1989 lecture that “in the long run <em>Chevron</em> will endure and be given its full scope” because it “<a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3075&amp;context=dlj">reflects the reality of government, and thus more adequately serves its needs</a>” than the alternative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beginning in the Obama administration, however, <em>Chevron</em> fell out of favor with the legal right, and the Federalist Society’s annual lawyers’ convention became a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22276279/supreme-court-war-joe-biden-agency-regulation-administrative-neil-gorsuch-epa-nondelegation">showcase of proposals seeking to disempower the administrative state</a>. Many of the same Republicans who praised <em>Chevron</em> when it enabled Reagan-era Republicans to roll back regulations abandoned that view when President Barack Obama’s appointees were in charge of the agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federalist Society calls for <em>Chevron</em> to be overruled reached a fever pitch as Republicans consolidated more and more control over the Supreme Court. Why should policymaking authority be wielded by the Executive Branch, which will sometimes be controlled by Democrats, when it could be wielded by a judiciary firmly in Republican Party hands?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so Roberts’s opinion for himself and his fellow Republican justices is an ode to judicial power. The framers “envisioned that the final ‘interpretation of the laws’ would be ‘the proper and peculiar province of the courts,’” Roberts declares in <em>Loper Bright</em>. Indeed, his opinion seems to deny even the possibility that statutes are sometimes ambiguous and subject to multiple plausible interpretations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Courts, he writes, “understand that such statutes, no matter how impenetrable, do — in fact, must — have a single, best meaning.” And so he holds that he and his fellow oracles will not simply resolve ambiguities in statutes delegating power to agencies, but that their resolution of these cases necessarily determine that only one possible interpretation is “best.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/10/24025127/supreme-court-chevron-deference-loper-bright-relentless-raimondo">facts of <em>Chevron</em> itself</a> belie any claim that every law has a single “best” meaning that can be determined by diviners wearing black robes. That case involved a law requiring certain power plants to obtain a permit if they built or modified “stationary sources” of air pollution — an ambiguous phrase that raises an obvious question: “What is a stationary source?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the Carter administration, the EPA determined that this phrase means any ”<a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/685/685.F2d.718.81-2208.html">identifiable piece of process equipment</a>,” which meant that a plant that wanted to modify a single piece of equipment often had to obtain a permit. Reagan’s EPA, by contrast, changed this rule to only require a permit if the entire plant would produce more emissions after individual pieces of equipment were modified.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Truthfully, both of these constructions of the statute were equally plausible. But <em>Chevron</em> ensured that this difficult policy question would be resolved by environmental policy experts overseen by politically accountable people — if voters preferred Carter’s rule to Reagan’s, they could have elected a new president who took a more expansive approach to environmental regulation. <em>Loper Bright</em>, by contrast, rests on the fiction that there is one “best” interpretation of all laws, and it is the interpretation preferred by entirely unaccountable judges.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Loper Bright</em> turns the Supreme Court into micromanagers of an astounding array of minor policy questions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most baffling things about <em>Loper Bright</em> is that the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">already gave itself an unchecked veto power</a> over any agency action it deems too economically or politically significant — a power it’s wielded ruthlessly to strike down Biden administration policies that garner strong objections from Republicans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Often these cases, which are known as “major questions” cases, permit the justices to veto agency actions that are clearly and unambiguously authorized by federal law. The most egregious example is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf"><em>Biden v. Nebraska</em></a> (2023), which struck down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">despite a federal statute</a> which gave the Secretary of Education sweeping authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs &#8230; as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency” — an emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, before <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court’s Republican majority already had the power to overrule any agency action that garnered political controversy, effectively replacing a Democratic president’s policy with one preferred by the GOP. After <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court is now the final word on a broad range of policy questions that hardly anyone cares about, but that are very important when taken in the aggregate, and that often involve hyper-technical questions that are far beyond the justices’ expertise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca1/16-2280/16-2280-2018-07-09.html">How much nitrogen may be discharged by a wastewater treatment plant</a> in Taunton, Massachusetts? Is there <a href="https://casetext.com/case/mass-dept-of-telecomms-v-fed-commcns-commn">“effective competition” between cable TV providers and streaming video providers</a> in Kauai, Hawaii? Does the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4533199890412583875&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">process of mixing and bagging sand</a> constitute “milling,” which is regulated under the Mine Safety and Health Act, or “manufacturing,” which is regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act? Which electrical facilities are “<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12830125190145456521&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">used in local distribution</a> or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce,” and therefore exempt from certain federal regulations? Does a service that streams live programming over the internet <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=277482026179987814&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">qualify as a “cable system”</a> under the Copyright Act?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal courts will soon be inundated with lawsuits forcing them to decide questions like these, which, under <em>Chevron,</em> have been the ken of federal agencies. And there’s simply no reason to think that some guy with a juris doctorate and a judicial commission will know how to handle these questions. Instead of leaving questions about, say, cable TV rates to officials in the Federal Communications Commission who have spent their careers studying those questions, they’ll now be resolved by lawyers who know little, if anything, about telecommunications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because lower court judges typically have no real expertise in any of these questions, moreover, policy questions that have historically been resolved by agencies are likely to cleave the federal courts down the middle, forcing the justices to resolve countless disagreements among federal circuit courts. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The one good thing that can be said about <em>Loper Bright</em> is that it does contain some language limiting its scope. Roberts concedes that the “best” meaning of a statute will sometimes be that an agency is “authorized to exercise a degree of discretion.” And, most likely to prevent the courts from being forced to relitigate every single challenge to a federal regulation filed in the last 40 years, Roberts also declares that “we do not call into question prior cases that relied on the <em>Chevron </em>framework.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Loper Bright </em>gives Roberts and his colleagues the final word on any new regulation issued by a federal agency, but it avoids the chaos of undoing four decades of previous decisions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, <em>Loper Bright </em>is an earthquake that reorders US law, and that transfers a simply astonishing amount of authority away from democratically accountable officials and to a Republican judiciary. It is likely to lead to worse governance, more arbitrary decisions, and even more contentious judicial confirmations because so much now turns on which party controls the courts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the biggest losers of all may be the justices themselves. I hope that Chief Justice Roberts didn’t plan on seeing his wife and kids any time soon, because he can look forward to many long, boring nights in the office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If President Joe Biden decides to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">drop out</a> of the presidential race, it appears <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357739/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-nominee-whitmer-moore-newsom">likely</a> that his replacement at the top of the ticket would be his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until this week, that possibility wasn’t really worth pondering too much. But after Biden’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">disastrous performance</a> during Thursday night’s debate, Harris becoming the Democratic nominee is suddenly a more serious hypothetical.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before considering what that would actually look like, it’s helpful to take stock of her vice presidency — and vice presidential candidacy — so far. Despite<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/27/23655248/kamala-harris-vice-president-approval-criticism"> frequent criticisms</a> and confusion surrounding what exactly her job is, she is now emerging as an indispensable surrogate and defender,&nbsp;and maybe even successor. She hasn’t been a particularly groundbreaking vice president, but she has had moments on the campaign trail, albeit overlooked by the public and the press, when she is able to showcase her value. It’s a preview of how her role could change in the coming months and even years, whether or not Biden steps aside.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thursday night was one of those times. As shocked and panicked reactions from Democratic operatives and the political press began to pour in post-debate, Harris was dispatched to defend Biden on CNN and MSNBC. She admitted that Biden had a “slow start,” but rounded that answer off by playing up a “strong finish” by the president. She went on offense: attacking Trump for his many lies during the debate and emphasizing Trump’s statements in defense of the January 6 insurrection and refusal to accept the results of the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the process, she surprised a host of pundits <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-debate-trump-biden-06-27-24/index.html">who wondered</a> why the White House has “kept her under wraps for three years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer is complicated.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris’s vice presidency has been muted by design</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike Biden’s tenure under former President Barack Obama, Harris’s role as vice president has been low-key. For most of her term, she’s been relegated to warm-up speaker and occasional Biden stand-in, delivering remarks at White House events with the president, attending summits and visiting foreign leaders when Biden is needed in DC or on another trip, or, like Thursday night, brought in to do clean-up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of those back-seat responsibilities have been due to the nature of the vice presidency: a constitutional office without any clear authorities beyond being a spare body in the event the president can’t do his job and being an extra vote when the US Senate is evenly tied.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But some of it appears to have been intentional. Vice presidents have exerted influence and power before. Vice President Dick Cheney essentially ran foreign policy for a few years during George W. Bush’s first term. Biden himself was given a large mandate by Obama during the government’s response to the Great Recession, administering hundreds of billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/06/828303824/a-look-back-at-how-joe-biden-managed-the-2009-stimulus-package">federal stimulus spending</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris got no such assignments, despite Biden suggesting that he wanted his second-in-command to be a governing “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/kamala-harris-working-partnership/index.html">partner</a>” during the 2020 campaign season. Questions about this have dogged Harris. Just nine months into Biden’s term, after waves of negative media coverage, public absence, staff departures, and rhetorical missteps (which have now become a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree">genre of meme</a>), the White House issued a <a href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/1460070063025831936?s=20">statement</a> assuring the public that the president did rely on Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By that point, the idea that Harris served a superfluous role was already baking into public and media perception. Instead of working on issues like criminal-justice reform and policing — her areas of expertise —<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html"> she took on voting rights</a>, an issue that was doomed to fail in an evenly divided Senate. Her portfolio was then filled with another cursed assignment: dealing with the root causes of migration from Latin America. Mainstream <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-3400f56255e000547d1ca3ce1aa6b8e9">press coverage</a> of that task, and Republican framing of it online and in right-wing media, made it seem like her job would be dealing with immigration and the southern border, however. That fog made her an easier target for Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, something changed in 2022: When the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a> that summer and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, Harris suddenly had a clear lane in which to operate, and she has taken it: being the Biden administration’s <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/08/abortion-rights-fight-gives-kamala-harris-a-chance-to-lead.html">point person</a> on conservative threats to reproductive rights.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campaign-trail Harris has shown how much of an asset she could be</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Post-<em>Dobbs</em> and since the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23448972/midterms-results-democrats-senate-red-wave">generally</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23439022/midterm-elections-2022-results-charts-maps-takeaways">successful</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/27/23475262/midterm-elections-2022-results-red-wave-democrats">midterms</a> that followed later that same year, Harris’s official role has shifted. She’s been on more foreign visits and to gatherings of NATO and allied leaders, headlined a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/07/vice-president-harris-launches-nationwide-fight-for-our-freedoms-college-tour-to-mobilize-students-and-young-people-in-the-fight-for-their-rights/">national college tour</a>, and embarked on two other nationwide tours: one this winter dedicated to raising awareness of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/19/vice-president-kamala-harris-launches-reproductive-freedoms-tour/">threats to reproductive freedom</a> (it kicked off on the 51<sup>st</sup> anniversary of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>) and another this spring focused on “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/vice-president-kamala-harris-launches-nationwide-economic-opportunity-tour/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20Vice%20President%20Kamala%20Harris,has%20the%20freedom%20to%20thrive.">economic opportunity</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tours, though events run out of the White House, served a campaign function as well. The stops were concentrated in swing states, and meant to reach a swath of core Democratic constituencies that Harris may be better positioned to speak to like young voters and college students, women, Black and Latino Americans, and working-class communities. Unlike Biden, who has been struggling with voters from all of these backgrounds, Harris is a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/18/1239107278/vp-harris-takes-to-the-road-to-convince-voters-to-give-biden-another-term">natural communicator</a> in these settings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The change in these official duties has also resulted in a shift in her campaign role, especially as the primary season wrapped up this spring and the general election began. She made history, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/kamala-harris-abortion-clinic.html">the White House said</a>, when she visited and toured an abortion clinic in Minneapolis in March, and has since delivered <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?534902-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-arizona-abortion-rights">campaign speeches</a> in states that have taken measures to restrict abortion access, like <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-travels-florida-6-week-abortion-ban/story?id=109704247">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/10/abortion-arizona-law-ban-kamala-harris">Arizona</a>, both when the state’s top court allowed a century-old abortion ban go into effect and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUzB0GURNQ">again</a> on the second anniversary of <em>Dobbs</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s also been zeroing in on other progressive priorities like <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-03-23/kamala-harris-to-tour-blood-stained-building-where-2018-florida-school-massacre-happened">gun safety</a>, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/kamala-harris-philadelphia-visit-student-loan-relief/">student loan forgiveness</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/kamala-harris-gaza-speech-watered-down-cease-fire-rcna141750">war in Gaza</a>. She’s been engaging media and giving many more interviews than Biden, appearing as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/podcasts/the-run-up-kamala-harris-interview.html">guest</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnTpTTKeeTg">popular</a><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kamala-harris/id1521578868?i=1000488347134"> podcasts</a>, TV shows like <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-05-01/drew-barrymore-kamala-harris-mamala-internet-backlash"><em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3-KA8ja6g"><em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94QBUk_-IPg">online</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFJJxvlAVkE">talk shows</a> to discuss the White House and the Biden campaign’s priorities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s filling the void that Biden has created intentionally (because of his age) or not (because he is also president, governing the country). Thursday night’s interviews, and whatever appearances she will have to make to defend Biden, show us what is likely to come: an expanded role for the veep in this term and a theoretical next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden will need it&nbsp;and Democrats should want it, in the event that Harris has to step up to win the election, govern the nation, or just be a solid backup — precisely as the vice presidency is supposed to work.</p>

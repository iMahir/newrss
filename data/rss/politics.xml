<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly three years into Russia’s full-scale invasion into Ukraine, the Biden administration gave Ukraine the green light to strike deeper into Russia using US-supplied longer-range missiles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ukrainian military quickly put that permission to use: On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/19/ukraine-russia-atacms-bryansk/">it attacked a weapons depot</a> about 70 miles from Ukraine’s border. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US and NATO allies have hesitated to provide sophisticated weapons like the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that Ukraine used in that attack, fearing Russian retaliation against NATO sites — or even nuclear escalation.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Raising that specter on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-ukraine-war-b5ee115aa2099fa247f630e16da861d8">new version of the country’s nuclear doctrine</a>, which would theoretically make it easier for Russia to use nuclear weapons in this conflict. The new doctrine specifically allows for a nuclear strike in response to a strike with conventional weapons — like the longer-range missiles Ukraine now has permission to use — if those attacks involved the “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898">participation or support of a nuclear power,</a>” likely referring to the US and other NATO countries.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">Throughout the war</a>, Russian leaders have threatened to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin">use the country’s nuclear weapons</a> in the conflict if they believed they were necessary. That has led Ukraine’s allies to be cautious about the amount of aid they’ve offered, and has led to limits on what Ukrainian troops can do with those weapons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s new ability to use longer range missiles to strike Russian territory — and Putin’s confirmation of new nuclear rules — have <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">again raised the question</a>: Could Russia’s war in Ukraine escalate into a nuclear conflict?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the war, experts have downplayed Russia’s appetite for nuclear conflict. But the rapid escalation of the conflict in recent weeks, and particularly Russia’s new nuclear doctrine, could mean that possibility is closer than before. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the chances that Ukraine’s new missile capabilities lead to nuclear escalation?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putins-nuclear-warnings-since-russia-invaded-ukraine-2024-03-13/">Putin and other officials have made statements</a>, both explicit and oblique, that Russia might be pressed to use nuclear weapons. Most experts agree that the risk of<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2024/02/putin-threatens-again-an-updated-timeline-of-commentary-on-potential-nuclear-escalation-of-the-russia-ukraine-war/"> Russia using such weapons is low</a>, but it’s not negligible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A previous version of the doctrine Russia updated on Tuesday said the country would tap into its nuclear arsenal <a href="https://nuclearnetwork.csis.org/why-russia-is-changing-its-nuclear-doctrine-now/">only under four circumstances</a>: receiving credible data of a ballistic missile attack; nuclear or other WMD attack against Russia or its allies; attacks on Russian nuclear infrastructure; or conventional weapons attacks that threaten “the very existence” of the Russian state. Under the new doctrine,<strong> </strong>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov  indicated attacks like Ukraine’s on Tuesday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-ukraine-war-b5ee115aa2099fa247f630e16da861d8">could trigger a nuclear response</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That change shouldn’t be taken as a response to Ukraine’s strike, however, Samuel Charap, distinguished chair in Russia and Eurasia policy and senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new doctrine “has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-vladimir-putin-ramps-up-nuclear-threats-signal-us-ukraine-nato-missiles-joe-biden/">been in the works for a long time</a>,” Charap said. “The timing may be tied to the attack of decision, but the substance has been brewing for a while.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Putin and other officials have not, it seems, made major preparations to actually use nuclear weapons. However as the war continues, Putin and his officials’ threats have become clearer and have involved actually demonstrating nuclear capacity. As recently as July, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-are-tactical-nuclear-weapons-why-is-russia-holding-drills-2024-06-11/">Russia and Belarus held joint military exercises</a> that demonstrated Russia’s tactical nuclear capabilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initially, the US and NATO <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/bidens-green-light-highlights-the-diminishing-power-of-putins-red-lines/">responded to Russia’s threats with caution</a>, denying Ukraine weapons or placing restrictions on their use. But over the past three years, as little has come of Putin’s threats of nuclear war and of war with NATO, Western countries have given Ukraine access to increasingly sophisticated weapons systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besides the risk of nuclear war, Ukraine’s allies have had to balance concerns that they might be more directly drawn into the conflict. Though Ukraine is not a member of the NATO military alliance, Putin has previously warned that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html">permission to use longer-range missiles</a> (like those used Tuesday) inside Russia would be considered a NATO attack on Russia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898">US officials speaking to the Associated Press</a> said they had anticipated a response from Russia, but that Russian officials’ warnings were viewed as inflammatory rhetoric, and would not provoke any change in US action. That suggests the US does not believe there’s much danger in Russia using its nuclear capabilities in the near term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russia “never explicitly, on the official level, warned that they would use nuclear weapons in response to X, Y, or Z,” Charap said. “The only explicit red line that they&#8217;ve ever drawn was on the use of long range, US [or] Western weapons to strike into Russia that has now been crossed. So I can imagine people will expect their response, and it will not just be with words.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After 1,000 days of the war, the conflict appears to be approaching an impasse. There’s no clear path to decisive victory for either side. Each side is deploying new tactics to try to gain an advantage: Ukraine with longer range missiles; Russia with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo">recruits from North Korea</a>. And now, Russia and the US seem to be simply responding to each others’ escalations: Russia put North Korean troops on the battlefield, the US responded by authorizing the use of longer range missiles, and Russia released its new nuclear posture. That sort of behavior is both reckless and dangerous, Charap said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You are in a spiral that is the definition of a tit-for-tat dynamic, where your actions are driven not by your goals, but by countering what the other guy is doing,” Charap said. “That only goes in one direction — continuing to up the ante. The spiral dynamic just continues until somebody gets out of control or somebody decides to stop it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly distanced himself from <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, a <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">900-page opus </a>of conservative policy recommendations published by the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank. But he has nominated two of the document’s co-authors to Cabinet-level positions, and many others served in his first administration, which suggests the document may be a window into what the next four years could bring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Trump nominated Brendan Carr, who wrote Project 2025’s chapter on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to head the agency. He has also appointed Tom Homan, a Heritage Foundation fellow named as a contributor to Project 2025, as his so-called “border czar.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/politics/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation.html">Eighteen of the 40 co-authors and editors</a><strong> </strong>of the report served in the first Trump administration. Among them are Ken Cuccinelli, former acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security; Christopher Miller, former acting Defense secretary; and Russell T. Vought, former director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought is reportedly being considered for<a href="https://x.com/KFaulders/status/1858834604355989917"> another top post in the coming administration</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the 2024 campaign, Democrats sought to tie Trump to Project 2025 — a policy agenda they decried as “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/house-democrats-project-2025-00182601">dangerous</a>” and “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/house-democrats-project-2025-00182601">shockingly radical</a>” — framing it as a blueprint for his second term that is much more detailed than the <a href="https://prod-static.gop.com/media/RNC2024-Platform.pdf?_gl=1*llhkp8*_gcl_au*MTgwODMxODIyOC4xNzMxNjg2NDM2&amp;_ga=2.200856430.1597472303.1731861841-1459843538.1731686436">GOP’s 28-page platform</a>. The document focuses on proposals to expand presidential power, gut the federal bureaucracy, enact the priorities of the religious right, deregulate, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump at one point <a href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1809249601595318585">claimed</a> to have “no idea who is behind it” and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/09/11/highlights-debate-memorable-lines-trump-harris/">denied any connection with it</a> when asked about it at the September presidential debate: “I have nothing to do with Project 2025. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it purposely. I’m not going to read it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, since Trump’s reelection, some of his allies have suggested that the document was <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/188097/steve-bannon-donald-trump-project-2025">always intended to be the playbook for his second term</a>. Trump’s nominations of Carr and Homan seem to support that idea. Neither will <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/17/brendan-carr-fcc-trump-pick-00190075">require additional Senate confirmation</a> to take on their roles; through them, they will be in a position to advocate for Project 2025’s ideas on communications and immigration, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we know about Carr and Homan and the ideas relevant to their posts outlined in Project 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Brendan Carr</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr, a pick <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/11/18/how-elon-musk-could-benefit-from-trumps-fcc-nominee-brendan-carr/">approved by Trump’s billionaire backer Elon Musk,</a> currently serves as the senior Republican on the FCC and was previously its general counsel. Now, he is set to take the helm, steering the commission toward a hardline stance against Big Tech and what he describes in Project 2025 as its “attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among his key proposals in Project 2025 is ending legal immunities for internet platforms hosting user-generated content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That would require stricter content moderation on the part of these platforms or cutbacks to the degree to which users can contribute content, fundamentally changing the way people interact online.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, he wrote in Project 2025 that he wants to ensure that “Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor protected speech.” That echoes some of Trump’s other Cabinet picks who are seeking to crack down on “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-wants-end-wokeness-education-051819573.html">wokeness</a>” in their respective agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr also supports <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24094839/tiktok-ban-bill-congress-pass-biden">efforts to block</a> TikTok in the US, identifying it, along with the Chinese smartphone producer Huawei, as a national security threat. He claims in Project 2025 that TikTok is part of a Chinese “foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.” However, there are reasons to believe that a TikTok ban would, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/24100104/banning-tiktok-us-senate-ineffective-and-harmful-bill">Vox previously reported</a>, have “serious consequences for online expression,” which include shutting down what has proved a hub for activism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr may have some difficulty enacting his agenda initially, however. The commission will have a 3-2 Democratic majority until next June when Trump will be able to nominate a new member.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Tom Homan</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan isn’t named as an author of a particular chapter of Project 2025 but as an overall contributor —&nbsp;and some of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">stated hardline views on immigration and the border</a> are reflected in the report.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He started out as a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and worked his way up through the immigration agencies, becoming the head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s removal operations arm under former President Barack Obama. There, he presided over the most immigrants ever deported in a single year, exceeding 400,000. Under Trump, Homan served as acting director of ICE but was never confirmed to the position permanently by the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan’s new role as “border czar” appears to involve far-reaching responsibilities. Those include overseeing the implementation of Trump’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportations policy</a> — the centerpiece of the former president’s immigration agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means Homan’s responsibilities will likely intersect with many of the numerous immigration priorities outlined in Project 2025. Here is a non-exhaustive list of what’s included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expanding the use of a legal authority known as “expedited removal” to quickly deport immigrants who crossed the border without authorization.</li>



<li>Deporting immigrants even in currently protected, sensitive zones like churches.</li>



<li>Ending large-scale parole programs that the Biden administration has relied upon as a deportation shield for individuals from certain countries, including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Ending programs like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation.</li>



<li>Creating a new legal authority akin to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23719941/title-42-ending-border-biden-trump">Title 42 policy</a>, which was implemented by Trump and maintained by Biden to rapidly expel immigrants arriving on the US southern border on the <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/programs/program-forced-migration-health/voices/epidemiologists-public-health-experts-reiterate-urgent-call-end-title-42">dubious public health grounds</a> of stopping the spread of Covid-19.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan has yet to indicate whether he or Trump fully endorses these policies. But unlike Trump, who claims to have never read Project 2025, Homan put his name to the document, and could draw from it in his new role.&nbsp;</p>

Such actions, the doctrine says, will be considered a joint attack.</p><p>In addition, a nuclear response from Russia is possible in the event of a critical threat to its sovereignty, even with conventional weapons, in the event of an attack on Belarus as a member of the Union State, [or] in the event of a massive launch of military aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, other aircraft and their crossing the Russian border.</p><p>Each time these discussions about an individual weapon type are considered, freighted with great significance, the reality has been they’ve only made an incremental difference in the battlefield. From Ukraine’s perspective, it is better to have them than not, but ultimately, no single weapon type is decisive in a complex war like this.</p><p>Each of these weapons comes along months, maybe years, after Ukrainians asked for them. It’s quite an agonising process. They are clearly military useful, they have a psychological and deterrent effect but in terms of an actual destructive effect, not so much.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 20:05:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scholz under pressure to stand aside for Pistorius before German election]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Senior SPD figures hold talks on candidate for chancellor amid speculation about switch to popular defence minister</p><p>Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is under mounting pressure to step aside as his party’s candidate for the job in February’s snap election in favour of his defence minister, Boris Pistorius, the most popular politician in the country.</p><p>The top brass of the Social Democratic party (SPD) are planning crisis talks on their choice of chancellor candidate for the 23 February general election on Tuesday evening while Scholz is flying home from the G20 summit in Brazil, local media reported.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/olaf-scholz-boris-pistorius-germany-election-spd">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/olaf-scholz-boris-pistorius-germany-election-spd</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/olaf-scholz-boris-pistorius-germany-election-spd</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:35:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Global stock markets fall and bonds jump as fears grow over Ukraine war]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Investors dash to safe-haven currencies after Putin updates nuclear doctrine and Ukraine fires missiles into Russia</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates">Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates</a></li></ul><p>Global stock markets fell and bond prices have jumped after reports that Ukraine had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/putin-warns-us-over-using-long-range-missiles-by-signing-new-nuclear-doctrine-ukraine">fired a US-made long-range missile into Russia for the first time</a> and Vladimir Putin approved changes to Moscow’s nuclear doctrine.</p><p>Investors dashed into safe-haven currencies such as the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc on Tuesday, after the RBC-Ukraine news outlet reported that Kyiv had carried out its first strike on Russian territory using western-supplied missiles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/global-stock-markets-fall-and-bonds-jump-as-fears-grow-over-ukraine-war">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/global-stock-markets-fall-and-bonds-jump-as-fears-grow-over-ukraine-war</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/global-stock-markets-fall-and-bonds-jump-as-fears-grow-over-ukraine-war</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:08:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Atacms: what are the missiles Ukraine has fired into Russia for first time?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden gave the green light for the US-made weapon to be used inside Russia.

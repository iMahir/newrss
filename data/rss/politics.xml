<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story was originally published by&nbsp;<a href="https://grist.org/politics/washington-climate-law-repeal-failed-cap-and-trade/">Grist</a>&nbsp;and is republished here as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://climatedesk.org/">Climate Desk</a>&nbsp;collaboration.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The people of Washington state elected to save the most ambitious price on carbon in the country. A large majority of voters,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-state-general-election-results-2024/?300_tab=5&amp;300_filter=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">62 percent</a>, rejected a ballot initiative to repeal the state’s Climate Commitment Act, the cap-and-trade law that has already raised more than $2 billion for cleaning up transportation, shifting to clean energy, and helping people adapt to the effects of a changing climate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On an otherwise depressing election night for voters who consider climate change a top concern, there was an air of victory at the Seattle Convention Center on Tuesday evening, where Gov. Jay Inslee and a couple hundred organizers with the campaign opposing the repeal gathered for a watch party. As news rolled in that former President Donald Trump was the favorite to win the presidential election, many in the crowd did their best to focus on their success in rescuing the state’s landmark carbon-cutting law. Inslee, the outgoing Democratic governor whose signature climate legislation was at risk, said that the results should embolden states to take action on climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I really feel it was important from a national perspective, because every state legislator can now look to Washington and say, ‘This is a winning issue,’” Inslee said in an interview with Grist. “This is something you can defend and win big on. And we won big.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inslee said that the effort to defeat the initiative had emphasized the concrete, local benefits of the program to voters, rather than getting into the weeds about how cap and trade works. “We focused on the easiest thing for people to wrap their minds and hearts around,” Inslee said, pointing to the tangible economic benefits that the repeal would take away: the funding for transportation, schools, and fighting fires.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Putting any kind of price on carbon has long been seen as <a href="https://grist.org/politics/who-killed-the-carbon-tax-republicans-or-democrats/">politically risky</a>. Opponents of Washington’s Climate Commitment Act, including Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager driving the repeal effort, blamed it for raising gas prices. The ballot measure would have not only struck down the state’s price on pollution — it would have also prevented the state from ever enacting a similar policy in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The resounding public support for Washington’s cap-and-trade program “is going to echo coast to coast,” said Democratic state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, who helped pass the legislation in 2021, during a speech at the convention center. Officials in states including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/carbon/washington-state-vote-harbinger-wider-carbon-markets-2024-11-01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Jersey, Maryland, and New York</a> have been eyeing similar policies, and they’ve been watching the results in Washington to see how voters responded. “I know that there are states that are thinking, ‘What can we do?’” Fitzgibbon told Grist. “And especially when there’s a vacuum at the federal level, that’s when I think you see the most motivation in state capitols to move.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cap and trade already exists in California, and in a more limited form among <a href="https://www.rggi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a network of states in the East</a>, but <a href="https://grist.org/economics/washington-state-cap-and-invest-california-lessonsit-works/">Washington’s law is more ambitious</a>, aiming to slash emissions nearly in half by 2030, using 1990 levels as a baseline, and by 95 percent by 2050.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Washington state is the gold standard for how we tackle climate change in a way that’s inclusive, in a way that’s politically popular, in a way that actually will decarbonize,” said state Sen. Joe Nguyễn, a Democrat who chairs the state’s Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee. A review of existing climate policies in 41 countries in August found that <a href="https://grist.org/economics/climate-policy-emissions-study/">carbon pricing programs were the most likely of any policy to lead to large emissions cuts</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Climate Commitment Act’s passage in 2021 followed&nbsp;<a href="https://grist.org/economics/after-a-decade-of-failures-washington-state-passes-a-cap-on-carbon-emissions/">more than a decade of failed attempts to put a price on pollution</a>&nbsp;in Washington state. It requires companies to buy pollution permits at quarterly auctions, a way to generate money for climate solutions and at the same time incentivize businesses to reduce their emissions. The number of permits available decreases over time. The program has so far raised billions to make public transit free for youth, install energy-efficient heat pumps in homes, and reduce local air pollution, among other measures.<a href="https://grist.org/politics/environment-conservation-climate-resilience-ballot-initaitives-election/"></a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the state, almost 600 organizations joined the “No on 2117” coalition to defend the law in 2024, ultimately raising <a href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/political-disclosure-reporting-data/browse-search-data/committees/co-2024-35713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$16 million</a>. Many businesses, religious organizations, health advocates, and agricultural organizations were on board. At the event Tuesday, there were security guards representing unionized labor, the chair of the Suquamish Tribe, and a public policy manager from the tech giant Amazon. “We put together, all of us, the most extraordinary coalition in the history of this state, on any issue, ever,” said Gregg Small, executive director of the group Climate Solutions, in a speech at the convention center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The initiative faced other headwinds. Ballots explicitly alerted voters to the fiscal costs of the repeal, despite <a href="https://www.nwprogressive.org/weblog/2024/08/washington-state-supreme-court-quashes-jim-walshs-lawsuit-to-hide-the-costs-of-his-destructive-initiatives-from-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeals to the state Supreme Court</a> by the Washington State Republican Party to get that language removed. And Washington’s gas prices — which soared to <a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/environment/2023/07/why-washington-gas-prices-are-nations-highest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$5, the highest in the country</a>, in 2023 — have now come down to around <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=WA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$4 a gallon</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-state-general-election-results-2024/?300_tab=5&amp;300_filter=0">Another ballot initiative</a>, which would complicate the state’s plans to get off natural gas, was still too close to call on Friday. With ballots still left to count, 51 percent of voters approved of the measure, which targets new building codes that make installing natural gas more difficult and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/states-new-law-involving-pse-aspires-to-set-a-course-for-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legislation to help the state’s largest utility accelerate its use of clean energy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that Washington’s cap-and-trade program survived the repeal, the state can move forward with plans to <a href="https://ecology.wa.gov/air-climate/climate-commitment-act/cap-and-invest/linkage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link its carbon market up with California and Quebec’s</a>. The state can also begin the years-long process of implementing the Climate Commitment Act’s program to regulate air quality. This summer, the state began <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/08/27/new-wa-program-aims-to-curb-air-pollution-in-parts-of-state-most-affected-by-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing grants to help reduce air pollution in “overburdened” communities</a>, but much of the work had been on hold as the state waited to see if voters would keep the law, according to David Mendoza, the director of public advocacy and engagement at the Nature Conservancy in Washington state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole repeal initiative might have been a blessing in disguise, Nguyễn said. It gave people a chance to pay attention to all the work the state had done on climate change that might otherwise have been ignored. “I actually want to thank Brian Heywood and his cronies for putting this on the ballot, and just reaffirming to everybody that we care about climate change in Washington state.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>A Vox reader writes: “Trump can&#8217;t run for a third term, right? (Yes, we know what the Constitution says &#8230; but he really, truly can&#8217;t run for a third term, right??)”</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">President-elect Donald Trump</a> has won his second — and final — term in office. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786">Trump has joked about pursuing a third term</a> and has a penchant for promoting authoritarian ideas, <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/can-donald-trump-run-2028-presidential-election/76094187007/">he’s barred from running again</a> by the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. To run for a third term, he’d have to repeal that amendment, and that would be difficult. Undoing a constitutional amendment requires an overwhelming level of support from Congress and state legislatures, support he would be unable to obtain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked if there were legal loopholes or other ways for a president to get around the 22nd Amendment, Stanford University Law Professor Michael McConnell, a specialist in constitutional law, had a definitive answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No. There are none. This will be his last run for president,” McConnell told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the 22nd Amendment says</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 22nd Amendment firmly limits <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-we-wound-up-with-the-constitutions-only-term-limits-amendment">presidents to two</a> successful runs and applies equally to those elected to consecutive terms and those, like Trump, who are elected to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-run-again-2028/">nonconsecutive terms</a>. It states the following:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-the-22nd-amendment-came-into-existence">was ratified in 1951</a> and came after years of both parties calling for term limits for the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While President George Washington set a precedent for only holding two terms in office, President Franklin D. Roosevelt later <a href="https://www.history.com/news/fdr-four-term-president-22-amendment">became the first and only commander-in-chief</a> to serve additional terms. Roosevelt was ultimately elected to four terms in office, though he passed away during his last term in 1945.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following Roosevelt’s tenure, there were growing calls to establish term limits for future presidents, leading to Congress’s approval of the 22nd Amendment and states’ subsequent ratification.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why it’s so hard to roll back the 22nd Amendment</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thresholds for approving a constitutional amendment and for repealing it are exceedingly high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two ways to go about rolling back an amendment. The first would require two-thirds of both the House — 290 members — and the Senate — 67 members — to agree to do so. Once they did so, three-fourths of all states — 38 — would then also have to agree.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These thresholds would be impossible for Trump to meet given Democratic opposition, and there would likely be some Republican outcry as well. While <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump">Republicans are poised to retake Senate control</a>, they’ll fall far short of the two-thirds majority required for such a vote. If the GOP attains control of the House, they’d similarly fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed there. Additionally, at least 17 states have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, signaling that they’d be unlikely to support any such amendment. That’s more than the one-fourth of states Trump could afford to lose should he somehow succeed in getting the amendment overturned by Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second means of repealing an Amendment would require holding a Constitutional Convention, which two-thirds of states — 34 — would have to support. Any amendments proposed at such a Convention would still need ratification from three-fourths of states — 38.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This option would face the same opposition from Democrat-leaning states as the first one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the amendment was first approved, there have been numerous proposals in <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/term-limits/">Congress raised to repeal it</a>, though they have all languished due to lack of support.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The amendment is crystal clear</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say there aren’t really any realistic options for Trump to try to bypass the 22nd Amendment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theoretically, <a href="https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/">the 22nd Amendment doesn’t prevent a former president</a> who has already served two terms from becoming vice president in a subsequent term. As vice president, that person could then potentially ascend to the presidency if the president on the ticket stepped down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It could theoretically happen, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen,” says McConnell, who added that it’s a “silly thing to worry about.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Efforts to challenge the amendment in court are also moot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court does not have the basis to overturn the 22nd Amendment, according to legal experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Per UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, any challenge to a constitutional amendment would likely rest on arguments that the procedure used to approve the amendment was faulty in some way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s “impossible” in this case, says Winkler, given how this amendment has been settled for more than seven decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Winkler notes the Supreme Court could try to interpret the 22nd Amendment to say that it only applies to presidents who have served consecutive terms, but even that would be a stretch based on its text. Any effort to declare the amendment unconstitutional by the Court would run into the problem of the amendment being part of the Constitution, notes McConnell. “By definition, the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, as Georgetown law professor Abbe Smith explained when asked if Trump could vie for a third term, it’s pretty simple: “Short answer: There is no way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As such, Trump’s recent run is set to be his final one.&nbsp;</p>

 The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country.<br><br>
 The temporary relief from deportation brought a brief sense of security to some 500,000 immigrants estimated to benefit from the program before Texas-based U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker put it on hold in August, days after applicants filed their paperwork.<br><br>
 Barker ruled yesterday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority by implementing the program and had stretched the legal interpretation of relevant immigration law “<strong>past its breaking point</strong>.”<br><br>
 The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as <strong>“Keeping Families Together”</strong> would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump’s return to the White House.<br></p><p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/11/politics/house-votes-count-election-dg/">CNN’s latest projection</a> of the crucial races to gain control of the House has Republicans ahead in ten of the contests, with, according to their projections, only six victories needed to tip them over the magic 218 for control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:15:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump says vow to deport millions of undocumented migrants has ‘no price tag’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>President-elect’s plan to quash undocumented migration through mass deportations met with Democratic resistance</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies">vow to deport</a> millions of undocumented <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">migrants</a> has no “price tag”, the president-elect has said, setting the scene for a confrontation between his incoming administration and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a> officials across the US.</p><p>As Democratic state governors and mayors signalled their determination to resist the most extreme elements of his agenda, Trump promised that his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/trump-mass-deportations-detention-camps-military-migrants">campaign pledge</a> to expel an estimated 11 million people – though Trump himself has given a figure as high as 21 million – would be implemented come what may.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-mass-deportation-plan">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-mass-deportation-plan</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-mass-deportation-plan</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:07:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump allies say Project 2025 is on as Heritage affiliates vie for cabinet posts]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Clear links to president-elect and rightwing document emerge after his attempts to distance himself from project</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives">US elections 2024 – live updates</a></li></ul><p>Cheerleaders for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> have gleefully raised the prospect of the extremist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/project-2025">Project 2025</a> policy blueprint being implemented by the new administration as they taunted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a>’ victory over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>.</p><p>Project 2025 is an initiative coordinated by the rightwing Heritage Foundation and presented to the American public in the form of the Mandate, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/project-2025-election">900-plus page policy plan</a>.

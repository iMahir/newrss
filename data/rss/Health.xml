<figcaption>Follow THESE measures to increase the immunity of newborns</figcaption>
<p>Newborns have delicate immune systems that require special care to prevent infections. Strengthening their immunity is crucial, especially during the winter months when they are more vulnerable. Here are five effective measures to enhance the immunity of newborns and protect them from seasonal diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Breastfeeding:</strong> Breast milk, including colostrum, is vital for providing antibodies and nutrition.</li>
<li><strong>2. Cleanliness:</strong> Regularly clean your baby's environment and items to reduce infection risks.</li>
<li><strong>3. Maintain the right temperature:</strong> Keep the baby warm in cold weather with appropriate clothing.</li>
<li><strong>4. Vaccination:</strong> Ensure timely vaccinations to protect against serious diseases.</li>
<li><strong>5. Nutrient-Rich Food:</strong> After 6 months, provide solid foods rich in nutrients to support development and immunity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking these steps can significantly boost a newborn's immunity and contribute to their overall health and growth.</p>]]></description>

<p>Russia has announced a significant advancement in cancer treatment with a claimed mRNA vaccine intended for cancer patients. This announcement has sparked both excitement and skepticism among global oncologists.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Russia asserts development of an mRNA cancer vaccine to be distributed free.</li>
  <li>Oncologists express skepticism due to lack of credible data supporting the claims.</li>
  <li>Pre-clinical trials reportedly show effectiveness in tumor suppression.</li>
  <li>Experts emphasize the complexity of developing effective cancer vaccines.</li>
  <li>The use of artificial intelligence is proposed to personalize vaccine development.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Vaccines are available currently for a few cancers which are thought to be due to viral infections. I will wait for the final data to come out before getting very excited.” - Dr. Gaurav Dixit</blockquote>
<p>This claimed breakthrough raises questions on the veracity and feasibility of creating a universal cancer vaccine, requiring further data and validation from clinical trials.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A healthy diet is key to cognitive health.</figcaption>
<p>Recent research from the University of Kentucky reveals that an antioxidant-rich diet may help lower iron buildup in the brain, thereby reducing the risk of cognitive issues and promoting brain health.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A diet high in antioxidants can reduce the risk of numerous diseases.</li>
  <li>Antioxidants help to scavenge free radicals from body cells.</li>
  <li>The study involved 72 older adults and measured brain iron levels using advanced MRI techniques.</li>
  <li>Increased brain iron levels were linked to cognitive decline in specific memory and executive function tasks.</li>
  <li>Foods high in antioxidants include various fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Iron is a vital element for brain health, playing a key role in essential cellular functions.” – Valentinos Zachariou, PhD</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, adopting an antioxidant-rich diet not only promotes physical health but may also lead to improved cognitive functionality and healthier aging.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Local Health Department Reports</p>
<p>The state of Kerala is experiencing a significant surge in mumps cases, with over 70,000 reported this year, a dramatic increase from 2,324 cases in 2023. Health officials are concerned about the rising numbers as many individuals seek alternative medical treatments instead of conventional methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Malappuram and Kannur are severely affected, with 13,643 and 12,800 reported cases, respectively.</li>
<li>Schools have closed and mask mandates are in effect to curb the spread.</li>
<li>Mumps is a viral illness leading to swollen salivary glands and is highly contagious.</li>
<li>Complications of mumps can be severe, especially in unvaccinated individuals.</li>
<li>Health officials attribute the outbreak to a lack of vaccinations among children.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The only way to stop the rise of mumps is to either bring back the MMR vaccine or properly inform people that it is accessible in private hospitals.” - Dr. Aneseya P. Varghese</blockquote>
<p>Despite no reported deaths, health authorities are urging for immediate action to address this urgent public health issue.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Study Reveals Flu Virus Remains Infectious in Refrigerated Raw Milk</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 12, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Stanford University via EurekAlert!</p>
<p>This study highlights the risks associated with consuming raw milk, revealing that influenza virus can remain infectious in refrigerated raw milk for up to five days. As concerns about bird flu outbreaks in dairy cattle grow, the findings emphasize the importance of milk pasteurization.</p>
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Raw Milk" />
<figcaption>Raw milk, which is not pasteurized, may harbor infectious viruses.</figcaption>
<ul>
<li>Over 14 million Americans consume raw milk annually.</li>
<li>The flu virus H1N1 PR8 can remain infectious in raw milk for up to five days.</li>
<li>Flu virus RNA can be detected in raw milk for at least 57 days.</li>
<li>Pasteurization effectively destroys infectious influenza in milk.</li>
<li>Flu viruses infect over 40 million Americans each year, leading to over 50,000 deaths.</li>
<li>Recent cases of bird flu in cattle raise concerns about potential transmission through dairy products.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The persistence of infectious influenza virus in raw milk for days raises concerns about potential transmission pathways.” – Mengyang Zhang</blockquote>
<p>This research sheds light on food safety regarding raw milk consumption and emphasizes the need for improved monitoring systems as avian influenza continues to spread among livestock.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Colon cancer: Measuring ‘biological age’ may help predict who's at risk for polyps</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Medical News Today</p>
<img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/age-colorectal-GettyImages-533258327-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A long exposure image of people commuting in the subway during rush hour">
<figcaption>Scientists have found a link between accelerated biological age and colon cancer risk. silkwayrain/Getty Images</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses new research indicating that biological age, reflecting an individual’s physiological condition, may be a key predictor of the risk for developing colon polyps, which are precursors to colorectal cancer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research from the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center suggests faster biological aging correlates with increased polyp risk.</li>
  <li>For every year of accelerated biological aging, the risk of developing polyps increases by 16%.</li>
  <li>These findings may lead to earlier screenings for those with accelerated biological ages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>“Biological aging is a measure of your body’s age based on changes in DNA.”</strong><br>— Shria Kumar, MD, MSCE</blockquote>
<p>Colorectal cancer, particularly among individuals under 50, is rising, emphasizing the need for risk stratification in screenings. Future studies should validate the findings to enhance preventive strategies.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India sets up its first diabetes biobank to facilitate advanced research.</figcaption>
<p>The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), in collaboration with the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF), has inaugurated India’s first diabetes biobank in Chennai, aimed at improving research on diabetes and its complications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The biobank is designed to store biological samples such as blood, plasma, serum, DNA, RNA, urine, tissue samples, and associated health information.</li>
  <li>It is equipped with 7 freezers set at -80°C and -20°C for optimal sample preservation.</li>
  <li>Currently, the facility houses approximately 75,000 blood samples, 10,000 serum samples, 16,000 genetic samples, and 5,000 urine samples from various studies.</li>
  <li>MDRF was previously designated as an ‘Advanced Centre for Genomics of Type 2 Diabetes’ by ICMR in July 2006.</li>
  <li>The establishment follows the recognition of Dr. V Mohan, chairman of MDRF, as an Honorary Fellow of the International Diabetes Federation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Currently, the facility has in storage approximately 75,000 blood samples, 10,000 serum samples, 16,000 genetic samples and 5,000 urine samples obtained from its population-based studies,” said MDRF.</blockquote>
<p>This biobank will enhance India's capacity for diabetes research and could improve patient outcomes through better understanding of the disease.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<p>As the winter season descends upon us, the cold weather can significantly impact our health, particularly our kidneys. This article discusses the relationship between hydration habits, dietary choices, and weather changes in preventing kidney stones.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kidney stones are caused by concentrated urine that allows minerals to crystallize.</li>
  <li>Winter reduces thirst, leading to inadequate hydration.</li>
  <li>Symptoms of kidney stones include sharp pain, burning during urination, and fever.</li>
  <li>Prevention tips include staying hydrated, maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, monitoring salt intake, and getting enough Vitamin D.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>As per the report by Times of India, it is crucial to adapt our health strategies as we transition into the winter months.</blockquote>
<p>By understanding the challenges posed by winter, individuals can proactively maintain kidney health and reduce the risk of kidney stones.</p>]]></description>

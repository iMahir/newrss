<figcaption>A recent study has revealed that 10,000 steps is not an ideal benchmark. (News18)</figcaption>
<p>A recent study suggests that walking 7,500 steps daily can significantly benefit mental health by reducing the risk of depression without the need to meet the often-quoted 10,000 steps goal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A study published in JAMA Network Open found that exceeding 7,500 steps does not provide additional health benefits.</li>
  <li>Walking 7,500 steps can lower depression risk by up to 42%.</li>
  <li>Even modest physical activity can significantly enhance health outcomes.</li>
  <li>Dr. Lindsay Bottoms and Professor Tom Yates emphasize the arbitrary nature of the 10,000-step goal and recommend more realistic walking goals.</li>
  <li>Research indicates that as few as 4,400 steps can improve life expectancy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The 10,000-step goal is arbitrary and can give a misleading sense of health security.” – Dr. Lindsay Bottoms</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, setting achievable walking goals is crucial for maintaining health without unnecessary stress, with significant benefits observable even with fewer than the often recommended 10,000 steps.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Seed oils are a relatively recent addition to the food industry. (Representative Image)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A study has shed light on a troubling connection between popular cooking oils and the increasing incidence of cancer, especially in younger individuals. The research, published in the medical journal Gut, reveals that frequent consumption of seed oils such as sunflower, grapeseed, canola, and corn oil may heighten cancer risk, raising serious concerns about health hazards linked to the overuse of these oils.</p>
<h4>Key discoveries from the study</h4>
<ul>
<li>Examined 80 colon cancer patients and found elevated levels of bioactive lipids.</li>
<li>Analysis of 81 tumor samples showed a strong presence of lipids linked to seed oil consumption.</li>
<li>Seed oils have a history of promoting inflammation and are linked to chronic conditions.</li>
<li>Highlighted the role of chronic inflammation in cancer growth.</li>
<li>Introduced the emerging field of resolution medicine to counteract persistent inflammation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notable Quotes or Statistics</h4>
<blockquote>The study highlights the role of chronic inflammation caused by the overconsumption of seed oils, which has been shown to contribute to the growth and spread of cancer.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, this study opens new avenues for understanding the links between dietary habits and cancer risk, emphasizing the need for cautious consumption of seed oils.</p>]]></description>

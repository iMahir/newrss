<figcaption></figcaption>
<p>The winter holiday season, although a time for celebration, can paradoxically lead to an increase in heart attack risks. Indulgences and decreased physical activity during this festive period can result in serious health effects.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dietary Changes:</strong> Indulgence in rich foods and high sodium during the holidays can raise blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Stress Levels:</strong> Holiday pressures can elevate stress hormones, increasing heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Weather Effects:</strong> Cold conditions can raise blood pressure and workload on the heart, posing risks for individuals with heart conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Inactivity:</strong> Sedentary lifestyles during the holidays can lead to poor cardiovascular health.</li>
<li><strong>Neglecting Health Monitoring:</strong> Skipping medications and health routines can exacerbate potential heart issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>By minding dietary habits, managing stress, staying active, and prioritizing health, individuals can enjoy festivities while minimizing heart risks.</p>]]></description>

<h1>Inflammation-Depression Link: Breakthrough Paves Way for Personalized Treatments</h1>

<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Scientists have uncovered a significant link between inflammation and depression, a discovery that could revolutionize our understanding of mental health and pave the way for personalized treatments.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking research by Raz Yirmiya from Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggests that the activation and suppression of the immune system can trigger depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for tailored treatment approaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>The study found that exposure to stress activates inflammatory processes in the brain, which can lead to depression.</li>
<li>Yirmiya's team identified several promising therapeutic targets by combining molecular techniques with behavioral studies.</li>
<li>The research suggests potential for developing personalized treatments based on individual inflammatory profiles.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"My overarching aim is to harness the extensive knowledge from my research and others to accelerate the development of novel antidepressant therapeutics targeting inflammatory processes." - Raz Yirmiya</blockquote>
<p>Yirmiya's work is part of a larger series by Genomic Press that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific ideas.</p>

It is a habit that one must leave behind in 2024. (Photo: Freepik)</figcaption><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> As we step into 2025, it's crucial to reflect on our daily habits and identify areas that may be harming our health. Discontinuing certain old practices and adopting healthier habits can improve our overall quality of life, increase energy levels, and reduce the risk of serious health conditions.</p><ol><li><strong>Consuming excessive sugar:</strong> High sugar intake can lead to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Limit daily intake to less than 25 grams (6 teaspoons) and opt for natural sources like fruits and vegetables.</li><li><strong>Ignoring sleep schedule:</strong> Poor sleep habits can disrupt your body's internal clock, leading to fatigue, mood disorders, and weakened immune system. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night and establish a consistent sleep pattern.</li><li><strong>Skipping breakfast:</strong> A big dietary mistake, skipping breakfast can lead to nutrient deficiencies, low energy, and overeating later in the day. Start your day with a balanced breakfast that includes protein, whole grains, and healthy fats.</li><li><strong>Using electronic devices before bedtime:</strong> Pre-bedtime use of phones and laptops can interfere with sleep patterns and make it difficult to fall asleep. Avoid using electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime and opt for relaxing activities like reading or meditation.</li><li><strong>Not staying hydrated:</strong> Inadequate hydration can lead to headaches, fatigue, and digestive problems. Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water each day and limit sugary drink intake.</li><li><strong>Sitting for long periods:</strong> Prolonged sitting can increase the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Take regular breaks to stand up, stretch, move around, and aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.</li><li><strong>Not managing stress:</strong> Chronic stress can lead to anxiety, depression, and a weakened immune system. Practice stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing, yoga, or meditation, and take breaks to relax and recharge.</li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> By recognizing and abandoning these unhealthy practices, we can take the first step towards a healthier, happier life in 2025.</p>]]></description>

Celebrity dietician Nicole Andrews warns about two common dietary elements that could contribute to cancer development.</p><p> Andrews advises against consuming alcohol and processed meats, as they are significant contributors to cancer risk. Alcohol elevates the risk of liver, breast, mouth, throat, oesophagus, and bowel cancer, while processed meats increase the risk of bowel cancer due to harmful chemicals and compounds they contain.</p><p> Contrary to popular belief, sugar does not directly cause cancer. However, excessive consumption can lead to weight gain and increase cancer risk through obesity.

<p>New research emphasizes the importance of both portion size and nutritional quality of breakfast for maintaining health, particularly as we age.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study explored the impact of calorie content and nutritional quality of breakfast on long-term cardiovascular health.</li>
<li>Participants aged 55-75 were tracked over three years regarding their breakfast habits.</li>
<li>The findings indicate that consuming 20-30% of daily calories at breakfast correlates with healthier outcomes.</li>
<li>Quality of breakfast is equally vital, with low-quality meals resulting in negative health trends.</li>
<li>The study recommends that breakfast should comprise 20-30% of daily calorie intake, focusing on whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What and how you eat it matters,” says Álvaro Hernáez, emphasizing the importance of portion sizes and nutrition.</blockquote>
<p>These findings highlight the need to optimize breakfast routines to manage and prevent health issues like cardiovascular disease.</p>]]></description>

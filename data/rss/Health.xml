<figcaption>Commercial tea bags release millions of microplastics when in use. (Representative pic: Freepik)</figcaption>
<p>A new study reveals that tea bags release billions of microplastics into hot water, raising health concerns as these particles can be absorbed into the human body. Conducted by researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the findings highlight significant risks associated with consuming tea made from commercially available tea bags.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tea bags release millions to billions of plastic particles per infusion.</li>
  <li>Polypropylene bags can release approximately 1.2 billion particles per drop.</li>
  <li>Microplastics can enter human cells and potentially disrupt cellular functions.</li>
  <li>The study emphasizes the pervasive nature of microplastic exposure in everyday life.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We are exposed everywhere to micro-nano plastics... Something as simple as preparing a cup of tea is enough to ingest millions of nanoparticles or nanoplastics." - Ricardo Marcos Dauder</blockquote>
<p>This research underscores the importance of reevaluating the safety of commonly used tea bags and raises awareness about microplastic consumption in beverages.</p>]]></description>

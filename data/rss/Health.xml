            <description><![CDATA[<h1>A 'ticking time bomb' for liver cancer</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> University of California San Diego School of Medicine</p>
<p>Scientists have conducted a study revealing how fatty liver disease progresses to liver cancer, emphasizing dietary impacts on DNA damage and cancer development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased by 25-30% over the last two decades.</li>
  <li>About 25% of American adults currently suffer from fatty liver disease, with 20% facing severe forms.</li>
  <li>The transition from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) to liver cancer remains poorly understood.</li>
  <li>Research indicates that MASH diets lead to DNA damage in liver cells, resulting in cells entering a senescent state.</li>
  <li>Compromised liver cells can survive and potentially lead to cancerous growths.</li>
  <li>New therapeutic avenues are suggested, focusing on drugs to prevent DNA damage.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A poor, fast-food diet can be as dangerous as cigarette smoking in the long run.” - Michael Karin, Ph.D.</blockquote>
<p>This study signals potential breakthroughs in liver cancer prevention and treatment, particularly for vulnerable populations suffering from MASH.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[At the soft core of a non communicable diseases epidemic, is obesity - The Hindu]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Alarming Rise of Obesity and Non-Communicable Diseases</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 03, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>
<p>Obesity is emerging as a critical public health issue globally, significantly impacting health outcomes and quality of life. It poses a grave challenge with rising cases of diabetes, hypertension, and other non-communicable diseases.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The excess availability of food combined with reduced physical activity has led to an epidemic of non-communicable diseases.</li>
  <li>Globally, one in eight people is obese, and one in three is overweight.</li>
  <li>Childhood obesity is a growing concern, with India ranking second globally for the highest number of obese children.</li>
  <li>Obesity incurs significant economic burdens due to healthcare costs and loss of productivity.</li>
  <li>Addressing obesity requires awareness, lifestyle changes, and potentially medical interventions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Mere weight loss alone results in a reduction in blood pressure, improves cholesterol levels, and reduces diabetes incidence, all in one shot without any pills.”</blockquote>
<p>Obesity is not only a personal health challenge but a growing societal concern that demands immediate action and sustained advocacy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Scientists in China have discovered an elixir in human body that may slow ageing by mimicking the effects of calorie restriction. Credit: Public Domain</figcaption>
<p>Researchers have identified a natural elixir produced by the liver that slows ageing. The compound, known as lithocholic acid (LCA), has shown the potential to improve muscle recovery, strengthen grip, and boost endurance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The findings highlight LCA’s ability to mimic the anti-ageing effects associated with calorie restriction.</li>
  <li>Studies suggest mammals accumulate LCA during calorie restriction, activating AMPK, a key molecule in regulating energy use.</li>
  <li>In experiments on fruit flies and worms, LCA improved lifespans significantly.</li>
  <li>Researchers are exploring the potential for developing LCA into a human-use pill.</li>
  <li>There is optimism for new therapies that could enhance quality of life in later years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“People have long sought an elixir for longevity. LCA is one possibility, as it represents one molecule in the blood of people practicing calorie restriction and activates AMPK...”— Lin Shengcai, Metabolic Biologist, Xiamen University</blockquote>
<p>Although more research is needed, this discovery represents a significant step forward in ageing research.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>HMPV: The mysterious virus gripping China — What You Need to Know</figcaption>
<p>China is currently facing an outbreak of the human metapneumovirus (HMPV), which causes flu-like symptoms and primarily affects vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The HMPV outbreak is raising concerns in several regions of China, five years after COVID-19 surfaced.</li>
  <li>The virus is an RNA virus first identified in 2001 and has been observed globally as a respiratory pathogen.</li>
  <li>Transmission occurs through droplets and close contact, with symptoms resembling the common cold.</li>
  <li>The virus can lead to severe respiratory issues like bronchitis and pneumonia, particularly in at-risk individuals.</li>
  <li>China's CDC has issued recommendations including mask-wearing and good hygiene practices.</li>
  <li>Laboratory protocols for case reporting and verification are being established to monitor the situation.</li>
  <li>Recent data shows a rise in respiratory infections linked to HMPV, especially among children under 14 in northern provinces.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Data from Dec 16-22 indicates a rise in acute respiratory infections, including HMPV, particularly in northern provinces.”</blockquote>
<p>The situation with HMPV underscores the importance of readiness and response to respiratory outbreaks, with lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic informing current measures.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New Lung Scanning Method Shows Improved Function Post-Treatment</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Dynamite News</p>
<p>A novel lung scanning technique allows for real-time observation of lung function, demonstrating its impact on treatment outcomes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The method uses a gas called perfluoro propane for MRI scans to visualize lung function.</li>
  <li>Researchers from Newcastle University are pioneering this technique to monitor patients with asthma, COPD, and lung transplants.</li>
  <li>The scans help in detecting early deterioration in lung function.</li>
  <li>Professor Pete Thelwall notes the method reveals ventilation defects and assesses treatment efficacy.</li>
  <li>This approach could enhance clinical trials for new lung disease treatments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Our scans show where there is patchy ventilation in patients with lung disease, and show us which parts of the lung improve with treatment." - Professor Pete Thelwall</blockquote>
<p>The new scanning technique represents a significant advancement in respiratory healthcare, offering potential improvements in how treatments are monitored and assessed.</p>]]></description>

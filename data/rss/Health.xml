(Source: Freepik)</figcaption><p>A recent study published in <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> reveals that older adults in South Asia continue to be highly vulnerable to diarrhoeal diseases despite a global decrease in mortality. This demographic faces the highest mortality rates along with children under five.</p><ul><li><strong>Elderly Vulnerability:</strong> Those aged 70 years and older in South Asia had the highest mortality rate globally, with 476 deaths per 100,000 population.</li><li><strong>Regional Disparities:</strong> High-income countries reported fewer than one death per 100,000 children under five, while sub-Saharan Africa has over 150 deaths in the same age group.</li><li><strong>Declining DALYs:</strong> The burden of diarrhoeal diseases decreased from 186 million in 1990 to 59 million in 2021.</li></ul><h2>Why older adults are at higher risk in South Asia</h2><p>Dr. Manisha Arora explains that older adults are susceptible due to a decline in immune function and pre-existing health conditions that complicate hydration during diarrhoeal episodes. “Older adults often face a dilemma during diarrhoea,” she notes, highlighting the challenges of hydration management.</p><h2>Tackling the crisis</h2><p>Dr. Arora emphasizes a multifaceted approach to reduce mortality rates among the elderly in South Asia:</p><ol><li><strong>Improve Access to Clean Water and Sanitation:</strong> Essential for preventing diarrhoeal diseases.</li><li><strong>Strengthen Healthcare Infrastructure:</strong> Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical.</li><li><strong>Promote Vaccinations:</strong> Vaccines can significantly help in reducing disease incidence.</li><li><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> Importance of hydration and early treatment should be communicated.</li><li><strong>Focus on Elderly Care:</strong> Interventions for fluid replacement and management of comorbidities are crucial.</li></ol><p>While global mortality rates from diarrhoeal diseases have declined, the situation for older adults in South Asia demands urgent attention. As Dr. Arora points out, “Addressing dehydration, improving healthcare access, and promoting preventive measures are key.”</p>]]></description>

<h1>Inflammation-Depression Link: Breakthrough Paves Way for Personalized Treatments</h1>

<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Scientists have uncovered a significant link between inflammation and depression, a discovery that could revolutionize our understanding of mental health and pave the way for personalized treatments.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking research by Raz Yirmiya from Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggests that the activation and suppression of the immune system can trigger depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for tailored treatment approaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>The study found that exposure to stress activates inflammatory processes in the brain, which can lead to depression.</li>
<li>Yirmiya's team identified several promising therapeutic targets by combining molecular techniques with behavioral studies.</li>
<li>The research suggests potential for developing personalized treatments based on individual inflammatory profiles.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"My overarching aim is to harness the extensive knowledge from my research and others to accelerate the development of novel antidepressant therapeutics targeting inflammatory processes." - Raz Yirmiya</blockquote>
<p>Yirmiya's work is part of a larger series by Genomic Press that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific ideas.</p>

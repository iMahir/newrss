<p>This January, marked as Cervical Cancer Awareness Month, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has partnered with the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) to eliminate cervical cancer through HPV vaccination and training initiatives for physicians.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A one-year training program aims to educate over 50,000 IMA physicians from Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 cities.</li>
  <li>The program emphasizes the importance of HPV vaccination in preventing cervical cancer.</li>
  <li>India sees approximately 77,348 cervical cancer deaths annually, contributing to 25% of global mortality from the disease.</li>
  <li>The initiative aligns with the governmental goal of a 'Cervical Cancer Mukt Bharat'.</li>
  <li>Training includes evidence-based guidelines and strategies for addressing vaccine hesitancy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“India needs more and more physicians to strongly advocate for HPV vaccination, one of the safest vaccines that prevents cancer.” - Dr. Priya Ganesh Kumar</blockquote>
<p>This initiative represents a significant step toward protecting future generations from cervical cancer through education and vaccination, aiming to bolster healthcare professionals’ roles in promoting HPV vaccination.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Children's go-to snacks like chips pose dental health risks. (Shutterstock)</figcaption>
<p>Children often gravitate towards ultra-processed foods like chips and ice cream, which while tasty, carry health risks. A recent study reveals that such diets may lead to deformities in jaw structure, particularly in younger children.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ultra-processed foods are high in calories, sugar, and salt.</li>
  <li>These foods require less chewing, leading to underdeveloped jaw muscles.</li>
  <li>Study shows children with high UFP diets have smaller jaw sizes.</li>
  <li>Misalignment of teeth, notably buck teeth, can result from this diet.</li>
  <li>Research indicates that solid, fibrous foods promote healthy jaw development.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Chewing solid, fibrous foods is essential for healthy jaw development. These foods help prevent malocclusion, or misalignment of teeth,” Dr. Laura Marques Martinez.</blockquote>
<p>The findings stress the importance of balanced diets for children's dental health to avoid long-term issues.</p>]]></description>

<p>A global commission has released a report calling for a comprehensive overhaul of how obesity is measured, stating that Body Mass Index (BMI) is inadequate as it does not account for body fat distribution, particularly important for Asian populations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The commission recommends using additional measures, including waist circumference, to assess obesity accurately.</li>
  <li>Two new diagnostic categories introduced: 'clinical obesity' and 'pre-clinical obesity.'</li>
  <li>There is a rising trend of obesity and metabolic issues in India, especially among children and women.</li>
  <li>The new recommendations aim to provide personalized care without stigma for individuals with obesity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By providing a medically coherent framework for disease diagnosis, the commission also aims to settle the ongoing dispute around the idea of obesity as a disease...” - Francesco Rubino, Commission chair, King’s College London</blockquote>
<p>The report emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of obesity, advocating for adequate medical responses and support for affected individuals.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Lancet commission calls for overhaul of obesity diagnosis</figcaption>
<p>A recent report from the Lancet Global Commission advocates for a revised approach to obesity diagnosis, emphasizing the need for metrics beyond Body Mass Index (BMI). This new methodology incorporates waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, highlighting the limitations of BMI in accurately assessing individual health.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The report indicates that almost 1 billion adults globally live with obesity, which is often incorrectly diagnosed using BMI.</li>
  <li>It suggests country-specific cutoffs to better assess obesity risk based on ethnicity.</li>
  <li>New classifications introduced include 'clinical obesity' (chronic condition) and 'pre-clinical obesity' (increased health risk without illness).</li>
  <li>Commission chair Francesco Rubino stresses the need for a nuanced understanding of obesity, advocating for personalized care and better allocation of healthcare resources.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This will facilitate a rational allocation of healthcare resources and a fair and medically meaningful prioritisation of available treatment options.” - Francesco Rubino</blockquote>
<p>The findings call for a broader recognition of the diverse presentations of obesity and suggest that the current BMI-focused framework may hinder effective treatment and management strategies.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
<li>Brittle Nails and Hair Loss</li>
<li>Fatigue and Weakness</li>
<li>Pale Skin</li>
<li>Frequent Headaches or Dizziness</li>
<li>Unusual Cravings (Pica)</li>
<li>Cold Hands and Feet</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Study Unravels Links Between Obesity and Cancer</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2024<br><strong>Source:</strong> Frontiers of Medicine</p>
<p>Obesity is increasingly recognized as a significant health issue linked to various cancers. This comprehensive review examines the mechanisms through which obesity increases cancer risk and discusses potential clinical implications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Key mechanisms include chronic inflammation, hormonal imbalances, and gut microbiota dysregulation.</li>
  <li>Chronic low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue is a significant characteristic of obesity influencing cancer development.</li>
  <li>Hormonal disturbances, particularly in postmenopausal women, contribute to obesity-related cancer risks.</li>
  <li>Prevention strategies emphasize weight management through diet, exercise, bariatric surgery, and pharmacotherapy.</li>
  <li>Strategies include dietary modifications and regular physical activity to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress.</li>
  <li>The review highlights the need for personalized prevention and treatment strategies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A multifaceted approach, combining lifestyle modifications with pharmacological interventions, may be most effective in reducing the incidence of obesity-related cancers.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the complex links between obesity and cancer can lead to more effective interventions for reducing the burden of obesity-related cancers.</p>]]></description>

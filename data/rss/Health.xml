<p>Recent research indicates a correlation between watching social media reels at bedtime and hypertension among young and middle-aged individuals in China.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study surveyed 4,318 participants, revealing increased susceptibility to high blood pressure with more screen time on reels.</li>
  <li>Findings were shared by cardiologist Dr. Deepak Krishnamurthy, emphasizing reel addiction as a major health risk.</li>
  <li>The study suggests that watching reels before sleep contributes to sympathetic arousal, heightening blood pressure risks.</li>
  <li>Researchers recommend limiting screen time while maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent hypertension.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Apart from being a major distraction and waste of time, reel addiction is also associated with high #BloodPressure in young and middle-aged people. Time to #UnInsta!!</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the study raises awareness about the health implications of excessive screen time, especially during bedtime, highlighting the need for moderation and lifestyle adjustments.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>14,700 confirmed mpox cases reported in 2024 in Africa: WHO</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 12, 2025<br><strong>Source:</strong> Yes Punjab News</p>
<p>About 14,700 confirmed mpox cases, including 66 deaths, were reported in 20 African countries from January 2024 to January 5, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.</p>
<ul>
<li>The confirmed cases represent only a subset of suspected cases, with many remaining untested due to limited diagnostic capacity.</li>
<li>The outbreak is driven by multiple clades of the virus, especially the Clade Ib variant, which is spreading predominantly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</li>
<li>Imported mpox cases from travel have been detected outside Africa, primarily among adults who traveled during their incubation periods.</li>
<li>The ongoing outbreak was declared a public health emergency of continental security by the Africa CDC in mid-August 2024.</li>
<li>The WHO activated its highest level of global alert for mpox, marking the second time in two years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We urge member states to sustain and strengthen mpox surveillance to improve case detection and reporting.” - WHO</blockquote>
<p>Mpox, also known as monkeypox, is a rare viral disease that spreads through body fluids, respiratory droplets, and contaminated materials, causing symptoms like fever and rash.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fibre May Protect Gut Health Against Harmful Bacteria: New Study</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> (Date not provided), <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/fibre-2.jpg" alt="Future research will integrate additional tools, such as metabolomics (studying chemicals microbes produce) and transcriptomics (studying how genes are activated), to create a clearer picture of how the gut ecosystem works for our health benefit." />
<figcaption>Image Credit: Freepik</figcaption>
<p>This new study reveals how a healthy gut environment, influenced by diet, can inhibit harmful bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, offering insights into gut health management.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study analyzed over 12,000 stool samples globally, indicating a strong link between gut microbiome composition and the presence of harmful bacteria.</li>
<li>Fatty acids produced by bacteria like Faecalibacterium are crucial in preventing the overgrowth of harmful microbes.</li>
<li>Co-colonisers of harmful bacteria demonstrate adaptability, suggesting that gut conditions play a significant role in bacterial survival.</li>
<li>Findings may lead to alternative methods for preventing infections without antibiotics by promoting beneficial bacteria instead.</li>
<li>The research highlights the need for further studies on global microbiome diversity and its implications for health.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Instead of killing harmful bacteria directly, we could boost the co-excluders or create diets that support their growth.”</blockquote>
<p>This research underscores the importance of dietary fibres in maintaining gut health and could pave the way for new treatments targeting harmful bacteria.</p>]]></description>

Here’s a list of eight vital nutrients that are most vulnerable and tips to preserve them.</p><ul><li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Sensitive to heat; steam or microwave instead of boiling.</li><li><strong>Vitamin B1 (Thiamine):</strong> Diminished through prolonged cooking; use shorter cooking times.</li><li><strong>Folate (Vitamin B9):</strong> Degrades rapidly; prefer steaming or raw options.</li><li><strong>Potassium:</strong> Loss occurs through leaching; use minimal water in cooking.</li><li><strong>Vitamin B6:</strong> Degraded during high-heat cooking; choose raw or lightly cooked foods.</li><li><strong>Iron:</strong> Availability may decrease; soak or sprout grains and legumes.</li><li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Lost due to oxalate binding; opt for low-oxalate greens.</li><li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Lost in water; prefer steaming or roasting.</li></ul><blockquote>“Cooking enhances flavor, but can cause nutrient loss.”</blockquote><p>The article emphasizes the importance of cooking methods in nutrient retention, encouraging healthier practices to ensure essential vitamins and minerals are preserved for better health.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Diet changes linked to gut microbiome can reduce risk of life-threatening infections.(Unsplash)</figcaption>
<p>A new study highlights how the composition of the gut microbiome can predict susceptibility to infections like Klebsiella pneumoniae and E.coli, suggesting that increasing fiber intake can enhance protection against these harmful bacteria.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gut microbiome may influence the risk of potentially life-threatening infections.</li>
  <li>Research analyzed stool samples from over 12,000 people worldwide to study gut microbiome signatures.</li>
  <li>Fibers in diet promote beneficial gut bacteria that can fend off harmful bacteria.</li>
  <li>Probiotics are less effective than dietary changes in altering gut health.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our results suggest that what we eat is potentially very important in controlling the likelihood of infection with a range of bacteria, including E.coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae because this changes our gut environment to make it more hostile to invaders.” - Dr Alexandre Almeida</blockquote>
<p>The findings point to the significance of dietary choices in promoting gut health and reducing the risk of serious infections.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Morning coffee consumption is linked to reduced mortality and cardiovascular risks, challenging the all-day coffee-drinking habit. The study from Tulane University emphasizes the importance of when we drink coffee, not just how much. Credit: SciTechDaily.com</figcaption>
<p>Drinking coffee in the morning is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality compared to drinking coffee all day, according to a comprehensive study published in the <em>European Heart Journal</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study tracked the coffee consumption habits of over 40,000 adults.</li>
  <li>Morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease compared to non-coffee drinkers.</li>
  <li>Those who drank coffee throughout the day did not show reduced risks.</li>
  <li>A possible explanation may relate to circadian rhythms disrupted by afternoon or evening coffee.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first study testing coffee drinking timing patterns and health outcomes. Our findings indicate that it’s not just whether you drink coffee or how much you drink, but the time of day when you drink coffee that’s important.” - Dr. Lu Qi</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the timing of coffee consumption may be as important as the amount consumed, suggesting a possible avenue for improving heart health.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Less than half of Americans view alcohol as a cancer risk factor according to surveys.</li>
  <li>The risk is particularly notable for breast, liver, and colorectal cancers.</li>
  <li>The report emphasizes the importance of informing the public about alcohol's cancer risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Alcohol is associated with approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths every year.”</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>HMPV cases reported in China sparked widespread panic, especially in Asia.</li>
    <li>India has confirmed 13 cases, including a recent case in a 9-month-old child from Gujarat.</li>
    <li>Medical professionals emphasize that HMPV is not a cause for mass panic.</li>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 13, 2025 &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> The Tribune</p>
<p>Sirsa MP Kumari Selja has expressed concerns over the rising cancer cases in Haryana and criticized the vague response from the Director General of Health Services regarding her demands for new treatment centers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selja's letter dated November 20, 2024, urged the establishment of cancer treatment centers in specific districts heavily affected by increasing cancer rates.</li>
  <li>Approximately 3,000 new cancer cases are reported monthly in Haryana, with about 1,500 fatalities due to delayed treatment.</li>
  <li>The DG Health Services outlined existing initiatives but did not address Selja's call for new centers in high-need areas.</li>
  <li>The response highlighted ongoing initiatives and existing facilities but lacked concrete plans for improving access to cancer care.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>No new info, just old data</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Selja criticized the response for not providing new information or addressing the specific needs of the Ghaggar river belt.</p>
<p>This situation calls for urgent action to improve cancer care accessibility in Haryana.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Shape and size of retina veins significantly correlate with stroke risk.</figcaption>
<p>Researchers have found that the shape and size of veins and arteries on the retina can predict stroke risk almost as accurately as traditional risk factors, without invasive tests.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study published in the journal Heart indicates that the retinal vascular network mirrors that of the brain.</li>
    <li>A simple retinal scan can assess the health of retinal vessels to forecast brain vessel damage.</li>
    <li>Data from 45,161 participants over 12.5 years was analyzed, identifying 749 stroke cases.</li>
    <li>Increased arc length and chord length of retinal blood vessels correlated with higher stroke risk.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"One can use a simple retinal scan to assess the health of these veins and arteries of the retina to predict potential damage to the brain's blood vessels." - Study Authors</blockquote>
<p>This study emphasizes the potential of retinal scans in stroke risk assessment, promoting non-invasive methods in medical evaluation.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article discusses the risks associated with swimming in freshwater environments where the brain-eating amoeba, <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>, can be present. Though infections are rare, they can cause severe and often fatal brain infections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The brain-eating amoeba thrives in warm freshwater and soil.</li>
  <li>It can cause primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a highly fatal brain infection.</li>
  <li>Recent statistics show a 97.5% fatality rate from recorded cases in the U.S.</li>
  <li>Symptoms of infection include headaches, fever, and nausea, with urgent medical attention required.</li>
  <li>Precautions include avoiding submerging the head in potentially contaminated waters.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Of the 164 reported cases in the US between 1962 and 2023, only four people have survived. This is a fatality rate of 97.5%."</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the risks and practicing safe swimming habits is essential, especially for vulnerable populations like children.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Dementia risk soars in aging US population, cases set to double by 2060, study predicts</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> Date not provided <strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<p>This article discusses a new study predicting that the number of dementia cases in the United States will nearly double by the year 2060, due to the aging population. This alarming projection highlights the increasing risk of dementia as the population ages, stressing the need for preventive measures and healthcare adjustments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of dementia cases is expected to rise significantly due to an older demographic.</li>
  <li>Preventive strategies and improved healthcare services are essential to address this impending healthcare challenge.</li>
  <li>While the study emphasizes the numbers, it also seeks to raise awareness about dementia risks among communities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This gives us not just a glimpse of the future, but also highlights the urgent need for initiatives to support our aging population and their healthcare needs.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as the US population ages, addressing dementia's growing prevalence is critical. The study underscores the importance of early intervention and resource allocation for effective management.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article discusses the importance of monitoring hearing health over time and introduces a new smartphone app developed by the Bloomberg School of Public Health that allows users to test their hearing at home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing loss often goes unaddressed until later in life.</li>
<li>The new app provides a quick and private way to measure hearing.</li>
<li>Research links hearing loss to cognitive decline and dementia.</li>
<li>Intervening early with technology can slow cognitive decline.</li>
<li>Public health initiatives aim to normalize hearing assessments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If people began thinking about and tracking that number, much like they might know their step count or blood pressure… it can change how people think and engage around their hearing.” - Frank Lin</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the introduction of this technology is a pivotal step towards preventing hearing loss and improving overall cognitive health in aging populations.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article discusses a study conducted by the Catholic University of Valencia, which reveals that ultra-processed foods are leading to shrinking jaw sizes in children and increasing the risk of dental deformities such as buck teeth. The shift towards these dietary patterns is affecting jaw development and overall health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-processed foods are linked to dental deformities in children, including buck teeth.</li>
<li>The study highlights that children's jaws are shrinking due to the shift from a hunter-gatherer diet to ultra-processed foods.</li>
<li>Toddlers in the UK obtain half of their calories from ultra-processed foods, which increases to 59% by age seven.</li>
<li>Chewing solid foods is crucial for jaw development, while softer ultra-processed diets negatively impact this process.</li>
<li>Related health issues from ultra-processed foods include obesity, cardiovascular disease, and poor gut health.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Chewing plays a crucial role in the proper development of the jaws as it stimulates bone growth, strengthens facial muscles, and promotes proper dental alignment.” - Laura Marques Martinez</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the findings suggest a need for awareness about the impact of dietary choices on children's dental and overall health, emphasizing the importance of solid, fibrous foods for proper jaw development.</p>]]></description>

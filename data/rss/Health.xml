<figcaption>To get that extra sweetness of coffee flavours, many add sugar.(Shutterstock)</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses a study that links unsweetened coffee consumption with significantly reduced risks of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The findings indicate that unsweetened coffee drinkers have a 29-30% reduced risk of developing these neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study analyzed data from over 200,000 participants aged 40 to 69.</li>
  <li>Finding: Unsweetened coffee drinkers had a 29-30% lower risk of Alzheimer’s.</li>
  <li>There was also a 43% lower risk of dying from Alzheimer’s and related conditions.</li>
  <li>Decaf coffee reduced risks by 34-37% and lowered dying risks by 47%.</li>
  <li>Adding sugar or sweeteners to coffee offers no significant health benefits.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Every dietary choice matters in the long run.”</blockquote>
<p>The results emphasize the importance of dietary choices, particularly regarding sugar consumption, for brain health.</p>]]></description>

<p>A recent study suggests that consuming tea daily can slow down biological aging. This study, published in <i>The Lancet Regional Health</i>, involved over 13,000 participants from the UK and China.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study finds that three cups of tea a day are optimal for slowing biological aging.</li>
<li>Significant differences were noted in participants who shifted from nondrinking to tea-drinking.</li>
<li>Polyphenols in tea are highlighted for their health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</li>
<li>Tea consumption may help protect against age-related diseases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Tea contains a variety of bioactive substances, especially polyphenols... which may delay the aging process,” the authors stated.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, making tea a daily habit could offer significant health benefits and potentially extend lifespan by slowing aging processes.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 18, 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> ANI</p>
<p>Researchers from UC San Diego and Stanford University have developed a noninvasive method to monitor electrical activity in cardiac muscle cells without invasive procedures. This AI-based technique captures electrical signals from outside the cells and reconstructs the internal signals with high precision.</p>
<ul>
  <li>New AI technique allows monitoring of heart cell signals noninvasively.</li>
  <li>Traditional methods require invasive electrode penetration, risking cell damage.</li>
  <li>The method correlates extracellular signals to predict intracellular signals.</li>
  <li>Potential applications in drug screening and personalized medicine.</li>
  <li>Researchers aim to extend the technique to other types of cells.</li>

The state health department has vowed to work towards ensuring there are zero deaths due to KFD this year.</p><ul><li>The patients are Kushal (63) from Basavani village, Shivamogga, and Sathish (24) from Kadabagere, Chikkamagaluru.</li><li>Kushal has been discharged, while Sathish is recovering in a private hospital in Manipal.</li><li>The state reported 14 deaths and 303 confirmed cases of KFD in 2024.</li><li>The health department is coordinating with the forest department to reduce KFD's spread.</li></ul><blockquote>“We do not want any KFD-related deaths this year. Our prevention and surveillance systems this time are more robust than last year so we are aiming at zero deaths,” said a senior official privy to the discussions.</blockquote><p>The tick-borne viral disease is endemic to the forested districts along the Western Ghats in Karnataka. The state is also tracking the progress of a new vaccine for KFD.</p>]]></description>

<p>Researchers are exploring xenon gas as a potential new therapy for Alzheimer's disease, finding that it can suppress neuroinflammation and reduce brain shrinkage in a mouse model, paving the way for clinical trials in humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers are actively seeking effective treatments for Alzheimer's, which is becoming increasingly common.</li>
<li>Current medications primarily address symptoms rather than the disease itself, although some newer treatments target brain lesions.</li>
<li>Xenon gas has been identified as a promising avenue for treatment.</li>
<li>In studies using mouse models, xenon inhalation exhibited neuroprotective benefits.</li>
<li>A clinical trial for human participants is set to begin soon.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The results are intriguing... it is quite expensive and there would be a challenge understanding how to deliver it to a large patient group.”</p>
<p>— Anton Porsteinsson, MD</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers' findings suggest that xenon inhalation could modify microglial activity and reduce neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's. Although this study is preliminary, the implications for future research and treatment options are optimistic.</p>]]></description>

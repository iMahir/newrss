<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Seasonal changes often bring fluctuating weather conditions and an increased risk of illnesses in children, which can lead to dehydration and reduced energy levels.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Dehydration and its impact on immunity:</strong> Pediatric expert Dr. NL Sridhar explains that dehydration can weaken children's immunity and leave them more vulnerable to infections.</li>
  <li><strong>How seasonal illnesses lead to dehydration:</strong> Fever, nausea, and vomiting are common in children during seasonal changes and can result in fluid, electrolyte, and energy deficits.</li>
  <li><strong>Highlighting the role of fluid, electrolyte, and energy (FEE) deficits in supporting recovery:</strong> Dr. NL Sridhar emphasizes the importance of replenishing fluids, electrolytes, and energy to counteract the effects of dehydration.</li>
  <li><strong>The Role of Electrolytes in Recovery:</strong> Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium are vital for recovery during seasonal illnesses.</li>
  <li><strong>The Importance of Timely Intervention:</strong> Early identification and management of dehydration and energy deficits can significantly improve recovery in children.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><strong>Notable Quote:</strong> "Ready-to-drink formulations with a scientifically balanced composition of electrolytes and energy are particularly beneficial as they ensure consistent quality and taste." - Dr. NL Sridhar</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Your Dog Could Have Diabetes: A Common Yet Often Unnoticed Condition</h1>
<p><strong>Published on Dec 31, 2023 - Source: India Today</strong></p>
<img src="https://cf-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/visualstory/wp/2024/12/dogs2itg-1735565018496-scaled_1200_675.jpg" alt="Dogs and cats with diabetes" width="1200" height="675">
<figcaption>The image shows dogs and cats, highlighting the importance of pet health awareness.</figcaption>
<p>Diabetes in pets, especially dogs and cats, is more common than many pet owners realize. While it's not as prevalent as in humans, it's a serious condition that requires proper management. Sadly, around 20% of pets with diabetes are euthanized within a year of diagnosis due to various factors, including lack of awareness and understanding of the condition.</p>
<ol>
<li>Glucose is the body's main energy source, regulated by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas.</li>
<li>In diabetic animals, low insulin levels cause high blood sugar. Middle-aged, obese, and unspayed female dogs are at higher risk.</li>
<li>There are two types of diabetes in pets: Type 1, which is common in dogs but rare in cats, and Type 2, which is the opposite.</li>
<li>Symptoms of diabetes in pets develop gradually but can worsen quickly if untreated. Key signs include increased thirst, urination, appetite, and weight loss.</li>
<li>Cats may develop a flat-footed stance, while dogs are prone to cataracts.</li>
<li>Management of diabetes in pets involves SGLT2 inhibitors for early stages and long-acting insulin injections for advanced cases, along with gradual weight loss and low-carb diets for cats.</li>
<li>Insulin therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, despite the rarity of diabetes reversal in dogs.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"Sadly, around 20% of pets with diabetes are euthanized within a year of diagnosis."</blockquote>
<p>Understanding and managing diabetes in pets is crucial for their well-being and longevity. Regular vet check-ups and proper diet management can significantly improve the quality of life for diabetic pets.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>IIT Bombay researchers develop needle-free ‘shock’ syringe</h1>
<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Researchers from IIT Bombay have developed a ‘shock’ syringe that delivers medication using shock waves, eliminating the need for needles.</p>
<img src="https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Syringe.jpg?w=802&amp;enlarge=true" alt="The shock syringes are painless. (Image Credit: kuniharu wakabayashi/DigitalVision/Getty Images)." />
<figcaption>The shock syringes are painless. (Image Credit: kuniharu wakabayashi/DigitalVision/Getty Images).</figcaption>
<p>The device uses a micro shock tube to create a rapid jet stream of liquid that penetrates the skin, allowing for painless drug delivery.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The shock syringe is longer than a regular ballpoint pen and uses pressurized nitrogen to deliver medication.</li>
  <li>Tests on lab rats showed results comparable to conventional syringes.</li>
  <li>Could facilitate quicker vaccination drives and alleviate fears associated with needles, especially for children.</li>
  <li>Less skin damage compared to traditional needle injections, reducing trauma from injections.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The shock syringe is designed to deliver the medication rapidly,” - Priyanka Hankare, lead author of the research paper.</blockquote>
<p>This innovation highlights the potential to transform drug delivery methods, pending further research and regulatory approval.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Accuracy of ESAT6-CFP10 skin test compared with tuberculin skin test in a healthy population: a randomized, blind, parallel controlled phase III clinical study - BMC Infectious Diseases]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>EC Skin Test Accuracy and Booster Effect Factors</h1>
<p>This randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled phase III clinical trial evaluated the accuracy of the ESAT6-CFP10 (EC) skin test compared to the tuberculin skin test (TB-PPD) and interferon-gamma release assay (T-SPOT) in a healthy population. The trial also determined factors influencing the booster effect of EC.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The trial was conducted at the Jiangsu Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China.</li>
  <li>Healthy participants aged 18-65 were enrolled and provided written informed consent.</li>
  <li>The experiment was divided into two stages, with the first stage involving all participants undergoing T-SPOT, TB-PPD, and EC tests. In the second stage, tri-negative participants (negative in all three tests) were randomly assigned to receive BCG or placebo vaccinations and underwent the tests again after 12 weeks.</li>
  <li>The primary endpoints were reactions at the injection sites and safety results within 48 hours after the skin tests, while the secondary endpoints were booster effects of skin tests.</li>
  <li>In the first stage, 1,564 participants were enrolled, and in the second stage, 585 tri-negative participants were randomly assigned to the BCG or placebo groups.</li>
  <li>The positivity rates and concordance of the three tests were calculated in both stages, and a logistic regression model was used to determine factors influencing the EC booster effect.</li>
  <li>Safety observations continued until the skin test results were available.</li>
</ul>
<div><img src='https://example.com/image.jpg' alt='Article Image' width='685' height='450'></div>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The positivity rates of the T-SPOT, EC, and TB-PPD tests in the first stage were 18.89%, 10.37%, and 53.96%, respectively. The concordance between the EC and T-SPOT tests was 88.97% (kappa = 0.56), and that between the TB-PPD and T-SPOT tests was 58.19% (kappa = 0.20).</li>
  <li>In the second stage, the overall positivity rates of the T-SPOT, EC, and TB-PPD tests in the tri-negative participants were 5.47%, 8.84%, and 62.11%, respectively. The concordance between the EC and T-SPOT tests was 93.68% (kappa = 0.53), and that between the TB-PPD and T-SPOT tests was 43.37% (kappa = 0.06).</li>
  <li>The factors associated with the EC booster effect were age ≥ 60 years and retest positivity of the T-SPOT test.</li>
  <li>Adverse events occurred in 328 (20.97%) participants in the first stage, with most being local adverse reactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The EC skin test showed similar diagnostic performance to the T-SPOT test in the healthy population and was unaffected by BCG vaccination. The booster effects were more likely to occur in populations with retest positivity of the T-SPOT test or age ≥ 60 years.</p>

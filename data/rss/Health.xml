(Source: Freepik)</figcaption><p>A recent study published in <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> reveals that older adults in South Asia continue to be highly vulnerable to diarrhoeal diseases despite a global decrease in mortality. This demographic faces the highest mortality rates along with children under five.</p><ul><li><strong>Elderly Vulnerability:</strong> Those aged 70 years and older in South Asia had the highest mortality rate globally, with 476 deaths per 100,000 population.</li><li><strong>Regional Disparities:</strong> High-income countries reported fewer than one death per 100,000 children under five, while sub-Saharan Africa has over 150 deaths in the same age group.</li><li><strong>Declining DALYs:</strong> The burden of diarrhoeal diseases decreased from 186 million in 1990 to 59 million in 2021.</li></ul><h2>Why older adults are at higher risk in South Asia</h2><p>Dr. Manisha Arora explains that older adults are susceptible due to a decline in immune function and pre-existing health conditions that complicate hydration during diarrhoeal episodes. “Older adults often face a dilemma during diarrhoea,” she notes, highlighting the challenges of hydration management.</p><h2>Tackling the crisis</h2><p>Dr. Arora emphasizes a multifaceted approach to reduce mortality rates among the elderly in South Asia:</p><ol><li><strong>Improve Access to Clean Water and Sanitation:</strong> Essential for preventing diarrhoeal diseases.</li><li><strong>Strengthen Healthcare Infrastructure:</strong> Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical.</li><li><strong>Promote Vaccinations:</strong> Vaccines can significantly help in reducing disease incidence.</li><li><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> Importance of hydration and early treatment should be communicated.</li><li><strong>Focus on Elderly Care:</strong> Interventions for fluid replacement and management of comorbidities are crucial.</li></ol><p>While global mortality rates from diarrhoeal diseases have declined, the situation for older adults in South Asia demands urgent attention. As Dr. Arora points out, “Addressing dehydration, improving healthcare access, and promoting preventive measures are key.”</p>]]></description>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<li><strong>Dietary Changes:</strong> Indulgence in rich foods and high sodium during the holidays can raise blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Stress Levels:</strong> Holiday pressures can elevate stress hormones, increasing heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Weather Effects:</strong> Cold conditions can raise blood pressure and workload on the heart, posing risks for individuals with heart conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Inactivity:</strong> Sedentary lifestyles during the holidays can lead to poor cardiovascular health.</li>
<li><strong>Neglecting Health Monitoring:</strong> Skipping medications and health routines can exacerbate potential heart issues.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Inflammation-Depression Link: Breakthrough Paves Way for Personalized Treatments</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> Updated On - 1 January 2025, 06:02 PM, Source: Telangana Today</p>
<img src="https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/depression.jpg" alt="Breakthrough links inflammation to depression’s causes" width="1200" height="720" /><figcaption>Represntative image</figcaption>
<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Scientists have uncovered a significant link between inflammation and depression, a discovery that could revolutionize our understanding of mental health and pave the way for personalized treatments.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking research by Raz Yirmiya from Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggests that the activation and suppression of the immune system can trigger depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for tailored treatment approaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>The study found that exposure to stress activates inflammatory processes in the brain, which can lead to depression.</li>
<li>Yirmiya's team identified several promising therapeutic targets by combining molecular techniques with behavioral studies.</li>
<li>The research suggests potential for developing personalized treatments based on individual inflammatory profiles.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"My overarching aim is to harness the extensive knowledge from my research and others to accelerate the development of novel antidepressant therapeutics targeting inflammatory processes." - Raz Yirmiya</blockquote>
<p>Yirmiya's work is part of a larger series by Genomic Press that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific ideas.</p>

(Photo: Freepik)</figcaption><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> As we step into 2025, it's crucial to reflect on our daily habits and identify areas that may be harming our health. Discontinuing certain old practices and adopting healthier habits can improve our overall quality of life, increase energy levels, and reduce the risk of serious health conditions.</p><ol><li><strong>Consuming excessive sugar:</strong> High sugar intake can lead to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Limit daily intake to less than 25 grams (6 teaspoons) and opt for natural sources like fruits and vegetables.</li><li><strong>Ignoring sleep schedule:</strong> Poor sleep habits can disrupt your body's internal clock, leading to fatigue, mood disorders, and weakened immune system. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night and establish a consistent sleep pattern.</li><li><strong>Skipping breakfast:</strong> A big dietary mistake, skipping breakfast can lead to nutrient deficiencies, low energy, and overeating later in the day. Start your day with a balanced breakfast that includes protein, whole grains, and healthy fats.</li><li><strong>Using electronic devices before bedtime:</strong> Pre-bedtime use of phones and laptops can interfere with sleep patterns and make it difficult to fall asleep. Avoid using electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime and opt for relaxing activities like reading or meditation.</li><li><strong>Not staying hydrated:</strong> Inadequate hydration can lead to headaches, fatigue, and digestive problems. Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water each day and limit sugary drink intake.</li><li><strong>Sitting for long periods:</strong> Prolonged sitting can increase the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Take regular breaks to stand up, stretch, move around, and aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.</li><li><strong>Not managing stress:</strong> Chronic stress can lead to anxiety, depression, and a weakened immune system. Practice stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing, yoga, or meditation, and take breaks to relax and recharge.</li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> By recognizing and abandoning these unhealthy practices, we can take the first step towards a healthier, happier life in 2025.</p>]]></description>

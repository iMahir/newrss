<figcaption>Women experience higher waiting-list mortality in lung transplantation</figcaption>
<p>A recent study investigated gender disparities in lung transplantation outcomes, revealing that women wait longer than men for transplants, despite better survival rates post-transplant.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Women are less likely to undergo lung transplantation than men and tend to wait longer on the list.</li>
  <li>Women displayed better post-transplant survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years compared to men.</li>
  <li>The study analyzed data from 1710 patients, with women making up 47% of the sample.</li>
  <li>Participants included various underlying diseases such as COPD, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis.</li>
  <li>The research suggested that size matching may be less stringent when women receive larger lungs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Women waited significantly longer for a lung transplant and were less likely to be transplanted than men." - Study Conclusion</blockquote>
<p>This study highlights the critical need for addressing gender disparities in lung transplantation, promoting better access and treatment outcomes for women.</p>]]></description>

  <figcaption>Why Is HPV Vaccine Important For Boys And Men?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The HPV vaccine is crucial for boys and men primarily for cancer prevention and public health. It protects against various HPV-related cancers, which are increasingly linked to HPV infections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HPV can prevent a range of cancers including penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers.</li>
  <li>About 70% of oropharyngeal cancer cases are attributed to HPV.</li>
  <li>The HPV vaccine can prevent over 90% of cancers caused by the most common strains of HPV.</li>
  <li>Vaccination is most effective when given before the onset of sexual activity.</li>
  <li>CDC recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls at ages 11 to 12.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"HPV is linked to approximately 31% of penile cancer cases, with HPV-16 being the most common subtype found in these tumors." – Dr. Sanjay Wazir</blockquote>
<p>In summary, vaccinating boys against HPV not only benefits their health but also plays a crucial role in public health by reducing HPV-related diseases.</p>]]></description>

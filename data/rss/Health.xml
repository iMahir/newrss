<figcaption>The risk for cancers of the breast, the mouth and the throat may rise with consumption of as little as one drink a day, or even less, said Dr Murthy. (File Photo/Representational)</figcaption>
<p>US Surgeon-General Vivek Murthy has called for alcoholic beverages to carry cancer warning labels, highlighting evidence that no level of alcohol consumption is safe when it comes to cancer risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the US, following tobacco and obesity.</li>
  <li>Consumption of just one drink per day can increase the risk for several cancers including breast, mouth, and throat.</li>
  <li>Alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the WHO, with no safe level of consumption.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy's report states alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy draws parallels with India's anti-smoking campaigns as a model for addressing alcohol-related harm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Alcohol has been confirmed as a group 1 carcinogen... there is no safe level of alcohol,” - Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects a growing recognition of the health risks associated with alcohol consumption and aims to reduce the incidence of alcohol-related cancers.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Union health ministry has addressed concerns regarding a potential outbreak of the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China, affirming that there has been no significant increase in viral respiratory illness cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The health ministry stated there’s “no substantial increase” in respiratory illness cases.</li>
<li>Dr. Atul Goel emphasized the commonality of the virus, akin to any other respiratory virus.</li>
<li>Monitoring of both seasonal influenza and respiratory cases is ongoing.</li>
<li>Precautionary measures against spread are advised for respiratory infections.</li>
<!-- More points can be added if needed -->
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is nothing to be alarmed about in the present situation,” said Dr. Goel.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, officials maintain that while attention to HMPV is warranted, the public can remain calm as the healthcare system is prepared and no alarming rise in cases has been noted.</p>]]></description>

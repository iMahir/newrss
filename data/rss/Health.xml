  <li>The carbohydrates in strawberries mainly consist of fibers and simple sugars, contributing to a low glycemic index.</li>
  <li>Potential allergies to strawberries are common, particularly in children.</li>
  <li>Strawberries can cause reactions in individuals sensitive to birch pollen or apples.</li>
  <li>It is generally advised to consume about eight strawberries each day for optimal health benefits.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Strawberries are usually well tolerated, but allergy is fairly common."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while strawberries are a nutritious fruit, it is important to be mindful of potential allergic reactions and to consume them in moderation.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Researchers Advise 150 Minutes a Week Aerobic Exercises for Reducing Waist, Fat</h1>
<p><strong>Published On:</strong> Dec 27, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> PTI</p>
<img src="https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1716881542-ethealthworld.webp" alt="Aerobic exercises" />
<figcaption>Aerobic exercises for at least 150 minutes a week are important for reducing waist and body fat.</figcaption>
<p>New research suggests that engaging in aerobic exercises for at least 150 minutes a week can significantly reduce waist and body fat in overweight and obese adults. The findings indicate that while 300 minutes per week offers the highest body weight reduction, 150 minutes yields the best improvements in body fat percentage.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Study reviewed 116 trials involving nearly 7,000 participants.</li>
    <li>Aerobic training includes activities like running and cycling that enhance heart rate and oxygen flow.</li>
    <li>Authors stress the need for more uniform recommendations for aerobic training duration in weight loss.</li>
    <li>30 minutes per week results in modest benefits; 150 minutes can lead to clinically significant reductions.</li>
    <li>Greatest improvement in body fat percentage occurs at the 150-minute mark.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Aerobic exercise training at least 150 minutes per week at moderate intensity or higher may be needed to achieve clinically important reductions in waist circumference and measures of body fat."</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the study underscores the importance of regular aerobic exercise for effective weight management and health improvement among individuals with a higher body mass index.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The wrong diet and lifestyle are bigger triggers for fatty liver than alcohol.</figcaption>
<p>Amidst India’s rising epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as a significant health risk, driven largely by poor diet and lifestyle choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>NAFLD occurs when fat accumulates in the liver of non-drinkers, leading to inflammation and scarring.</li>
<li>Dr. SK Sarin mentions that nearly one in three to four people in India has fatty liver.</li>
<li>A new preventive module aims to detect the condition early to combat this growing health issue.</li>
<li>Fatty liver rates are becoming as prevalent as heart disease across various age groups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Almost one in three to four people in India have fatty liver.” - Dr. SK Sarin</blockquote>
<p>The rising prevalence of fatty liver disease highlights the need for increased awareness and preventive measures against this largely asymptomatic yet harmful condition.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Screen Time, Sleep and Behavioural Issues: Is that a Vicious Cycle in Children?</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Dec 27, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>

<figcaption>Sleep patterns and behaviours in preschoolers can be influenced by the time they spent on their screens. (Pexels)</figcaption>
<p>This article explores the harmful impact of excessive screen time on children's sleep and behavior, drawing on a study led by Dr. Shujin Zhou from Shanghai Normal University.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study involved 571 mothers of preschool children and assessed screen time, sleep quality, and behavioral challenges.</li>
  <li>Findings indicate that increased screen time is linked to poorer sleep, which in turn exacerbates behavioral issues.</li>
  <li>Boys displayed higher levels of hyperactivity and peer-related problems compared to girls.</li>
  <li>The research highlights a vicious cycle: screen time affects sleep, leading to behavioral issues, which in turn may increase screen usage as a coping mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Poor sleep may be due to postponed bedtimes caused by screen viewing and the disruption of sleep patterns due to overstimulation and blue-light exposure.” - Dr. Shujin Zhou</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, regulating screen time can help mitigate behavioral problems in children, while sleep interventions may also alleviate the negative effects of screen exposure.</p>]]></description>

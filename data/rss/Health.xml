<figcaption>While the relationship between sleep and memory has been well established, the neural mechanisms that underpin their interplay remain murky. Credit: Neuroscience News</figcaption>
<p>Researchers at Cornell University have found that pupil size during non-REM sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation. This study demonstrates that contracted pupils correlate with the consolidation of new memories, while dilated pupils relate to the processing of older memories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pupil Size and Memory:</strong> Contracted pupils correlate with new memory consolidation, while dilated pupils process older memories.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Separation:</strong> The brain alternates between new and old knowledge during non-REM sleep to prevent interference.</li>
<li><strong>AI Applications:</strong> Insights into memory processing may help improve efficiency in artificial neural networks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The eyes may be the window to the soul, but the pupil is key to understanding how, and when, the brain forms strong, long-lasting memories, Cornell researchers have found.</blockquote>
<p>The findings offer potential for developing better memory enhancement techniques and deeper understanding of sleep's role in memory processing.</p>]]></description>

</figure>
<p>The US Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, has recommended that alcoholic beverages carry warning labels due to their link to cancer, highlighting the risks even from moderate drinking.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The advisory emphasizes that alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the US.</li>
  <li>Approximately 20,000 cancer-related deaths annually are attributed to alcohol, with 17% from those who drink within recommended limits.</li>
  <li>Less than half of Americans are aware of the alcohol-cancer connection.</li>
  <li>Alcohol consumption is linked to at least seven types of cancer.</li>
  <li>The call for warning labels has received mixed reactions from health organizations and industry representatives.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What we know with a high degree of confidence is that there is a causal link between alcohol and cancer risk. The data has been building for some time and getting stronger and stronger.” - Dr. Vivek Murthy</blockquote>
<p>The Surgeon General's advisory on warning labels seeks to enhance public awareness about the health risks associated with alcohol, targeting a product widely consumed in the US.</p>]]></description>

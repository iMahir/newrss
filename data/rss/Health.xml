<figcaption>Representational image</figcaption>
<p>As cervical cancer month is observed in January, doctors emphasize the importance of awareness regarding the disease, its symptoms, and preventative measures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cervical cancer is primarily caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and is rising in prevalence in India.</li>
<li>Dr Nasreen Ashfaq reports that about 18% of women in India currently suffer from cervical cancer.</li>
<li>The disease is the second leading cause of death among women after breast cancer.</li>
<li>The government has initiated screening tests including pap smears for early detection and treatment.</li>
<li>HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that can lead to cervical cancer over a long period.</li>
<li>Vaccination against HPV is critical for prevention, preferably administered to girls aged 11-13.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Prevention is better than curing cervical cancer because it is the only cancer that can be completely prevented by vaccination.” - Dr Amreen</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, increasing awareness and preventive health measures, including vaccination and regular screenings, are vital for lowering the incidence of cervical cancer among women in India.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Barbells; chalk; the clang of iron plates. Strength training is having a moment.</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the growing trend of strength training and its health benefits, emphasizing the importance of muscle strength for overall well-being as people age.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength training is gaining popularity, with gyms shifting focus from cardio machines to weightlifting equipment.</li>
<li>The World Health Organisation recommends muscle-strengthening exercises at least twice a week.</li>
<li>A 2020 study showed that only 10% to 30% of adults meet strength training guidelines.</li>
<li>Strength training can reduce the risk of heart diseases, diabetes, and cancer.</li>
<li>Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle with age, is a significant health issue that can lead to frailty and increased risk of falls.</li>
<li>Even older adults can benefit from regular strength training to maintain functionality and health.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Even for people in their 80s, a bit of pumping iron can work wonders."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, incorporating strength training into regular exercise routines can lead to a healthier and longer life, especially as we age.</p>]]></description>

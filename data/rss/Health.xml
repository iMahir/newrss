<figcaption>Researchers are trying to find out what happens to teeth’s enamel as we age. (iStock)</figcaption>
<p>Researchers from the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are investigating the atomic composition of tooth enamel samples from individuals of different ages to understand the brittleness of teeth as we age.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study analyzed enamel samples from a 22-year-old and a 56-year-old.</li>
    <li>Findings revealed the older sample contained higher fluoride levels in the enamel's crystalline structure.</li>
    <li>The researchers employed atom probe tomography to map atoms in the enamel.</li>
    <li>The aim is to understand how mineral content changes with aging.</li>
    <li>Notably, the decrease of protein in enamel with age is still not understood.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We’re interested in understanding exactly how the mineral content is changing. And if you want to see that, you have to look at the scale of atoms.” - Jack Grimm</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, this research sheds light on the complex changes in tooth enamel with aging, emphasizing the need for further studies to unravel the connection between protein levels and enamel brittleness.</p>]]></description>

<p>Winters bring various health challenges, especially for those with heart conditions, as the incidence of heart attacks tends to rise. Lower temperatures cause blood vessels to constrict, increasing blood pressure and straining the heart.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals with existing heart conditions are at higher risk.</li>
  <li>Risk factors include age, alcohol consumption, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle.</li>
  <li>Tips to maintain heart health include staying physically active, following a healthy diet, and avoiding excess alcohol.</li>
  <li>Consulting healthcare providers for heart conditions is crucial during winter months.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is essential to be extra careful during this weather condition and take preventive measures to keep the heart healthy.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, taking necessary precautions and staying proactive in heart health management can help mitigate the risks associated with winter weather.</p>]]></description>

<p>A recent study has found a significant rise in chronic fatigue syndrome cases among individuals recovering from Covid-19.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study, funded by the US government, links long Covid to increased cases of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).</li>
  <li>4.5% of Covid-19 survivors met the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, compared to 0.6% of those uninfected.</li>
  <li>The NIH conducted the study as part of its RECOVER initiative, analyzing data from 13,224 participants.</li>
  <li>New ME/CFS cases post-Covid were found to be 15 times higher than pre-pandemic levels.</li>
  <li>The identified symptoms included post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, and cognitive impairment.</li>
  <li>The findings underline the necessity to understand Covid-19's role in triggering chronic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These findings add to the growing evidence that infections like Covid-19 can lead to chronic fatigue syndrome.” - Dr. Suzanne D. Vernon</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the triggers of ME/CFS may pave the way for improved treatments for chronic conditions associated with infections.</p>]]></description>

<p>A two-day summit in Chennai focused on eliminating hepatitis emphasized the need for early detection to prevent deaths related to the viral infection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The summit highlighted that 70% of hepatitis deaths are preventable.</li>
  <li>Approximately 1.3 million people died of viral hepatitis globally in 2022, up from 1.1 million in 2019.</li>
  <li>Experts call for increased awareness and improved treatment access in India.</li>
  <li>An app for data collection and follow-up of hepatitis cases was launched during the summit.</li>
  <li>Online courses for healthcare professionals were introduced to enhance skills in combating hepatitis.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Hepatitis is a global crisis,” stated Rachel Holford, president of the World Hepatitis Alliance.</blockquote>
<p>The summit reinforced the need for heightened awareness and proactive measures to control hepatitis, as well as the development of vaccines and treatment strategies to eliminate the disease.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nutritional Support Could Prevent TB Deaths and Cases in India by 2035: Lancet Study</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified in the article.</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> The Lancet Global Health</p>
<p>This study indicates that providing nutritional support to half of the households undergoing tuberculosis (TB) treatment in India may significantly reduce TB deaths and cases by 2035.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 4.5% of TB-related deaths might be prevented.</li>
<li>About 2.2% of TB disease episodes could be averted.</li>
<li>Estimates suggest that more than 360,000 deaths and over 880,000 TB cases could be averted.</li>
<li>The intervention may cost about USD 1,349 million but offers a potential economic benefit of USD 167 per disability-adjusted life-year averted.</li>
<li>An earlier study by the same research team revealed a drop in TB incidence by 39-48% through nutritional support for household contacts of TB patients.</li>
<li>The findings suggest a greater focus on states with high levels of undernutrition could enhance effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We found that if India can deliver a nutritional intervention to 50% of households in which individuals are receiving tuberculosis treatment, nearly 900,000 episodes of tuberculosis would be averted, and nearly 400,000 deaths, at a cost of USD 167 per disability-adjusted life-year averted,” the authors wrote.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, nutritional support is a cost-effective approach likely to yield substantial health and economic benefits in combating tuberculosis in India.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>An image representing the impact of tuberculosis.</figcaption>
<p>The introduction of a new short-term regimen for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) offers hope for patients, potentially transforming treatment protocols and improving adherence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>MDR-TB is a serious illness, with high risks of death, particularly in India where 27% of global cases were reported.</li>
  <li>Traditional treatment regimens for DR-TB were lengthy and involved toxic side effects.</li>
  <li>New regimens like BPaL can shorten treatment duration to 6 months and are designed to be less toxic.</li>
  <li>Continuous monitoring and evaluation of drug effectiveness is essential to prevent resistance.</li>
  <li>Health system preparedness and training for healthcare professionals are crucial for successful implementation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Shorter regimens are likely to be more expensive for the program. However, continuing inexpensive but toxic regimens would be myopic.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while the new treatment regimens for TB are a significant advancement, a comprehensive approach addressing systemic issues and social determinants is necessary for long-term success.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Cracking the code of the extracellular matrix</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Unknown</p>
<p>This article explores the significant role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in brain function, detailing how ECM proteins influence neuronal plasticity, learning, and their potential implications for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The discovery that ECM digestion can restore visual cortex plasticity after the critical period.</li>
<li>Up to 20% of the brain consists of ECM, which plays various roles in synaptic function and myelin formation.</li>
<li>ECM proteins could be crucial for what makes human brains unique and healthy.</li>
<li>Recent studies tie ECM proteins to youthfulness in brain biomarkers and their dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The ECM field in neuroscience has been underexplored despite its importance.</li>
<li>Challenges remain with scientific blind spots and technical limitations in studying ECM proteins.</li>
<li>Advances in proteomics and a shift in thinking are necessary to fully understand the ECM and its implications for brain research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the matrix involves the same degree of complexity and precision, the potential payoff for our understanding of brain plasticity and brain diseases could be immense.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the article emphasizes the need for collaboration in neuroscience to address the complexities of the ECM and its role in brain function.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Representational Image | Photo: Canva.com</figcaption>
<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) reports of eight suspected Marburg virus-related deaths in northern Tanzania, while local authorities refute these claims, stating no positive tests. This divergence has raised concerns about disease surveillance and public health responses.</p>
<ul>
<li>WHO reports 9 suspected Marburg cases, with 8 deaths.</li>
<li>Tanzanian Health Minister denies any confirmed cases.</li>
<li>Immediate investigation and testing by Tanzanian health officials showed no positive results for Marburg.</li>
<li>Marburg virus is highly contagious and fatal in up to 88% of cases without treatment.</li>
<li>WHO considers the outbreak risk high nationally and regionally, but low globally.</li>
<li>Previous outbreaks have seen significant mortality rates, with health workers among the most affected.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We would expect further cases in the coming days as disease surveillance improves.” - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Chief</blockquote>
<blockquote>“As of 15th January 2025, laboratory results for all suspected individuals were negative for the Marburg virus.” - Jenista Mhagama, Tanzania's Health Minister</blockquote>
<p>This incident underscores the challenges in managing emerging infectious diseases and the importance of accurate reporting and communication between agencies and governments.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date] | <strong>Source:</strong> Mint</p>
<p>As cases of HMPV (human metapneumovirus) emerge globally, doctors are leveraging social media and humor to calm public fears and educate about the virus.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HMPV cases reported in China sparked widespread panic, especially in Asia.</li>
    <li>India has confirmed 13 cases, including a recent case in a 9-month-old child from Gujarat.</li>
    <li>Medical professionals emphasize that HMPV is not a cause for mass panic.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The HMPV virus needn’t be a cause for panic or anxiety.”</blockquote>
<p>This initiative aims to educate the public in a more accessible and relatable manner amidst rising fears of respiratory viruses.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/centered/newbucket/1200_675/2025/01/bird-flu-1736490487.webp" alt="Here's what you need to know about H5N1 virus" width="1200" height="675">
<figcaption> Here's what you need to know about H5N1 virus </figcaption>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that a person has died of H5N1 bird flu in the United States, marking the first such death in the country due to this infection, which is primarily caused by animal-to-human exposure.</p>
<ul>
<li>H5N1 does not spread from person to person.</li>
<li>First identified in Southern China in 1996, it has caused sporadic outbreaks in birds worldwide.</li>
<li>Symptoms include pink eye, fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties.</li>
<li>Severe cases can lead to complications like pneumonia and respiratory failure.</li>
<li>Preventative measures include wearing protective clothing and frequent handwashing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Scientists said that the virus would need to evolve or retain key changes in its genetic sequence to start a pandemic.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while H5N1 bird flu poses a significant risk to birds and occasionally humans, it does not spread between human beings, making widespread outbreaks less likely under current conditions.</p>]]></description>

<p>Chinese health officials have identified a new mutated strain of mpox, known as clade Ib, in a foreigner who had traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This finding comes as mpox continues to spread globally, prompting concern from health authorities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A cluster of cases was linked to an individual from the DRC, with four additional cases reported among close contacts.</li>
  <li>Symptoms among infected individuals are reported to be mild, including skin rashes and blisters.</li>
  <li>Mpox transmits through close contact and can lead to serious health issues in vulnerable populations.</li>
  <li>Infection rates and deaths in the DRC raise alarms, particularly concerning individuals with underlying health conditions.</li>
  <li>WHO's designation of mpox as a global public health emergency highlights the need for monitoring and containment measures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Clade Ib seems to be different, and is spreading largely through contact between humans, including through sex. Around 18,000 suspected cases of mpox, many of them among children, and at least 600 deaths potentially attributable to the disease have been reported this year (2024) in the DRC alone."</blockquote>
<p>The mpox situation underscores the importance of public awareness and health measures to control the spread of this viral disease.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Innovative Cure for Dengue and Malaria: 'Toxic' Semen from Male Mosquitoes Kills Females</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong> October 2023 <strong>Source: </strong> Time of India</p>
<p>An innovative approach to combat dengue and malaria is making waves as researchers discover that 'toxic' semen from male mosquitoes could effectively kill female mosquitoes, potentially controlling the spread of these diseases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The research highlights the use of male mosquitoes in disease control strategies.</li>
  <li>Female mosquitoes, which are responsible for biting and spreading disease, are targeted.</li>
  <li>This method offers a novel biological solution to a long-standing public health issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This breakthrough could revolutionize our approach to combating mosquito-borne diseases," says lead researcher.</blockquote>
<p>This innovative strategy could provide a sustainable and effective method for reducing the populations of disease-carrying mosquitoes, ultimately aiming for better health outcomes in affected regions.</p>]]></description>

However, the effect on uric acid is modest and did not translate into reduced risk of gout in EMPA-KIDNEY.”</blockquote><p>Despite reducing uric acid levels, empagliflozin does not significantly decrease the risk of gout among CKD patients.</p>]]></description>

<p>Obesity in children diagnosed with cancer poses significant health risks, highlighting the importance of managing obesity to improve cancer outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Study conducted by researchers at Montreal's Sainte-Justine Hospital.</li>
<li>Data analyzed from the Cancer in Young People in Canada database (2001-2020).</li>
<li>10.5% of 11,291 children with cancer were classified as obese.</li>
<li>Obese children had lower rates of 5-year event-free survival (77.5% vs 79.6%) and overall survival (83.0% vs 85.9%).</li>
<li>Obesity linked to a 16% increased risk of cancer relapse and a 29% increased risk of death.</li>
<li>Most pronounced effects observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our study highlights the negative impact of obesity among all types of childhood cancers. It provides the rationale to evaluate different strategies to mitigate the adverse risk of obesity on cancer outcomes in future trials,” said co-senior author Thai Hoa Tran, MD.</blockquote>
<p>This study underscores the urgent need to address childhood obesity, which can have serious health implications for affected children.</p>]]></description>

<p>Exercise is recognized for its psychological benefits, yet many struggle to maintain a routine. This article outlines five fundamental exercises that encourage not only physical fitness but also improved mental health.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Squats:</strong> Helps in getting comfortable with discomfort.</li>
  <li><strong>Lunges:</strong> Aids in overcoming stuckness and fear of movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Twists:</strong> Encourages fluidity and flow in movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Hinge exercises:</strong> Promotes self-ownership and upright posture.</li>
  <li><strong>Push and Pull movements:</strong> Essential for building strength and resilience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The mood improvements that can come with 30-45 minutes of exercise are more attainable than the six-packs and beach bodies advertised by many gym chains.”</blockquote>
<p>Incorporating these exercises into daily practice can lead to lasting changes in both physical and mental health.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Image Credit: Thx4Stock team/Shutterstock.com</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses how climate change affects the degradation of microplastics, emphasizing the increasing presence of these pollutants due to poor plastic waste management and rising global plastic production rates.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microplastics are categorized into primary and secondary types, with the latter forming from larger plastics through various processes.</li>
  <li>Rising temperatures and climate change accelerate microplastic breakdown and increase their prevalence in ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Extreme weather events contribute to the movement and fragmentation of plastic debris, leading to more microplastics entering the environment.</li>
  <li>Microbial activity related to temperature variations significantly influences plastic degradation efficiency.</li>
  <li>Future research is needed to better understand how climate variables affect microplastics and to develop effective mitigation strategies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"Once in aquatic ecosystems, microplastics tend to remain and accumulate, resulting in a growing pervasiveness and steady increase in microplastic concentrations" <br>— Nathanial Banks, Co-Founder and CTO, PolyGone Systems.</p>

<p>Addressing microplastic pollution is critical as climate change continues to alter environments and increase the distribution of these pollutants.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Sierra Leone Declares Emergency After Second Mpox Case in Four Days</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 13, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> CNBC TV18</p>
<img alt="Sierra Leone declares emergency after confirming second Mpox case in four days" title="Sierra Leone declares emergency after confirming second Mpox case in four days" loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/default.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=360">
<figcaption>Image illustrating the Mpox outbreak in Sierra Leone.</figcaption>
<p>Sierra Leone has declared a state of emergency after confirming its second case of Mpox within four days, as health authorities express concern over the rapid spread of the disease.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first case involved recent travel to the northern Port Loko District.</li>
  <li>Both patients are currently receiving treatment in Freetown.</li>
  <li>Mpox was first identified in 1958, historically affecting mostly people in central and West Africa.</li>
  <li>In 2022, Mpox was confirmed to spread through sexual intercourse, leading to outbreaks in over 70 countries.</li>
  <li>Sierra Leone was previously the epicentre of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, resulting in significant loss of life and healthcare workforce.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Congo has borne the brunt of the epidemic, with a vast majority of the roughly 43,000 suspected cases and 1,000 deaths in Africa this year."</blockquote>
<p>This situation poses a significant public health challenge, especially in the context of Sierra Leone's past experiences with epidemics.</p>]]></description>

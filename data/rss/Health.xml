<figcaption>Image showing air pollution impact</figcaption>
<p>Long-term exposure to air pollution, specifically PM2.5, is linked to infertility in men, as confirmed by a recent BMJ study.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study highlights significant sperm DNA damage, decreased motility, and impaired hormone production due to PM2.5 exposure.</li>
  <li>Men aged 30 to 45 are particularly susceptible to infertility risks associated with air pollution.</li>
  <li>The research also suggests long-term exposure to road traffic noise can link infertility in women over 35.</li>
  <li>Noise pollution is shown to affect reproductive health, causing chronic stress and hormone disruptions.</li>
  <li>Preventive strategies include using air purifiers and N95 masks, especially during peak pollution hours.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Chronic stress, reproductive hormone disruption, and irregular menstrual cycles can all be caused by noise pollution.”</blockquote>
<p>This study underscores the urgent need for addressing air pollution as a critical public health issue, particularly regarding its hidden effects on fertility.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nutritional Support Could Prevent TB Deaths and Cases in India by 2035: Lancet Study</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified in the article.</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> The Lancet Global Health</p>
<p>This study indicates that providing nutritional support to half of the households undergoing tuberculosis (TB) treatment in India may significantly reduce TB deaths and cases by 2035.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 4.5% of TB-related deaths might be prevented.</li>
<li>About 2.2% of TB disease episodes could be averted.</li>
<li>Estimates suggest that more than 360,000 deaths and over 880,000 TB cases could be averted.</li>
<li>The intervention may cost about USD 1,349 million but offers a potential economic benefit of USD 167 per disability-adjusted life-year averted.</li>
<li>An earlier study by the same research team revealed a drop in TB incidence by 39-48% through nutritional support for household contacts of TB patients.</li>
<li>The findings suggest a greater focus on states with high levels of undernutrition could enhance effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We found that if India can deliver a nutritional intervention to 50% of households in which individuals are receiving tuberculosis treatment, nearly 900,000 episodes of tuberculosis would be averted, and nearly 400,000 deaths, at a cost of USD 167 per disability-adjusted life-year averted,” the authors wrote.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, nutritional support is a cost-effective approach likely to yield substantial health and economic benefits in combating tuberculosis in India.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Cracking the code of the extracellular matrix - The Transmitter: Neuroscience News and Perspectives]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Cracking the code of the extracellular matrix</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Unknown</p>
<p>This article explores the significant role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in brain function, detailing how ECM proteins influence neuronal plasticity, learning, and their potential implications for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The discovery that ECM digestion can restore visual cortex plasticity after the critical period.</li>
<li>Up to 20% of the brain consists of ECM, which plays various roles in synaptic function and myelin formation.</li>
<li>ECM proteins could be crucial for what makes human brains unique and healthy.</li>
<li>Recent studies tie ECM proteins to youthfulness in brain biomarkers and their dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The ECM field in neuroscience has been underexplored despite its importance.</li>
<li>Challenges remain with scientific blind spots and technical limitations in studying ECM proteins.</li>
<li>Advances in proteomics and a shift in thinking are necessary to fully understand the ECM and its implications for brain research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the matrix involves the same degree of complexity and precision, the potential payoff for our understanding of brain plasticity and brain diseases could be immense.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the article emphasizes the need for collaboration in neuroscience to address the complexities of the ECM and its role in brain function.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Study relates exposure to air pollution prior to conceiving with higher BMI in children</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 17, 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> PTI</p>
<img src="https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1716881542-ethealthworld.webp" alt="" />
<figcaption></figcaption>
<p>A recent study published in the journal <em>Environmental Research</em> has found a connection between increased air pollution exposure before pregnancy and higher BMI in children.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study analyzed data from over 5,800 mother-child pairs in China.</li>
  <li>Increased PM2.5 levels by 16.2 micrograms per cubic metre were linked to a rise of 0.078 in child BMI Z-scores at age two.</li>
  <li>An increase in PM10 pollution by 21.1 micrograms per cubic metre was also associated with an increase of 0.093 in child BMI.</li>
  <li>Researchers emphasized the need for potential measures to lower air pollution exposure for those planning to conceive.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The magnitude is small, but because air pollution is widespread and everybody is exposed, the risk of exposure on children's obesity may be substantial and may start before their mothers' pregnancy.</blockquote>
<p>These findings highlight the importance of air quality during the preconception period in influencing children's health outcomes.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Air pollution amplifies dementia risk in cardiometabolic disease patients - healthy habits can help</figcaption>
<p>The research highlights how lifestyle changes can help reduce the risks associated with dementia among patients with cardiometabolic diseases exacerbated by air pollution.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Patients with three cardiometabolic diseases have a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.</li>
  <li>Specific hazard ratios indicate significantly increased risks: 1.951 for MCI, 1.554 for all-cause dementia.</li>
  <li>Ambient air pollution, particularly PM2.5 and NO2, worsens cognitive health outcomes.</li>
  <li>Engaging in a healthy lifestyle can mitigate some risks associated with pollution exposure.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia in patients with CMDs was 1.951, 1.554, 1.216, and 2.032 times higher than in those without CMDs, respectively."</blockquote>
<p>The study underscores the importance of adopting healthier lifestyle practices to combat the escalating prevalence of dementia amid increasing pollution levels.</p>]]></description>

<p>The U.S. surgeon general has issued an advisory linking alcohol to seven types of cancer, emphasizing the need for warning labels on alcoholic beverages about this risk. Researchers at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center stress the importance of this advisory in changing public behavior and oncology practices.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The surgeon general's report highlights that alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer.</li>
  <li>Alcohol is linked to over 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 related deaths annually in the U.S.</li>
  <li>The association between alcohol intake and increased cancer risk has been acknowledged for decades.</li>
  <li>Experts are hopeful that labeling will lead to greater public awareness and behavior change regarding alcohol consumption.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Alcohol consumption is certainly a worsening public health problem and we’re going to be in trouble if people continue drinking as they are.” - Dr. Patricia Jones</blockquote>
<p>This advisory signals a significant opportunity to address alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for cancer.</p>]]></description>

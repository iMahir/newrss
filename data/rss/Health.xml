<p>The risk of dying from alcohol-related causes begins even with low levels of alcohol consumption, and this risk increases with higher intake levels, according to a new US federal report.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than seven drinks per week.</li>
  <li>The risk increases to 1 in 100 if consumption exceeds nine drinks per week.</li>
  <li>Men and women have a similar level of risk for alcohol-related health harms, irrespective of gender.</li>
  <li>Alcohol use is linked to increased mortality for several types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, and liver cancer.</li>
  <li>Women face a much greater risk of alcohol-attributable cancer per drink consumed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Combined with the Surgeon General’s recent advisory on alcohol and cancer risk, the evidence is clear and indisputable. The fact that any amount of alcohol is harmful to your health can no longer be ignored.” - Tiffany Hall, USAPA Board Chair</blockquote>
<p>The findings sparked backlash from the drinks industry, which criticized the methodology and biases of the study.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Cholera Outbreak Update in South Sudan</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 17 Jan 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> ECHO Daily Flash</p>
<ul>
  <li>As of January 17, cholera cases in South Sudan have reached 21,389 with 390 fatalities.</li>
  <li>52% of patients are aged between zero to 14 years, the majority of deaths occurring in those aged 60+ (19%) and those between zero to 4 years (18%).</li>
  <li>Cholera is present in 7 out of 10 states; Rubkona alone accounts for 47% of cases.</li>
  <li>The overall case fatality rate stands at 1.8%, with some counties reporting troubling statistics.</li>
  <li>A vaccination campaign has been completed in Renk and is ongoing in three other states.</li>
  <li>Since early December 2024, over 120,000 people have crossed into South Sudan from Sudan, heightening the risk of cholera spread.</li>
  <li>The European Humanitarian Response Capacity delivered 4,290 boxes of PUR tablets for water disinfection to aid the cholera response.</li>
</ul>
<p>The situation remains critical due to both the rapid spread of cholera and the influx of refugees from neighboring Sudan.</p>]]></description>

<p>The recent study introduces genetically modified mice that express human versions of the MAPT gene, suggesting tau hyperphosphorylation plays a crucial role in the early development of tauopathies like Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tau hyperphosphorylation was identified as a potential early factor in tauopathy development.</li>
<li>New animal models were developed to better understand the mechanisms of tau-related neurodegeneration.</li>
<li>The study highlights that synapse loss occurred without higher-order tau structures, indicating a novel pathway of tau toxicity.</li>
<li>Findings could lead to new therapeutic strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance,” the researchers stated.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, this research provides valuable insights that may enhance our understanding of tauopathies and help in developing future treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>]]></description>

<p>A recent study has found a significant rise in chronic fatigue syndrome cases among individuals recovering from Covid-19.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study, funded by the US government, links long Covid to increased cases of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).</li>
  <li>4.5% of Covid-19 survivors met the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, compared to 0.6% of those uninfected.</li>
  <li>The NIH conducted the study as part of its RECOVER initiative, analyzing data from 13,224 participants.</li>
  <li>New ME/CFS cases post-Covid were found to be 15 times higher than pre-pandemic levels.</li>
  <li>The identified symptoms included post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, and cognitive impairment.</li>
  <li>The findings underline the necessity to understand Covid-19's role in triggering chronic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These findings add to the growing evidence that infections like Covid-19 can lead to chronic fatigue syndrome.” - Dr. Suzanne D. Vernon</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the triggers of ME/CFS may pave the way for improved treatments for chronic conditions associated with infections.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Can a cup of coffee in morning boost your heart health?</figcaption>
<p>A recent study in the European Heart Journal suggests that drinking coffee in the morning may have significant health benefits, particularly in reducing the risks of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study indicates that morning coffee consumption is associated with 16% lower death rates and 31% lower cardiovascular disease deaths compared to non-coffee drinkers.</li>
  <li>Moderate coffee drinkers (2-3 cups) and heavy drinkers (more than 3 cups) benefit similarly from health effects.</li>
  <li>However, excessive consumption can lead to adverse effects, including increased risks of high blood pressure and sleep issues.</li>
  <li>Dr. Lu Qi, the study's lead researcher, emphasizes the importance of the timing of coffee consumption.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This study doesn’t tell us why drinking coffee in the morning reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.” - Dr. Lu Qi</blockquote>
<p>The researchers call for a re-evaluation of dietary guidelines regarding coffee timing, highlighting notable health advantages linked to morning coffee consumption.</p>]]></description>

<p>A two-day summit in Chennai focused on eliminating hepatitis emphasized the need for early detection to prevent deaths related to the viral infection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The summit highlighted that 70% of hepatitis deaths are preventable.</li>
  <li>Approximately 1.3 million people died of viral hepatitis globally in 2022, up from 1.1 million in 2019.</li>
  <li>Experts call for increased awareness and improved treatment access in India.</li>
  <li>An app for data collection and follow-up of hepatitis cases was launched during the summit.</li>
  <li>Online courses for healthcare professionals were introduced to enhance skills in combating hepatitis.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Hepatitis is a global crisis,” stated Rachel Holford, president of the World Hepatitis Alliance.</blockquote>
<p>The summit reinforced the need for heightened awareness and proactive measures to control hepatitis, as well as the development of vaccines and treatment strategies to eliminate the disease.</p>]]></description>

<p>The foods we eat daily have a major role in shaping our health. Poor dietary choices can increase the risk of chronic illnesses and even shorten our lifespan.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processed Meats:</strong> Linked to cancer and heart disease due to preservatives like nitrates.</li>
<li><strong>Sugary Drinks:</strong> Major contributors to weight gain and diseases, responsible for over 184,000 deaths annually.</li>
<li><strong>Refined Grains:</strong> Stripped of nutrients, leading to blood sugar spikes and obesity risk.</li>
<li><strong>Fried Foods:</strong> Raise bad cholesterol levels, linked to higher risk of early death.</li>
<li><strong>Packaged Snacks:</strong> High in unhealthy additives and sodium, increasing stroke risk.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Sweeteners:</strong> May disrupt gut health and increase cravings for sugar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Research shows that regular consumption of fried foods is linked to a higher risk of early death, particularly in women.</blockquote>

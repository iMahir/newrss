            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Which infectious disease is likely to be biggest emerging problem in 2025</h1>
<p><strong>Updated: December 26, 2024</strong> | <strong>The Conversation</strong></p>
<img alt="Bird Flu Concern" title="H5N1 Bird Flu" src="https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/wire-updates/pti-preview-theweek.jpg">
<figcaption>Concerns rise over H5N1 bird flu as a potential pandemic threat.</figcaption>
<p>As COVID-19 recedes, health officials are increasingly worried about the potential rise of H5N1 bird flu in 2025, coupled with ongoing issues from malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The top infectious disease threats include malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, which together account for around 2 million deaths annually.</li>
<li>Bird flu (H5N1) is currently a major concern due to recent infections in cattle and the potential for transmission to humans.</li>
<li>61 human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US in 2024, largely among farm workers.</li>
<li>The H5N1 virus has a high mortality rate of 30% in human cases but does not currently spread efficiently between people.</li>
<li>A mutation could allow H5N1 to adapt to humans, raising the risk of a pandemic.</li>
<li>Countries like the UK are preparing by purchasing vaccines against H5N1 in case of an outbreak.</li>
<li>Interconnected health approaches are emphasized to address both animal and human health risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If this strain of bird flu makes that switch and can start transmitting between humans, governments must act quickly to control the spread."</blockquote>
<p>The urgency in addressing bird flu stems from its potential to disrupt animal health and have economic ramifications, highlighting the importance of proactive measures in pandemic preparedness.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 25, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> ANI</p>
<p>A novel way of scanning lungs can demonstrate the impact of treatment on lung function in real-time, benefiting patients with asthma, COPD, and lung transplants.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scanning technique allows doctors to observe changes in lung function and detect deterioration earlier.</li>
<li>Research led by Newcastle University uses perfluoro propane gas visible on MRI scans.</li>
<li>Scans show patchy ventilation and improvements in lung function with treatment.</li>
<li>Study results published in Radiology and JHLT Open validate the method's effectiveness.</li>
<li>Quantitative assessments can aid in clinical trials for new lung disease treatments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our scans show where there is patchy ventilation in patients with lung disease, and show us which parts of the lung improve with treatment.” - Professor Pete Thelwall</blockquote>
<p>The new scanning method shows promise in enhancing understanding and treatment of lung conditions, potentially revolutionizing patient care in this field.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> The Tribune</p>
<p>A team of scientists has created a groundbreaking method for scanning lungs that reveals the effects of treatments in real-time, particularly useful for monitoring transplanted lungs.</p>
<img src='path_to_image.jpg' alt='Lung Scan Example'>
<figcaption>Example of a lung scan using the new method.</figcaption>
<p>This innovative scan visualizes air movement within the lungs for patients suffering from asthma, COPD, and those who have undergone lung transplants.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The method shows how air moves in and out of the lungs during breathing.</li>
  <li>Led by Newcastle University researchers, the study was published in Radiology and JHLT Open.</li>
  <li>Utilizes a safe gas (perfluoropropane) visible in MRI scans to analyze lung function.</li>
  <li>Can identify areas of patchy ventilation and gauge improvements from treatments such as salbutamol.</li>
  <li>May facilitate earlier intervention in lung transplant care and disease management.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We hope this new type of scan might allow us to see changes in the transplant lungs earlier and before signs of damage are present...” – Professor Andrew Fisher</blockquote>
<p>This scan technique has the potential to transform clinical evaluations of lung health and enhance treatment strategies in the future.</p>]]></description>

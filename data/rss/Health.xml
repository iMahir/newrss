<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 17, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>
<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3nrvfy/article68995614.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/80692_15_9_2023_18_33_3_1_16TVKZAMBULANCE2.JPG" alt="File photograph used for representational purposes only" />
<figcaption>File photograph used for representational purposes only | Photo Credit: K Ragesh</figcaption>
<p>A new study revealed that taxi and ambulance drivers have a lower risk of death from Alzheimer's disease compared to individuals in other professions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taxi and ambulance drivers demonstrated the lowest proportions of Alzheimer's-related deaths in a study of nearly nine million people from various occupations.</li>
  <li>Only 171 of 16,658 taxi drivers (approximately 1%) died from Alzheimer's, while 10 of 1,348 ambulance drivers (0.74%) succumbed to the disease.</li>
  <li>The study posited that these professions may provide a protective effect against Alzheimer's due to the frequent processing of spatial and navigational information.</li>
  <li>This trend differs from other transport-related jobs like bus drivers and aircraft pilots, likely due to differences in job demands.</li>
  <li>The impact on the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and navigation, may explain the reduced risk.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"In an analysis of nearly all death certificates in the United States, taxi drivers and ambulance drivers, whose jobs require frequent spatial and navigational processing, were found to be the occupations with the two lowest risk-adjusted percentages of deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease," the authors wrote.</blockquote>
<p>The authors emphasize the need for further research to clarify whether cognitive activities in these professions can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and if such activities can be preventive.</p>]]></description>

<p>A recent study conducted by the University of Michigan reveals that certain processed foods, such as hot dogs and cheeseburgers, may significantly reduce healthy life expectancy. The findings suggest that dietary changes can lead to improved health outcomes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study finds that a single serving of a hot dog can reduce healthy life by 36 minutes.</li>
  <li>Cheeseburgers reduce healthy life by 9 minutes, while sugary drinks can add another 12 minutes to that total.</li>
  <li>Research evaluated over 5,800 types of American foods based on their health impacts.</li>
  <li>Processed meats are shown to adversely affect health and are linked to chronic diseases.</li>
  <li>Alternatives like legumes and fish can potentially increase healthy lifespan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The need for dietary changes aimed at improving human health is clear," said Dr. Olivier Jolliet, the head of the University of Michigan study.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, shifting towards a healthier diet by incorporating less processed foods and more plant-based alternatives may enhance longevity and well-being.</p>]]></description>

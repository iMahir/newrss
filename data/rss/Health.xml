<p>This article explores the surprising effects of space travel on the human body, based on studies conducted by NASA in preparation for future missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>
<ul>
<li>NASA studies how space impacts human health to prepare for future Moon and Mars missions.</li>
<li>Astronauts face health challenges, including bone density loss of 1-1.5% per month in microgravity.</li>
<li>Fluid shifts in microgravity can lead to increased pressure on the eyes and vision problems.</li>
<li>Dehydration and calcium loss increase the risk of kidney stones in space.</li>
<li>Astronauts learn to create medical solutions and perform health checks using ultrasound during missions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Astronauts lose about 1-1.5% of bone density per month during spaceflight.</blockquote>
<p>The findings underscore the importance of further research into the effects of long-duration space travel on health as humanity aims for deeper space exploration.</p>]]></description>

<img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/1464257_Manuscript_runny-nose-fungi-43-642x1020.jpg" alt="If Your Allergies Make You Sniffle You Likely Have Different Fungi Up Your Nose" width="642" height="1020" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Fungal populations and their interconnectedness in terms of functional diversity, found in the three sample groups, control (CT), asthma and rhinitis (ARAS) and allergic rhinitis (AR). (Pérez-Losada et al., <em>Front. microbiol.</em> 2024)</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses the discovery of unique fungi in the noses of individuals with hay fever and asthma. Research led by George Washington University highlights how these fungi differ significantly from those found in healthy individuals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers analyzed nasal samples from 339 participants, including those with allergic rhinitis and asthma.</li>
  <li>Findings indicated more diverse and abundant fungal populations in individuals with these respiratory conditions.</li>
  <li>Key fungal genera identified included <i>Malassezia</i>, <i>Aspergillus</i>, <i>Candida</i>, and <i>Penicillium</i>.</li>
  <li>Increased fungal diversity may help alter the immune system in the nasal cavity.</li>
  <li>The research suggests that allergic rhinitis and asthma may reflect distinct conditions with unique microbiomes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This suggests that the nasal cavity is a major reservoir for fungi that could be involved in allergic rhinitis and asthma.” - Luís Delgado, immunologist</blockquote>
<p>The study underscores the complex relationship between fungi and respiratory diseases, suggesting the need for further longitudinal studies to clarify causality.</p>]]></description>

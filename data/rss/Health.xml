<figcaption>Equitable access to mpox vaccines is essential for at-risk populations in Africa.</figcaption>
<p>The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) calls on Bavarian Nordic to share technology for mpox vaccine production with African manufacturers and to lower vaccine costs for lower-income countries, particularly as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding areas grapple with significant mpox outbreaks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>AHF urges Bavarian Nordic to prioritize Africa in its vaccine distribution strategy.</li>
  <li>Public Citizen supports the call for equitable access to vaccines through technology sharing.</li>
  <li>Children are particularly vulnerable, with significant case and fatality rates reported in the DRC.</li>
  <li>The need for affordable mpox vaccines is critical given historical inequities with COVID-19 vaccine distribution.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“With Africa still bearing the brunt of the mpox outbreak, Bavarian Nordic must prioritize Africa with lower costs, technology transfer, and regional manufacturing...” - Daniel Reijer, AHF Europe Bureau Chief</blockquote>
<p>The call for action emphasizes the importance of equitable vaccine access to prevent further crisis in Africa amidst the ongoing mpox outbreak.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>AHF: Bavarian Nordic Must Prioritize Africa in Localized Mpox Vaccine Production</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Business Wire</p>
<p>AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) calls on Bavarian Nordic to share vaccine technology with African manufacturers and reduce the cost of the Jynneos vaccine to combat mpox effectively.</p>
<blockquote>“While a recent agreement to share vaccine technology with India is a step forward, it falls woefully short of addressing the urgent need for affordable mpox vaccines where they’re needed most”</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>AHF emphasizes the importance of equitable access to mpox vaccines in Africa.</li>
  <li>Recent reports indicate over 50,000 confirmed or suspected cases of mpox in the DRC, with severe effects on children.</li>
  <li>The organization criticizes high-profit motives of pharma companies contributing to vaccine inequity.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>CDC Confirms First Severe Bird Flu Case in the US</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 18, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Wired</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the first severe case of avian influenza caused by the H5N1 virus in the United States, marking a concerning shift in the pattern of human infections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The patient, hospitalized in Louisiana, had exposure to sick birds in backyard flocks.</li>
  <li>This case is the first severe illness linked to H5N1 in the US, previously seen only in mild cases.</li>
  <li>Since April, 61 human cases of bird flu were reported in the US, all mild until now.</li>
  <li>The H5N1 virus has significant historical associations with severe illness and high mortality rates in other countries.</li>
  <li>No person-to-person transmission of H5N1 has been detected, and the public health risk remains low.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“While an investigation into the source of this infection in Louisiana is ongoing, it is believed that the patient that was reported by Louisiana had exposure to sick or dead birds on their property.” – Demetre Daskalakis, CDC</blockquote>
<p>Although this case raises concerns, the CDC reassures that the immediate risk to public health is still regarded as low, urging caution for individuals in contact with infected animals.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A healthy diet is key to cognitive health.</figcaption>
<p>Recent research from the University of Kentucky reveals that an antioxidant-rich diet may help lower iron buildup in the brain, thereby reducing the risk of cognitive issues and promoting brain health.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A diet high in antioxidants can reduce the risk of numerous diseases.</li>
  <li>Antioxidants help to scavenge free radicals from body cells.</li>
  <li>The study involved 72 older adults and measured brain iron levels using advanced MRI techniques.</li>
  <li>Increased brain iron levels were linked to cognitive decline in specific memory and executive function tasks.</li>
  <li>Foods high in antioxidants include various fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Iron is a vital element for brain health, playing a key role in essential cellular functions.” – Valentinos Zachariou, PhD</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, adopting an antioxidant-rich diet not only promotes physical health but may also lead to improved cognitive functionality and healthier aging.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Kerala Faces Major Mumps Outbreak with Over 70,000 Cases Reported</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Local Health Department Reports</p>
<p>The state of Kerala is experiencing a significant surge in mumps cases, with over 70,000 reported this year, a dramatic increase from 2,324 cases in 2023. Health officials are concerned about the rising numbers as many individuals seek alternative medical treatments instead of conventional methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Malappuram and Kannur are severely affected, with 13,643 and 12,800 reported cases, respectively.</li>
<li>Schools have closed and mask mandates are in effect to curb the spread.</li>
<li>Mumps is a viral illness leading to swollen salivary glands and is highly contagious.</li>
<li>Complications of mumps can be severe, especially in unvaccinated individuals.</li>
<li>Health officials attribute the outbreak to a lack of vaccinations among children.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The only way to stop the rise of mumps is to either bring back the MMR vaccine or properly inform people that it is accessible in private hospitals.” - Dr. Aneseya P. Varghese</blockquote>
<p>Despite no reported deaths, health authorities are urging for immediate action to address this urgent public health issue.</p>]]></description>

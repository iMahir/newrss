            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fibre May Protect Gut Health Against Harmful Bacteria: New Study</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> (Date not provided), <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/fibre-2.jpg" alt="Future research will integrate additional tools, such as metabolomics (studying chemicals microbes produce) and transcriptomics (studying how genes are activated), to create a clearer picture of how the gut ecosystem works for our health benefit." />
<figcaption>Image Credit: Freepik</figcaption>
<p>This new study reveals how a healthy gut environment, influenced by diet, can inhibit harmful bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, offering insights into gut health management.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study analyzed over 12,000 stool samples globally, indicating a strong link between gut microbiome composition and the presence of harmful bacteria.</li>
<li>Fatty acids produced by bacteria like Faecalibacterium are crucial in preventing the overgrowth of harmful microbes.</li>
<li>Co-colonisers of harmful bacteria demonstrate adaptability, suggesting that gut conditions play a significant role in bacterial survival.</li>
<li>Findings may lead to alternative methods for preventing infections without antibiotics by promoting beneficial bacteria instead.</li>
<li>The research highlights the need for further studies on global microbiome diversity and its implications for health.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Instead of killing harmful bacteria directly, we could boost the co-excluders or create diets that support their growth.”</blockquote>
<p>This research underscores the importance of dietary fibres in maintaining gut health and could pave the way for new treatments targeting harmful bacteria.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Diet changes linked to gut microbiome can reduce risk of life-threatening infections.(Unsplash)</figcaption>
<p>A new study highlights how the composition of the gut microbiome can predict susceptibility to infections like Klebsiella pneumoniae and E.coli, suggesting that increasing fiber intake can enhance protection against these harmful bacteria.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gut microbiome may influence the risk of potentially life-threatening infections.</li>
  <li>Research analyzed stool samples from over 12,000 people worldwide to study gut microbiome signatures.</li>
  <li>Fibers in diet promote beneficial gut bacteria that can fend off harmful bacteria.</li>
  <li>Probiotics are less effective than dietary changes in altering gut health.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our results suggest that what we eat is potentially very important in controlling the likelihood of infection with a range of bacteria, including E.coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae because this changes our gut environment to make it more hostile to invaders.” - Dr Alexandre Almeida</blockquote>
<p>The findings point to the significance of dietary choices in promoting gut health and reducing the risk of serious infections.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Morning coffee consumption is linked to reduced mortality and cardiovascular risks, challenging the all-day coffee-drinking habit. The study from Tulane University emphasizes the importance of when we drink coffee, not just how much. Credit: SciTechDaily.com</figcaption>
<p>Drinking coffee in the morning is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality compared to drinking coffee all day, according to a comprehensive study published in the <em>European Heart Journal</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study tracked the coffee consumption habits of over 40,000 adults.</li>
  <li>Morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease compared to non-coffee drinkers.</li>
  <li>Those who drank coffee throughout the day did not show reduced risks.</li>
  <li>A possible explanation may relate to circadian rhythms disrupted by afternoon or evening coffee.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first study testing coffee drinking timing patterns and health outcomes. Our findings indicate that it’s not just whether you drink coffee or how much you drink, but the time of day when you drink coffee that’s important.” - Dr. Lu Qi</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the timing of coffee consumption may be as important as the amount consumed, suggesting a possible avenue for improving heart health.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
    <li>HMPV cases reported in China sparked widespread panic, especially in Asia.</li>
    <li>India has confirmed 13 cases, including a recent case in a 9-month-old child from Gujarat.</li>

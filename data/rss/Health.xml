<p>The risk of dying from alcohol-related causes begins even with low levels of alcohol consumption, and this risk increases with higher intake levels, according to a new US federal report.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than seven drinks per week.</li>
  <li>The risk increases to 1 in 100 if consumption exceeds nine drinks per week.</li>
  <li>Men and women have a similar level of risk for alcohol-related health harms, irrespective of gender.</li>
  <li>Alcohol use is linked to increased mortality for several types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, and liver cancer.</li>
  <li>Women face a much greater risk of alcohol-attributable cancer per drink consumed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Combined with the Surgeon General’s recent advisory on alcohol and cancer risk, the evidence is clear and indisputable. The fact that any amount of alcohol is harmful to your health can no longer be ignored.” - Tiffany Hall, USAPA Board Chair</blockquote>
<p>The findings sparked backlash from the drinks industry, which criticized the methodology and biases of the study.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Cholera Outbreak Update in South Sudan</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 17 Jan 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> ECHO Daily Flash</p>
<ul>
  <li>As of January 17, cholera cases in South Sudan have reached 21,389 with 390 fatalities.</li>
  <li>52% of patients are aged between zero to 14 years, the majority of deaths occurring in those aged 60+ (19%) and those between zero to 4 years (18%).</li>
  <li>Cholera is present in 7 out of 10 states; Rubkona alone accounts for 47% of cases.</li>
  <li>The overall case fatality rate stands at 1.8%, with some counties reporting troubling statistics.</li>
  <li>A vaccination campaign has been completed in Renk and is ongoing in three other states.</li>
  <li>Since early December 2024, over 120,000 people have crossed into South Sudan from Sudan, heightening the risk of cholera spread.</li>
  <li>The European Humanitarian Response Capacity delivered 4,290 boxes of PUR tablets for water disinfection to aid the cholera response.</li>
</ul>
<p>The situation remains critical due to both the rapid spread of cholera and the influx of refugees from neighboring Sudan.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Generation of humanized mutant MAPT KI mice with BEs. Credit: Watamura et al., <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>, 2024.</figcaption>
<p>The recent study introduces genetically modified mice that express human versions of the MAPT gene, suggesting tau hyperphosphorylation plays a crucial role in the early development of tauopathies like Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tau hyperphosphorylation was identified as a potential early factor in tauopathy development.</li>
<li>New animal models were developed to better understand the mechanisms of tau-related neurodegeneration.</li>
<li>The study highlights that synapse loss occurred without higher-order tau structures, indicating a novel pathway of tau toxicity.</li>
<li>Findings could lead to new therapeutic strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance,” the researchers stated.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, this research provides valuable insights that may enhance our understanding of tauopathies and help in developing future treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Image showing signs and symptoms of GERD</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses the challenges of managing gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) at night and its impact on sleep quality. It provides insights into symptoms, causes, and management strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li>GERD symptoms include heartburn, chest pain, difficulty swallowing, and cough.</li>
<li>It occurs when stomach acid leaks into the esophagus due to weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter.</li>
<li>Factors such as stress, obesity, and food choices can aggravate GERD.</li>
<li>Symptoms tend to worsen at night and can disrupt sleep cycles.</li>
<li>Recommendations include sleeping on the left side, avoiding meals close to bedtime, and raising the head during sleep.</li>
<li>Over-the-counter medications can ease moderate symptoms, but persistent cases require professional treatment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“GERD-related sleep deprivation causes exhaustion and hinders the following day's general mental and physical recuperation.”</blockquote>
<p>The article emphasizes the importance of proper management of GERD to improve overall sleep health.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Fibre in diet may boost the body against infections.</figcaption>
<p>A new study indicates that a person's gut microbiome composition plays a crucial role in predicting susceptibility to life-threatening infections, particularly from bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and E.coli. The study highlights the potential of dietary fiber in enhancing gut health and infection resistance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gut microbiome can predict infections with Enterobacteriaceae, which includes harmful bacteria.</li>
  <li>Researchers analyzed gut samples from over 12,000 individuals across 45 countries.</li>
  <li>A protective microbe group, Faecalibacterium, was identified as beneficial in breaking down fiber.</li>
  <li>Increasing dietary fiber is suggested to enhance good bacteria growth in the gut.</li>
  <li>Probiotics may have a lesser impact on preventing Enterobacteriaceae infections.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Eating more fibre in our diet will support the growth of good bacteria — and crowd out the bad ones to significantly reduce the risk of illness."</blockquote>
<p>This study underscores the significant health benefits of dietary fiber in promoting a healthier gut microbiome and reducing infection risk.</p>]]></description>

<p>A recent study has found a significant rise in chronic fatigue syndrome cases among individuals recovering from Covid-19.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study, funded by the US government, links long Covid to increased cases of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).</li>
  <li>4.5% of Covid-19 survivors met the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, compared to 0.6% of those uninfected.</li>
  <li>The NIH conducted the study as part of its RECOVER initiative, analyzing data from 13,224 participants.</li>
  <li>New ME/CFS cases post-Covid were found to be 15 times higher than pre-pandemic levels.</li>
  <li>The identified symptoms included post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, and cognitive impairment.</li>
  <li>The findings underline the necessity to understand Covid-19's role in triggering chronic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These findings add to the growing evidence that infections like Covid-19 can lead to chronic fatigue syndrome.” - Dr. Suzanne D. Vernon</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the triggers of ME/CFS may pave the way for improved treatments for chronic conditions associated with infections.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Can a cup of coffee in morning boost your heart health?</figcaption>
<p>A recent study in the European Heart Journal suggests that drinking coffee in the morning may have significant health benefits, particularly in reducing the risks of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study indicates that morning coffee consumption is associated with 16% lower death rates and 31% lower cardiovascular disease deaths compared to non-coffee drinkers.</li>
  <li>Moderate coffee drinkers (2-3 cups) and heavy drinkers (more than 3 cups) benefit similarly from health effects.</li>
  <li>However, excessive consumption can lead to adverse effects, including increased risks of high blood pressure and sleep issues.</li>
  <li>Dr. Lu Qi, the study's lead researcher, emphasizes the importance of the timing of coffee consumption.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This study doesn’t tell us why drinking coffee in the morning reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.” - Dr. Lu Qi</blockquote>
<p>The researchers call for a re-evaluation of dietary guidelines regarding coffee timing, highlighting notable health advantages linked to morning coffee consumption.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption> Here's what you need to know about H5N1 virus </figcaption>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that a person has died of H5N1 bird flu in the United States, marking the first such death in the country due to this infection, which is primarily caused by animal-to-human exposure.</p>
<ul>
<li>H5N1 does not spread from person to person.</li>
<li>First identified in Southern China in 1996, it has caused sporadic outbreaks in birds worldwide.</li>
<li>Symptoms include pink eye, fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties.</li>
<li>Severe cases can lead to complications like pneumonia and respiratory failure.</li>
<li>Preventative measures include wearing protective clothing and frequent handwashing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Scientists said that the virus would need to evolve or retain key changes in its genetic sequence to start a pandemic.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while H5N1 bird flu poses a significant risk to birds and occasionally humans, it does not spread between human beings, making widespread outbreaks less likely under current conditions.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Jan 10, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> India Today</p>
<img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/mpox-313718686-16x9.jpeg?VersionId=RxkXn6dS9zSt4YqUGuBDkCF7Yg08CY_D&amp;size=690:388" alt="Mpox is a viral disease similar to smallpox, causing fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, and a blistering rash." />
<figcaption>Mpox is a viral disease similar to smallpox, causing fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a blistering rash. (Photo: Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>Chinese health officials have identified a new mutated strain of mpox, known as clade Ib, in a foreigner who had traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This finding comes as mpox continues to spread globally, prompting concern from health authorities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A cluster of cases was linked to an individual from the DRC, with four additional cases reported among close contacts.</li>
  <li>Symptoms among infected individuals are reported to be mild, including skin rashes and blisters.</li>
  <li>Mpox transmits through close contact and can lead to serious health issues in vulnerable populations.</li>
  <li>Infection rates and deaths in the DRC raise alarms, particularly concerning individuals with underlying health conditions.</li>
  <li>WHO's designation of mpox as a global public health emergency highlights the need for monitoring and containment measures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Clade Ib seems to be different, and is spreading largely through contact between humans, including through sex. Around 18,000 suspected cases of mpox, many of them among children, and at least 600 deaths potentially attributable to the disease have been reported this year (2024) in the DRC alone."</blockquote>
<p>The mpox situation underscores the importance of public awareness and health measures to control the spread of this viral disease.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong> October 2023 <strong>Source: </strong> Time of India</p>
<p>An innovative approach to combat dengue and malaria is making waves as researchers discover that 'toxic' semen from male mosquitoes could effectively kill female mosquitoes, potentially controlling the spread of these diseases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The research highlights the use of male mosquitoes in disease control strategies.</li>
  <li>Female mosquitoes, which are responsible for biting and spreading disease, are targeted.</li>
  <li>This method offers a novel biological solution to a long-standing public health issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This breakthrough could revolutionize our approach to combating mosquito-borne diseases," says lead researcher.</blockquote>
<p>This innovative strategy could provide a sustainable and effective method for reducing the populations of disease-carrying mosquitoes, ultimately aiming for better health outcomes in affected regions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Can Ozempic damage your optic nerve? Here’s what doctors say about a new study</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 9, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/vision-loss.jpg?w=640" alt="ozempic, vision loss" width="640" height="360">
<figcaption>Doctors in India say the data is still insufficient to prove that the drug will almost always trigger this condition, called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).</figcaption>
<p>A recent Danish study indicates that semaglutide, a medication used for controlling blood glucose and aiding in weight loss, may be linked to an increased risk of vision loss related to damage of the optic nerve. However, Indian doctors emphasize that evidence is not yet conclusive regarding this risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Danish study shows that semaglutide usage may lead to higher risks for non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).</li>
  <li>The study observed 67 cases of NAION in individuals exposed to semaglutide over a period of up to 23 months.</li>
  <li>The incidence of NAION was noted to be 0.228 per 1000 person-years among diabetics using semaglutide.</li>
  <li>Benefits of semaglutide include effective blood glucose control, weight loss, and heart health improvements.</li>
  <li>Doctors in India are cautious, discussing the potential indirect impacts on the nervous system, yet assert that no direct evidence of optic nerve damage exists locally.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Any study must be weighed against the absolute benefits of GLP-1 molecules, which outweigh the risks, at least in this case.” - Dr. VN Shah</blockquote>
<p>In summary, while there are concerns about potential vision loss associated with semaglutide, medical professionals stress the importance of considering its overall benefits.</p>]]></description>

<p>Researchers from the University of Lubeck in Germany have demonstrated a significant improvement in cancer detection rates using AI, with over 17% increase in accuracy observed in a recent study involving extensive screenings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study included 119 radiologists and 460,000 women screened between 2021 and 2023.</li>
  <li>AI-assisted radiologists achieved a detection rate of 6.7 per 1,000 screenings, marking a 17.6% improvement over traditional readings.</li>
  <li>65% of biopsies ordered from AI-assisted readings confirmed cancer, compared to 59% without AI.</li>
  <li>AI reduced reading times by 43% while maintaining accuracy, assisting radiologists in identifying suspicious cases efficiently.</li>
  <li>The research focused on participants aged 50-69 to evaluate the effectiveness of AI in reducing missed detections.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The study shows that AI can make breast cancer screening faster, more accurate, and less stressful for patients." - Researchers</blockquote>
<p>This breakthrough highlights AI's role as a complementary tool in radiology aimed at enhancing early detection of breast cancer, potentially addressing challenges in healthcare efficiency and radiologist shortages.</p>]]></description>

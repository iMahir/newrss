<figcaption>Cardiovascular diseases are on the rise due to air pollution.</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses the serious impact of air pollution on cardiovascular health, detailing how long-term exposure leads to increased risks of heart disease, inflammation, and morbidity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air pollution is responsible for one in eight deaths globally, with 8.1 million deaths recorded in 2021.</li>
<li>It currently shortens the average life span by one year and eight months.</li>
<li>The pollutants can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the circulatory system, raising the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
<li>Poor air quality introduces contaminants into the bloodstream, leading to increased blood pressure and heart issues.</li>
<li>Mitigation strategies include monitoring air quality, reducing outdoor activities during high pollution days, and supporting anti-pollution policies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The interactions between air pollution and health outcomes are diverse and complex... ranking second after high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking.” – Dr. Naresh Kumar Goyal</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, addressing air pollution is crucial for improving public health and reducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Chameleon-like Immune Cells May Worsen Asthma</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 15, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Medical Xpress</p>
<img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2022/asthma-1.jpg" alt="asthma" title="Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain" width="800" height="530">
<figcaption>Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain</figcaption>
<p>Researchers at McMaster University have identified a new population of immune cells that may significantly contribute to asthma severity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study, published in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>, explores the complex mechanisms of severe asthma.</li>
<li>Asthma affects up to 10% of the general asthma population and is challenging to treat.</li>
<li>Chameleon-like immune cells (c-kit+IL-17A+ ILC2s) linked to eosinophils and neutrophils might worsen asthma symptoms.</li>
<li>Understanding these cells could lead to new treatments for patients unresponsive to current therapies.</li>
<li>The research involved collaboration between multiple laboratories and is based on over a decade of research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“When you can't breathe, nothing else matters.” - Roma Sehmi</blockquote>
<p>The discovery of these immune cells reshapes our understanding of severe asthma, potentially paving the way for innovative treatment strategies.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Does obesity affect children’s likelihood of survival after being diagnosed with cancer?</h1>
<p><strong>Date Published:</strong> Wednesday, January 15, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> WEBWIRE</p>
<img src="https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/332600/332600-1.png" alt="Press Release Image" />
<figcaption>Image related to the study on obesity and childhood cancer.</figcaption>
<p>A recent study reveals that obesity at diagnosis significantly decreases survival rates among children diagnosed with cancer, suggesting a need for strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>10.5% of children with cancer were obese at the time of diagnosis.</li>
  <li>Lower 5-year event-free survival rates were observed in obese children (77.5%) compared to non-obese children (79.6%).</li>
  <li>Obesity was linked to a 16% increase in relapse risk and a 29% increase in risk of death.</li>
  <li>The impact is particularly significant for those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our study highlights the negative impact of obesity among all types of childhood cancers. It provides the rationale to evaluate different strategies to mitigate the adverse risk of obesity on cancer outcomes in future trials,” said co–senior author Thai Hoa Tran, MD.</blockquote>
<p>This research underscores the urgent need to address childhood obesity due to its serious implications on health and survival outcomes in pediatric cancer patients.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>"Long-term exposure to environmental toxins can weaken the immune system and cause DNA mutations, which can lead to cancerous changes in blood cells," said Dr Shivali Ahlawat.(Pexels)</figcaption>
<p>This article explores how environmental toxins contribute to blood cancers such as Leukaemia, Lymphoma, and Myeloma, highlighting important insights from an oncologist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental toxins like benzene, pesticides, and heavy metals can lead to blood cancer.</li>
<li>Long-term exposure to benzene is linked to an increased risk of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML).</li>
<li>Some pesticides are associated with a higher risk of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and other blood cancers.</li>
<li>Heavy metals such as arsenic and ionizing radiation contribute to the development of blood cancers.</li>
<li>Preventative measures include using protective gear in high-risk jobs and regular screenings for blood abnormalities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Environmental toxins are contributors to inciting mutations and disturbance in the hematopoietic system of the body.” - Dr. Shivali Ahlawat</blockquote>
<p>This discussion underscores the importance of addressing environmental toxins as critical factors in blood cancer development and emphasizes the need for preventative strategies.</p>]]></description>

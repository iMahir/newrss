<p>Aimed at facilitating advanced research on diabetes, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in collaboration with the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) has set up the country’s first diabetes biobank in Chennai.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The biobank will gather, process, store, and distribute biospecimens for scientific studies.</li>
  <li>A variety of blood samples from different types of diabetes have been stored for future studies.</li>
  <li>The initiative aims to identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and develop personalized treatment strategies.</li>
  <li>A government study indicated a rising prevalence of diabetes among the general population in India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The biobank could help in the identification of novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and the development of personalised treatment strategies.” - Dr. V. Mohan</blockquote>
<p>The establishment of this biobank represents a significant step in addressing the diabetes epidemic in India, promising better management and prevention strategies for the condition.</p>]]></description>

<p>Loneliness is an emotional void caused by a lack of companionship, significantly affecting physical and mental health, particularly brain health. A new study has revealed a strong link between loneliness and a higher risk of developing dementia.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study published in <em>Nature Mental Health</em> indicates loneliness is associated with a 31% increased risk of dementia.</li>
<li>Over 608,561 individuals were analyzed, making it the largest meta-analysis on loneliness and dementia.</li>
<li>Loneliness is identified as an independent predictor of dementia, often leading to Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia.</li>
<li>Additionally, loneliness correlates with a 15% increased risk of milder cognitive issues that may precede dementia.</li>
<li>Factors such as reduced mental stimulation, chronic stress, heart health issues, and unhealthy lifestyle habits contribute to the impact of loneliness on brain health.</li>
<li>Effective measures to combat loneliness include encouraging social connections, promoting physical activity, regular check-ins, leveraging technology, supporting therapy, and adopting healthy habits.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Loneliness alone remains an independent and strong predictor of dementia.”</blockquote>
<p>This study underscores the critical need to address loneliness not just for emotional well-being but also for safeguarding cognitive health.</p>]]></description>

<p>Constipation is a common gastrointestinal issue that often worsens in winter. Experts suggest hydration, exercise, and a high-fiber diet to manage and prevent this condition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink over two litres of fluids daily to aid digestion and maintain bowel movement.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Engage in physical activity to promote bowel movements.</li>
<li><strong>Fibre Intake:</strong> Consume at least 30 grams of dietary fibre daily from natural food sources like fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Prebiotics and Probiotics:</strong> Foods like oats, bananas, and fermented items boost gut health.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Attention:</strong> Seek help if constipation is accompanied by severe symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Consume at least 30 grams of dietary fibre daily (e.g., one avocado and one pear cover 50 percent of this requirement).” - Dr. Arvind Sahni</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, maintaining gut health during winter requires a proactive approach with hydration, dietary choices, and regular exercise.</p>]]></description>

<h1>Title: Cancer vaccines are showing promise at last</h1>
<p><strong>Date: Not specified, Source: Mint</strong></p>
<img src="" alt="Cancer vaccine" width="300">
<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, William Coley, a surgeon in New York, observed that a patient with a neck tumour recovered after contracting a bacterial skin infection. This discovery led to the concept of cancer vaccines, which aim to train the immune system to recognize and fight tumours. After decades of trial and error, promising results are now emerging from various clinical trials.</p>
<ol>
<li>Coley's observation and initial experiments</li>
<li>Widespread acceptance of Coley's idea in the 1950s</li>
<li>Current cancer vaccine trials against various types of cancer</li>
<li>Emerging promising results from these trials</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>After half a century of disappointing dead ends, promising results are starting to emerge.</blockquote>
<p>The article highlights the potential of cancer vaccines and how they could revolutionize cancer treatment.</p>

(Source: Freepik)</figcaption><p>A recent study published in <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> reveals that older adults in South Asia continue to be highly vulnerable to diarrhoeal diseases despite a global decrease in mortality. This demographic faces the highest mortality rates along with children under five.</p><ul><li><strong>Elderly Vulnerability:</strong> Those aged 70 years and older in South Asia had the highest mortality rate globally, with 476 deaths per 100,000 population.</li><li><strong>Regional Disparities:</strong> High-income countries reported fewer than one death per 100,000 children under five, while sub-Saharan Africa has over 150 deaths in the same age group.</li><li><strong>Declining DALYs:</strong> The burden of diarrhoeal diseases decreased from 186 million in 1990 to 59 million in 2021.</li></ul><h2>Why older adults are at higher risk in South Asia</h2><p>Dr. Manisha Arora explains that older adults are susceptible due to a decline in immune function and pre-existing health conditions that complicate hydration during diarrhoeal episodes. “Older adults often face a dilemma during diarrhoea,” she notes, highlighting the challenges of hydration management.</p><h2>Tackling the crisis</h2><p>Dr. Arora emphasizes a multifaceted approach to reduce mortality rates among the elderly in South Asia:</p><ol><li><strong>Improve Access to Clean Water and Sanitation:</strong> Essential for preventing diarrhoeal diseases.</li><li><strong>Strengthen Healthcare Infrastructure:</strong> Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical.</li><li><strong>Promote Vaccinations:</strong> Vaccines can significantly help in reducing disease incidence.</li><li><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> Importance of hydration and early treatment should be communicated.</li><li><strong>Focus on Elderly Care:</strong> Interventions for fluid replacement and management of comorbidities are crucial.</li></ol><p>While global mortality rates from diarrhoeal diseases have declined, the situation for older adults in South Asia demands urgent attention. As Dr. Arora points out, “Addressing dehydration, improving healthcare access, and promoting preventive measures are key.”</p>]]></description>

With improved understanding of women's experiences and the challenges of a distracted world, more people are seeking and benefiting from diagnoses and medication. However, some experts argue that ADHD may not be a disorder but rather a part of neurodiversity.</p><ol><li>ADHD diagnosis is evolving, with better recognition of symptoms in women and girls.</li><li>Medication can be life-changing for those with severe symptoms but has risks and may not be a long-term solution.</li><li>Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as supportive environments and cognitive tools, can help manage ADHD symptoms.</li><li>ADHD diagnosis is subjective and relies on self-reported symptoms, leading to varied estimates of prevalence.</li><li>Scientists are exploring a 'transdiagnostic' approach to help individuals with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional difficulties without relying on diagnostic labels.</li></ol><blockquote>"It has become more accepted in the past ten years that it is not a single biological entity." - Edmund Sonuga-Barke, neuroscientist at King’s College London</blockquote><p>In conclusion, while ADHD diagnoses are rising and medication can be beneficial, the understanding of ADHD as a disorder is evolving, with some experts advocating for a shift towards considering it a part of neurodiversity.</p>]]></description>

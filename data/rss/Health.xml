            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Are Plant-Based Milks Truly Healthy or Overhyped?</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<figure><img src="/image/contentid/policy:1.10167214:1734277482/plant-based-milk.jpg?$p=35e33af&amp;q=0.8" alt="plant milk"><figcaption>Representational image | photo:Canva</figcaption></figure>
<p>New research suggests that popular plant-based milk alternatives such as oat, almond, and soy milk may lack essential nutritional components compared to cow’s milk. The University of Copenhagen study indicates that processing methods can compromise protein quality and create potentially harmful compounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The popularity of plant-based milks has increased, but they may be nutritionally inadequate compared to cow's milk.</li>
<li>Extensive processing, including ultra-high temperature treatments, diminishes protein quality and reduces essential amino acids.</li>
<li>Researchers found harmful compounds like acrylamide in certain plant-based beverages, raising potential health risks over time.</li>
<li>Despite being eco-friendly options, these drinks may not offer the same benefits as cow's milk.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Plant-based drinks cannot replace cow’s milk in terms of proper nutrition,” said Professor Marianne Nissen Lund.</blockquote>
<p>The findings highlight a need for consumers to be cautious about the nutritional value of plant-based milks and seek alternatives that can meet dietary needs.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Loneliness deteriorates brain health.(Shutterstock)</figcaption>
<p>A groundbreaking study published in Nature Mental Health finds that loneliness increases the risk of developing dementia by 31%. It emphasizes the severe impact of loneliness on brain health.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study analyzed data from 608,561 individuals worldwide.</li>
  <li>Loneliness was shown to be a crucial risk factor for dementia, comparable to smoking and lack of exercise.</li>
  <li>Researchers noted loneliness leads to cognitive decline and is linked to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.</li>
  <li>Lack of mental stimulation and chronic stress due to loneliness contribute to the risk of dementia.</li>
  <li>Loneliness can also lead to mild cognitive problems, indicating early effects before dementia onset.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is groundbreaking, as the risk factor of loneliness is similar to other commonly known risk factors for dementia.”</blockquote>
<p>This study highlights the urgent need for addressing loneliness as a public health issue, especially in light of its long-term implications for cognitive health.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Paracetamol poses gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks for seniors: Study</figcaption>
<p>Paracetamol, a common over-the-counter medication, poses significant risks to seniors, as revealed by a new study from the University of Nottingham.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study found increased risks of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications in people aged 65 and over using paracetamol.</li>
  <li>Data from 180,483 participants were analyzed, focusing on individuals aged 65 and older who had been prescribed paracetamol repeatedly.</li>
  <li>Findings indicated associations between paracetamol use and peptic ulcers, heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.</li>
  <li>Prolonged use of paracetamol can lead to liver toxicity, particularly in seniors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Due to its perceived safety, paracetamol has long been recommended as the first line drug treatment for osteoarthritis by many treatment guidelines..." - Professor Weiya Zhang</blockquote>
<p>The study calls for caution regarding the use of paracetamol among elderly patients, highlighting the need for alternative pain management strategies.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Study reveals raw milk may harbor infectious flu virus(Pixabay)</figcaption>
<p>The study from Stanford University indicates that the H1N1 flu virus can survive in refrigerated raw milk for up to five days, potentially endangering public health.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The flu virus can remain infectious in refrigerated raw milk for five days.</li>
  <li>Over 14 million Americans consume raw milk annually, which is not pasteurized to kill harmful pathogens.</li>
  <li>The FDA has linked raw milk to over 200 outbreaks of illness.</li>
  <li>Flu virus RNA was detectable in raw milk for at least 57 days.</li>
  <li>Pasteurization effectively kills the infectious virus and reduces viral RNA levels significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This work highlights the potential risk of avian influenza transmission through consumption of raw milk and the importance of milk pasteurization.</blockquote>
<p>The study stresses the need for improved monitoring systems as bird flu continues to spread among livestock, raising concerns about human health risks.</p>]]></description>

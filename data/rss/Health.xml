            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Heart Muscle Can Regenerate After Failure in Some Patients with Artificial Hearts: Study</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> IANS</p>
<img src="/image/contentid/policy:1.9624005:1717936839/Untitled%20design.jpg?$p=1a4beb7&amp;q=0.8" alt="heart">
<figcaption>Representational image | photo: Canva</figcaption>
<p>A groundbreaking study has revealed that heart muscle can regenerate in certain patients with artificial hearts, offering new hope for treating and potentially curing heart failure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A subset of patients with artificial hearts demonstrated significant heart muscle regeneration.</li>
  <li>Heart failure traditionally has no cure, with limited treatment options available.</li>
  <li>Patients with artificial hearts regenerated heart muscle cells at a rate more than six times higher than healthy individuals.</li>
  <li>Research emphasizes the need for heart muscle to rest to enhance regenerative capacity.</li>
  <li>Collaboration between the University of Arizona and the University of Utah was critical to the study.</li>
  <li>The findings were published in the journal <em>Circulation</em>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the strongest evidence we have so far that human heart muscle cells can actually regenerate,” said Dr. Sadek.</blockquote>
<p>This discovery could lead to innovative therapies aimed at repairing damaged heart tissue and potentially curing heart failure.</p>

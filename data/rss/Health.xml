            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hospital admission after taking hallucinogens triples risk of schizophrenia: study</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> December 31, 2024 04:55 pm IST</p>

<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sci-tech/science/n8b431/article69046225.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/file-20241201-15-s7v98j.jpg" alt="Given the&nbsp;recent increase&nbsp;in people taking these drugs, a&nbsp;research group in Canada&nbsp;wanted to know if there was an association between people going to hospital because of problems related to these drugs and subsequent mental ill health – specifically, schizophrenia spectrum disorder." />
<figcaption>Photo Credit: Stock Photo</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses a Canadian study that reveals a significant link between hospital admissions due to hallucinogen use and the subsequent development of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD).</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study was retrospective, examining hospital records in Ontario from 2008 to 2021.</li>
  <li>Over 5,000 individuals visited the emergency department for hallucinogen-related issues; 208 developed SSD.</li>
  <li>The risk of developing SSD was initially a 21-fold increase, then adjusted to a 3.5-fold increase after considering other factors.</li>
  <li>Alcohol was found to pose a greater risk, with a 4.7-fold increase for alcohol-related visits.</li>
  <li>The article contrasts the findings with historical data on cannabis and hallucinogen use and risk of SSD.</li>
  <li>Despite potential risks, hallucinogens are being studied for their therapeutic applications.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This study does pose important questions about the use of hallucinogens in the clinic and provides further evidence of the dangers of alcohol abuse.”</blockquote>
<p>This study underscores the importance of understanding the mental health risks associated with hallucinogen use while also highlighting the therapeutic potential of these substances.</p>]]></description>

<p>The US is experiencing a notable increase in norovirus cases, as reported by the CDC. Recent figures show a significant spike in outbreaks, particularly this winter.</p>
<ul>
    <li>There have been 91 reported outbreaks of norovirus, an increase from 69 in late November.</li>
    <li>Norovirus is the leading cause of diarrhea and vomiting in the US, impacting all age groups.</li>
    <li>Common symptoms of norovirus include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain, typically seen within 12 to 48 hours post-exposure.</li>
    <li>Proper hygiene and handwashing are essential in preventing the spread of norovirus.</li>
    <li>Annual outbreaks average around 2,500 cases, predominantly occurring in colder months (November to April).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Most people with norovirus recover within 1 to 3 days, and there is no specific medicine for it. Consult with your healthcare provider if you notice symptoms."</blockquote>
<p>This surge in norovirus infections underscores the importance of public awareness and hygiene to combat the spread of this highly contagious virus.</p>]]></description>

<p>A young man from Sydney, Jay Shew, shares his experiences leading to a late-stage diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. His story serves as a crucial reminder for others to recognize and act upon health warning signs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jay was diagnosed with stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 21.</li>
  <li>He initially dismissed symptoms like high calcium levels and significant weight loss.</li>
  <li>Family and friends noticed changes in his appearance before he did.</li>
  <li>He later experienced severe back pain, night sweats, and tireless fatigue.</li>
  <li>Jay underwent a blood test that led to further investigations, revealing his diagnosis.</li>
  <li>He is now in recovery and actively sharing his story to inform others about cancer symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I’m glad I’m better now and at the moment, I'm just trying my best to maintain good health and of course convince other people to get themselves checked up before it’s too late,”</blockquote>
<p>Jay aims to raise awareness about the importance of early detection in cancer treatment.</p>]]></description>

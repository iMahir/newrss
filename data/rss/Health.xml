<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has assessed the global public health risk from the H5N1 bird flu virus as currently low, despite a recent increase in human cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>76 human infections reported in 2024, mainly among US farm workers.</li>
  <li>Risk remains low due to no sustained human-to-human transmission.</li>
  <li>Warnings about the virus's potential for rapid adaptation.</li>
  <li>Concerns for occupationally exposed groups in contact with infected animals.</li>
  <li>Significant economic and ecological concerns due to the virus's impact on poultry and wildlife.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The potential for rapid adaptation emphasizes the ongoing risk to occupationally exposed groups.”</blockquote>
<p>Continued vigilance and international collaboration are essential to manage the risks associated with the H5N1 bird flu virus.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Most humans are thought to have been exposed to cytomegalovirus (HCMV), one of the nine viruses known to cause herpes (Source: Freepik)</figcaption>
<p>A recent study reveals that a virus causing gut infections may play a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers suggest existing antiviral drugs could be repurposed to treat or prevent this form of the disease.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The herpes-causing virus can remain active in the gut and travel to the brain through the vagus nerve.</li>
  <li>Once in the brain, the virus alters the immune response, contributing to Alzheimer’s disease pathology.</li>
  <li>Research indicates that this virus subtype may affect 25-45% of Alzheimer’s patients.</li>
  <li>Antibodies specific to the virus were found in the spinal fluid of Alzheimer’s patients.</li>
  <li>The presence of the herpes virus has been linked to the activation of specific immune cells involved in Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We think we’ve identified a biologically unique subtype of Alzheimer’s that may affect 25-45% of people with the disease,” said Ben Readhead, first author and research associate professor at Arizona State University.</blockquote>
<p>This study opens avenues for further exploration into the relationship between gut health and neurodegenerative diseases, potentially reshaping our understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathology.</p>]]></description>

Several potential factors and theories could explain this phenomenon.</p><ul><li><strong>The impact of COVID-19 on the Immune System:</strong> COVID-19 may trigger autoimmune responses, with severe infections accelerating processes that contribute to diabetes.</li><li><strong>Delayed Diagnosis Due to Pandemic Disruptions:</strong> Postponed medical visits may have delayed diagnosis, leading to more advanced cases by the time symptoms were recognized.</li><li><strong>Changes in Diet and Physical Activity:</strong> Increased sedentary behavior and poor diet during the pandemic may contribute to autoimmune conditions.</li><li><strong>Environmental and Genetic Interactions:</strong> COVID-19 could interact with genetic susceptibility, potentially acting as a new environmental trigger for Type 1 diabetes.</li><li><strong>Changes in Healthcare Access and Monitoring:</strong> Disruptions in routine pediatric care during COVID-19 may have worsened symptoms before diagnosis.</li></ul><blockquote>“Children who were unable to visit their doctors during lockdowns might not have had their diabetes diagnosed until they were seriously ill, making it harder to manage their condition early on.”</blockquote><p>This rise in Type 1 diabetes among children is a concerning trend that highlights the complications arising from the pandemic and the necessity for renewed focus on pediatric healthcare.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 21, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>

<p>The World Health Organization and the Rwandan government have declared the outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg fever in Rwanda over, following no new cases reported in recent weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The outbreak was first declared on September 27, 2024, with a total of 15 deaths and 66 cases, primarily affecting healthcare workers.</li>
<li>Marburg can be fatal in up to 88% of cases without treatment, with symptoms including fever, muscle pain, and severe bleeding.</li>
<li>Rwanda had received trial vaccines but currently lacks an authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg.</li>
<li>The outbreak is considered over after 42 days elapsed without registering new cases and all existing cases testing negative.</li>
<li>Vigilance is necessary as risks remain, particularly from bats, according to WHO and Rwandan health officials.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I thank the government of Rwanda, its leadership and Rwandans in general for the strong response to achieve this success but the battle continues,” said WHO representative Brian Chirombo.</blockquote>
<p>Although the outbreak is declared over, health officials urge continued awareness to prevent future cases.</p>]]></description>

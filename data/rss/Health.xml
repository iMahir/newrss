<figcaption>Children's go-to snacks like chips pose dental health risks. (Shutterstock)</figcaption>
<p>Children often gravitate towards ultra-processed foods like chips and ice cream, which while tasty, carry health risks. A recent study reveals that such diets may lead to deformities in jaw structure, particularly in younger children.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ultra-processed foods are high in calories, sugar, and salt.</li>
  <li>These foods require less chewing, leading to underdeveloped jaw muscles.</li>
  <li>Study shows children with high UFP diets have smaller jaw sizes.</li>
  <li>Misalignment of teeth, notably buck teeth, can result from this diet.</li>
  <li>Research indicates that solid, fibrous foods promote healthy jaw development.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Chewing solid, fibrous foods is essential for healthy jaw development. These foods help prevent malocclusion, or misalignment of teeth,” Dr. Laura Marques Martinez.</blockquote>
<p>The findings stress the importance of balanced diets for children's dental health to avoid long-term issues.</p>]]></description>

<p>A global commission has released a report calling for a comprehensive overhaul of how obesity is measured, stating that Body Mass Index (BMI) is inadequate as it does not account for body fat distribution, particularly important for Asian populations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The commission recommends using additional measures, including waist circumference, to assess obesity accurately.</li>
  <li>Two new diagnostic categories introduced: 'clinical obesity' and 'pre-clinical obesity.'</li>
  <li>There is a rising trend of obesity and metabolic issues in India, especially among children and women.</li>
  <li>The new recommendations aim to provide personalized care without stigma for individuals with obesity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By providing a medically coherent framework for disease diagnosis, the commission also aims to settle the ongoing dispute around the idea of obesity as a disease...” - Francesco Rubino, Commission chair, King’s College London</blockquote>
<p>The report emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of obesity, advocating for adequate medical responses and support for affected individuals.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Study Unravels Links Between Obesity and Cancer</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2024<br><strong>Source:</strong> Frontiers of Medicine</p>
<p>Obesity is increasingly recognized as a significant health issue linked to various cancers. This comprehensive review examines the mechanisms through which obesity increases cancer risk and discusses potential clinical implications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Key mechanisms include chronic inflammation, hormonal imbalances, and gut microbiota dysregulation.</li>
  <li>Chronic low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue is a significant characteristic of obesity influencing cancer development.</li>
  <li>Hormonal disturbances, particularly in postmenopausal women, contribute to obesity-related cancer risks.</li>
  <li>Prevention strategies emphasize weight management through diet, exercise, bariatric surgery, and pharmacotherapy.</li>
  <li>Strategies include dietary modifications and regular physical activity to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress.</li>
  <li>The review highlights the need for personalized prevention and treatment strategies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A multifaceted approach, combining lifestyle modifications with pharmacological interventions, may be most effective in reducing the incidence of obesity-related cancers.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the complex links between obesity and cancer can lead to more effective interventions for reducing the burden of obesity-related cancers.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why do false claims that vaccines cause autism refuse to die? Here are nine reasons</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> 15 January 2025, 05:31 IST</p>
<p><em>By Sven Bölte for The Conversation</em></p>
<p>The resurgence of the belief that vaccines cause autism has been fueled by public figures despite extensive evidence to the contrary. This article explores nine reasons why these misconceptions persist.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unawareness of evidence:</strong> The complexities of scientific communication leave much of the public unaware of the overwhelming data supporting vaccine safety.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges understanding the science:</strong> The nuances of science can lead to misinterpretations and expectations of clear, absolute truths.</li>
<li><strong>Public doubts about science:</strong> Past incidents and perceived contradictions in research create distrust towards scientific findings.</li>
<li><strong>Invisible success of vaccine programmes:</strong> Vaccination success has made certain diseases disappear from public consciousness, leading to the belief that vaccines are unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Vaccines cause immune reaction:</strong> Immune responses can be mistaken as negative reactions, causing doubt about their safety.</li>
<li><strong>Correlation is not causation:</strong> The coincidence of vaccine timing and initial autistic behaviors can lead to false connections.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical concerns regarding drugs in infancy:</strong> Parents may feel uneasy about vaccinating infants in the absence of an emergency.</li>
<li><strong>Actual harms from less-well established vaccines:</strong> The history of less established vaccines creates skepticism about well-regarded ones.</li>
<li><strong>Polarised debate of vaccines:</strong> Increasing polarization and stigmatization of differing views has further eroded public trust in vaccines.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The absence of these diseases generates implicit beliefs that vaccinations are unnecessary.”</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the persistence of these false claims about vaccines indicates a significant challenge in public health communication and trust.</p>]]></description>

<p>Cancer recurrence is a common concern among survivors and their loved ones, involving the return of cancer after a period of remission. While not all cancers recur, understanding contributing factors and treatment options is crucial.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cancer recurrence can occur months or years after treatment in various forms - local, regional, or distant.</li>
  <li>Some cancers, like glioblastoma and epithelial ovarian cancer, have a high recurrence rate.</li>
  <li>Signs of recurrence can include lumps, sores, weight changes, and fatigue.</li>
  <li>Precautions to minimize recurrence risk include regular medical follow-ups and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</li>
  <li>Treatment for recurrence may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy, depending on the cancer type.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Though cancer doesn’t always return, understanding the factors that contribute to recurrence and being aware of available treatment options is crucial.”</blockquote>
<p>Continued advancements in cancer therapies and proactive health management can help survivors reduce their risk and maintain fulfilling lives after treatment.</p>]]></description>

<p>Researchers at the UNC Thurston Arthritis Research Center have identified 13 genes that contribute to osteoarthritis, affecting over 32 million people in the U.S. This discovery aims to guide the development of targeted therapies to prevent disease progression.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers pinpointed 13 “high probability risk genes” for osteoarthritis.</li>
  <li>Nearly half of the risk for osteoarthritis is genetic, according to recent studies.</li>
  <li>Six of the identified genes were previously unknown.</li>
  <li>The study was backed by a $2.5 million grant from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.</li>
  <li>Drug screening studies are being conducted to find compounds that target these genes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If we can identify the causal genes, we can use that information to define new genetic targets for therapies for osteoarthritis.” - Dr. Richard F. Loeser, Jr.</blockquote>
<p>This research provides valuable insights into osteoarthritis and could lead to early intervention strategies to combat the disease effectively.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Hepatitis E vaccination is effective in an epidemic - Science Daily]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hepatitis E Vaccination is Effective in an Epidemic</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> The Lancet Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>In South Sudan, where hepatitis E outbreaks are common due to contaminated water, a recent study has shown that the two-dose regimen of the hepatitis E vaccine is effective in fighting the disease despite the challenges posed by a 3-dose standard regimen.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study involved collaboration between Médecins Sans Frontières, Johns Hopkins University, the South Sudanese Ministry of Health, WHO, and other organizations.</li>
  <li>The vaccination campaign targeted over 100,000 people in camps for internally displaced individuals.</li>
  <li>Results indicated that even after just two doses, the vaccine was effective in reducing hepatitis E cases.</li>
  <li>Approximately 50,000 deaths worldwide are attributed to hepatitis E annually, with high-risk populations including pregnant women.</li>
  <li>The WHO has confirmed the effectiveness of the vaccine and approved the creation of a global stockpile for emergencies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Our results combined with others helped lead to recent approval by WHO's International Coordinating Group of a stockpile of hepatitis E vaccines for emergencies." - Andrew Azman, Epidemiologist</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the study supports the vaccine's use in outbreak situations and showcases the importance of adapting vaccination protocols to address immediate health crises.</p>]]></description>

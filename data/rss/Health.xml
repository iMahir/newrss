<figcaption>Health tips to embrace in 2025.</figcaption>
<p>This article provides essential health, skin, and fitness tips for individuals preparing for the new year. It emphasizes the importance of balanced nutrition, hydration, skincare, and lifestyle choices.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Healthy carbohydrates should be consumed in moderation for energy and brain function.</li>
  <li>Hydration needs vary; the "eight glasses a day" rule is not one-size-fits-all.</li>
  <li>Effective skincare depends on compatibility with individual skin types rather than price.</li>
  <li>Quitting smoking is crucial for lung health and to avoid nicotine addiction.</li>
  <li>Small, balanced meals help maintain metabolism and prevent binge eating.</li>
  <li>Severe glucose spikes may indicate health issues like insulin resistance.</li>
  <li>Strength training is important for overall fitness and does not lead to bulkiness in women.</li>
  <li>Raw vegetable juices can cause health problems compared to whole, cooked vegetables.</li>
  <li>Moderation in fat intake is necessary to prevent weight gain and cardiovascular problems.</li>
  <li>Seed oils are not inherently harmful; a diverse range of fats is needed for a healthy diet.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Quitting smoking is the healthiest option because both smoking and vaping damage the lungs and lead to nicotine addiction."</blockquote>
<p>This guidance aims to enhance well-being as we approach 2025, focusing on practical and balanced approaches to health.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Wednesday, December 19, 2024 &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> Lancet Infectious Diseases</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/19/550x309/Diarrhoea-patients-at-a-civil-hospital-in-Panchkul_1734577002292.jpg" alt="Diarrhoea patients at a civil hospital in Panchkula in 2021.

<figcaption>Diarrhoea patients at a civil hospital in Panchkula in 2021. (HT File Photo)</figcaption>
<p>The study published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases indicates a nearly 60% decrease in global deaths from diarrhoeal diseases, while emphasizing that children and the elderly remain the most affected demographics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In 2021, diarrhoeal diseases led to 1.2 million deaths compared to 2.9 million in 1990.</li>
    <li>Children under five years saw a remarkable 79% decline in mortality rates.</li>
    <li>Regions with high-income countries reported less than one death per 100,000 children under five.</li>
    <li>South Asia experienced the highest mortality rates among those aged 70 and older, with 476 deaths per 100,000.</li>
    <li>Diarrhoeal mortality rates reflected overall declines across age groups globally.</li>
    <li>The researchers found that disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) shrank from 186 million in 1990 to 59 million in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"In spite of the encouraging progress made combating diarrhoeal mortality, a multipronged approach is required to simultaneously tackle live-saving solutions while also prioritising preventive interventions to alleviate burdens on health systems." - Dr. Hmwe Hmwe Kyu</blockquote>
<p>The findings underline the need for continued efforts in healthcare interventions to combat diarrheal diseases, particularly focusing on preventive measures and targeted vaccine developments.</p>]]></description>

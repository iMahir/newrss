<p>This study examines the prevalence of <i>Leishmania infantum</i> coinfection in COVID-19 patients in a site endemic to visceral leishmaniasis in Iran.</p>
<ul>
    <li>250 blood samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 231 from a control group were analyzed.</li>
    <li>18.4% of COVID-19 patients tested positive for <i>L. infantum</i>, compared to 7.8% in the control group.</li>
    <li>COVID-19 patients had a 2.66 times greater chance of having <i>L. infantum</i> infection.</li>
    <li>No significant association was found between <i>L. infantum</i> infection and various patient demographics or treatment outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The overall seroprevalence of <i>L. infantum</i> infection among patients with COVID-19 was 2.66 times greater than that in the control group."</blockquote>
<p>This study emphasizes the potential risk factor of <i>L. infantum</i> infection in COVID-19 patients, particularly in endemic areas.</p>]]></description>

<p>This groundbreaking study from KAIST reveals a new approach to cancer treatment, focusing on converting colon cancer cells into normal cells instead of destroying them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>KAIST researchers have developed technology that transforms colon cancer cells back into normal cells.</li>
  <li>This method minimizes side effects and reduces the likelihood of cancer recurrence.</li>
  <li>Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho leads the project, offering a significant shift from traditional cancer treatments.</li>
  <li>The research utilized a digital twin of the gene network to identify key molecular switches in cells.</li>
  <li>The findings could pave the way for new cancer therapies that are safer and more effective.</li>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Seasonal changes often bring fluctuating weather conditions and an increased risk of illnesses in children, which can lead to dehydration and reduced energy levels.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Dehydration and its impact on immunity:</strong> Pediatric expert Dr. NL Sridhar explains that dehydration can weaken children's immunity and leave them more vulnerable to infections.</li>
  <li><strong>How seasonal illnesses lead to dehydration:</strong> Fever, nausea, and vomiting are common in children during seasonal changes and can result in fluid, electrolyte, and energy deficits.</li>
  <li><strong>Highlighting the role of fluid, electrolyte, and energy (FEE) deficits in supporting recovery:</strong> Dr. NL Sridhar emphasizes the importance of replenishing fluids, electrolytes, and energy to counteract the effects of dehydration.</li>
  <li><strong>The Role of Electrolytes in Recovery:</strong> Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium are vital for recovery during seasonal illnesses.</li>
  <li><strong>The Importance of Timely Intervention:</strong> Early identification and management of dehydration and energy deficits can significantly improve recovery in children.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><strong>Notable Quote:</strong> "Ready-to-drink formulations with a scientifically balanced composition of electrolytes and energy are particularly beneficial as they ensure consistent quality and taste." - Dr. NL Sridhar</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Parents should remain vigilant for signs of dehydration and consult pediatricians for appropriate care, prioritizing hydration and addressing energy needs to help children navigate seasonal transitions with resilience and good health.</p>

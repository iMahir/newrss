<p>A recent study suggests that consuming tea daily can slow down biological aging. This study, published in <i>The Lancet Regional Health</i>, involved over 13,000 participants from the UK and China.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study finds that three cups of tea a day are optimal for slowing biological aging.</li>
<li>Significant differences were noted in participants who shifted from nondrinking to tea-drinking.</li>
<li>Polyphenols in tea are highlighted for their health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</li>
<li>Tea consumption may help protect against age-related diseases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Tea contains a variety of bioactive substances, especially polyphenols... which may delay the aging process,” the authors stated.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, making tea a daily habit could offer significant health benefits and potentially extend lifespan by slowing aging processes.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Scientists are investigating xenon gas as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s. Westend61/Getty Images</figcaption>
<p>Researchers are exploring xenon gas as a potential new therapy for Alzheimer's disease, finding that it can suppress neuroinflammation and reduce brain shrinkage in a mouse model, paving the way for clinical trials in humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers are actively seeking effective treatments for Alzheimer's, which is becoming increasingly common.</li>
<li>Current medications primarily address symptoms rather than the disease itself, although some newer treatments target brain lesions.</li>
<li>Xenon gas has been identified as a promising avenue for treatment.</li>
<li>In studies using mouse models, xenon inhalation exhibited neuroprotective benefits.</li>
<li>A clinical trial for human participants is set to begin soon.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The results are intriguing... it is quite expensive and there would be a challenge understanding how to deliver it to a large patient group.”</p>
<p>— Anton Porsteinsson, MD</p>

<p>A recent study suggests that the traditional belief that iron deficiency is the primary cause of anaemia in India may be outdated, highlighting alternative factors such as Vitamin B12 deficiency and air pollution. The findings call for a review of public health policies regarding anaemia.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study was published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</li>
<li>Anaemia affects 34.9% of the population tested, but only 9% had iron-deficiency anaemia.</li>
<li>Prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age increased from 53.2% to 57.2% as per the latest National Family Health Survey.</li>
<li>Other causes of anaemia include deficiencies in nutrients like B12 or folate and environmental factors such as pollution.</li>
<li>The study indicates the need for diversified dietary policies and holistic approaches, rather than focusing solely on iron supplementation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The key is to diversify diets. We have to intervene with ensuring more fruits, milk and vegetables are made available to a wider population which will improve absorption of essential nutrients.” - Dr. Anura Kurpad</blockquote>
<p>The findings of this study advocate for more comprehensive public health strategies to combat anaemia in India.</p>]]></description>

<p>Experts advise that individuals with cardiovascular diseases or risk factors should stay away from extreme temperatures to prevent health complications.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extreme cold or heat can disrupt cardiovascular functions.</li>
    <li>Fluctuations in temperature can lead to spikes in blood pressure.</li>
    <li>About 3.5 crore devotees participated in the Maha Kumbh event under harsh conditions.</li>
    <li>Notable increases in heart attack rates during winter attributed to temperature changes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Exposure to extreme cold can affect the heart, the brain and other vital organs.”</blockquote>
<p>This increased awareness and caution regarding temperature impacts can help prevent serious cardiovascular events.</p>]]></description>

<p>This article explores the experiences of individuals suffering from depersonalisation and derealisation disorder, emphasizing the emotional and psychological struggles faced by those affected by these dissociative symptoms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals with depersonalisation disorder often feel detached from themselves and their surroundings, leading to experiences described as dream-like or surreal.</li>
  <li>The lack of understanding and language surrounding these disorders contributes to feelings of isolation among sufferers.</li>
  <li>Many mental health professionals receive little training on dissociative disorders, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.</li>
  <li>Awareness and conversation about these disorders are increasing, particularly through social media and dedicated resources.</li>
  <li>Ongoing research is aimed at developing better support and treatment options for those affected.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The surprising truth is that the experiences of depersonalisation and derealisation that define depersonalisation disorder are extremely common and entirely normal, especially when under stress.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while depersonalisation and derealisation disorders often leave individuals feeling misunderstood and alone, growing awareness and resources offer hope for better understanding and treatment in the future.</p>]]></description>

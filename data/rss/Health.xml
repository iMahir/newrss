            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Kerala Faces Major Mumps Outbreak with Over 70,000 Cases Reported</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Local Health Department Reports</p>
<p>The state of Kerala is experiencing a significant surge in mumps cases, with over 70,000 reported this year, a dramatic increase from 2,324 cases in 2023. Health officials are concerned about the rising numbers as many individuals seek alternative medical treatments instead of conventional methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Malappuram and Kannur are severely affected, with 13,643 and 12,800 reported cases, respectively.</li>
<li>Schools have closed and mask mandates are in effect to curb the spread.</li>
<li>Mumps is a viral illness leading to swollen salivary glands and is highly contagious.</li>
<li>Complications of mumps can be severe, especially in unvaccinated individuals.</li>
<li>Health officials attribute the outbreak to a lack of vaccinations among children.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The only way to stop the rise of mumps is to either bring back the MMR vaccine or properly inform people that it is accessible in private hospitals.” - Dr. Aneseya P. Varghese</blockquote>
<p>Despite no reported deaths, health authorities are urging for immediate action to address this urgent public health issue.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Study Reveals Flu Virus Remains Infectious in Refrigerated Raw Milk</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 12, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Stanford University via EurekAlert!</p>
<p>This study highlights the risks associated with consuming raw milk, revealing that influenza virus can remain infectious in refrigerated raw milk for up to five days. As concerns about bird flu outbreaks in dairy cattle grow, the findings emphasize the importance of milk pasteurization.</p>
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Raw Milk" />
<figcaption>Raw milk, which is not pasteurized, may harbor infectious viruses.</figcaption>
<ul>
<li>Over 14 million Americans consume raw milk annually.</li>
<li>The flu virus H1N1 PR8 can remain infectious in raw milk for up to five days.</li>
<li>Flu virus RNA can be detected in raw milk for at least 57 days.</li>
<li>Pasteurization effectively destroys infectious influenza in milk.</li>
<li>Flu viruses infect over 40 million Americans each year, leading to over 50,000 deaths.</li>
<li>Recent cases of bird flu in cattle raise concerns about potential transmission through dairy products.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The persistence of infectious influenza virus in raw milk for days raises concerns about potential transmission pathways.” – Mengyang Zhang</blockquote>
<p>This research sheds light on food safety regarding raw milk consumption and emphasizes the need for improved monitoring systems as avian influenza continues to spread among livestock.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Colon cancer: Measuring ‘biological age’ may help predict who's at risk for polyps</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Medical News Today</p>
<img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/age-colorectal-GettyImages-533258327-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A long exposure image of people commuting in the subway during rush hour">
<figcaption>Scientists have found a link between accelerated biological age and colon cancer risk. silkwayrain/Getty Images</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses new research indicating that biological age, reflecting an individual’s physiological condition, may be a key predictor of the risk for developing colon polyps, which are precursors to colorectal cancer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research from the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center suggests faster biological aging correlates with increased polyp risk.</li>
  <li>For every year of accelerated biological aging, the risk of developing polyps increases by 16%.</li>
  <li>These findings may lead to earlier screenings for those with accelerated biological ages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>“Biological aging is a measure of your body’s age based on changes in DNA.”</strong><br>— Shria Kumar, MD, MSCE</blockquote>
<p>Colorectal cancer, particularly among individuals under 50, is rising, emphasizing the need for risk stratification in screenings. Future studies should validate the findings to enhance preventive strategies.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 18, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> HealthDay News</p>
<p>Winter is here, and managing asthma symptoms can be challenging due to colder air, increased respiratory infections, and seasonal allergies. Following certain strategies can help control asthma and make winter more enjoyable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a scarf or mask to warm the air when outside in cold weather.</li>
<li>Maintain good indoor air quality with regular cleaning and air purifiers.</li>
<li>Get a flu shot to protect against respiratory infections.</li>
<li>Utilize maintenance inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep inflammation under control.</li>
<li>Consider SMART (Single Maintenance and Reliever Therapy) for a simplified inhaler approach.</li>
<li>Explore biologics for severe asthma management when traditional therapies are ineffective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Asthma management in winter can be a challenge, but with the right tools, your symptoms will be better controlled.”</blockquote>
<p>By adopting these practices, individuals with asthma can effectively manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of flare-ups during the winter months.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Many factors distort blood pressure reading: report</figcaption>
<p>A recent report highlights various factors that can distort blood pressure readings, including patient posture and lifestyle choices. Proper measurement techniques are crucial for accurately assessing blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular health issues.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Patients often skip essential steps in measuring blood pressure.</li>
  <li>Factors like sitting posture and recent caffeine intake can skew readings.</li>
  <li>Guidelines suggest specific positions for accurate measurement.</li>
  <li>Research indicates that brief daily exercise can positively influence blood pressure.</li>
  <li>Over 1.28 billion adults globally suffer from hypertension.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To really make a dent at improving people's cardiovascular health, we need to screen and treat people for hypertension, but we need to do it correctly," - Tammy Brady, Johns Hopkins.</blockquote>
<p>Correct blood pressure measurement techniques are vital for health management and early detection of cardiovascular conditions.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2025 &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> India TV News</p>
<img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/centered/newbucket/1200_675/2025/01/bird-flu-1736490487.webp" alt="Here's what you need to know about H5N1 virus" width="1200" height="675">
<figcaption> Here's what you need to know about H5N1 virus </figcaption>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that a person has died of H5N1 bird flu in the United States, marking the first such death in the country due to this infection, which is primarily caused by animal-to-human exposure.</p>
<ul>
<li>H5N1 does not spread from person to person.</li>
<li>First identified in Southern China in 1996, it has caused sporadic outbreaks in birds worldwide.</li>
<li>Symptoms include pink eye, fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties.</li>
<li>Severe cases can lead to complications like pneumonia and respiratory failure.</li>
<li>Preventative measures include wearing protective clothing and frequent handwashing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Scientists said that the virus would need to evolve or retain key changes in its genetic sequence to start a pandemic.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while H5N1 bird flu poses a significant risk to birds and occasionally humans, it does not spread between human beings, making widespread outbreaks less likely under current conditions.</p>]]></description>

<p>Chinese health officials have identified a new mutated strain of mpox, known as clade Ib, in a foreigner who had traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This finding comes as mpox continues to spread globally, prompting concern from health authorities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A cluster of cases was linked to an individual from the DRC, with four additional cases reported among close contacts.</li>
  <li>Symptoms among infected individuals are reported to be mild, including skin rashes and blisters.</li>
  <li>Mpox transmits through close contact and can lead to serious health issues in vulnerable populations.</li>
  <li>Infection rates and deaths in the DRC raise alarms, particularly concerning individuals with underlying health conditions.</li>
  <li>WHO's designation of mpox as a global public health emergency highlights the need for monitoring and containment measures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Clade Ib seems to be different, and is spreading largely through contact between humans, including through sex.

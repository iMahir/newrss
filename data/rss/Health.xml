<p>This article explores the surprising effects of space travel on the human body, based on studies conducted by NASA in preparation for future missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>
<ul>
<li>NASA studies how space impacts human health to prepare for future Moon and Mars missions.</li>
<li>Astronauts face health challenges, including bone density loss of 1-1.5% per month in microgravity.</li>
<li>Fluid shifts in microgravity can lead to increased pressure on the eyes and vision problems.</li>
<li>Dehydration and calcium loss increase the risk of kidney stones in space.</li>
<li>Astronauts learn to create medical solutions and perform health checks using ultrasound during missions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Astronauts lose about 1-1.5% of bone density per month during spaceflight.</blockquote>
<p>The findings underscore the importance of further research into the effects of long-duration space travel on health as humanity aims for deeper space exploration.</p>]]></description>

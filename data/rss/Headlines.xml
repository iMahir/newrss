<figcaption>J&amp;K chief minister Omar Abdullah (File photo/ANI)</figcaption>
<p>Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the dual governance model in Jammu and Kashmir, describing it as a "recipe for disaster," and called for the restoration of statehood in the region.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah expressed cautious optimism regarding the central government's commitment to restore statehood, citing previous promises from Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah.</li>
    <li>He emphasized that having multiple power centres leads to inefficiency, using sports leadership as an analogy.</li>
    <li>Abdullah highlighted the lack of benefits from Union Territory status since taking office and criticized the idea of dual governance, referencing Delhi's arrangement.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court has ordered assembly elections by September and called for statehood restoration "at the earliest" by December 2023.</li>
    <li>He mentioned plans for a backup strategy if statehood isn't restored but chose not to disclose details.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "Let me just say this, having two power centres anywhere is a recipe for disaster... No organisation works well if there are multiple power centres." – Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Abdullah’s remarks reflect a strong stance against the current governance structure in Jammu and Kashmir, insisting on the need for restoring its statehood to ensure effective administration and representation.]]></description>

<p>Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden expressed surprise at Rohit Sharma's bold decision to bowl first on the opening day of the Gabba Test, given that the pitch conditions seemed more suited for batting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hayden was taken aback by Rohit's toss decision, stating that the pitch favored batters.</li>
    <li>He noted that the groundsman had likely prepared the pitch earlier due to recent rain, affecting its behavior.</li>
    <li>India's bowlers struggled against Australia, who ended the day at 28/0 in 13.2 overs.</li>
    <li>Hayden believes that the pitch will deteriorate over the next couple of days, making spinners more effective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I was really surprised that actually, Rohit won the toss and decided to bowl, because I felt like it was over-prepared... Almost 12 inches of rain in the past two weeks." - Matthew Hayden</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Hayden emphasized that opting to bat first would have been a wiser choice, considering the expected changes in pitch conditions over the course of the match.]]></description>

<p>In the third Test against Australia at the Gabba, Indian captain Rohit Sharma opted to bowl first under cloudy conditions. However, Jasprit Bumrah expressed his frustration over the lack of swing during the early overs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rohit Sharma chose to bowl first despite expectations of a favorable pitch for fast bowlers.</li>
    <li>Bumrah was heard on the stump microphone saying, "Nahin ho raha swing aise bhi; kahin bhi kar lo", indicating the ball was not swinging.</li>
    <li>The first day was disrupted by rain, with only 13.2 overs bowled, leaving Australia at 28 for 0 by the end.</li>
    <li>Indian bowlers experimented with different lines but failed to get swing or seam movement.</li>
    <li>Former players and commentators expressed concerns about the decision to bowl first at the Gabba, citing historical context.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"You bat at the Gabba. If you face Australia, you want them to bat second and fourth." - Kerry O'Keeffe</blockquote>

<p>South Korea’s parliament has voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration this month, marking a significant political event in the country.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The National Assembly passed the impeachment motion with a vote of 204-85.</li>
    <li>Yoon’s presidential powers will be suspended pending the Constitutional Court's decision on his impeachment.</li>
    <li>The court has up to 180 days to decide Yoon's fate; if removed, a national election must be held within 60 days.</li>
    <li>Yoon stated he will “never give up” and called for stability during this “temporary” pause of his presidency.</li>
    <li>The martial law decree drew comparisons to South Korea's authoritarian past from the 1980s.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I will fight to the end in the face of opposition-led efforts to remove me from office.” - President Yoon Suk Yeol</blockquote>

<p><strong>Published:</strong> 14 December 2024, <strong>Source:</strong> PTI</p>
<p>Bhopal: A purported suicide note recovered after the deaths of a businessman and his wife in Madhya Pradesh's Sehore district has ignited a political dispute between the Congress and the ruling BJP.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The suicide note reportedly accuses the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and BJP leaders of harassment.</li>
    <li>Manoj Parmar urged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to care for his children in the note, saying the couple were supporters of the party.</li>
    <li>Congress claims harassment led to the couple's deaths, labeling it a state-sponsored murder.</li>
    <li>BJP leaders condemned the politically charged accusations, calling them a misuse of tragedy for personal gain.</li>
    <li>The ED conducted searches linked to Parmar under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act prior to the incident.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another political row has broken out between the State and Central governments over the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) demand that Kerala recompense an outstanding ₹132 crore airway bill incurred during disaster-related humanitarian operations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The IAF's demand surfaces amid calls for federal aid for Wayanad's landslide recovery.</li>
    <li>Kerala's Revenue Minister K. Rajan criticized the Centre's demand as discriminatory against the state.</li>
    <li>The Centre is accused of stonewalling Kerala's request to classify the Wayanad landslide as a Level 3 disaster for federal aid eligibility.</li>
    <li>K. Rajan emphasized that Kerala is financially strained and cannot afford to compensate the IAF without federal support.</li>
    <li>Joint protests from Kerala MPs, including Congress's Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, have been organized against the Centre's actions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Centre's demand for monetary reimbursement for humanitarian operations amid ongoing disaster recovery in Kerala is unjust and discriminatory."</blockquote>
<p>Kerala's officials plan to petition the Centre to waive the IAF's charges, highlighting a growing tension in federal-state relations over disaster aid and support.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rain disrupted Day 1 of the third Test between India and Australia at the Gabba, allowing only 13.2 overs of play. The highlight was a moment captured on the stump mic featuring Jasprit Bumrah expressing his frustration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl first under overcast conditions.</li>
    <li>Jasprit Bumrah struggled to find swing and indicated to Shubman Gill during play that the ball wasn't swinging as expected.</li>
    <li>Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney faced the Indian bowlers comfortably, contributing to Australia's score of 28/0 before rain halted play.</li>
    <li>The play is scheduled to resume with adjusted timings at 5:20 AM IST, contingent on weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Nahi ho raha swing aise bhi (The ball isn't swinging),” Jasprit Bumrah expressed to Shubman Gill after his delivery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As both teams prepare for the resumption, memories of India's historic win at the Gabba in 2020-21 loom large, with Rishabh Pant sharing his positive outlook about returning to the venue.</p>]]></description>

<p>The outbreak of cholera in Yemen has escalated significantly, with around 250,000 suspected infections reported, highlighting the dire humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yemen has reported 250,000 suspected cholera infections and 861 deaths as of December 1, 2024.</li>
  <li>There has been a 37% increase in cases and a 27% rise in the death rate in November 2024 compared to the previous year.</li>
  <li>The cholera outbreak is exacerbated by Yemen's prolonged conflict, economic struggles, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure.</li>
  <li>A significant funding gap of $20 million threatens to close essential treatment facilities, including diarrhea treatment centers.</li>
  <li>The WHO is collaborating with local authorities to address the outbreak through various interventions, including improving laboratory capacities and training health workers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Waterborne diseases like cholera and acute watery diarrhea have added immense pressure on Yemen’s already struggling health system.” - Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen</blockquote>
<p>This cholera surge poses a significant risk to the population, with millions requiring urgent humanitarian assistance amidst systematic challenges.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>27 contact lenses found in woman's eye during cataract surgery</figcaption>
<p>A routine cataract surgery turned into a medical mystery when doctors found 27 contact lenses trapped under a 67-year-old woman's eyelid. She had worn monthly disposable lenses for 35 years without regular check-ups and experienced only minor discomfort.</p>
<ul>
<li>The woman had no major vision issues despite her contact lenses being trapped.</li>
<li>Doctors discovered the lenses when administering anesthetic for cataract surgery.</li>
<li>A clump of 17 lenses was found, with 10 more located using a microscope.</li>
<li>The surgery was postponed for two weeks due to potential infection risks.</li>
<li>The woman assumed a missing lens had been dropped and was unaware of the accumulation.</li>
<li>Doctors emphasized the importance of monitoring contact lens users properly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“While it wasn’t clear how so many contact lenses ended up under the patient’s eyelid…”</blockquote>
<p>This unusual case highlights the need for regular eye check-ups for contact lens users to prevent similar incidents.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the retirement of Nvidia's GeForce Experience in favor of the new Nvidia App, marking a drastic change that many users are celebrating.</p>
<ul>
  <li>GeForce Experience (GFE) was criticized for being convoluted and requiring user logins without offering value.</li>
  <li>The new Nvidia App combines useful features from GFE and the outdated Nvidia Control Panel.</li>
  <li>User feedback indicates significant improvements in usability and convenience with the new Nvidia App.</li>
  <li>The Nvidia App does not require logins, removing the frustration associated with GFE.</li>
  <li>Despite improvements, some areas still need enhancement for full integration of features.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Nothing infuriated me more than GeForce Experience during that time."</blockquote>
<p>This change signifies a positive step for Nvidia users, although concerns remain about potential future changes that may reintroduce unwelcome features.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SpaceX launches double moonshot mission as 2 lunar landers on rocket blast off</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, Cape Canaveral, Fla.<br /><strong>Source:</strong> Associated Press</p>
<p>SpaceX successfully launched two lunar landers for U.S. and Japanese companies aiming to enhance lunar exploration and business opportunities. The landers were launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and will follow separate paths to the moon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The mission includes ispace's Resilience lander and Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander.</li>
  <li>ispace's mission aims to test lunar soil collection and future resource utilization.</li>
  <li>Firefly's lander will conduct various experiments for NASA, including soil sampling.</li>
  <li>The two landers will have differing timelines for their moon landings in early March and late May or early June, respectively.</li>
  <li>The U.S. plans more lunar missions under NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon by the end of the decade.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We don’t think this is a race. Some people say ‘race to the moon,’ but it’s not about the speed.” - ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada</blockquote>
<p>Both companies face challenges but share a common goal of paving the way for future lunar exploration.</p>]]></description>

<p>A high-powered enquiry committee has submitted its findings regarding organised criminal groups and terrorist organisations that pose a threat to the security interests of both India and the U.S.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The investigation was prompted by allegations of a plot to assassinate Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun by Indian agents.</li>
  <li>The committee has recommended legal action against an individual discovered during the enquiry.</li>
  <li>Cooperation from U.S. authorities was pivotal in the investigation.</li>
  <li>The MHA established the committee in November 2023 following intelligence from U.S. sources.</li>
  <li>The report suggests systemic improvements to enhance India's operational responses to threats.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Committee has further recommended functional improvements in systems and procedures as also initiation of steps that could strengthen India's response capability..."</blockquote>
<p>The report addresses critical security concerns and proposes measures to bolster operational strategies in counter-terrorism efforts.</p>]]></description>

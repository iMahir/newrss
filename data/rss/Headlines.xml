            <description><![CDATA[<h1>HMPV outbreak: Amid global concern, Chinese official says cases in northern China declining</h1>

<p>The recent outbreak of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in northern China has sparked concerns about a potential pandemic; however, a health official reports declining rates of infection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The human metapneumovirus, known for causing flu-like symptoms, is not new and has been present for decades.</li>
  <li>Infections have been rising, but improvements in detection methods have contributed to increased reported cases.</li>
  <li>Reports indicate that the rate of positive HMPV cases is declining, particularly among children aged 14 and below.</li>
  <li>Concerns about the outbreak intensified after images of overwhelmed hospitals circulated in media.</li>
  <li>Experts assert that HMPV differs from COVID-19 in that most people develop some immunity to the virus over time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The human metapneumovirus is not a new virus, and has been with humans for at least several decades.” - Wang Liping</blockquote>
<p>As of now, there are no vaccines or specific treatments for HMPV. Experts recommend preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus.</p>]]></description>

(Photo: X/ MoFA Bangladesh)</figcaption><p>Bangladesh faced off with India Sunday over tensions at the border as the neighbouring country’s foreign ministry summoned High Commissioner Pranay Verma to express “deep concern” over “recent activities of the Border Security Force (BSF)”.</p><p>This came hours after Dhaka alleged that India was attempting to construct fences at five locations along the Indo-Bangla border, violating a bilateral agreement.</p><p>After meeting Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin, the Indian High Commissioner said: “I just met Foreign Secretary to discuss India’s commitment to ensuring a crime-free border, effectively addressing challenges of smuggling, movement of criminals and trafficking.” “We have an understanding with regard to fencing the border for security. BSF and BGB (Border Guard Bangladesh) have been in communication in this regard. We expect that understandings will be implemented and there will be a cooperative approach to combating crime,” Verma said in Dhaka.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Bangladesh Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd.) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said that India had halted the construction of barbed wire fencing along the border after strong opposition from the BGB and local residents.</p><p>According to the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry, Jashim Uddin told the Indian envoy that the “unauthorized attempt” to construct fences and related operational actions by BSF have caused tensions along the border.</p><p>“He emphasised that the construction of barbed wire fences without proper authorization undermines the spirit of cooperation and friendly relations between the two neighboring countries. He hoped that the upcoming BGB-BSF DG Level Talks would be able to discuss the matter at length,” it said in a statement.</p><p>“Referring to the recent killing of a Bangladesh citizen at Sunamganj by BSF, Foreign Secretary… strongly resented these acts of killing and called for urgent action by the Indian authorities to stop recurrence of such incidents and conduct enquiries into all these border killings and take actions against those responsible,” it said.</p><p>He said Bangladesh believes such issues should be resolved through dialogue.</p><p>This article went live on January 12, 2025, at 6:06 PM.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully brought its SpaDeX satellites, Chaser and Target, within 3 meters of each other as part of a trial for a future docking experiment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The docking mission aims to showcase in-space docking technologies.</li>
<li>If successful, India will join the US, Russia, and China as a nation capable of complex docking operations.</li>
<li>This mission is key for future Indian space missions, including lunar sample collection and establishing a space station by 2035.</li>
<li>ISRO emphasizes caution in the docking process due to its complexity and its status as a technology demonstration mission.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Getting it right is more important than getting it done on schedule.” - ISRO</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the successful close approach of the SpaDeX satellites marks a significant step in India's ambitious space exploration goals.</p>]]></description>

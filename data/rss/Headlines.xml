<figcaption>Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal addresses a press conference in New Delhi.(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>In a press conference, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal alleged that the BJP is distributing gold chains to buy votes in the upcoming Delhi assembly elections. He has urged voters not to sell their votes under any circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kejriwal claimed BJP leaders are openly attempting to buy votes with cash and gifts.</li>
<li>He warned voters against accepting any monetary incentives from political parties.</li>
<li>Kejriwal called out the BJP for not having a clear vision or chief ministerial candidate.</li>
<li>The AAP leader stated that the distribution of gifts is a tactic to manipulate voter behavior.</li>
<li>BJP's Manoj Tiwari accused Kejriwal of breaking his promise to avoid alliances.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I appeal to the public to take everything they are distributing but don't sell your vote.” - Arvind Kejriwal</blockquote>
<p>This election is critical for the future political landscape of Delhi, and the accusations of vote buying raise significant questions about electoral integrity.</p>]]></description>

<p>The first full moon of 2025, known as the 'Wolf Moon,' was witnessed by sky-watchers in North America as it briefly blocked Mars during a lunar occultation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The occultation lasted for about an hour, obscuring Mars from view.</li>
<li>This rare celestial event coincided with Mars being the closest to Earth since December 2022.</li>
<li>Mars reached opposition on January 15, making it fully illuminated.</li>
<li>The phenomenon was a visual illusion caused by the moon crossing the ecliptic plane.</li>
<li>Observers noted the relative distances: Mars was 59.7 million miles away while the moon was 224,000 miles distant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Mars appeared fully illuminated and brighter than at any other time since December 2022, despite being outshone by Venus.</blockquote>
<p>The 'Wolf Moon' is traditionally associated with January and has several alternative names, including the Stay Home Moon and Snow Moon, with the next full moon set for February 12, 2025.</p>]]></description>

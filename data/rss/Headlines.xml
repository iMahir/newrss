            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Solid-state nuclear clocks could be closer with thin-film technology</h1>
<p><strong>Updated:</strong> January 09, 2025 04:19 PM EST</p>
<img alt="Safe, affordable solid-state nuclear clocks could be closer with thin-film technology" src="https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Using-its-active-sensors-sonar-LIDAR-camera-electromagnetic-the-vehicle-can-identify-mines.-The-vehicle-has-a-silent-electric-propulsion-system-a-non-metallic-non-pressurized-hull-structur-2025-01-10T021650.416.png" width="584" height="421">
<figcaption>Representational image showing potential applications of nuclear clocks.</figcaption>
<p>The successful use of thin films marks a potential turning point in the development of nuclear clocks, leveraging physical vapor deposition to make clock technology more practical and accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers at JILA and NIST found a method to reduce the amount of the rare isotope thorium-229 needed for nuclear clocks.</li>
<li>Thin-film technology allows for the development of nuclear clocks that are significantly less radioactive and expensive.</li>
<li>This new approach could enable nuclear clocks to be used outside laboratory settings, making them compact and portable.</li>
<li>The use of thin films could lead to improvements in the precision and stability of timekeeping.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Thorium-229 by weight is more expensive than some of the custom proteins I’ve worked with in the past,” - Jake Higgins, JILA researcher.</blockquote>
<p>This breakthrough in thin-film technology may change the future of timekeeping, providing a new avenue for developing solid-state nuclear clocks that are both less hazardous and more efficient.</p>]]></description>

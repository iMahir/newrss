<p>The Union Home Ministry has sanctioned the Enforcement Directorate to prosecute Arvind Kejriwal in connection with a money laundering case linked to the excise policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Enforcement Directorate filed a chargesheet after arresting Kejriwal in March 2024.</li>
<li>The MHA's sanction comes just ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections on February 5, 2025.</li>
<li>Kejriwal and AAP have been accused of involvement in corrupt practices related to the 2021-22 excise policy.</li>
<li>V K Saxena, the Delhi Lieutenant Governor, had recommended a CBI probe into alleged irregularities leading to the ED's investigation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Kejriwal was called the 'kingpin and key conspirator' of the Delhi excise scam by the ED."</blockquote>
<p>This development is critical in the context of the upcoming elections and raises significant questions about governance and accountability in the Delhi government.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>Aryna Sabalenka defeated Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-3, 7-5, recovering from a 5-2 deficit in the second set.</li>
  <li>Laura Siegemund made headlines by defeating No.5 seed Zheng Qinwen 7-6(3), 6-3.</li>
  <li>This match marked Siegemund's 11th career Top 10 victory.</li>
  <li>Sabalenka extended her winning streak at Melbourne Park to 16 matches.</li>
  <li>Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva also advanced to the third round with contrasting performances.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"She played incredible tennis, especially in the second set," Sabalenka said. "I'm really happy I was able to turn around that set."</blockquote>

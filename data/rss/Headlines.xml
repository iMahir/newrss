(Photo Credits: X)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> NASA's Juno mission has provided groundbreaking insights into the volcanic heat of Io, Jupiter's largest moon. The research published in Nature has revealed that the volcanoes on Io are powered by local magma chambers rather than a global magma ocean.</p><ol><li>Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system with over 400 active volcanoes.</li><li>The Juno spacecraft used high-precision Doppler measurements to probe Io’s gravitational field and internal structure.</li><li>The volcanic activity on Io is mainly due to tidal flexing—a gravitational pull by Jupiter that heats the moon's interior.</li><li>Each volcano on Io is fed by its own magma chamber, providing the energy for continuous eruptions.</li></ol><blockquote>The squeezing generates heat to the extent that Io’s insides are melting and erupting.</blockquote><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The findings from Juno reshape our understanding of Io and have broader implications for the study of other celestial bodies with subsurface oceans, such as Europa and Enceladus.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Taxi and ambulance drivers less likely to die from Alzheimer's disease, study says</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 17, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>
<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3nrvfy/article68995614.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/80692_15_9_2023_18_33_3_1_16TVKZAMBULANCE2.JPG" alt="File photograph used for representational purposes only" />
<figcaption>File photograph used for representational purposes only | Photo Credit: K Ragesh</figcaption>
<p>A new study revealed that taxi and ambulance drivers have a lower risk of death from Alzheimer's disease compared to individuals in other professions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taxi and ambulance drivers demonstrated the lowest proportions of Alzheimer's-related deaths in a study of nearly nine million people from various occupations.</li>
  <li>Only 171 of 16,658 taxi drivers (approximately 1%) died from Alzheimer's, while 10 of 1,348 ambulance drivers (0.74%) succumbed to the disease.</li>
  <li>The study posited that these professions may provide a protective effect against Alzheimer's due to the frequent processing of spatial and navigational information.</li>
  <li>This trend differs from other transport-related jobs like bus drivers and aircraft pilots, likely due to differences in job demands.</li>
  <li>The impact on the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and navigation, may explain the reduced risk.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"In an analysis of nearly all death certificates in the United States, taxi drivers and ambulance drivers, whose jobs require frequent spatial and navigational processing, were found to be the occupations with the two lowest risk-adjusted percentages of deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease," the authors wrote.</blockquote>
<p>The authors emphasize the need for further research to clarify whether cognitive activities in these professions can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and if such activities can be preventive.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Canada’s New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</figcaption>
<p>Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, has joined renewed calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign, citing high living costs and the looming threat of tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
<li>Singh stated, "Today, I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Liberals are fighting themselves when Canadians need a Prime Minister who will fight for them."
<li>Trudeau is facing significant political challenges following the unexpected resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, which has led to a third of the Liberal MPs demanding a leadership change.</li>
<li>Reports indicate that nearly 60 of the 153 Liberal MPs in the House of Commons are rebelling against Trudeau's leadership.</li>
<li>Trudeau is trailing Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre by 20 points in recent polls.</li>
<li>Freeland’s resignation letter referred to a “grave challenge” for Canada, linked to Trump's proposed tariffs on Canadian goods.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today, I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Liberals are fighting themselves – when Canadians need a Prime Minister who will fight for them.” – Jagmeet Singh</blockquote>
<p>This political turmoil comes as Trudeau's government grapples with internal dissent and significant external pressures, which may have lasting implications for Canadian politics.</p>]]></description>

<p>Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) secretary Ashok Sharma has expressed disappointment that star cricketer Virat Kohli will not participate in the Ranji Trophy, urging him to draw inspiration from players who prioritize domestic cricket.</p>
<ul>

  <li>Kohli last played for Delhi in 2012; faces criticism for not participating in domestic games.</li>
  <li>Comparison with Mumbai players who compete in domestic cricket despite being contracted with the Indian team.</li>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to create a new government agency called the External Revenue Service on January 20, coinciding with his second inauguration. This agency will focus on collecting tariffs and duties from foreign sources as part of a broader strategy to implement new import tariffs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump aims to shift revenue collection from the IRS to the new department.</li>
  <li>He criticized existing trade agreements for burdening American taxpayers.</li>
  <li>The proposal includes tariffs of 10% on global imports and higher tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.</li>
  <li>Economic forecasts predict significant revenue generation from the proposed tariffs, but potential adverse effects on the economy.</li>
  <li>Senator Ron Wyden condemned Trump's plan as a tax increase on families and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects Trump's ongoing commitment to reshape U.S. trade policy and revenue structure as he resumes presidential duties.</p>]]></description>

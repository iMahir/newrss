            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Elon Musk emerges as power player amid US government shutdown crisis</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> December 21, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/21/550x309/GERMANY-MUSK--0_1734755281734_1734755307631.JPG" alt="Elon Musk's influence is now being felt far beyond the business world.(REUTERS)">
<figcaption>Elon Musk's influence is now being felt far beyond the business world.(REUTERS)</figcaption>
<p>In the midst of the US shutdown crisis, Elon Musk emerged as a significant influencer, wielding considerable power alongside President-elect Donald Trump. The world's richest person played a key role as the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives passed legislation on Friday that would avert a midnight government shutdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The House passed a bipartisan bill by a vote of 366-34 to avoid a government shutdown.</li>
<li>Trump and Musk actively opposed a prior bipartisan funding plan due to controversial provisions.</li>
<li>Musk used social media to influence public opinion and shape policy discussions around the funding bill.</li>
<li>The final package stripped many controversial provisions and would fund the government through March.</li>
<li>Musk's role suggests increasing influence in Washington, particularly as head of the Department of Government Efficiency in Trump's administration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces," Musk wrote on X, signaling his approval of the revised bill.</blockquote>
<p>The government shutdown crisis was narrowly averted, but the power struggle between the White House, Congress, and Musk's influence continues.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja (AFP Photo)</figcaption>
<p>Ravindra Jadeja expressed that he will deeply miss Ravichandran Ashwin, whom he considers an on-field mentor, after Ashwin announced his retirement during the Test series against Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashwin retires as India’s second-highest wicket-taker in Tests with 537 wickets.</li>
  <li>He and Jadeja took 587 wickets together in 58 Tests, surpassing the Kumble-Harbhajan duo.</li>
  <li>Jadeja praised Ashwin's mentorship and their communication during matches.</li>
  <li>They will reunite in IPL 2025 for Chennai Super Kings.</li>
  <li>Ashwin reflected on his career and significant memories with teammates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level. I do feel there's a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to expose... I've had a lot of fun.” - R Ashwin</blockquote>
<p>Jadeja's sentiments highlight the bond formed between the two over many years, while Ashwin's retirement marks a significant moment in Indian cricket history.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article outlines Jasprit Bumrah's stellar performance in the Border-Gavaskar series despite injury concerns emerging from his heavy workload. He ended the series with 32 wickets and was named Player of the Series, but his absence in the final innings has raised alarms regarding his fitness and management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bumrah took 32 wickets in five matches, achieving three five-wicket hauls.</li>
<li>He bowled 151.2 overs in the series, with a peak of 53.2 overs in one match.</li>
<li>Concerns about workload management sparked debate in the cricketing community.</li>
<li>Former cricketer Balwinder Sandhu criticized the idea of workload management, encouraging players to focus on physical endurance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If a bowler can’t bowl 20 overs in an innings, he should forget about playing for India." - Balwinder Sandhu</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the conflict between modern injury management practices in cricket and the traditional philosophies regarding player endurance.</p>]]></description>

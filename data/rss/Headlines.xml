<p>US Surgeon-General Vivek Murthy has called for alcoholic beverages to carry cancer warning labels, highlighting evidence that no level of alcohol consumption is safe when it comes to cancer risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the US, following tobacco and obesity.</li>
  <li>Consumption of just one drink per day can increase the risk for several cancers including breast, mouth, and throat.</li>
  <li>Alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the WHO, with no safe level of consumption.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy's report states alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy draws parallels with India's anti-smoking campaigns as a model for addressing alcohol-related harm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Alcohol has been confirmed as a group 1 carcinogen... there is no safe level of alcohol,” - Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects a growing recognition of the health risks associated with alcohol consumption and aims to reduce the incidence of alcohol-related cancers.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>New Orleans attack puts spotlight on Islamic State com</figcaption>
<p>A recent attack in New Orleans by a U.S. Army veteran, who identified himself with the Islamic State, has raised concerns about the group's ability to inspire violence even after significant losses in recent years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The attacker rammed a truck into New Year's revelers while flying the Islamic State flag, resulting in 14 fatalities.</li>
    <li>The Islamic State's leadership structure has become more clandestine, but their capacity to inspire lone wolf attacks remains strong.</li>
    <li>Despite the U.S.-led coalition's efforts, the group has continued some major operations and recruiting.</li>
    <li>Geopolitical turmoil, particularly in the Middle East, presents opportunities for the Islamic State’s resurgence.</li>
    <li>The U.N. warns of a potential resurgence of the group alongside concerns about its affiliates, particularly in Afghanistan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"History shows how quickly moments of promise can descend into conflict and violence." - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken</blockquote>
<p>The New Orleans attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by extremist ideologies and highlights the need for continued vigilance in counterterrorism efforts.</p>]]></description>

<p>Australian opener Sam Konstas has come under fire for a heated argument with India captain Jasprit Bumrah during the SCG Test.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Konstas engaged in a furious exchange with Bumrah before Usman Khawaja's dismissal.</li>
  <li>The altercation led to India celebrating Khawaja's wicket and marked a tense finale to day one.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest Konstas' behavior may have distracted Khawaja from finishing the day's play smoothly.</li>
  <li>Adam Gilchrist criticized Konstas, highlighting the unusual and intense nature of the celebration from the Indian team.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"They're charging in from everywhere … All sorts of drama here," said Adam Gilchrist. "It was Bumrah who turned to Konstas. He learns a tough lesson in his second Test match."</blockquote>
<p>The incident has sparked widespread discussion and criticism among commentators and former players regarding the balance between confidence and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>]]></description>

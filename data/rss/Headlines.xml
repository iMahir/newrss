<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<p>In Bihar, a gang has been scamming men by offering fake job opportunities as pregnancy assistants, promising high pay for minimal work. The scheme has drawn attention for its deceitful nature and the emotional toll on victims.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gang lured victims with ads for high-paying jobs.</li>
  <li>Victims were manipulated into believing they were essential for supporting pregnant women.</li>
  <li>Several men reported large sums of money being extracted from them under false pretenses.</li>
  <li>Authorities are now investigating the gang's operations and seeking to provide justice to the victims.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We never imagined we were being fooled into such a cruel scam,” one victim said.</blockquote>

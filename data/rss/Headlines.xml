            <title><![CDATA["Objectionable That Arvind Kejriwal Called Atishi Temporary": Lt Governor - NDTV]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Objectionable That Arvind Kejriwal Called Atishi Temporary: Lt Governor</h1>
<p><strong>Date: </strong> Not specified | <strong>Source: </strong> Not specified</p>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong> Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena expressed his discontent over Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's reference to Atishi as a 'temporary Chief Minister', stating it undermines democratic principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saxena stated he was 'hurt' by Kejriwal's comment.</li>
<li>He emphasized that the term 'temporary Chief Minister' does not exist in the Constitution.</li>
<li>The LG praised Atishi for her governance efforts, contrasting her work with that of her predecessor, Kejriwal.</li>
<li>He listed areas where he believes the government has failed, while acknowledging Kejriwal's admissions of shortcomings.</li>
<li>Assembly elections in Delhi are scheduled for February next year.</li>
<li>Saxena had previously referred to Atishi as 'a thousand times better' than Kejriwal.</li>
<li>Atishi has yet to respond to the criticisms made by Saxena.</li>
<li>There was a prior incident in which Saxena overruled Atishi's request to hoist the national flag on Independence Day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is the first time in my two-and-a-half-year tenure that I am seeing a Chief Minister discharge the duties of a Chief Minister." - Lt Governor VK Saxena</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong> The ongoing tensions between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister highlight the political dynamics in Delhi ahead of the upcoming elections.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant and the three shots that sunk India at MCG</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 30, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Cricket.com.au</p>
<p>In a dramatic final session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, India lost to Australia by 184 runs, after falling short at 155 while chasing 339. Key players Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant made critical errors that shifted the game's momentum.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pat Cummins hailed the win as the “best Test he has been part of”.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma questioned Rishabh Pant's shot selection, emphasizing the need for players to recognize risk percentages.</li>
  <li>Virat Kohli’s innings ended disappointingly as he chased a wide delivery.</li>
  <li>The match saw a record attendance of 373,691, the highest for a Test in Australia.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a sad moment, but not a surprise,” remarked commentator Jim Maxwell on Kohli's dismissal.</p></blockquote>
<p>India's performance showcased not just individual errors but also a missed opportunity to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy should they win the next game.</p>]]></description>

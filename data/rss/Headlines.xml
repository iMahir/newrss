<p>In a crucial phase of Day 3 at the MCG, Rishabh Pant's risky shot selection led to his dismissal, sparking debate among fans and experts about his aggressive playing style.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pant attempted a scoop shot against Scott Boland but was caught out, leaving India at 191/5.</li>
  <li>Criticism of Pant's shot selection included comments from cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, who labeled it “stupid.”</li>
  <li>Ravi Shastri defended Pant, suggesting that it’s important to assess the context of his dismissals across innings.</li>
  <li>Shastri emphasized the need for Pant to adapt his approach during matches and play with maturity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It's not in every innings he has attempted that shot... Let’s calm down here, guys. It’s not every time he’s throwing it away.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri also remarked on Pant's propensity for high-risk shots, noting that while they can be effective, they must be executed wisely in changing game situations.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, GM <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/magnus-carlsen" target="_blank">Magnus Carlsen</a> announced his withdrawal from the ongoing <a href="https://www.chess.com/events/info/2024-fide-world-rapid-chess-championships" target="_blank">2024 FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship</a> and the <a href="https://www.chess.com/events/info/2024-fide-world-blitz-chess-championships" target="_blank">FIDE World Blitz Chess Championship</a> due to a conflict regarding the dress code. Finishing the Rapid championship with a score of 5 out of 8, Carlsen's withdrawal guarantees new champions in both formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carlsen received a $200 fine for wearing jeans and refused to change.</li>
<li>GMs <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/volodar-murzin" target="_blank">Volodar Murzin</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/jan-krzysztof-duda" target="_blank">Jan-Krzysztof Duda</a>, <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/arjun-erigaisi" target="_blank">Arjun Erigaisi</a>, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/alexander-grischuk" target="_blank">Alexander Grischuk</a> lead the Open championship with 7 points.</li>
<li>The final rounds for the Open and Women's championships will determine the world champions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>"I said I'll change tomorrow... but they said you have to change now & it became a matter of principle for me so here we are! Honestly I'm too old at this point to care too much." — <a href="https://twitter.com/chess24com/status/1872782506082353644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Magnus Carlsen</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This incident has sparked significant discussions on social media, particularly focusing on the enforcement of FIDE’s dress regulations and their implications for players.</p>
<p>FIDE confirmed the long-established dress code rules and stated that they serve to ensure professionalism and fairness among competitors. The dynamic nature of the championship continues as leaders and competitors strategize for the final rounds.</p>
<p>As Carlsen leaves the competition, the landscape of the tournament remains charged with anticipation as players vie for titles in his absence, marking a turning point in the championship's narrative.</p>]]></description>

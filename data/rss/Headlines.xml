<figcaption>While the relationship between sleep and memory has been well established, the neural mechanisms that underpin their interplay remain murky. Credit: Neuroscience News</figcaption>
<p>Researchers at Cornell University have found that pupil size during non-REM sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation. This study demonstrates that contracted pupils correlate with the consolidation of new memories, while dilated pupils relate to the processing of older memories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pupil Size and Memory:</strong> Contracted pupils correlate with new memory consolidation, while dilated pupils process older memories.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Separation:</strong> The brain alternates between new and old knowledge during non-REM sleep to prevent interference.</li>
<li><strong>AI Applications:</strong> Insights into memory processing may help improve efficiency in artificial neural networks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The eyes may be the window to the soul, but the pupil is key to understanding how, and when, the brain forms strong, long-lasting memories, Cornell researchers have found.</blockquote>
<p>The findings offer potential for developing better memory enhancement techniques and deeper understanding of sleep's role in memory processing.</p>]]></description>

<p>Roborock has introduced its latest robot vacuum, the Saros Z70, which boasts a unique mechanical arm capable of picking up small items while cleaning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Saros Z70 features the OmniGrip, a five-axis robotic arm that can lift objects up to 10.5 ounces.</li>
  <li>The vacuum also has advanced navigation with next-gen sensors and AI-powered object recognition.</li>
  <li>Initial demos showed some mechanical glitches, but Roborock assures that these issues have been addressed for retail versions.</li>
  <li>The vacuum can detect and avoid up to 108 different obstacles during cleaning cycles.</li>
  <li>Safety features include a child lock and a safety stop button to prevent accidental grabs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Instead of using a traditional LDS (LIDAR) tower module for navigation, the system integrates next-gen dual-light 3D time-of-flight sensors and RGB cameras powered by AI to determine its position, surroundings and whether the object it grips is overweight." - Roborock</blockquote>
<p>The Roborock Saros Z70 not only innovates with its mechanical arm but also maintains strong vacuuming capabilities with 22,000 Pa of suction power and an anti-tangle system.</p>]]></description>

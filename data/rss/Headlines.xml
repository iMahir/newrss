<p>The article discusses the Indian government's reluctance to engage with protesting farmers who have been calling for a legal guarantee for minimum support prices and other reforms. The Union Agriculture Minister has indicated the government is waiting for Supreme Court directives before initiating talks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The protests are led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha.</li>
<li>Farmers have been protesting at the Punjab-Haryana borders since February last year.</li>
<li>The current government is taking a more hands-off approach compared to previous administrations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The article highlights a shift in the Modi government's strategy towards farmer protests, emphasizing caution and reliance on judicial outcomes rather than direct negotiations.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Samsung's New OLED TV with Glare Free 2.0 Tech Addresses Screen Reflection Issues</h1>

<figcaption>The Samsung S95D (at right) shows fewer screen reflections than the LG G4 (at left), but has a comparatively elevated black level – an issue Samsung's Glare Free 2.0 tech fixes. <span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption>
<p>The Samsung S95F, which will feature the new Glare Free 2.0 technology, aims to tackle one of the key problems facing OLED TVs: screen reflections from ambient light sources. The latest tech promises improved black levels and shadow detail.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Samsung 2025 TVs feature new-gen 'Glare Free' tech.</li>
  <li>Glare Free 2.0 better retains black depth and shadow detail.</li>
  <li>Will feature in flagship OLED, and 8K and 4K mini-LED TVs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Enhancing black expression” along with rejecting glare is the primary focus of Glare Free 2.0 technology.</blockquote>
<p>This new technology positions Samsung competitively against both established and emerging brands in the OLED market.</p>]]></description>

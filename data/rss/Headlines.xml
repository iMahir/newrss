            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Jagmeet Singh Calls for Trudeau’s Resignation Amid Political Crisis</h1>

<figcaption>Canada’s New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</figcaption>
<p>Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, has joined renewed calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign, citing high living costs and the looming threat of tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
<li>Singh stated, "Today, I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Liberals are fighting themselves when Canadians need a Prime Minister who will fight for them."
<li>Trudeau is facing significant political challenges following the unexpected resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, which has led to a third of the Liberal MPs demanding a leadership change.</li>
<li>Reports indicate that nearly 60 of the 153 Liberal MPs in the House of Commons are rebelling against Trudeau's leadership.</li>
<li>Trudeau is trailing Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre by 20 points in recent polls.</li>
<li>Freeland’s resignation letter referred to a “grave challenge” for Canada, linked to Trump's proposed tariffs on Canadian goods.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today, I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Liberals are fighting themselves – when Canadians need a Prime Minister who will fight for them.” – Jagmeet Singh</blockquote>
<p>This political turmoil comes as Trudeau's government grapples with internal dissent and significant external pressures, which may have lasting implications for Canadian politics.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Published on:</strong> December 16, 2023, <strong>Source:</strong> The Astrophysical Journal</p>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116395242,imgsize-23490,width-400,resizemode-4/116395242.jpg" alt="NASA James Webb Space Telescope" />
<figcaption>Image source: NASA</figcaption>
<p>The recent findings from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope reveal that planets can form and survive in environments that are much harsher than previously believed. This challenges long-held theories about planet formation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>James Webb Telescope findings suggest long-lasting planet-forming disks exist around stars with low heavy elements.</li>
  <li>Planet-forming disks can survive for tens of millions of years, providing ample time for planets to form.</li>
  <li>Research challenges traditional models that argue planets cannot form in metal-poor environments.</li>
  <li>Implications extend to understanding planet formation in the early universe, potentially dating back to shortly after the Big Bang.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This implies that planets could have begun forming at a much earlier stage in the universe’s history than previously thought.” - Guido De Marchi</blockquote>
<p>The discovery revolutionizes our understanding of planet formation and opens new avenues for research in astronomy, particularly regarding the early universe and the origins of our solar system.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Men used bat guano to grow cannabis, leading to fatal infections.</figcaption>
<p>Two men in New York died from a rare fungal lung infection after using bat guano as fertilizer for their cannabis plants. They developed histoplasmosis, a dangerous condition caused by inhaling spores from bat droppings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both men were aged 59 and 64, with pre-existing health conditions.</li>
<li>They experienced symptoms such as fever, cough, significant weight loss, and respiratory failure.</li>
<li>Histoplasmosis is non-communicable between humans or pets.</li>
<li>The use of bat guano as fertilizer carries severe health risks.</li>
<li>5-7% of hospitalized histoplasmosis patients may die from the infection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Their deaths should serve as a warning about the potential dangers of using bat guano as a fertilizer.”</blockquote>
<p>This tragic incident highlights the need for awareness regarding unconventional agricultural practices and their unexpected health impacts.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>HMPV outbreak: Common symptoms seen in kids and adults.</figcaption>
<p>The Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) outbreak is raising global concerns regarding its transmission and symptoms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HMPV is being monitored closely in China and other countries.</li>
  <li>It is prevalent among children aged 14 and under, especially in hospital visits.</li>
  <li>Common symptoms include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.</li>
  <li>Severe cases can lead to bronchitis and pneumonia.</li>
  <li>HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets from infected individuals.</li>
  <li>Good hygiene practices are essential for prevention.</li>
  <li>HMPV is responsible for about 20,000 hospitalizations among children under 5 in the U.S. annually.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Currently, there is no vaccine against HMPV.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, staying informed and practicing hygiene precautions can help mitigate the spread of HMPV.</p>]]></description>

<p>Kareem Badawi, an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Alabama, tragically died in a terrorist attack in New Orleans on New Year’s Eve. His passing has left the Episcopal School community in Baton Rouge mourning the loss of an exceptional young man.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kareem graduated from Episcopal High School and was a beloved member of the football team.</li>

<li>He was in New Orleans to reunite with friends when he was killed in the attack.</li>
<li>Another former classmate, Parker Vidrine, was injured and remains in ICU.</li>
<li>Friends honored him by getting tattoos that read “KB 1-1-2025.”</li>
<li>A memorial was held at the Episcopal School chapel, which overflowed with attendees.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Why innocent people have to suffer, especially a guy like Kareem, who was well-liked, not a hurtful bone in his body. He's a very kind, gentle guy.” - Travis Bourgeois, Kareem’s former football coach</blockquote>
<p>The community's heartbreak following Kareem's death highlights the impact he had on those around him.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The risk for cancers of the breast, the mouth and the throat may rise with consumption of as little as one drink a day, or even less, said Dr Murthy. (File Photo/Representational)</figcaption>
<p>US Surgeon-General Vivek Murthy has called for alcoholic beverages to carry cancer warning labels, highlighting evidence that no level of alcohol consumption is safe when it comes to cancer risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the US, following tobacco and obesity.</li>
  <li>Consumption of just one drink per day can increase the risk for several cancers including breast, mouth, and throat.</li>
  <li>Alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the WHO, with no safe level of consumption.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy's report states alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy draws parallels with India's anti-smoking campaigns as a model for addressing alcohol-related harm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Alcohol has been confirmed as a group 1 carcinogen... there is no safe level of alcohol,” - Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects a growing recognition of the health risks associated with alcohol consumption and aims to reduce the incidence of alcohol-related cancers.</p>]]></description>

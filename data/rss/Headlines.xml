  <li>The patient had contact with sick and dead birds.</li>
  <li>The H5N1 virus was identified with genetic sequencing.</li>
  <li>Current risk to the public is considered low.</li>
  <li>Symptoms of bird flu in humans include high fever, severe coughing, and breathing difficulties.</li>
  <li>Preventive measures include avoiding contact with infected birds and practicing good hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This case highlights that wild birds and backyard flocks, along with commercial poultry and dairy operations, can also be sources of infection.” - CDC</blockquote>
<p>It is essential to follow prevention tips to reduce the risk of infection while remaining vigilant for symptoms.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 20 Dec 2024, 6:23 am</p>
<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="The Moon started out molten and then cooled down, only to be reheated roughly 100 million years later.

<figcaption>The Moon started out molten and then cooled down, only to be reheated roughly 100 million years later. This heating event could have reset most of the ages recorded by lunar rocks. - Francis Nimmo</figcaption>
<p>The study discusses how new perspectives on the Moon's history may change scientists' understanding of its formation. The research explores tidal heating effects and challenges existing estimations concerning the Moon's age.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Moon's formation is linked to a Mars-sized object colliding with Earth.</li>
  <li>Initial Moon rocks suggest the Moon is about 4.35 billion years old, but this may not reflect its actual age.</li>
  <li>The research proposes that tidal heating might reset radiometric clocks in lunar rocks.</li>
  <li>Further analysis and samples from ongoing lunar missions may provide clarity on the Moon's formation timeline.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the Moon warmed up enough, its clocks would lose their memory and would start recording time only once the Moon cooled down again.”</blockquote>
<p>The implications of these findings could reshape our understanding of planetary formation and the early solar system's dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The US Capitol is pictured ahead of a vote on a revised continuing resolution bill in Washington, DC.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The US government faces a shutdown as lawmakers are unable to agree on a temporary funding plan amidst a significant debt ceiling crisis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Republican-led House rejected a temporary funding plan backed by President-elect Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>The bill failed with a vote of 235 to 174, reflecting division among Republicans.</li>
  <li>Trump is demanding a provision to raise the debt limit be included in any funding legislation.</li>
  <li>If the debt ceiling is not raised, it could lead to default and severe economic disruption.</li>
  <li>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson faces pressure as he navigates this critical issue.</li>
  <li>Key figures like Representative Chip Roy and Elon Musk have influenced the debate, voicing strong criticisms of proposed plans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To congratulate yourself because it’s shorter in pages but increases the debt by $5 trillion is asinine." - Representative Chip Roy</blockquote>
<p>As the deadline approaches, the nation awaits a resolution to avert a government shutdown and its possible repercussions.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a major relief for commuters using the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway, the Supreme Court has upheld a decision barring the collection of toll charges, reprimanding the Noida Authority for allowing a toll company to exploit commuters indefinitely.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court confirmed the Allahabad High Court's 2016 ruling against toll collection by the Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd (NTBCL).</li>
  <li>The court found that NTBCL had already recovered the costs and profits since the expressway opened in 2001.</li>
  <li>Justice Kant criticized the Noida Authority for not defining a time frame for toll collection, leading to indefinite charges on users.</li>
  <li>The court validated a public interest litigation filed against NTBCL's toll collection practices.</li>
  <li>Prior to this ruling, commuters were paying ₹28 per trip or ₹56 for round trips.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“NOIDA overstepped its authority by delegating powers to NTBCL to collect or levy fees, resulting in undue burden on users,” - Justice Surya Kant.</blockquote>
<p>The verdict is expected to alleviate the financial burden on thousands of daily commuters, promoting fairness in public infrastructure projects.</p>]]></description>

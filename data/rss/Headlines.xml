<p>An engineering student in Maharashtra's Nagpur allegedly killed his parents over differences regarding his academic record and career, news agency PTI reported. The 25-year-old accused, Utkarsh Dhakhole, killed his parents at their residence in Kapil Nagar area on December 26. He also hid their bodies and told his relatives that his parents had gone to Bengaluru to take part in a meditation programme. Days later, Dhakole's neighbours complained to the police of a foul smell in the neighbourhood, leading to the discovery of the bodies and his arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The victim's parents wanted him to quit engineering due to his poor academic record.</li>
<li>Utkarsh allegedly strangled his mother and stabbed his father to death.</li>
<li>He confessed to the crime during police investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notable Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>“Utkarsh failed to clear several subjects during his engineering course. His parents, therefore, wanted him to quit engineering and choose something else. However, he was against their suggestion,” the official added.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The incident serves as a grim reminder of the pressure students face regarding academic expectations and career choices, often leading to tragic consequences.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, the mother of 26-year-old Suchir Balaji, who was found dead in his San Francisco apartment last month, has rejected the initial suicide ruling. Poornima Ramarao alleges that the second autopsy report indicates a head injury and signs of struggle, suggesting foul play. She urges the Indian government to support their cause and explore 'who and why'.</p>
<p>Suchir's father, Balaji Ramamurthi, recalled his last conversation with his son on December 22, describing him as happy and in good spirits. However, his mother believes that Suchir's work at OpenAI may have gotten him into trouble, with the company allegedly threatening him and suppressing his research. She also mentioned that Suchir was working on personal research and consulting a copyright attorney before his death.</p>
<p>Suchir, a prominent figure in the tech industry, had resigned from OpenAI over ethical concerns and had previously criticized the misuse of copyrighted materials in generative AI. His parents are now demanding a probe by the FBI in connection with his death.</p>

<figcaption>File photo of Gautam Gambhir. © X (formerly Twitter)</figcaption>
<p>India pacer Harshit Rana has publicly defended head coach Gautam Gambhir amid criticism following India's loss in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. As fans and former players expressed their dissatisfaction, Rana emphasized Gambhir's support for players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gautam Gambhir faced backlash after India's 1-3 series loss to Australia.</li>
<li>Harshit Rana backed Gambhir, stating that criticizing him due to personal insecurities is wrong.</li>
<li>Nitish Rana also supported Gambhir, praising his selflessness.</li>
<li>The article discusses India's performance in the ODI series against Sri Lanka and subsequent matches.</li>
<li>Gambhir's coaching tenure faced challenges with significant losses against New Zealand and Australia.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Criticising someone due to personal insecurities is not good. Gauti bhaiya is someone who thinks more for others than himself.” - Harshit Rana</blockquote>
<p>The support for Gambhir highlights the desire for constructive criticism rather than personal attacks, amidst the scrutiny following a challenging series for the Indian cricket team.</p>]]></description>

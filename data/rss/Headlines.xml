<p>The InSight Mars lander has been observed in a new image captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, showing it covered in Martian dust, highlighting dust movement and wind patterns on Mars.</p>
<ul>
<li>The InSight lander landed on Mars in November 2018 and studied the planet's seismic activity and internal structure.</li>
<li>The mission officially ended in December 2022 due to dust accumulation on its solar panels.</li>
<li>NASA's monitoring operations are expected to conclude by the end of 2024.</li>
<li>The recent HiRISE image helps researchers understand the Martian dust cycle and wind dynamics.</li>
<li>Dust accumulation has altered surface features, including the fading of geological marks made by InSight's landing thrusters.</li>
<li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter continues to provide crucial data for current and future Mars missions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The latest image of InSight may mark the lander’s silent legacy, but it continues to contribute to our understanding of the dusty mysteries of Mars.” - NASA</blockquote>
<p>This observation not only preserves the legacy of the InSight lander but also plays a critical role in preparing for future exploration missions on Mars.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Laapataa Ladies is out of the Oscars 2025 race.</figcaption>
<p>The announcement of the 2025 Oscars shortlist has left many disappointed as India's official entry, Laapataa Ladies, directed by Kiran Rao, failed to make the cut. Viewers are expressing their frustration online, blaming the Film Federation of India (FFI) for the omission.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laapataa Ladies was directed by Kiran Rao and selected as India's official entry earlier this year.</li>
<li>Many believed Payal Kapadia's film, All We Imagine As Light, had a better chance of earning a nomination.</li>
<li>The FFI has faced criticism for its selection process and track record at the Oscars.</li>
<li>Following the announcement, the internet is calling for reforms within the FFI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Film Federation of India requires a full revamp. The ones who are there now should step down and let others who understand and know the art of cinema take over.”</blockquote>
<p>With recent failures in selection, many argue that an overhaul of the FFI is necessary for the future of Indian cinema at international awards.</p>]]></description>

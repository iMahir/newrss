            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Gold Outshines Equities in 2024: A Look at the Drivers Behind the Divergence</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 24, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Upstox</p>
<img src="https://assets.upstox.com/content/assets/images/cms/20241224/unnamed.webp" alt="Gold performance chart">
<figcaption>Gold's impressive return compared to equities in 2024.</figcaption>
<p>The year 2024 has seen a stark difference in performance between gold and equities, with gold delivering 20.5% YTD returns while equities produced a modest 8.9% YTD. This article explores the reasons behind these diverging trends.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gold's Safe-Haven Appeal:</strong> Gold acted as a refuge during market uncertainty, resulting in higher demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> Increased consumer demand, particularly in India and China, has supported gold prices.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy Support:</strong> Changes to long-term capital gains tax have made gold investments more attractive.</li>
  <li><strong>Equities Underperform:</strong> Equities faced challenges like earnings slowdowns and inflation issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Market Outlook:</strong> Future performance for both asset classes is influenced by economic and geopolitical factors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“2024 was a year in which gold proved its worth, emerging as one of the top-performing assets amid uncertainty.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, despite gold's outperformance, there is a potential for equities to recover if economic conditions improve. Investors should remain vigilant and consider diversification in their portfolios as the market evolves.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Which infectious disease is likely to be biggest emerging problem in 2025</h1>
<p><strong>Updated: December 26, 2024</strong> | <strong>The Conversation</strong></p>
<img alt="Bird Flu Concern" title="H5N1 Bird Flu" src="https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/wire-updates/pti-preview-theweek.jpg">
<figcaption>Concerns rise over H5N1 bird flu as a potential pandemic threat.</figcaption>
<p>As COVID-19 recedes, health officials are increasingly worried about the potential rise of H5N1 bird flu in 2025, coupled with ongoing issues from malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The top infectious disease threats include malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, which together account for around 2 million deaths annually.</li>
<li>Bird flu (H5N1) is currently a major concern due to recent infections in cattle and the potential for transmission to humans.</li>
<li>61 human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US in 2024, largely among farm workers.</li>
<li>The H5N1 virus has a high mortality rate of 30% in human cases but does not currently spread efficiently between people.</li>
<li>A mutation could allow H5N1 to adapt to humans, raising the risk of a pandemic.</li>
<li>Countries like the UK are preparing by purchasing vaccines against H5N1 in case of an outbreak.</li>
<li>Interconnected health approaches are emphasized to address both animal and human health risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If this strain of bird flu makes that switch and can start transmitting between humans, governments must act quickly to control the spread."</blockquote>
<p>The urgency in addressing bird flu stems from its potential to disrupt animal health and have economic ramifications, highlighting the importance of proactive measures in pandemic preparedness.</p>]]></description>

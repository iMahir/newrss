</figure>
<p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has launched an investigation against certain Indian individuals, entities, and Canadian colleges for allegedly trafficking Indians into the US through Canada. The probe stems from a tragic incident in 2022 involving the deaths of a family from Gujarat while attempting to cross the border illegally.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The investigation targets Bhavesh Ashokbhai Patel and associates accused of human trafficking.</li>
  <li>Individuals were charged between ₹55 and ₹60 lakh for illegal entry into the US.</li>
  <li>Search operations were conducted at eight locations across various Indian cities.</li>
  <li>About 25,000 students are referred annually by one entity for overseas college admissions.</li>
  <li>Over 112 colleges in Canada are implicated in the ongoing investigation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All the accused, in conspiracy with each other, lured the innocent Indian nationals by charging them huge amounts for causing them to illegally enter the USA through Canada,” ED statement.</blockquote>
<p>The ED's investigation underscores the dire circumstances that lure individuals into seeking illegal pathways for migration, emphasizing the need for stringent measures against such trafficking schemes.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Trump Promises to Pursue Executions After Biden Commutes Federal Death Row Sentences</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 25, 2024, <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>
<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sport/tennis/wc69g9/article67781095.ece/alternates/SQUARE_80/Alabama.JPG" alt="" width="100%" height="100%">

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to “vigorously pursue” capital punishment following President Joe Biden’s decision to commute the sentences of most federal death row inmates. Trump criticized Biden's actions as senseless and a disservice to victims' families.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump's statement comes after Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates.</li>
  <li>Biden argued that the commutations align with a moratorium on federal executions, except in specific cases.</li>
  <li>Trump plans to direct the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty for violent offenders after taking office.</li>
  <li>Polling shows mixed support for the death penalty in America, with a noted decline in support over the years.</li>
  <li>Legal experts express skepticism about the feasibility of Trump's intentions under current law.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Joe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,” Trump stated on social media.</blockquote>
<p>In response to Biden's actions, Trump seeks to reinstate and expand the use of the death penalty, potentially affecting cases involving serious crimes such as drug trafficking and murders. The future of capital punishment in federal cases remains uncertain amidst varying public opinions and legal challenges.</p>]]></description>

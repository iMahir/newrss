<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023</p>

<figcaption>Deadly 'Zombie Deer' Disease Could Evolve</figcaption>
<p>Scientists warn that the incurable prion disease known as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), primarily affecting deer, could evolve to infect humans, potentially leading to severe health consequences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The disease has already been reported in feral pigs and could spill over to domestic swine.</li>
  <li>CWD exhibits symptoms similar to dementia in infected animals, such as drooling and aggression.</li>
  <li>Currently found in at least 33 states, including Wyoming and Wisconsin.</li>
  <li>There are concerns about  human exposure through consumption of infected meat.</li>
  <li>The disease is highly contagious among deer and other hoofed animals.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If they can get infected, surely it's possible domestic swine could also become infected? What would that do to the swine market?" - Dr. Michael Osterholm</blockquote>
<p>Experts express urgency for preparedness as the potential spillover of CWD to humans could lead to a health crisis.</p>]]></description>

<p>A global commission has released a report calling for a comprehensive overhaul of how obesity is measured, stating that Body Mass Index (BMI) is inadequate as it does not account for body fat distribution, particularly important for Asian populations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The commission recommends using additional measures, including waist circumference, to assess obesity accurately.</li>
  <li>Two new diagnostic categories introduced: 'clinical obesity' and 'pre-clinical obesity.'</li>
  <li>There is a rising trend of obesity and metabolic issues in India, especially among children and women.</li>
  <li>The new recommendations aim to provide personalized care without stigma for individuals with obesity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By providing a medically coherent framework for disease diagnosis, the commission also aims to settle the ongoing dispute around the idea of obesity as a disease...” - Francesco Rubino, Commission chair, King’s College London</blockquote>
<p>The report emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of obesity, advocating for adequate medical responses and support for affected individuals.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology Commission has introduced a new approach to diagnosing obesity, emphasizing the importance of fat distribution over the traditional BMI method.</p>

<li>The commission suggests combining BMI with additional body measurements, such as waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio.</li>
<li>Direct assessments of body fat, such as DEXA scans, are recommended for more accurate diagnoses.</li>
<li>Two new categories of obesity have been introduced: clinical obesity and pre-clinical obesity.</li>

<li>Current recommendations aim to improve diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of obesity-related health risks.</li>

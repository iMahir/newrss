<figcaption>Image illustrating the effects of stress on heart health</figcaption>
<p>In today's fast-paced world, chronic stress has emerged as a significant health concern, leading to conditions like Broken Heart Disease, which temporarily weakens the heart muscle due to extreme emotional or physical stress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken Heart Disease, medically known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is often mistaken for a heart attack.</li>
<li>This condition is triggered by excessive stress hormones, particularly adrenaline, which can impair heart function.</li>
<li>The symptoms include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeat, usually following an emotionally stressful event.</li>
<li>It primarily affects middle-aged and older women due to hormonal factors.</li>
<li>Recovery is typically quick, but complications can arise if not managed properly.</li>
<li>Good practices to mitigate stress include regular exercise, effective stress management techniques, and professional support.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The heart muscles may become overwhelmed with the excessive amounts of adrenaline that is caused by the high levels of adrenaline in the body.” - Dr. Brajesh Kumar Mishra</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the relationship between emotional health and cardiac function is crucial, especially in a time where stress levels are ever-rising.</p>]]></description>

<p>Puja Khedkar has moved to the Supreme Court after her anticipatory bail was rejected by the Delhi High Court in a case involving allegations of document forgery to secure eligibility for the UPSC exam.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khedkar is accused of forging documents to obtain benefits for the OBC and disability categories for the 2022 UPSC exam.</li>
  <li>The Delhi High Court described the case as a 'glaring example of fraud,' affecting public trust in competitive exams.</li>
  <li>Khedkar claims that she is being targeted after filing a complaint of sexual harassment against her senior and disputes the allegations against her.</li>
  <li>In July, she was banned from future UPSC examinations and denied appointment as a junior government officer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The public's trust in competitive exams and their white credibility would be severely damaged if such charges were proven true.</blockquote>
<p>Puja Khedkar's case highlights the serious implications of fraud in public service exams and raises concerns about the integrity of the selection process.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Deadly 'Zombie Deer' Disease Could Evolve</figcaption>
<p>Scientists warn that the incurable prion disease known as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), primarily affecting deer, could evolve to infect humans, potentially leading to severe health consequences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The disease has already been reported in feral pigs and could spill over to domestic swine.</li>
  <li>CWD exhibits symptoms similar to dementia in infected animals, such as drooling and aggression.</li>
  <li>Currently found in at least 33 states, including Wyoming and Wisconsin.</li>
  <li>There are concerns about  human exposure through consumption of infected meat.</li>
  <li>The disease is highly contagious among deer and other hoofed animals.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If they can get infected, surely it's possible domestic swine could also become infected? What would that do to the swine market?" - Dr. Michael Osterholm</blockquote>
<p>Experts express urgency for preparedness as the potential spillover of CWD to humans could lead to a health crisis.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses how top Indian cricketers, including Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, have not participated in domestic red-ball cricket for several years, impacting the team's performance in international tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Virat Kohli last played in a Ranji Trophy game in 2012, and Rohit Sharma in 2016.</li>
<li>In the past four years, key players have participated in only four long-format domestic matches collectively.</li>
<li>The Indian team recently lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia, marking a major setback.</li>
<li>Former players and officials emphasize the necessity of engaging in domestic cricket to maintain competitive readiness.</li>
<li>There is concern about the decline in the quality of Indian players emerging from the domestic circuit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Without game time in the middle, their game will stagnate…” - A team management member</blockquote>
<p>Experts are calling for changes in the culture of commitment towards domestic cricket, warning that neglecting it could lead to further decline in performance.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2025<br><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/TABLE-1.jpg?resize=600,266" alt="GDP Trends">
<figcaption>Table 1: GDP Trends Analysis</figcaption>
<p>The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released the First Advance Estimates (FAEs) of India’s GDP growth for the financial year 2024-25. These estimates suggest that India's nominal GDP is projected to reach Rs 324 lakh crores, growing 9.7% over the previous financial year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The estimated nominal GDP for FY25 is $3.8 trillion at the exchange rate of 85 rupees to a dollar.</li>
  <li>Real GDP is expected to be Rs 184.9 lakh crores, accounting for 57% of nominal GDP, indicating a growth deceleration.</li>
  <li>Private consumption demand (PFCE) plays a crucial role, contributing almost 60% to GDP.</li>
  <li>Government spending growth has been slow, averaging just 4.2% for the current year.</li>
  <li>Investments have stalled since 2014, leading to reduced productive capacity growth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"When one considers a slightly longer period, it becomes clear that India’s real economy is growing at less than 5% per annum."
</blockquote>
<p>The latest GDP figures serve as a reality check, revealing that while India's growth appears strong, much of this is boosted by a low base effect from the pandemic's economic contraction.</p>]]></description>

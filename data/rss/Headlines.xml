<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2023, <strong>Source:</strong> The Tribune</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and his family received numerous gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, with Jill Biden receiving the most valuable present: a diamond worth $20,000 from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The diamond is a 7.5-carat gem retained for official use.</li>
  <li>Other notable gifts included a $14,063 brooch from the Ukrainian ambassador and a $4,510 set from Egypt's president.</li>
  <li>Federal law mandates declaration of gifts over $480 received by executive officials.</li>
  <li>CIA employees reported destruction of luxury gifts totaling over $132,000.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>‚ÄúMany of the gifts that meet that threshold are relatively modest.‚Äù</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the gifting of expensive items by foreign leaders to the U.S. first family is regulated, yet it sparks significant interest due to the extensive values involved.</p>]]></description>

<p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's entry into content creation has faced challenges as their initial Netflix projects have not achieved significant viewership, prompting concerns from the streaming service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The couple's Netflix projects, including the documentary Polo, have failed to attract an audience.</li>
  <li>They reportedly received a significant amount of money for these projects, raising expectations.</li>
  <li>Harry's passion for Polo has not resonated with viewers, leading to frustration about the project's reception.</li>
  <li>Despite the initial success of their 2022 documentary, their subsequent work has struggled to gain traction.</li>
  <li>Meghan has announced a new cooking and lifestyle show, set to premiere on January 15, which aims to revitalize their Netflix presence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>‚ÄúFact is, Harry and Meghan were paid an exorbitant amount of money by Netflix and have little to show for it. Whether they admit it or not, the pressure is on for the Sussexes to deliver a hit.‚Äù</blockquote>
<p>This latest challenge highlights the pressures faced by Harry and Meghan as they navigate the competitive world of entertainment while trying to regain momentum with their upcoming projects.</p>]]></description>

<img width="639" height="479" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-01/39fv9rno_rishabh-pant-afp_625x300_03_January_25.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" title="India vs Australia LIVE, 5th Test, Day 1: Rishabh Pant Takes Blows To Body, Steers India To 107/4 At Tea vs Aus"><figcaption>Rishabh Pant in action during the 5th Test against Australia.</figcaption></p>
<p>Amid criticism, Rishabh Pant coped several blows to his body, steering India to 107/4 at Tea on Day 1 of the 5th Test against Australia in Sydney. Pant was unbeaten on 32 off 80 balls while Jadeja was batting alongside him on 50.</p>
<ul>
<li>India suffered a significant blow with Virat Kohli's dismissal, caught in the slips.</li>
<li>At the end of the first session, India lost Shubman Gill on the final delivery.</li>
<li>KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal also fell cheaply for India.</li>
<li>Scott Boland emerged as the standout bowler for Australia, taking two wickets.</li>
<li>@Jasprit Bumrah was acting captain in place of @Rohit Sharma who opted out of the match.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>‚ÄúIt's a tough situation for India right now as they have lost key wickets early on.‚Äù</blockquote>
<p>As the day progresses, the focus remains on how Pant and Jadeja can build a stronger partnership to recover the innings.</p>]]></description>

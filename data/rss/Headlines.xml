<ul>
<li>LCA activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), regulating energy use in the body.</li>
<li>The compound has been shown to extend lifespans in fruit flies and a microscopic worm species.</li>
<li>In experiments, LCA extended the average lifespan of worms from 22 to 27 days and increased lifespan in fruit flies.</li>
<li>Researchers aim to explore potential human applications and develop LCA into a pill for various ages and health conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“People have long sought an elixir for longevity. LCA is one possibility... activates AMPK, which in turn further induces metabolite changes in the blood.” - Lin Shengcai, metabolic biologist</blockquote>
<p>Despite promising results, further research is needed to confirm LCA’s effects in humans. The findings represent a significant breakthrough in ageing research and could lead to therapies that not only extend lifespans but also improve the quality of life in later years.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Publication Date Needed] | <strong>Source:</strong> Associated Press</p>
<p>A patient in Louisiana has become the first human in the US to die of bird flu. The Louisiana department of health reported that the patient, over the age of 65 with underlying medical conditions, contracted H5N1 after exposure to birds.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is the first human case in the US linked to exposure to backyard birds.</li>
  <li>A genetic analysis suggested that the virus mutated within the patient, potentially leading to severe illness.</li>
  <li>There are no additional H5N1 cases or evidence of person-to-person transmission identified.</li>
  <li>The current public health risk for the general public is deemed low.</li>
  <li>66 confirmed bird flu infections have been reported in the US since March last year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient’s family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while the public health risk remains low, individuals working with birds or livestock are at a higher risk of exposure to H5N1.</p>]]></description>

<p>The U.S. Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's election victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, allowing him to take office on January 20, 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>The joint session of Congress took place on January 6, 2025, presided over by Vice President Harris.</li>
<li>Mr. Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Ms. Harris’s 226.</li>
<li>No attempts were made by Democrats to block the certification.</li>
<li>Security was heightened around the Capitol during the certification process due to past events.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!" - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>The certification underscores the transition of power amidst heavy security, reflecting lessons learned from previous Capitol events. With Republicans controlling both the White House and Congress, Trump's administration is expected to pursue significant policy changes.</p>]]></description>

<p>Hisense showcases its new large-scale TVs at CES, featuring the 136-inch MicroLED and the 116-inch TriChroma LED TV, aiming to enhance home theater experiences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 136-inch MicroLED 136MX is touted as a consumer-ready MicroLED display but remains high-end and expensive.</li>
  <li>Hisense claims the 136MX represents a significant step towards making cutting-edge display technology more accessible.</li>
  <li>The TV uses over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs for exceptional brightness and quality without the risk of burn-in.</li>
  <li>The new TriChroma LED TV utilizes RGB Local Dimming Technology to achieve a vibrant color spectrum and high brightness levels.</li>
  <li>The TriChroma is reported to cover 97% of the BT.2020 color space, making it superior in color vibrance among Mini LED displays.</li>
  <li>No pricing or release date information is available yet for the TriChroma TV.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The 136MX builds on Hisense’s legacy of display innovation, leveraging a high-density array of over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs to deliver unparalleled brightness, resolution, and precision.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both TVs aim to redefine viewing experiences, but they remain high-end options for most consumers.</p>]]></description>

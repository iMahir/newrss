<p>A severe malaria outbreak in Kwango Province, DRC has resulted in 143 deaths and 592 confirmed cases. Issues surrounding treatment access, drug resistance, and malnutrition complicate the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The outbreak started in late October in the Panzi health zone.</li>
  <li>Case-fatality rate stands at 6.2% with symptoms like fever, headache, and cough.</li>
  <li>Malnutrition and low vaccination rates exacerbate the health crisis.</li>
  <li>Injectable artesunate is the recommended treatment, but access in rural areas is problematic.</li>
  <li>Concerns about artemisinin resistance have been raised in affected children.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If untreated, severe malaria can progress rapidly and lead to death within hours or days."</blockquote>
<p>This outbreak underscores the dire need for improved healthcare infrastructure and access to treatments in rural areas facing malaria.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>CDC Confirms First Severe Bird Flu Case in the US</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 18, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Wired</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the first severe case of avian influenza caused by the H5N1 virus in the United States, marking a concerning shift in the pattern of human infections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The patient, hospitalized in Louisiana, had exposure to sick birds in backyard flocks.</li>
  <li>This case is the first severe illness linked to H5N1 in the US, previously seen only in mild cases.</li>
  <li>Since April, 61 human cases of bird flu were reported in the US, all mild until now.</li>
  <li>The H5N1 virus has significant historical associations with severe illness and high mortality rates in other countries.</li>
  <li>No person-to-person transmission of H5N1 has been detected, and the public health risk remains low.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“While an investigation into the source of this infection in Louisiana is ongoing, it is believed that the patient that was reported by Louisiana had exposure to sick or dead birds on their property.” – Demetre Daskalakis, CDC</blockquote>
<p>Although this case raises concerns, the CDC reassures that the immediate risk to public health is still regarded as low, urging caution for individuals in contact with infected animals.</p>]]></description>

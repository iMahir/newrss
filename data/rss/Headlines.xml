<p>As both the US and China prepare to return humans to the Moon, the US lunar program faces delays, while China is projected to land astronauts by 2030. This article explores the implications of a potential new Moon race and the challenges both nations face.</p>
<ul>
<li>12 Americans landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972.</li>
<li>The US lunar program is behind schedule due to unprepared equipment.</li>
<li>China intends to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, backed by a smooth-running space program.</li>
<li>Nasa's Artemis program aims to land humans on the Moon by 2026, with several milestones including Artemis I and II.</li>
<li>Critics suggest Artemis is overly complicated compared to China’s direct approach.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Rushing back to the Moon could be costly, both financially and in the risk to human life.”</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming Moon missions highlight competitive international space efforts and the importance of responsible exploration principles.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray(PTI file photo)</figcaption>
<p>Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray condemned union minister Amit Shah's remarks about Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, labeling them as 'insolent' and questioned the NDA's response to the controversy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thackeray criticized Shah for saying that taking Ambedkar's name had become fashionable.</li>
<li>He demanded action from Prime Minister Modi against Shah for his comments.</li>
<li>The remarks led to protests by several MPs from the opposition INDIA bloc in Parliament.</li>
<li>Kiren Rijiju, minister for parliamentary affairs, defended Shah, accusing the Congress of insulting Ambedkar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The manner in which Amit Shah spoke in the Parliament yesterday, he displayed insolence... Who are you? Ambedkar ji is a personality not bound by any side." - Uddhav Thackeray</blockquote>
<p>This controversy highlights ongoing tensions between the BJP and opposition parties over representation and respect for historical figures like Dr. Ambedkar.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>HMPV outbreak: How does it spread?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An outbreak of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China has raised global alarm, with several countries, including India, monitoring the situation closely. The article discusses the similarities between HMPV and COVID-19, symptoms, and the absence of a vaccine.</p>
<ul>
<li>HMPV is a common respiratory virus that causes seasonal infections.</li>
<li>It was first discovered in 2001 but evidence suggests it has been around since at least 1958.</li>
<li>HMPV and COVID-19 share similarities: both cause respiratory illness, have similar symptoms, and spread through similar means.</li>
<li>There is currently no vaccine for HMPV, and patients are advised to take precautions to prevent spreading the virus.</li>
<li>Health officials in India reassure the public regarding the outbreak and encourage preventive measures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Dr. Atul Goel stated, "We have analyzed the data of the respiratory outbreaks within the country, there is no such substantial increase in 2024 data.”</blockquote>
<p>The situation requires ongoing monitoring, but the public has been advised that there is no immediate cause for alarm.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>NASA proposes a revised plan to return samples from Mars.</figcaption>
<p>NASA has unveiled a new plan aimed at returning rock and soil samples from Mars in a more cost-effective and timely manner, after previous estimates soared to $11 billion.</p>
<ul>
<li>NASA's Administrator Bill Nelson presented the revised plan, which aims to ensure samples from Mars are returned by the 2030s.</li>
<li>The previous plan was deemed too expensive and projected returns by 2040 or later.</li>
<li>New options are estimated to cost between $6 billion to $7 billion and involve innovative designs by commercial partners.</li>
<li>The mission aims to return 30 titanium tubes containing samples collected by the Perseverance rover.</li>
<li>Both proposed options will clean the sample tubes on Mars before the return journey to Earth.</li>
<li>NASA is considering a traditional landing method with a sky crane or a private company-developed system.</li>
<li>The final decision on the plan will be made after engineering studies are completed next year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We want to return 30 titanium tubes as soon as possible at the cheapest price.” - Bill Nelson</blockquote>
<p>The revised proposals reflect an urgent need to move forward with Mars exploration, emphasizing efficiency in the sample return process while adapting to budget constraints.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>“HMPV not a threat”: Health experts urge caution</figcaption>
<p>Health experts have reported seven cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in India in just two days, but they urge the public not to panic as the virus typically causes mild infections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Five cases were reported recently, primarily affecting infants and toddlers.</li>
  <li>Former AIIMS chief Dr. Randeep Guleria emphasized that HMPV is a common virus that is self-limiting.</li>
  <li>Union Health Minister JP Nadda reassured that health authorities are monitoring the situation closely.</li>
  <li>WHO notes that HMPV is common during winter and spring, with no unusual outbreak patterns reported.</li>
  <li>States are preparing measures to tackle any potential outbreak while advising the public to remain calm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is not a very worrying virus. It is not the one that is prevalent in China.” - Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah</blockquote>

<p>An IED blast in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district resulted in the deaths of eight security personnel, five of whom were former Naxalites who had joined the police force after surrendering. This tragic incident marks a significant attack on security forces by Naxalites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eight security personnel, including five former Naxalites, killed in a Maoist blast.</li>
<li>The attack occurred near Ambeli village on January 6, 2025.</li>
<li>The deceased were part of the District Reserve Guards and Bastar Fighters units.</li>
<li>The incident is noted as the largest strike against security forces by Naxalites in two years.</li>
<li>Last year, 792 Naxalites surrendered in the Bastar region.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is the biggest strike on security forces by Naxalites in Chhattisgarh in the last two years." - Inspector General of Police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P.</blockquote>

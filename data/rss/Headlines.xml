<figcaption>New bird flu vaccine development amidst rising cases</figcaption>
<p>Amid fears of a bird flu pandemic in humans due to the rise in bird flu cases, the federal government is accelerating efforts in developing new vaccines, including mRNA shots, with a $590 million commitment to Moderna.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has intensified bird flu vaccine development.</li>
  <li>An mRNA vaccine is being prioritized for its ability to be developed quickly.</li>
  <li>$590 million has been committed to Moderna for fast-tracking vaccine production, in addition to a previous $176 million investment.</li>
  <li>67 confirmed human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US, with one death.</li>
  <li>Research funding is also being allocated for antivirals and monoclonal antibodies to combat bird flu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Accelerating the development of new vaccines will allow us to stay ahead and ensure that Americans have the tools they need to stay safe.” - HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra</blockquote>
<p>The development of new vaccines for bird flu is critical in ensuring public safety and preventing a potential pandemic, as current vaccines may not be sufficient during a health crisis.</p>]]></description>

<p>The AAP has alleged that Arvind Kejriwal’s car was attacked during an election campaign, claiming the attackers were BJP workers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The AAP released a video showing a group of people waving black flags and throwing stones at Kejriwal's car.</li>
  <li>BJP leader Parvesh Sahib Singh countered that the crowd was attempting to ask questions to Kejriwal, and some youths were injured by his vehicle.</li>
  <li>Police stated that no stones were thrown at the car, and the individuals waving flags were swiftly removed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Supporters of BJP’s New Delhi candidate Parvesh Verma attacked Kejriwal during campaigning in the constituency,” an AAP leader said.</blockquote>
<p>Concluding, this incident highlights the rising tensions and allegations between AAP and BJP amidst a charged political atmosphere.</p>]]></description>

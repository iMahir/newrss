<figcaption>Rohit Sharma could quit Test cricket after the Australia series</figcaption></p>
<p>The discussions surrounding India captain Rohit Sharma's potential retirement from Test cricket have intensified following a significant loss to Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rohit Sharma's performance and emotional state during the recent Test match raise questions about his future in the longest format of the game.</li>
<li>Justin Langer observed Rohit displaying unusual emotions on the field, suggesting that he may be considering retirement.</li>
<li>Langer noted the stress Rohit faces as captain when team performance falters and personal runs are lacking.</li>
<li>Contrastingly, Langer believes Virat Kohli still has years of top-level cricket ahead of him.</li>
<li>Both Langer and Ravi Shastri agree that this could be the end of Rohit's Test career but see a different trajectory for Kohli.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Rohit Sharma looks very tired to me. I saw him quite emotional on the field yesterday. That's unusual for us to see Rohit like that." - Justin Langer</blockquote>

<p>The first full moon of 2025, known as the 'Wolf Moon,' was witnessed by sky-watchers in North America as it briefly blocked Mars during a lunar occultation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The occultation lasted for about an hour, obscuring Mars from view.</li>
<li>This rare celestial event coincided with Mars being the closest to Earth since December 2022.</li>
<li>Mars reached opposition on January 15, making it fully illuminated.</li>
<li>The phenomenon was a visual illusion caused by the moon crossing the ecliptic plane.</li>
<li>Observers noted the relative distances: Mars was 59.7 million miles away while the moon was 224,000 miles distant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Mars appeared fully illuminated and brighter than at any other time since December 2022, despite being outshone by Venus.</blockquote>
<p>The 'Wolf Moon' is traditionally associated with January and has several alternative names, including the Stay Home Moon and Snow Moon, with the next full moon set for February 12, 2025.</p>]]></description>

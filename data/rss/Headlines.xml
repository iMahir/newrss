            <description><![CDATA[<h1>First blood-stage malaria vaccine ‘a much-needed addition’ – analyst</h1>

<img src="https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/12/GettyImages-1236444257-430x241.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption>Malaria is spread by the female Anopheles mosquito. Credit: NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty images.</figcaption>
<p>The RH5.1/Matrix-M blood-stage vaccine could constitute a crucial secondary defence for communities at high risk of malaria infection, including those who have already received pre-erythrocytic vaccines, an analyst has said.</p>
<ul>
<li>The RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccine may be the first blood-stage malaria vaccine brought to market.</li>
<li>The vaccine has shown to be safe, effective, and highly immunogenic in Phase IIb trials.</li>
<li>The trial included 361 children aged 5 to 17 months conducted in Burkina Faso and the UK.</li>
<li>Immunity to malaria wanes over time, making blood-stage vaccines essential as a second line of defence.</li>
<li>The CDC reported around 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 2023, with the majority occurring in Africa.</li>
<li>76% of all malaria deaths in Africa are among children under five.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“RH5.1/Matrix-M has the potential to be the first blood-stage malaria vaccine brought to market. This could be a much-needed addition to the currently available malaria vaccines and provide an important second line of defence for those most at risk of contracting malaria.” – Stephanie Kurdach, GlobalData</blockquote>
<p>The development of this vaccine represents a significant advancement in the fight against malaria, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Stock market highlights as of December 20.</figcaption>
<p>This week, the equity markets experienced a significant downturn, marked by a 5% decline in benchmark indices SENSEX and NIFTY, totaling the largest weekly loss in two years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The NIFTY IT index dropped 4.8% after reaching a lifetime high the previous week.</li>
  <li>BSE-listed companies lost nearly ₹17 lakh crore in market capitalization.</li>
  <li>Despite the downturn, the NIFTY Pharma index saw a modest increase of 1.6%.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The correction was triggered by cautious trading ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy decisions.”</blockquote>
<p>The correction is attributed to investor jitters stemming from the US Federal Reserve's anticipated changes in interest rate policies, leading to a global sell-off.</p>
<p>Analysts suggest a potential pull-back rally in the coming week, anticipating a possible “Santa rally” during the holiday season.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Image Source: Business Line</figcaption>
<p>The Karnataka High Court has granted interim bail to BJP Legislator C T Ravi, following his arrest for allegedly using derogatory language towards Congress Legislator Laxmi Hebbalkar within the State Council at Belagavi.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The High Court ruled that a prima facie case for bail was established.</li>
  <li>Justice M G Uma presided over the bail hearing, highlighting procedural violations by the police.</li>
  <li>Ravi was charged under Sections 75 and 79 of BNS, with potential imprisonment of up to seven years.</li>
  <li>The court noted the incident occurred in the legislative assembly, marking it as unfortunate.</li>
  <li>The police were found to have not adhered to required arrest procedures.</li>
  <li>The court mandated that Ravi remain available to investigators as needed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Even if the allegations made against the petitioner are to be accepted, the offence is punishable by less than 7-years of imprisonment. The police are required to follow procedure as contemplated under BNSS.”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling emphasizes the necessity for adherence to lawful arrest protocols, particularly in cases involving elected officials.</p>]]></description>

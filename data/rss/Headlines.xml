<p>The stock market faced a decline on December 16, 2024, with the Sensex dropping 384.55 points (0.47%) to close at 81,748.57 and the Nifty falling 100.05 points (0.4%) to 24,668.25. This drop occurred amid mixed sector performance and increased market volatility, leading to a cautious investor sentiment ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The India VIX index surged by 7% reflecting heightened uncertainty among investors.</li>
  <li>The realty sector performed well, gaining over 3%, while metal and IT stocks struggled.</li>
  <li>Despite the losses, there were more advances than declines on the BSE, indicating some underlying market strength.</li>
  <li>Key economic indicators showed some optimism with wholesale inflation easing to 1.89% and Composite PMI rising to 60.7.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Analysts recommend a buy-on-dip approach as markets consolidate," reflecting a cautious yet strategic market outlook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the market's performance indicates a complex landscape influenced by global economic factors and investor sentiment.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Publication Date Needed] | <strong>Source:</strong> Associated Press</p>
<p>A patient in Louisiana has become the first human in the US to die of bird flu. The Louisiana department of health reported that the patient, over the age of 65 with underlying medical conditions, contracted H5N1 after exposure to birds.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is the first human case in the US linked to exposure to backyard birds.</li>
  <li>A genetic analysis suggested that the virus mutated within the patient, potentially leading to severe illness.</li>
  <li>There are no additional H5N1 cases or evidence of person-to-person transmission identified.</li>
  <li>The current public health risk for the general public is deemed low.</li>
  <li>66 confirmed bird flu infections have been reported in the US since March last year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient’s family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while the public health risk remains low, individuals working with birds or livestock are at a higher risk of exposure to H5N1.</p>]]></description>

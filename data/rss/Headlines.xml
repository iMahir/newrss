<figcaption>Relations between Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena and Arvind Kejriwal have been strained for a long time now. (File Photo)</figcaption>
<p>Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena has approved the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to prosecute Arvind Kejriwal in a case related to an excise policy scam, a move AAP describes as harassment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ED sought permission to prosecute Kejriwal regarding irregularities in the excise policy for the year 2021-22.</li>
  <li>Several AAP leaders have been jailed amid the ongoing investigation.</li>
  <li>AAP claims the prosecution sanction is a political tool used against them.</li>
  <li>The investigation has led to extensive raids and document filings without any financial recovery.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The so-called liquor scam investigation has dragged on for two years... not a single penny has been recovered,” AAP alleged.</blockquote>
<p>The decision has further intensified the political conflict between the AAP government and the Lieutenant Governor's office, highlighting ongoing tensions in Delhi's governance.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Elon Musk's influence is now being felt far beyond the business world.(REUTERS)</figcaption>
<p>In the midst of the US shutdown crisis, Elon Musk emerged as a significant influencer, wielding considerable power alongside President-elect Donald Trump. The world's richest person played a key role as the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives passed legislation on Friday that would avert a midnight government shutdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The House passed a bipartisan bill by a vote of 366-34 to avoid a government shutdown.</li>
<li>Trump and Musk actively opposed a prior bipartisan funding plan due to controversial provisions.</li>
<li>Musk used social media to influence public opinion and shape policy discussions around the funding bill.</li>
<li>The final package stripped many controversial provisions and would fund the government through March.</li>
<li>Musk's role suggests increasing influence in Washington, particularly as head of the Department of Government Efficiency in Trump's administration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces," Musk wrote on X, signaling his approval of the revised bill.</blockquote>
<p>The government shutdown crisis was narrowly averted, but the power struggle between the White House, Congress, and Musk's influence continues.</p>]]></description>

<p>Ravindra Jadeja expressed that he will deeply miss Ravichandran Ashwin, whom he considers an on-field mentor, after Ashwin announced his retirement during the Test series against Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashwin retires as India’s second-highest wicket-taker in Tests with 537 wickets.</li>
  <li>He and Jadeja took 587 wickets together in 58 Tests, surpassing the Kumble-Harbhajan duo.</li>
  <li>Jadeja praised Ashwin's mentorship and their communication during matches.</li>
  <li>They will reunite in IPL 2025 for Chennai Super Kings.</li>
  <li>Ashwin reflected on his career and significant memories with teammates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level. I do feel there's a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to expose... I've had a lot of fun.” - R Ashwin</blockquote>
<p>Jadeja's sentiments highlight the bond formed between the two over many years, while Ashwin's retirement marks a significant moment in Indian cricket history.</p>]]></description>

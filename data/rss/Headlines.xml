<p>The Indian cricket team is facing a setback as Jasprit Bumrah is unlikely to recover in time for the Champions Trophy due to worsening back spasms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah experienced back spasms during the final Test against Australia.</li>
  <li>His condition was found to be worse than anticipated, with swelling on his back.</li>
  <li>He is currently undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru.</li>
  <li>BCCI has requested an extension for the squad announcement due to Bumrah's injury.</li>
  <li>There is uncertainty whether to include him in the 15-man roster or as a reserve in the UAE.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"He (Bumrah) will be going to NCA for his rehabilitation. The initial report says he doesn't have a fracture but has swelling on his back."</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of Bumrah's recovery is critical, as his absence could significantly affect India's performance in the Champions Trophy, with the semi-finals set to begin shortly after his expected rehabilitation period.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>ISRO SpaDeX Docking Mission Live Updates: SpaDeX satellites hold position at 15m. (@isro/X)</figcaption>
<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully brought its SpaDeX satellites, Chaser and Target, within 3 meters of each other in a recent trial aimed at demonstrating in-space docking technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mission, launched on December 30, aims to showcase in-space docking using small spacecraft.</li>
<li>If successful, India will join the ranks of the US, Russia, and China in mastering significant space docking technologies.</li>
<li>ISRO is being cautious with the docking process, focusing on accuracy over speed due to the mission's complexity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Getting it right is more important than getting it done on schedule.” - ISRO representative</blockquote>
<p>This trial demonstrates significant progress in ISRO's ambition to enhance its space exploration capabilities, including future missions to the Moon and the establishment of a space station by 2035.</p>]]></description>

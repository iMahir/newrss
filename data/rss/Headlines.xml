<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116406313,imgsize-1643339,width-400,resizemode-4/116406313.jpg" alt="How bat poop turned deadly for two men growing marijuana" title="(Image: Canva)" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high">

<p>In a bizarre incident in Rochester, USA, two men died from a lung infection after using bat poop as fertilizer in their marijuana cultivation. The guano, which contains harmful spores, led to a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two men died after inhaling spores from bat poop used to fertilize marijuana.</li>
  <li>The lung infection they suffered from was identified as histoplasmosis.</li>
  <li>The infection is caused by a fungus found in bat and bird feces.</li>
  <li>Despite medical care, neither man survived after developing severe symptoms.</li>
  <li>Histoplasmosis cases have been reported across the United States, particularly in Ohio and Mississippi.</li>
  <li>Improper handling of bat guano poses significant health risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The increase in this rare lung disease seems to align with the rise in popularity of bat guano as a fertilizer among cannabis cultivators."</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, public awareness about the dangers of handling bat guano is limited, leading to tragic outcomes like that of the two men.</p>]]></description>

<p>The ongoing Winter Session of Parliament has seen home minister Amit Shah delivering sharp critiques of the Congress party, accusing them of failing to uphold the Constitution and excessively praising the Nehru-Gandhi family.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shah introduced the bill for “one nation, one election” in the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>Criticism aimed at Congress for their historical amendments to the Constitution.</li>
<li>The BJP continues to advocate for simultaneous elections despite opposition.</li>
<li>Shah remarked that Congress's fixation on the Nehru-Gandhi family undermines their political credibility.</li>

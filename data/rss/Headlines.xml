            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Israel Government Approves Ceasefire Deal with Hamas to End Gaza Conflict</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> January 18, 2025 06:54 AM IST - <strong>Source:</strong> HT News Desk</p>

<figcaption>This handout picture released by the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO) shows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2-R), heading a security cabinet meeting to vote on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal that should take effect on January 19, 2025. (AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In a significant move towards ending the 15-month-long war in Gaza, Israel's government approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which will take effect on January 19, 2025, and includes a series of hostage exchanges.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ceasefire deal will facilitate the release of 33 Israeli hostages by Hamas.</li>
  <li>In exchange, Israel will free all Palestinian women and children under 19 currently in Israeli prisons.</li>
  <li>The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 46,000 casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza.</li>
  <li>Despite challenges, 24 cabinet members supported the deal, with strong opposition from hardline ministers.</li>
  <li>The deal was mediated by Qatar and the US and faced delays due to disputes and last-minute complications.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This agreement raises hopes for a reduction in hostilities.</blockquote>
<p>The approval marks a crucial step towards peace, though challenges remain as the situation in Gaza continues to evolve.</p>]]></description>

</figure>
<p>Over the next few weeks, a stunning parade of planets will glow across the night sky, putting on a celestial spectacle that both amateur and seasoned stargazers can easily observe. All month, four planets — Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars — will appear to line up and be bright enough to see with the naked eye in the first few hours after dark, according to NASA.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Venus and Saturn will appear very close together on Friday and Saturday.</li>
  <li>Mars is at 'opposition' this month, making it appear bigger and brighter.</li>
  <li>Jupiter will shine high overhead during the viewing time.</li>
  <li>Uranus and Neptune can be seen through binoculars or telescopes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"These multi-planet viewing opportunities aren't super rare, but they don't happen every year, so it's worth checking it out," - NASA</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the planetary lineup this January offers a unique opportunity for skywatchers to witness a spectacular celestial event.</p>]]></description>

<h4><strong>About Azaad</strong></h4>
<p>Helmed by Abhishek Kapoor, the film's synopsis mentions a young stable boy bonding with a spirited horse amidst rebellion in 1920s India.</p>

<figcaption>The remarks by the bench came while discharging a bank manager of charge of abetting the suicide of a man who allegedly took his own life after being unable to repay the loan that he had availed from the bank. (Express File/Amit Mehra)</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that invoking abetment of suicide charges must not be done mechanically to comfort the deceased’s family. This judgment emphasizes the necessity of a higher legal threshold before such charges are applied.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The court discharged a bank manager accused of abetting a suicide linked to loan repayment issues.</li>
  <li>It criticized the casual application of Section 306 IPC by police, advocating for stricter adherence to legal standards.</li>
  <li>Justice Viswanathan emphasized genuine cases must not be overlooked while cautioning against procedural abuses.</li>
  <li>The court stated that emotional outbursts should not be interpreted as instigation to suicide.</li>
  <li>The decision sets a precedent for how law enforcement and courts should approach suicides connected to debt disputes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To attract the ingredient of Section 306, the accused should have abetted the commission of a suicide.”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling seeks to prevent the misuse of suicide abetment charges and ensure that only those responsible for instigating suicide face legal consequences.</p>]]></description>

<p>Sanju Samson has been performing exceptionally well in T20 internationals, scoring three centuries in his last five innings. Despite this, he may not be included in India's squad for the Champions Trophy, according to Harbhajan Singh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Samson has a T20I average of 56 and three recent centuries.</li>
<li>His lack of participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy may affect his selection.</li>
<li>Harbhajan Singh believes that performance in one format should be considered for other formats.</li>
<li>Samson's exemplifying performance brings into question the selectors' decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If a person is scoring three centuries in five matches, that means that he is in a zone where he can't be stopped.” - Harbhajan Singh</blockquote>
<p>The discussion around Samson's exclusion raises questions about the criteria utilized for selection, particularly when considering a player's performance in varying formats.</p>]]></description>

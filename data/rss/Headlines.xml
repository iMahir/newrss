<ul>
<li>The Chhattisgarh government provides ₹1,000 every month to married women through the 'Mahtari Vandan Yojana'.</li>
<li>Virendra Joshi allegedly opened the account under Sunny Leone's name and has been receiving money illegally.</li>
<li>Authorities are investigating the case and have frozen the fraudulent account.</li>

<p>The chief ministers of the Telugu states, Chandrababu Naidu and Revanth Reddy, are set to attend the upcoming World Economic Forum Summit in Davos, which begins on January 20. While this may be an opportunity for them to meet, their attendance will be in an individual capacity rather than a bilateral meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both leaders have previously met to discuss post-bifurcation issues.</li>
<li>This will be Naidu’s first trip to Davos during his second tenure as a chief minister.</li>
<li>Revanth Reddy continues the tradition of attending the summit.</li>
<li>Maharashtra's chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will also be at Davos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It has to be seen if they will orchestrate a meeting here to discuss political affairs of Telugu states.”</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming summit presents a significant platform for political discussions among the Telugu CMs, which could influence the region's governance.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44, the highest since August 27.</figcaption>
<p>Oil prices have risen to their highest level in over three months due to new US sanctions targeting Russian oil exports, affecting key importers like China and India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels shipping Russian oil.</li>
  <li>Brent crude futures reached $81.11 a barrel and peaked at $81.44, the highest since August 27.</li>
  <li>US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $77.97 a barrel after a high of $78.32.</li>
  <li>The sanctions aim to cut revenue that funds Russia's war efforts in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44."</blockquote>
<p>This escalation in oil prices highlights the impact of geopolitical tensions and ongoing sanctions on global markets.</p>]]></description>

<p>The upcoming U.S.-India NISAR mission aims to enhance our understanding of Earth’s ongoing changes through advanced satellite technology.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The NISAR mission will launch in a few months, utilizing dual-band radar to observe various Earth features.</li>
  <li>The L-band radar penetrates vegetation for larger features, while the S-band focuses on finer surface details.</li>
  <li>NISAR will monitor glaciers, forests, and wetlands, providing critical data for climate change studies.</li>
  <li>The mission reflects an international partnership between NASA and ISRO, emphasizing global cooperation.</li>
  <li>Data generated by NISAR will be freely accessible, benefitting both scientists and decision-makers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The planet’s surfaces never stop changing – in some ways small and subtle, and in other ways monumental and sudden.” - Paul Rosen, NISAR Project Scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>
<p>The NISAR mission represents a significant step in Earth observation technology, highlighting the importance of global collaboration in tackling environmental challenges.</p>]]></description>

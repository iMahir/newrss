<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 27, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> Congress Party Statement</p>
<p>Following the passing of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge has reached out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the possibility of building a memorial at the site of his last rites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manmohan Singh passed away at the age of 92 due to age-related issues.</li>
<li>He served two terms as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014 under the UPA government.</li>
<li>The last rites are scheduled to take place on December 28, 2024, at Nigambodh Ghat in Delhi.</li>
<li>Kharge emphasized that this request aligns with traditions of memorializing leaders at their funeral sites.</li>
<li>Singh is credited with vital economic reforms that greatly improved India's economic stability.</li>
<li>He had a significant role in ushering in various landmark policies like the NREGS and the RTI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“When the nation was in the throes of grave economic crisis, it was Dr. Manmohan Singh who took India out of the crisis and also led the country towards prosperity.” — Mallikarjun Kharge</blockquote>
<p>This request seeks to honor Singh's legacy as a statesman and a national leader.</p>]]></description>

<p>A crucial moment unfolded when Yashasvi Jaiswal’s run-out sparked a collapse for India, who ended day two of the fourth Test against Australia at 164/5, chasing a first innings score of 474.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaiswal scored 82 runs from 118 balls before his run-out, which triggered a poor performance from Indian batsmen.</li>
<li>Steve Smith scored his 34th Test century, contributing significantly to Australia's score.</li>
<li>India needs 111 more runs to avoid a follow-on, struggling at 310 runs behind.</li>
<li>Jaiswal and Kohli's partnership yielded 102 runs before the unfortunate dismissal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This moment will be one for posterity as Kohli looked down and perhaps felt that he could have at least said a loud ‘No’.”</blockquote>
<p>The day concluded with Australia firmly in control, leaving India with a challenging path ahead in the Test match.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Chinese foreign ministry announced plans for a $137 billion dam on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet, asserting that it will not adversely affect neighboring countries along the river.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The dam is part of a major infrastructure project in the ecologically sensitive Himalayan region.</li>
  <li>China claims it has conducted extensive studies to ensure the project's safety and environmental impact.</li>
  <li>Work on the dam aims to foster international cooperation on disaster prevention and relief.</li>
  <li>Construction will take at least a decade and will connect to the grid further east.</li>
  <li>Concerns have been raised about potential water flow reductions affecting downstream countries, especially India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Everybody downstream is going to be concerned about what it means if water flow is reduced. I know India is very anxious about it.” - David Fishman, energy consulting firm</blockquote>
<p>This ambitious project highlights the complexities of managing international rivers and the geopolitical implications for neighboring nations.</p>]]></description>

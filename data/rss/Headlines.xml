<figcaption>Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44, the highest since August 27.</figcaption>
<p>Oil prices have risen to their highest level in over three months due to new US sanctions targeting Russian oil exports, affecting key importers like China and India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels shipping Russian oil.</li>
  <li>Brent crude futures reached $81.11 a barrel and peaked at $81.44, the highest since August 27.</li>
  <li>US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $77.97 a barrel after a high of $78.32.</li>
  <li>The sanctions aim to cut revenue that funds Russia's war efforts in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44."</blockquote>
<p>This escalation in oil prices highlights the impact of geopolitical tensions and ongoing sanctions on global markets.</p>]]></description>

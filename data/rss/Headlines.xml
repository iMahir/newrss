<figcaption>Sonu Sood’s Fateh sees a significant drop in box office collection.</figcaption>
<p>Sonu Sood's directorial debut, Fateh, has faced a disappointing box office performance, failing to reach even Rs. 1 crore on its fourth day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film opened with Rs. 2.4 crores but has dramatically dropped since then.</li>
  <li>Day 4 collection was only Rs. 85 lakhs, with total earnings so far at Rs. 7.60 crore.</li>
  <li>Despite promotional efforts and a reduced ticket price, the film struggled to attract viewers.</li>
  <li>Fateh is competing against Ram Charan’s Game Changer, which has grossed Rs. 97 crore in the same period.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Sonu Sood’s directorial debut delves deep into the pervasive threat of cybercrime, a modern plague wreaking havoc in India.”</blockquote>
<p>The film's lack of connection in storytelling has impacted its reception, despite strong action sequences and a relevant theme.</p>]]></description>

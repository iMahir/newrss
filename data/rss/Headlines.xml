<p>The tokens for the first three days of the ten-day ‘Vaikunta Dwara Darshan’ at Tirumala Sri Venkateswara temple were exhausted shortly after the counters opened. This surge in demand followed a tragic stampede incident that resulted in the death of six devotees.</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.20 lakh tokens were issued at five additional centers in Tirupati for the Vaikunta Ekadasi event.</li>
  <li>The distribution began earlier than scheduled due to crowd control after the stampede.</li>
  <li>The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) plans to reopen token counters on January 12 for subsequent darshan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Normalcy returned after the stampede and 1.20 lakh tokens were exhausted within a few hours.”</blockquote>
<p>The event highlights ongoing challenges in managing large crowds at significant religious gatherings.</p>]]></description>

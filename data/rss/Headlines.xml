<figcaption>Dr SK Sarin, Director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences at Agenda Aaj Tak event.</figcaption>
<p>Liver specialist Dr SK Sarin emphasized that popular weight-loss medications should only be used under strict medical supervision, warning that these drugs are primarily beneficial for the wealthy due to their high costs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dr Sarin advocates for healthier lifestyle choices over reliance on medications for weight loss.</li>
    <li>Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic (semaglutide) enhance metabolic processes but can lead to side effects.</li>
    <li>Dr Sarin believes exercise and an active lifestyle remain the best methods for weight management.</li>
    <li>Increased calorie intake can lead to serious health complications such as fatty liver disease.</li>
    <li>Weight-loss drugs may have significant side effects, including gastrointestinal issues and rapid weight regains.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The best method for most people is still to exercise, burn calories, and lead an active lifestyle.” - Dr SK Sarin</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These drugs are not a magic solution. Once you stop taking them, weight gain often resumes rapidly.” - Dr Naresh Trehan</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, both doctors underline the importance of sustainable lifestyle changes, as opposed to solely relying on weight-loss drugs which come with potential risks and complications.</p>]]></description>

<p>NASA has made significant discoveries regarding Io, the most volcanically active body in our solar system, providing answers to longstanding questions about its volcanic activity.</p>

<ul>
    <li>NASA's Juno mission revealed that Io’s volcanoes are powered by individual magma chambers, not a global magma ocean.</li>
    <li>The findings end a 44-year-old mystery regarding the intense geological activity of Io.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate that Io's volcanic activity is influenced by its unique orbit around Jupiter, causing heat through gravitational interactions.</li>
    <li>New high-resolution images show volcanic features and fresh lava flows on Io's surface.</li>
    <li>Juno completed its 66th flyby over Jupiter and is scheduled for its next close approach in late December 2024.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“Not very demure at all. But Jupiter's moon Io is still beautiful, constantly erupting volcanoes and all.” – NASA Solar System</blockquote>

<p>NASA continues to enhance our understanding of volcanic processes beyond Earth, contributing to broader knowledge of planetary geology.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a recent Parliament debate, Rahul Gandhi emphasized the importance of social justice, invoking Eklavya from the Mahabharata to criticize the Modi government's policies affecting marginalized communities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gandhi addressed a debate on the Constitution's 75-year journey, focusing on social justice and equitable representation.</li>
    <li>He criticized Hindutva ideologue Savarkar's views on the Constitution, quoting him on Manusmriti's relevance to Indian culture.</li>
    <li>Gandhi used Eklavya’s story to illustrate how the government is stifling the potential of marginalized youth.</li>
    <li>He called for a nationwide caste census and the removal of the 50% quota ceiling.</li>
    <li>The Congress leader linked current government favoritism to the hardships faced by disadvantaged groups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Like Dronacharya cut the thumb of Eklavya, you are cutting the thumbs of India’s youngsters."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rahul Gandhi's speech highlights the ongoing struggle for social justice in India, calling attention to systemic inequalities and advocating for reforms to empower marginalized communities.]]></description>

<figcaption>J&amp;K chief minister Omar Abdullah (File photo/ANI)</figcaption>
<p>Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the dual governance model in Jammu and Kashmir, describing it as a "recipe for disaster," and called for the restoration of statehood in the region.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah expressed cautious optimism regarding the central government's commitment to restore statehood, citing previous promises from Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah.</li>
    <li>He emphasized that having multiple power centres leads to inefficiency, using sports leadership as an analogy.</li>
    <li>Abdullah highlighted the lack of benefits from Union Territory status since taking office and criticized the idea of dual governance, referencing Delhi's arrangement.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court has ordered assembly elections by September and called for statehood restoration "at the earliest" by December 2023.</li>
    <li>He mentioned plans for a backup strategy if statehood isn't restored but chose not to disclose details.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "Let me just say this, having two power centres anywhere is a recipe for disaster... No organisation works well if there are multiple power centres." – Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Abdullah’s remarks reflect a strong stance against the current governance structure in Jammu and Kashmir, insisting on the need for restoring its statehood to ensure effective administration and representation.]]></description>

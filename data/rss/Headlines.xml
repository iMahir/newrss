<figcaption>BCCI Takes Shock U-Turn On KL Rahul Selection In India Squad For England ODIs: Report © BCCI/Sportzpics</figcaption>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reversed its decision regarding KL Rahul's participation in the upcoming ODI series against England. Initially resting him, the board has now requested his availability as they aim to provide him with match practice ahead of the Champions Trophy in February.</p>
<ul>
    <li>BCCI had initially agreed to KL Rahul's break from the ODI assignment.</li>
    <li>Recent developments show the board now wants him available for selection.</li>
    <li>Rahul's performance in the Test series in Australia was notable, being the third-highest run-getter for India.</li>
    <li>Competition for the wicketkeeper batter's slot includes Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson.</li>
    <li>The board is seeking an extension from the ICC for the Champions Trophy squad announcement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The selectors initially decided to rest Rahul… However, they had a rethink and the BCCI has now asked him to play…”</blockquote>
<p>This change signifies the BCCI's emphasis on Rahul's performance potential and readiness for future tournaments, demonstrating a dynamic approach to player management.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fateh Review: The No-Nonsense, Unabashed And Ultra-Violent Film Is Surprisingly Watchable</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>An ex-special ops agent embarks on a violent rampage to take down cyber criminals behind a fraudulent loan operation. Actor Sonu Sood makes his writing and directing debut with a film that is unapologetically violent and dynamic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film opens with an intense confrontation where the protagonist, Fateh Singh, takes control by resorting to extreme violence.</li>
  <li>Fateh utilizes a variety of weapons in his mission against a network of cyber criminals, showcasing high body counts reminiscent of other action-packed films.</li>
  <li>The narrative includes a social purpose, focusing on the impact of a scam targeting financially vulnerable individuals.</li>
  <li>Despite the relentless violence, the film offers minimal mystery as the antagonist's identity is revealed early on.</li>
  <li>Sonu Sood's performance resonates with the film's gritty tone, although other characters struggle to stand out in the chaos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Fateh is marked by dizzying momentum if not sustained clarity.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while <em>Fateh</em> may be overwhelming with its sheer brutality, it remains a captivating watch for those who appreciate action-packed narratives.</p>]]></description>

<p>The announcement for the Champions Trophy squad is set for January 12, ahead of the tournament starting on February 19, 2024. This article discusses the uncertain status of star players like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, who is eyeing a return after a lengthy absence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Champions Trophy starts on February 19, 2024, with India's first match on February 20.</li>
  <li>Mohammed Shami, absent for 417 days since November 19, 2023, is expected to return after ankle surgery and complications.</li>
  <li>Shami's fitness is being monitored by the BCCI, with a clearance required from the NCA.</li>
  <li>Jasprit Bumrah's participation is uncertain due to a back injury sustained during the fifth Test against Australia.</li>
  <li>Michael Clarke praised Bumrah as possibly the greatest all-format fast bowler ever.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I know a lot of great fast bowlers, Curtly Ambrose, Glenn McGrath, didn't get to play T20 cricket, so I'm not talking about those guys, but in regards to anyone who has played all three formats, I think he might be the best ever." - Michael Clarke</blockquote>
<p>This discussion highlights the potential make-up of India's squad for the prestigious tournament, emphasizing the importance of player fitness and selections.</p>]]></description>

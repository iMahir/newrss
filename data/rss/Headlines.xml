<p>Hisense showcases its new large-scale TVs at CES, featuring the 136-inch MicroLED and the 116-inch TriChroma LED TV, aiming to enhance home theater experiences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 136-inch MicroLED 136MX is touted as a consumer-ready MicroLED display but remains high-end and expensive.</li>
  <li>Hisense claims the 136MX represents a significant step towards making cutting-edge display technology more accessible.</li>
  <li>The TV uses over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs for exceptional brightness and quality without the risk of burn-in.</li>
  <li>The new TriChroma LED TV utilizes RGB Local Dimming Technology to achieve a vibrant color spectrum and high brightness levels.</li>
  <li>The TriChroma is reported to cover 97% of the BT.2020 color space, making it superior in color vibrance among Mini LED displays.</li>
  <li>No pricing or release date information is available yet for the TriChroma TV.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The 136MX builds on Hisense’s legacy of display innovation, leveraging a high-density array of over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs to deliver unparalleled brightness, resolution, and precision.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both TVs aim to redefine viewing experiences, but they remain high-end options for most consumers.</p>]]></description>

<p>Google has unveiled a new ambient mode for Google TV devices that allows them to detect when a person enters a room and display relevant information like news and weather without any input from the user.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new feature was demonstrated at CES 2025.</li>
  <li>The TVs will use radar-like technology to sense motion instead of cameras, prioritizing privacy and cost.</li>
  <li>Existing presence detection features offered by competitors like Amazon and Sony are noted.</li>
  <li>Google aims to make its TVs more of a living room hub, enhanced by AI upgrades with Gemini models.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Our vision is that this can be something so much more," - Jamieson Brettle, Google product manager.</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming Google TV products that support this feature are expected to launch later this year.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh</figcaption>
<p>Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh questioned the team’s decline following Rahul Dravid's tenure as head coach. India recently lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia by a score of 1-3, marking a significant downturn since Dravid's departure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India celebrated success under Dravid, winning the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.</li>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir took over as head coach but has seen disappointing results since.</li>
  <li>India lost their ODI series against Sri Lanka (0-2) and struggled in Test series against New Zealand (0-3).</li>
  <li>Harbhajan Singh advocates for selecting players based on current form, criticizing reliance on past reputations.</li>
  <li>Notable struggles from key players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in recent series.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“In the past six months, we lost to Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia. Everything was fine till Rahul Dravid was our coach. We won the T20 World Cup and everything was looking good.”</blockquote>
<p>The commentary from Harbhajan highlights the urgency for the selectors to move away from a “superstar culture” and focus on deserving players.</p>]]></description>

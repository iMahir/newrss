            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why Modi govt 3.0 is maintaining an arm’s length from protesting farmers</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has indicated a distant approach from the ongoing farmers' protests led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, unlike the proactive measures taken during Modi's previous term.</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers have been protesting since February 2024 at the Punjab-Haryana borders, demanding legal status for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and a farm debt waiver.</li>
<li>Chouhan has extended an open invitation for talks, yet has not engaged directly with the protesting farmers.</li>
<li>The government's previous attempts to resolve farmer grievances, particularly in 2020-21, led to escalated tensions and prolonged protests.</li>
<li>Current protests are more localized and lack the broad unity seen in earlier movements.</li>
<li>Jagjit Singh Dallewal, president of BKU Sidhupur, is on a hunger strike demanding response to farmers' issues from the government.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Currently, the Supreme Court is looking into this issue. Whatever directives the Supreme Court gives, will be followed.” - Shivraj Singh Chouhan</blockquote>
<p>This current strategy marks a significant shift in the government's handling of farmer-related issues, emphasizing a more detached stance in contrast to previous direct engagements.</p>]]></description>

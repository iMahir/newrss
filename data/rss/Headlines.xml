<figcaption>Trump did not specify whether the new agency would replace collections of tariffs, duties, fees and fines by US Customs and Border Protection.(AP)</figcaption>
<p>US President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to create a new government agency called the External Revenue Service on January 20, coinciding with his second inauguration. This agency will focus on collecting tariffs and duties from foreign sources as part of a broader strategy to implement new import tariffs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump aims to shift revenue collection from the IRS to the new department.</li>
  <li>He criticized existing trade agreements for burdening American taxpayers.</li>
  <li>The proposal includes tariffs of 10% on global imports and higher tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.</li>
  <li>Economic forecasts predict significant revenue generation from the proposed tariffs, but potential adverse effects on the economy.</li>
  <li>Senator Ron Wyden condemned Trump's plan as a tax increase on families and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects Trump's ongoing commitment to reshape U.S. trade policy and revenue structure as he resumes presidential duties.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Image illustrating the effects of stress on heart health</figcaption>
<p>In today's fast-paced world, chronic stress has emerged as a significant health concern, leading to conditions like Broken Heart Disease, which temporarily weakens the heart muscle due to extreme emotional or physical stress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken Heart Disease, medically known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is often mistaken for a heart attack.</li>
<li>This condition is triggered by excessive stress hormones, particularly adrenaline, which can impair heart function.</li>
<li>The symptoms include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeat, usually following an emotionally stressful event.</li>
<li>It primarily affects middle-aged and older women due to hormonal factors.</li>
<li>Recovery is typically quick, but complications can arise if not managed properly.</li>
<li>Good practices to mitigate stress include regular exercise, effective stress management techniques, and professional support.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The heart muscles may become overwhelmed with the excessive amounts of adrenaline that is caused by the high levels of adrenaline in the body.” - Dr. Brajesh Kumar Mishra</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the relationship between emotional health and cardiac function is crucial, especially in a time where stress levels are ever-rising.</p>]]></description>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to create a new government agency called the External Revenue Service on January 20, coinciding with his second inauguration. This agency will focus on collecting tariffs and duties from foreign sources as part of a broader strategy to implement new import tariffs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump aims to shift revenue collection from the IRS to the new department.</li>
  <li>He criticized existing trade agreements for burdening American taxpayers.</li>
  <li>The proposal includes tariffs of 10% on global imports and higher tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.</li>
  <li>Economic forecasts predict significant revenue generation from the proposed tariffs, but potential adverse effects on the economy.</li>
  <li>Senator Ron Wyden condemned Trump's plan as a tax increase on families and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects Trump's ongoing commitment to reshape U.S. trade policy and revenue structure as he resumes presidential duties.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Broken Heart Disease: How Heightened Stress Levels Can Weaken Heart Muscles</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117245007,imgsize-1318143,width-400,resizemode-4/117245007.jpg" alt="Broken Heart Disease: How heightened stress-levels can weaken heart muscles" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high">
<figcaption>Image illustrating the effects of stress on heart health</figcaption>
<p>In today's fast-paced world, chronic stress has emerged as a significant health concern, leading to conditions like Broken Heart Disease, which temporarily weakens the heart muscle due to extreme emotional or physical stress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken Heart Disease, medically known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is often mistaken for a heart attack.</li>
<li>This condition is triggered by excessive stress hormones, particularly adrenaline, which can impair heart function.</li>
<li>The symptoms include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeat, usually following an emotionally stressful event.</li>
<li>It primarily affects middle-aged and older women due to hormonal factors.</li>
<li>Recovery is typically quick, but complications can arise if not managed properly.</li>
<li>Good practices to mitigate stress include regular exercise, effective stress management techniques, and professional support.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The heart muscles may become overwhelmed with the excessive amounts of adrenaline that is caused by the high levels of adrenaline in the body.” - Dr. Brajesh Kumar Mishra</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the relationship between emotional health and cardiac function is crucial, especially in a time where stress levels are ever-rising.</p>]]></description>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar assured the Indian diaspora in Spain that the government is committed to addressing farmers' issues through discussions in cabinet and parliament.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jaishankar emphasized the complexity of farmers' issues and the government's commitment to tackle them.</li>
  <li>The increase in minimum support prices (MSP) reflects the government's support for farmers.</li>
  <li>He highlighted the need for a focused approach amidst politicization of the issue.</li>
  <li>Farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal continues his hunger strike, urging the government to fulfill promises from the 2021 farmers' protests.</li>

<blockquote>“Regarding the issue of farmers... this is a complex topic. The issues involved are not simple. From the government's side, I can assure you that we discuss how to help these people in the cabinet and parliament.”</blockquote>
<p>Jaishankar's reassurances come at a time of increasing urgency as Dallewal's health deteriorates during his fast-unto-death protest.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>IAS trainee Pooja Khedkar approached SC</figcaption>
<p>Puja Khedkar has moved to the Supreme Court after her anticipatory bail was rejected by the Delhi High Court in a case involving allegations of document forgery to secure eligibility for the UPSC exam.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khedkar is accused of forging documents to obtain benefits for the OBC and disability categories for the 2022 UPSC exam.</li>
  <li>The Delhi High Court described the case as a 'glaring example of fraud,' affecting public trust in competitive exams.</li>
  <li>Khedkar claims that she is being targeted after filing a complaint of sexual harassment against her senior and disputes the allegations against her.</li>
  <li>In July, she was banned from future UPSC examinations and denied appointment as a junior government officer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The public's trust in competitive exams and their white credibility would be severely damaged if such charges were proven true.</blockquote>
<p>Puja Khedkar's case highlights the serious implications of fraud in public service exams and raises concerns about the integrity of the selection process.</p>]]></description>

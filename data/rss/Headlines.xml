            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fateh Review: The No-Nonsense, Unabashed And Ultra-Violent Film Is Surprisingly Watchable</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>An ex-special ops agent embarks on a violent rampage to take down cyber criminals behind a fraudulent loan operation. Actor Sonu Sood makes his writing and directing debut with a film that is unapologetically violent and dynamic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film opens with an intense confrontation where the protagonist, Fateh Singh, takes control by resorting to extreme violence.</li>
  <li>Fateh utilizes a variety of weapons in his mission against a network of cyber criminals, showcasing high body counts reminiscent of other action-packed films.</li>
  <li>The narrative includes a social purpose, focusing on the impact of a scam targeting financially vulnerable individuals.</li>
  <li>Despite the relentless violence, the film offers minimal mystery as the antagonist's identity is revealed early on.</li>
  <li>Sonu Sood's performance resonates with the film's gritty tone, although other characters struggle to stand out in the chaos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Fateh is marked by dizzying momentum if not sustained clarity.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while <em>Fateh</em> may be overwhelming with its sheer brutality, it remains a captivating watch for those who appreciate action-packed narratives.</p>]]></description>

<p>At least 11 people have died and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed in massive fires in the Los Angeles area, with investigators looking into possible ignition sources.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Investigators are examining multiple potential causes for the fires, having ruled out lightning.</li>
    <li>Prominent figures such as Hollywood stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Billy Crystal have lost their homes in the blaze.</li>
    <li>Utility line sparks and intentional fires are also being considered as possible sources of ignition.</li>
    <li>Southern California Edison has reported findings to regulators concerning the Eaton Fire.</li>
    <li>The 2017 Thomas Fire serves as a historical reference for similar incidents caused by utility lines.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It’s going to go out when it runs out of fuel, or when the weather stops,” said John Lentini, owner of Scientific Fire Analysis.</blockquote>
<p>The situation remains critical, with the fires continuing to spread and further investigations underway to determine the exact causes.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India's captain Rohit Sharma with teammates Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja</figcaption>
<p>The BCCI has requested an extension from the ICC for announcing India's squad for the Champions Trophy, which was initially scheduled for January 12, in order to finalize their selection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The announcement delay stems from the BCCI's request for more time to finalize the squad.</li>
<li>Teams were expected to name provisional squads five weeks before the tournament, but the BCCI is citing recent commitments in Australia.</li>
<li>The new date for announcing the squad is likely January 19, one month before the tournament starts.</li>
<li>The provisional squad is expected to see mostly the same players as those in the ODI series against England.</li>
<li>India's T20I squad against England is also expected to be announced shortly.</li>
<li>A review meeting will involve BCCI officials, captain Rohit Sharma, and coach Gautam Gambhir.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The BCCI aims to finalize the squad while addressing recent performance issues after a disappointing series against Australia.</blockquote>
<p>The BCCI's careful planning aims to ensure that the squad is well-prepared following recent overseas matches, indicating a strategic approach to the upcoming Champions Trophy.</p>]]></description>

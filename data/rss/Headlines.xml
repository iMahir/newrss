<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has been spotted in leaked images, showcasing a familiar design ahead of its rumored launch event.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaked images show a rounded design similar to previous models like the Galaxy S24 and iPhone 16 Plus.</li>

<li>New features may include a wider display and the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset for improved performance.</li>
<li>Camera features are still partly hidden, but it's expected the Plus won't have the significant lens changes seen in the Ultra model.</li>

<blockquote>"With the rounded corners, the S25 Plus appears to be very similar to the iPhone 16 Plus."</blockquote>
<p>The S25 Plus is set to attract attention due to these recent leaks as users await official confirmation from Samsung.</p>]]></description>

<p>Two bills enabling simultaneous elections were introduced in the Lok Sabha after a heated debate, with 269 votes in favor and 198 against.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 were formally introduced.</li>
<li>The bills propose 'One Nation, One Election', or simultaneous elections to both Lok Sabha and state assemblies.</li>
<li>The government insists the bills are not an attack on federalism, as claimed by the opposition.</li>
<li>The measure now goes to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for further discussion.</li>
<li>The electronic voting system was used in the Lok Sabha for the first time in the new Parliament House.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The essential features are federalism and the structure of our democracy.” - Manish Tewari, Congress MP</blockquote>

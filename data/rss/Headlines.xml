<figcaption>Representational image.</figcaption>
<p>The recent outbreak of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in northern China has sparked concerns about a potential pandemic; however, a health official reports declining rates of infection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The human metapneumovirus, known for causing flu-like symptoms, is not new and has been present for decades.</li>
  <li>Infections have been rising, but improvements in detection methods have contributed to increased reported cases.</li>
  <li>Reports indicate that the rate of positive HMPV cases is declining, particularly among children aged 14 and below.</li>
  <li>Concerns about the outbreak intensified after images of overwhelmed hospitals circulated in media.</li>
  <li>Experts assert that HMPV differs from COVID-19 in that most people develop some immunity to the virus over time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The human metapneumovirus is not a new virus, and has been with humans for at least several decades.” - Wang Liping</blockquote>
<p>As of now, there are no vaccines or specific treatments for HMPV. Experts recommend preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus.</p>]]></description>

<p>The tragic Jeju Air flight 7C2216 crash has raised significant questions regarding the actual cause, with experts disputing the likelihood of a bird strike leading to the aircraft's malfunction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The plane was landing at Muan International Airport when it crashed, resulting in the death of 179 people.</li>
<li>Experts argue that a bird strike could not have solely caused the malfunctioning of the landing gear.</li>
<li>Survivors of the crash are stable and conscious but the majority of passengers have not been identified.</li>
<li>The South Korean government declared a period of national mourning following the incident.</li>

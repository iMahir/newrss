<p>The tabla fell silent as Ustad Zakir Hussain, one of the greatest ambassadors of Indian classical music, passed away on December 16, 2024, after a brief illness in San Francisco, California. He transformed the modest tabla into a voice for universal peace and humanity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hussain was renowned for his speed, dexterity, and creativity, mesmerizing audiences worldwide.</li>
<li>He played a crucial role in popularizing the tabla on a global scale.</li>
<li>A child prodigy, he gave his first professional performance at the age of 12.</li>
<li>Among his notable achievements are three Grammy Awards received in one night.</li>
<li>Hussain blended musical traditions, collaborating with artists across various genres and cultures.</li>
<li>He was also an actor, famously appearing in commercials that brought classical music into mainstream culture.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I haven’t played good enough to quit.”</blockquote>
<p>Ustad Zakir Hussain’s legacy will continue to inspire future generations of musicians and audiences as a testament to the power of music.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India can't see ‘One Nation, One Election’ before 2034. Here’s what Modi govt is proposing</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date] <strong>Source:</strong> ThePrint</p>
<p>The BJP-led NDA government is set to introduce two significant bills aimed at achieving simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and state assemblies. This move represents a critical step towards fulfilling a major electoral promise by the ruling party.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment Bill) and the Union Territories Law (Amendment) Bill are expected to be introduced in Lok Sabha soon.</li>
  <li>These bills propose amendments to existing articles in the Constitution, enabling simultaneous elections.</li>
  <li>The anticipated implementation date for 'One Nation, One Election' is projected to be 2034.</li>
  <li>The bills will not require ratification by half of the state assemblies due to their constitutionality.</li>
  <li>The government asserts that simultaneous elections will save costs and reduce disruptions caused by prolonged electoral cycles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The ECI has pegged the cost of holding simultaneous elections at Rs 4,500 crore.</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of these bills is part of a broader effort to streamline election processes across India, though the timeline for actual implementation remains several years away.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rockland County Executive Ed Day has expressed his frustration regarding unidentified drone sightings in New Jersey and New York, demanding clarity from federal authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Day has written to President Biden asking for an investigation by the FAA and FBI.</li>
<li>Drones have been spotted in the region since mid-November, causing concern among residents.</li>
<li>The Federal government has stated they cannot verify over 3,000 reports of these drones.</li>
<li>Day criticized the federal response as “completely unacceptable”.</li>
<li>Former President Trump suggested that the government is withholding information about the drone sightings.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable—not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Ed Day said.</blockquote>

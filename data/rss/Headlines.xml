<p>After a disappointing loss against Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy, the BCCI will review the performance of senior players Kohli and Sharma, but they will remain in contention for upcoming series.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India lost 1-3 against Australia, raising questions on players' performances.</li>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir, head coach, and his staff will not be blamed for the defeat.</li>
  <li>A review meeting is planned, but no dismissals are anticipated.</li>
  <li>Kohli and Rohit, influential players, will continue to be considered for the Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>Gambhir expresses confidence in Kohli and Rohit to overcome their recent struggles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They still have hunger and passion, they are tough people. Hopefully, they can continue to take Indian cricket forward,” said Gambhir.</blockquote>
<p>Despite past successes, India's recent struggles in Test cricket have prompted this review, with attention now turning to the forthcoming matches against England and the Champions Trophy.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Las Vegas police reported that Matthew Livelsberger, a decorated Army soldier, used generative AI tools like ChatGPT to assist in planning the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel. He fatally shot himself shortly before the explosion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Livelsberger had looked for information about explosive targets and the legality of fireworks.</li>
<li>The Cybertruck contained 60 pounds of pyrotechnic material and racing-grade fuel.</li>
<li>The explosion resulted in minor injuries to seven individuals, but minimal damage to the hotel.</li>
<li>Livelsberger left notes citing political grievances and a desire for a “wake up call” regarding national issues.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first incident that I’m aware of on US soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,” said Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</blockquote>
<p>This incident raises concerns about the use of generative AI in planning dangerous acts, as multiple government agencies continue to investigate the implications.</p>]]></description>

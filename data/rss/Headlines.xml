<figcaption>Prapti Upadhayay is a New Delhi-based journalist who reports on key news developments across India and global affairs, with a special focus on US politics.</figcaption>
<p>Donald Trump has made his intentions clear regarding a possible government shutdown, insisting that it should occur under President Joe Biden’s administration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump stated that government shutdowns should start now under Biden, labeling it a problem for Biden to address.</li>
  <li>House Republicans are preparing to pass a bill to prevent a shutdown, which requires only a simple majority.</li>
  <li>Elon Musk has faced criticism from Democrats regarding his influence in the Republican Party and his opposition to a bipartisan spending bill.</li>
  <li>Karoline Leavitt mentioned Trump's leading role in shaping Republican views on the continuing resolution.</li>
  <li>Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Musk's intervention in budget negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now, under the Biden Administration, not after January 20th, under ‘TRUMP.’ This is a Biden problem to solve.” – Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This ongoing debate highlights the deepening partisan divide in U.S. politics, with significant implications for government funding and bipartisan relations.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Malaria is spread by the female Anopheles mosquito. Credit: NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty images.</figcaption>
<p>The RH5.1/Matrix-M blood-stage vaccine could constitute a crucial secondary defence for communities at high risk of malaria infection, including those who have already received pre-erythrocytic vaccines, an analyst has said.</p>
<ul>
<li>The RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccine may be the first blood-stage malaria vaccine brought to market.</li>
<li>The vaccine has shown to be safe, effective, and highly immunogenic in Phase IIb trials.</li>
<li>The trial included 361 children aged 5 to 17 months conducted in Burkina Faso and the UK.</li>
<li>Immunity to malaria wanes over time, making blood-stage vaccines essential as a second line of defence.</li>
<li>The CDC reported around 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 2023, with the majority occurring in Africa.</li>
<li>76% of all malaria deaths in Africa are among children under five.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“RH5.1/Matrix-M has the potential to be the first blood-stage malaria vaccine brought to market. This could be a much-needed addition to the currently available malaria vaccines and provide an important second line of defence for those most at risk of contracting malaria.” – Stephanie Kurdach, GlobalData</blockquote>
<p>The development of this vaccine represents a significant advancement in the fight against malaria, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Stock market highlights as of December 20.</figcaption>
<p>This week, the equity markets experienced a significant downturn, marked by a 5% decline in benchmark indices SENSEX and NIFTY, totaling the largest weekly loss in two years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The NIFTY IT index dropped 4.8% after reaching a lifetime high the previous week.</li>
  <li>BSE-listed companies lost nearly ₹17 lakh crore in market capitalization.</li>
  <li>Despite the downturn, the NIFTY Pharma index saw a modest increase of 1.6%.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The correction was triggered by cautious trading ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy decisions.”</blockquote>
<p>The correction is attributed to investor jitters stemming from the US Federal Reserve's anticipated changes in interest rate policies, leading to a global sell-off.</p>
<p>Analysts suggest a potential pull-back rally in the coming week, anticipating a possible “Santa rally” during the holiday season.</p>]]></description>

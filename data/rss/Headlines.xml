<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Jan 10, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> India Today</p>
<img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/mpox-313718686-16x9.jpeg?VersionId=RxkXn6dS9zSt4YqUGuBDkCF7Yg08CY_D&amp;size=690:388" alt="Mpox is a viral disease similar to smallpox, causing fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, and a blistering rash." />

<p>Chinese health officials have identified a new mutated strain of mpox, known as clade Ib, in a foreigner who had traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This finding comes as mpox continues to spread globally, prompting concern from health authorities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A cluster of cases was linked to an individual from the DRC, with four additional cases reported among close contacts.</li>
  <li>Symptoms among infected individuals are reported to be mild, including skin rashes and blisters.</li>
  <li>Mpox transmits through close contact and can lead to serious health issues in vulnerable populations.</li>
  <li>Infection rates and deaths in the DRC raise alarms, particularly concerning individuals with underlying health conditions.</li>
  <li>WHO's designation of mpox as a global public health emergency highlights the need for monitoring and containment measures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Clade Ib seems to be different, and is spreading largely through contact between humans, including through sex. Around 18,000 suspected cases of mpox, many of them among children, and at least 600 deaths potentially attributable to the disease have been reported this year (2024) in the DRC alone."</blockquote>
<p>The mpox situation underscores the importance of public awareness and health measures to control the spread of this viral disease.</p>]]></description>

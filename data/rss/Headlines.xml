<li>Currently the fastest human-made object, moving at 430,000 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Aims to explore why the Sun’s corona is significantly hotter than its surface.</li>
<li>Equipped with a specialized heat shield to withstand temperatures of around 1,800°F.</li>
<li>Data collection will begin shortly after the flyby, with updates provided by NASA.</li>
<li>The mission will continue with more flybys planned in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By studying the Sun from such close proximity, the Parker Solar Probe is poised to answer long-standing questions about solar activity.”</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Will Varun Dhawan’s Baby John Just Be Vijay’s Theri on Steroids, or Is There More to It?</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024, <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Joseph-Kuruvilla-and-Baby-John.jpg?resize=600,338" alt="Vijay as Joseph and Varun as John in the flashback">
<figcaption>Still from Theri and Baby John</figcaption>
<p>Varun Dhawan’s upcoming film, <strong>Baby John</strong>, is an official remake of the 2016 Tamil blockbuster <strong>Theri</strong>, featuring Vijay. Directed by Atlee, <strong>Baby John</strong> marks Dhawan's first portrayal of a cop and raises expectations for a captivating narrative as it explores themes of familial bonds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Connections:</strong> The film draws from the emotional core of <strong>Theri</strong>, emphasizing the father-daughter relationship and the protagonist's dual life as a father and a police officer.</li>
<li><strong>Character Dynamics:</strong> The movie updates character relationships, including the love story between the cop and his wife, which has evolved since <strong>Theri</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Casting Choices:</strong> Rajpal Yadav's addition is noted as a change from the original, bringing a fresh dynamic to the supporting roles.</li>
<li><strong>A Deeper Narrative:</strong> While promising more action and drama, the film aims to retain its emotional depth with themes of revenge and justice.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Baby John, summa Therikka vidunga” (Baby John, let the sparks fly).</blockquote>
<p>This film not only aims to resonate with fans of the original but also seeks to establish Varun Dhawan in a new light as he takes on the iconic role of a police officer. Expectations are set high as the film gears up for a big release this Christmas.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Apple's M4-powered MacBook Air may launch sooner than expected</h1>
<p><strong>Published On:</strong> Dec 24, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Published By:</strong> Nandini Yadav</p>
<p>Apple’s M4 chips are powering high-performance devices, and the anticipated MacBook Air with M4 is speculated to launch ahead of the iPhone SE 4.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mark Gurman from Bloomberg hints that the MacBook Air M4 could be released earlier than the iPhone SE 4, scheduled for Spring 2025.</li>
  <li>The new MacBook Air is expected to consist of a 13-inch and a 15-inch model with minor design updates and the M4 chip.</li>
  <li>Apple's accidental confirmation of new MacBook Air models in a macOS update suggests they are coming in 2025.</li>
  <li>There are rumors of performance improvements and potential upgrades like a Center Stage camera.</li>
  <li>The M4 chip shows a 25% performance boost over the M3 chip according to Geekbench results.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Apple could possibly start selling the laptop in the first quarter of 2025.”</blockquote>
<p>The MacBook Air powered by M4 chip may signal a shift in Apple's usual product launch schedule, potentially announced through a press release rather than an event.</p>]]></description>

<p>Shubman Gill has faced challenges in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, failing to convert starts into substantial scores. Ricky Ponting has pointed out technical errors in Gill's batting that need to be addressed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>KL Rahul has been a consistent performer while other top players have struggled.</li>
  <li>Gill has scored low in key matches, raising concerns about his technique.</li>
  <li>Ponting noted that Gill is changing his guard and presenting his front pad too much, leading to dismissals.</li>
  <li>He emphasized the need for Gill to back his defensive technique and adopt a more attacking mindset.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I watched him a little bit in Adelaide... Scott Boland was bowling and he changed his guard, he moved across to the off stump…” - Ricky Ponting</blockquote>
<p>For Gill, the key to improvement lies in trusting his technique and finding a balance between aggression and caution as he plays in Australia.</p>]]></description>

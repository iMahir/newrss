<p>The article discusses the internal conflict within Trump's support base regarding H-1B visas for skilled workers, highlighting his alignment with Silicon Valley supporters against the anti-immigration stance of MAGA proponents.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump favors a more open high-skilled immigration policy, siding with Silicon Valley.</li>
  <li>Criticism arises after the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, who advocates for immigration reform.</li>
  <li>Trump’s allies, Musk and Ramaswamy, defend the H-1B program against MAGA criticisms.</li>
  <li>Concerns about the impact of H-1B visas on American jobs and racial undertones in the debate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"OF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process. HOWEVER, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America." - Elon Musk</blockquote>
<p>The conflict underscores a significant rift within the Republican Party as immigration policy continues to create divisions between traditional supporters and tech industry interests.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Just one session of exercise can keep your brain supercharged till the next day</figcaption>
<p>A recent study by University College London reveals that only one session of exercise can enhance memory benefits for over 24 hours. This emphasizes the importance of physical activity not just for physical health, but also for cognitive enhancement.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The study involved 76 participants aged 50 to 83 engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity.</li>
  <li>Memory tests showed improved performance the day after exercising.</li>
  <li>Participants reported less sitting time and more deep sleep, contributing to memory improvement.</li>
  <li>This research uses a unique “micro-longitudinal” study design, tracking daily activities of participants.</li>
  <li>Findings were published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our findings suggest that the short-term memory benefits of physical activity may last longer than previously thought, possibly to the next day instead of just the few hours after exercise,” Dr. Mikaela Bloomberg stated.</blockquote>
<p>This research underscores the cognitive benefits derived from regular physical activity and highlights the need for mindful incorporation of exercise into daily routines.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ravindra Jadeja's wicket raises concerns for India.</figcaption>
<p>India is in a precarious position on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia after losing their seventh wicket, Ravindra Jadeja. With their follow-on score in jeopardy, the team is desperate to build a solid partnership to avoid defeat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia posted a total of 474 runs in their first innings.</li>
<li>India is currently 221 runs for 7 wickets with Nitish Reddy and Washington Sundar at the crease.</li>
<li>Jadeja's departure marks a significant setback as he was expected to score critical runs.</li>
<li>If India fails to perform today, their chances of reaching the World Test Championship (WTC) final diminish significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The way India play today might well decide the course of the series and World Test Championship final equation.”</blockquote>

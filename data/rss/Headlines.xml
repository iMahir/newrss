<figcaption>ICC Champions Trophy Logo</figcaption>
<p>India's matches in the 2025 Champions Trophy will be held in Dubai after the country refused to visit Pakistan due to ongoing political tensions between the two nations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ICC confirmed that India will play in Dubai, the chosen neutral venue for their matches.</li>
    <li>India’s fixtures include games against Bangladesh and New Zealand, as well as their Group A game against Pakistan.</li>
    <li>If India qualifies for the final on March 9, it will be hosted in Dubai instead of Lahore.</li>
    <li>This decision follows the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s announcement that it would not send a team to Pakistan, citing government advice.</li>
    <li>The last time India toured Pakistan was in 2008, while Pakistan last played India in the 2023 World Cup.</li>
    <li>The tournament marks the first Champions Trophy since 2017, which Pakistan won against India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are pleased that an agreement has been reached based on the principles of equality and respect, showcasing the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that defines our sport,” - PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi.</blockquote>
<p>The tournament is expected to be a major event, with Pakistan last hosting an ICC event in 1996.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Researchers are trying to find out what happens to teeth’s enamel as we age. (iStock)</figcaption>
<p>Researchers from the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are investigating the atomic composition of tooth enamel samples from individuals of different ages to understand the brittleness of teeth as we age.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study analyzed enamel samples from a 22-year-old and a 56-year-old.</li>
    <li>Findings revealed the older sample contained higher fluoride levels in the enamel's crystalline structure.</li>
    <li>The researchers employed atom probe tomography to map atoms in the enamel.</li>
    <li>The aim is to understand how mineral content changes with aging.</li>
    <li>Notably, the decrease of protein in enamel with age is still not understood.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We’re interested in understanding exactly how the mineral content is changing. And if you want to see that, you have to look at the scale of atoms.” - Jack Grimm</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, this research sheds light on the complex changes in tooth enamel with aging, emphasizing the need for further studies to unravel the connection between protein levels and enamel brittleness.</p>]]></description>

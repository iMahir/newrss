            <description><![CDATA[<h1>A man's brain is 10%-15% larger than a woman's: Understanding how it matters (at all)</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>This article explores the differences in brain size between men and women, discussing whether these differences are significant and what they might mean.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brain size is often cited to suggest differences in intelligence or capability.</li>
  <li>The average male brain is reported to be 10%-15% larger than the female brain.</li>
  <li>Experts argue that size does not equate to intelligence.</li>
  <li>Cultural perceptions and myths about gender and intelligence are examined.</li>
  <li>The article highlights the importance of context over mere anatomical differences.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Brain size is only one aspect of a complex interaction of factors that contribute to intelligence."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while there may be measurable differences in brain size, the implications of these differences are often overstated in societal discussions.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Almost one-fourth of our population (both men and women) are currently either overweight or obese in India. Photograph used for representational purposes only | Photo Credit: AP</figcaption>
<p>A global commission has released a report calling for a comprehensive overhaul of how obesity is measured, stating that Body Mass Index (BMI) is inadequate as it does not account for body fat distribution, particularly important for Asian populations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The commission recommends using additional measures, including waist circumference, to assess obesity accurately.</li>
  <li>Two new diagnostic categories introduced: 'clinical obesity' and 'pre-clinical obesity.'</li>
  <li>There is a rising trend of obesity and metabolic issues in India, especially among children and women.</li>
  <li>The new recommendations aim to provide personalized care without stigma for individuals with obesity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By providing a medically coherent framework for disease diagnosis, the commission also aims to settle the ongoing dispute around the idea of obesity as a disease...” - Francesco Rubino, Commission chair, King’s College London</blockquote>
<p>The report emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of obesity, advocating for adequate medical responses and support for affected individuals.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>This shimmering cosmic curtain shows interstellar gas and dust that has been heated by the flashbulb explosion of a long-ago supernova. (Image: NASA)</figcaption>
<p>NASA’s Webb Telescope has captured stunning infrared light echoes from a supernova, revealing intricate details of interstellar dust and cosmic structure, significantly enhancing our understanding of star death.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The explosion of a massive star created a shockwave, sending X-ray and ultraviolet light outward.</li>
    <li>After 350 years, this light interacted with surrounding interstellar material, creating a glowing infrared light echo.</li>
    <li>Astronomers have observed these evolving structures resembling wood grain patterns.</li>
    <li>Jacob Jencson described the detail as “shocking,” while Josh Peek noted, “We’ve never been able to look inside before.”</li>
    <li>The findings were compared to a cosmic CT scan, providing a 3D view of the interstellar medium.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is like a cosmic CT scan,” said Armin Rest.</blockquote>
<p>This advancement marks a significant leap in understanding cosmic dust and its formation.</p>]]></description>

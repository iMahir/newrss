<p>The BCCI is set to hold a meeting with Gautam Gambhir and Chief Selector Ajit Agarkar to discuss the future of star players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after recent disappointing performances in international cricket.</p>
<ul>
<li>The upcoming meeting will review the recent tour to Australia and performances against New Zealand.</li>
<li>Concerns are growing about Kohli and Rohit's diminishing returns at the crease.</li>
<li>Selectors will also discuss team composition for the upcoming Champions Trophy in the UAE.</li>
<li>Questions remain over whether to transition younger players now or wait until after the next ICC event.</li>
<li>Kohli and Rohit's performances in the upcoming ODI Champions Trophy could be crucial for their futures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Both Kohli and Rohit have played just three ODIs in 2024 after the World Cup, which might be too light of a sample size to make a final call on their careers."</blockquote>
<p>This meeting will also include a review of the Gamir-led coaching staff's performance and strategies moving forward.</p>]]></description>

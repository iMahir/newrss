<ul>
    <li><strong>iPhone 17 price increases are expected</strong></li>
    <li><strong>As yet we haven't seen many price leaks</strong></li>
    <li><strong>A new model is expected to appear in 2025</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s anticipated that the iPhone 17 will be released in September 2025, with predictions of higher prices compared to the iPhone 16.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analyst Jong Wook Lee suggests iPhone prices will increase due to previous years' profit margin declines.</li>
    <li>The current iPhone 16 starts at $799, but the iPhone 17 is expected to cost more.</li>
    <li>The rumored iPhone 17 Air could have a starting price of around $1,299.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Although there were initial expectations that Apple’s iPhone prices would rise this year, prices were unusually not increased. As a result, profit margins have declined since...” - Jong Wook Lee</blockquote>
<p>The iPhone 16 currently starts at $799, but consumers may need to prepare for a price hike with the impending iPhone 17 launch.]]></description>

<figcaption>Paracetamol poses gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks for seniors: Study</figcaption>
<p>A new study from the University of Nottingham highlights the potential risks of repeated paracetamol use in individuals aged 65 and older, linking it to serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study analyzed health records of 180,483 seniors over a 20-year period.</li>
    <li>Repeated paracetamol usage (≥2 prescriptions within six months) was associated with increased risks of peptic ulcers, heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.</li>
    <li>Paracetamol, traditionally seen as a safe pain reliever, can cause liver toxicity, especially in older adults.</li>
    <li>The findings were published in the journal Arthritis Care and Research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Due to its perceived safety, paracetamol has long been recommended as the first line drug treatment for osteoarthritis by many treatment guidelines, especially in older people who are at higher risk of drug-related complications." - Professor Weiya Zhang</blockquote>
<p>This study raises critical questions about the safety of long-term paracetamol use in older adults, urging a reevaluation of treatment guidelines.]]></description>

<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has expressed that his political career has been significantly influenced by the Gandhi family, both positively and negatively, and has offered insights on the party's leadership decisions over the years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar claims his political career was “made and unmade” by the Gandhi family.</li>
    <li>He stated that he had limited personal interactions with Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>Aiyar believes if Pranab Mukherjee had become Prime Minister in 2012, the Congress would have performed better in the 2014 elections.</li>
    <li>He recalled feeling surprised when Sonia Gandhi remarked, "I’m not a Christian" during a Christmas greeting.</li>
    <li>Aiyar's upcoming book 'A Maverick in Politics' discusses these political dynamics and his experiences.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Aiyar reflects on his complex relationship with the Gandhi family while emphasizing the pivotal role of Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership in Congress's political fortunes.]]></description>

<p>Shantanu Deshpande, the CEO of Bombay Shaving Company, expresses serious concerns regarding the health implications associated with the rapid food delivery market in India, addressing issues like preparation times and overall safety.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deshpande highlights that the quick commerce food delivery process is too rapid — 'Cook time 2 min, delivery time 8 min' — raising alarm over health standards.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“The quick pace of food delivery poses health risks and raises questions about safety,” said Shantanu Deshpande.</blockquote>

<p>This commentary underscores the need for a critical examination of the quick commerce industry and its practices, particularly concerning consumer health and safety.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How intermittent fasting could lead to hair loss</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 13, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Cell Press</p>
<p>Kilos are not the only thing that intermittent fasting will help you shed. A new study shows that the wildly popular weight-loss method could also inhibit hair growth.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intermittent fasting is a time-restricted diet where participants consume calories in an 8-12 hour window.</li>
    <li>Benefits include weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved diabetes control.</li>
    <li>A 2023 survey reported that over 12% of respondents in the US are practicing intermittent fasting.</li>
    <li>Research linked intermittent fasting to a 91% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.</li>
    <li>Disruptions in sleep cycles and gastric issues are also associated with intermittent fasting.</li>
    <li>A recent study shows a link between intermittent fasting and hair loss by inhibiting hair follicle regeneration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Commonly used intermittent fasting regimens inhibit hair follicle regeneration by selectively inducing apoptosis [programmed cell death] in activated hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs)…”</blockquote>
<p>Researchers found that mice on intermittent fasting exhibited slower hair regeneration, and similar effects were observed in a small human trial, albeit likely less severe in humans.</p>
<p>The study suggests that hair growth inhibition occurs because HFSCs cannot handle the oxidative stress from switching energy sources during fasting.</p>
<blockquote>“During fasting, adipose tissue starts to release free fatty acids...but these stem cells don’t have the right machinery to use them,” - Bing Zhang, senior author and stem cell biologist.</blockquote>
<p>Further research is needed to understand the effects of intermittent fasting on hair loss across different individuals.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>New Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi,(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the Congress party's stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), arguing that they cannot reject EVMs after losses while celebrating wins with the same machines.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah addressed the Congress's doubts about EVMs following defeats in the Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly polls.</li>
    <li>He stated that one cannot selectively trust EVMs based on election outcomes.</li>
    <li>Abdullah encouraged parties to remain consistent in their views on voting mechanisms.</li>
    <li>He defended the Central Vista project, stating it was necessary for a new Parliament building.</li>
    <li>Reports indicate rising tension between the National Conference (NC) and Congress, particularly after recent elections in Jammu and Kashmir.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs, and you celebrate that as sort of a victory for your party, you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to." — Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>Abdullah's comments indicate growing friction within the INDIA alliance and highlight the need for party leaders to consistently support their electoral processes. His advocacy for principles over partisan loyalty bolsters his political stance amid rising tensions.</p>]]></description>

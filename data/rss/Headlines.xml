<p>Allu Arjun's celebratory return home from prison following a high-profile arrest has sparked outrage online, particularly as a young victim from the associated stampede remains in critical condition.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun was arrested concerning a fan's death during the premiere of his film <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/telugu-cinema/justice-done-allu-arjun-fans-celebrate-after-actor-is-granted-interim-bail-in-pushpa-2-stampede-case-101734093105639.html">Pushpa 2: The Rule</a>.</li>
    <li>After his release, he was celebrated at home with significant industry support, which many deemed inappropriate given the ongoing tragedy.</li>
    <li>Many social media users criticized the celebrations, calling it a PR stunt and questioning the lack of support for the deceased's family by Arjun.</li>
    <li>The incident occurred during a large crowd gathering at Sandhya Theatre, leading to a stampede that resulted in significant casualties.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "Today's non-stop celebrity visits and the publicity around it has tilted the scales in favour of Revanth Reddy... It should have been a day of introspection, not celebration."
</blockquote>
<p>The critic response reflects a broader sentiment that celebrity culture can overshadow genuine human tragedy, urging a consideration of the consequences of such public displays amidst personal loss.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar addresses the launch of 'The Nehru Development Model'.</figcaption>
<p>In a recent address, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar discussed the failures of the 'Nehru development model' and the ongoing efforts to correct its consequences since 2014.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jaishankar stated that both Russia and China reject the economic assumptions of the Nehru era.</li>
    <li>The 'Nehru development model' has influenced India's politics, bureaucracy, and education.</li>
    <li>He emphasized a strong need for a course correction post-2014, but acknowledged this task remains challenging.</li>
    <li>Jaishankar quoted John Foster Dulles on India's independence to highlight past geopolitical misconceptions.</li>
    <li>He pointed out a national consensus on the model's failure but noted a reluctance to explore alternatives.</li>
    <li>The current environment requires more focus on resiliency, reliability, and trust rather than just openness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"As a result, we end up doing the reforms we must, rarely the reforms we should." - S. Jaishankar</blockquote>
<p>Jaishankar concluded that the idea of 'Atmanirbharta' should be about self-reliance without equating to protectionism, emphasizing the importance of national security and thoughtful action.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is facing internal discord following its acceptance to host the 2025 Champions Trophy in a hybrid model, allowing India to play their matches in Dubai. Many PCB members are dissatisfied with this decision and the perceived compensation offered.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ICC confirmed a hybrid model for the Champions Trophy 2025, causing dissent in the PCB.</li>
    <li>As compensation, Pakistan will play in the 2026 T20 World Cup in Colombo.</li>
    <li>Former captain Rashid Latif criticized the hybrid model and the future ICC events offered as insufficient compensation.</li>
    <li>Latif referred to the compensation as a "lollipop," questioning its true benefit to Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "This is a lollipop the ICC is giving to the PCB... that if you agree to this, don't ask for anything in writing and we will give you another ICC event. This won't be of any benefit (to Pakistan)." - Rashid Latif
</blockquote>
<p>Internal conflicts within the PCB highlight the complexities of international cricket negotiations, as members debate the adequacy of the hybrid model and its implications for Pakistan cricket moving forward.</p>]]></description>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump will receive $15 million from ABC News as part of a defamation lawsuit settlement related to inaccurate claims made by anchor George Stephanopoulos regarding a civil liability for rape.</p>
<ul>
    <li>ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos claimed that Trump had been civilly found liable for raping E. Jean Carroll.</li>
    <li>The settlement includes $1 million for legal fees to Trump's attorney.</li>
    <li>ABC News issued a public statement expressing regret over the remarks made on the March 10 episode of "This Week."</li>
    <li>The settlement agreement was signed after a Florida federal judge ordered separate depositions for both Trump and Stephanopoulos.</li>
    <li>ABC News is required to transfer $15 million for Trump’s library into an escrow account within 10 days.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We are pleased that the two parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing." - Jeannie Kedas, ABC News spokesperson</blockquote>

<p>Mohammed Siraj continued his lively antics during the Border Gavaskar Trophy, notably at the Gabba, where he engaged the crowd and fellow cricketer Marnus Labuschagne with a 'bail flip' moment.</p>
<ul>
    <li>On Day 2 of the Brisbane Test, Siraj flipped the bails at the striker's end to unnerve Labuschagne.</li>
    <li>Labuschagne responded by flipping the bails back, much to the cheers of the crowd.</li>
    <li>This playful exchange came after a previous incident between the two during the Adelaide Test.</li>
    <li>Siraj received boos from the crowd upon his arrival to bowl at the Gabba after a tumultuous outing in Adelaide.</li>
    <li>In a prior match, both Siraj and Labuschagne faced penalties for their heated exchanges on the field.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Siraj later gave a fiery send-off to local boy Travis Head after dismissing him, which led to recurring boos from the crowd.”</blockquote>
<p>This latest incident adds to the ongoing rivalry and drama between the players and highlights the spirited environment of international cricket.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Sambhal district officials have reopened the Bhasma Shankar temple, which had been closed since the communal riots of 1978. This reopening is a significant moment for the local Hindu community after decades of displacement.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The temple was discovered during an anti-encroachment drive near Shahi Jama Masjid.</li>
    <li>A Hanuman idol and a Shivling were found during the inspection.</li>
    <li>Sub-Divisional Magistrate Vandana Misra highlighted the discovery and the decision to reopen the temple.</li>
    <li>Local residents, including Mukesh Rastogi, claim the temple is over 500 years old and has significant historical importance.</li>
    <li>The reopening follows recent violence related to a survey of the Shahi Jama Masjid.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We all came here together and decided to reopen the temple," - Vandana Misra, Sub-Divisional Magistrate.</blockquote>
<p>The reopening of the Bhasma Shankar temple marks a restorative step for the community, allowing local residents to reconnect with a significant part of their heritage that had been inaccessible for decades.]]></description>

</ul>
<blockquote>"Today's show is dedicated to world chess champion Gukesh. Do you know why it is dedicated to him? Because whatever you think in life, he has already thought about becoming a world champion. And he became that. Problems are there, I face them daily."</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Diljit Dosanjh's concert highlighted both his admiration for Gukesh's achievements in chess and his appreciation for the film Pushpa, engaging the audience with inspirational messages and entertainment.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Mohammed Siraj's send-off to Travis Head in the India vs Australia 2nd Test.</figcaption>
<p>Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar criticized Australian fans and players for their treatment of Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj after a controversial incident during the second Test in Adelaide.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gavaskar condemned the hypocrisy of Australian fans, suggesting they would cheer if the roles were reversed.</li>
    <li>Siraj faced criticism for a fiery send-off directed at Australian batsman Travis Head, which Gavaskar believes was unjust.</li>
    <li>Despite receiving a demerit point and a 20% fine on his match fees, Gavaskar noted the importance of the Indian Premier League in reducing animosity in cricket.</li>
    <li>Gavaskar humorously questioned whether Australian cricketers are "mongrels" who only bark in the context of aggressive play.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Siraj is getting the stick from all the 'saints' in Australian cricket who, of course, were known for their impeccable behaviour on the field... So, do mongrels simply purr, or do they bark, too?" - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>Gavaskar's remarks highlight the double standards in cricket fan culture and emphasize a call for fair treatment of players regardless of nationality.</p>]]></description>

<p>NASA’s Perseverance rover has successfully reached the top of Jezero Crater's rim, marking a significant milestone in its mission to explore the ancient Martian landscape.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The rover climbed 500 vertical meters over three and a half months to reach "Lookout Hill".</li>
    <li>Perseverance will now begin its "Northern Rim" campaign, aiming to explore geological samples over the next year.</li>
    <li>Four previous science campaigns have been completed since its landing in February 2021.</li>
    <li>The rover's current mission involves investigating new geological features and ancient environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>As Perseverance begins to explore areas less affected by ancient impacts, it remains focused on finding biosignatures from Mars' wetter past, contributing to our understanding of the planet’s history and potential for life.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>Atiur Rahman Laskar, the victim's brother-in-law, allegedly killed her after she rejected his advances.</li>

<figcaption>Things got a bit heated between Irfan Pathan (L) and Sanjay Manjrekar(Agency-BCCI)</figcaption>
<p>Former Indian cricketers Irfan Pathan and Sanjay Manjrekar had a heated exchange on live television regarding a critical run-out incident involving Virat Kohli and Yashasvi Jaiswal during a Test match against Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pathan and Manjrekar disagreed on the run-out of Jaiswal following a communication error with Kohli.</li>
  <li>India was placed at 153/2 before losing three wickets for six runs due to the incident.</li>
  <li>Manjrekar criticized Kohli for not being more proactive, while Pathan defended the non-striker's call in a heated debate.</li>
  <li>Manjrekar suggested a new coaching manual based on Pathan's approach to running between wickets.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you don't want to listen, there isn't much left here,” said Manjrekar, highlighting the tensions during the debate.</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the argument, India's position in the game has weakened, trailing by 310 runs with five wickets down.</p>]]></description>

<p>This review takes a close look at the final flight of the agency’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, which was the first aircraft to fly on another world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingenuity completed its final flight on January 18, 2024.</li>
<li>During its mission, it performed 72 flights and flew over 30 times farther than planned.</li>
<li>The navigation system failure during Flight 72 likely caused the end of the mission.</li>
<li>Despite being grounded, Ingenuity continues to send weather data to the Perseverance rover.</li>
<li>Future Mars helicopters may benefit from the findings of Ingenuity's investigation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“When running an accident investigation from 100 million miles away, you don’t have any black boxes or eyewitnesses.” – Håvard Grip, Ingenuity’s first pilot</blockquote>
<p>Ingenuity’s success and longevity will guide the design of future Mars aerial vehicles, with potential for exploration of terrains unreachable by rovers.</p>]]></description>

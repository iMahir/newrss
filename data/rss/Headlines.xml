<figcaption>Quadrantid Meteor Shower</figcaption>
<p>The Quadrantid meteor shower is set to peak tonight, providing a stellar display for sky gazers. This annual phenomenon, likely originating from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Quadrantids occur every year, typically peaking in early January.</li>
  <li>They originate from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, a fragment of a comet.</li>
  <li>Known for their sharp peak, they can produce bright meteors that may appear blue.</li>
  <li>The meteors radiate from near Boötes and the Big Dipper’s handle.</li>
  <li>Best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere, away from city lights.</li>
  <li>Quadrantids travel at approximately 41 km/s (25 miles per second).</li>
  <li>First observed in the 1820s and named after the now-defunct Quadrans Muralis constellation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The Quadrantids are known for their sharp peak, lasting only a few hours, but they can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</blockquote>
<p>Tonight’s viewing conditions could offer impressive displays for those in favorable locations, making it a perfect time for astronomy enthusiasts.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma was not included in the team for the Sydney Test, suggesting a significant change in the selectors' strategy post-Australia tour.</li>
  <li>Head coach Gautam Gambhir and the selectors communicated their plan, indicating a transition in leadership with upcoming series.</li>
  <li>Rohit's recent performance raised concerns, leading to a decision to rest him amidst struggles with the bat.</li>
  <li>Stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah addressed the team’s unity during the toss, acknowledging Rohit’s choice to rest.</li>
  <li>Former players anticipate this may mark Rohit's last Test as selectorial decisions lean towards younger talent for future events including the Champions Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think it probably means that (if) India don’t qualify for the WTC final, the Melbourne Test will be Rohit Sharma’s last game.” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>The decision regarding Rohit Sharma's role in the team reflects a broader strategy of transitioning to new players, signaling an ending of an era in Indian Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Issues Notice to Dera Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in 2002 Murder Case</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Today, <strong>Source:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has issued a notice to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, chief of Dera Sacha Sauda, along with four others in the 2002 murder case of former Dera manager Ranjit Singh, after the CBI challenged the Punjab and Haryana High Court's acquittal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The notice follows the CBI's plea against the acquittal of Ram Rahim and co-accused.</li>
  <li>The murder occurred on July 10, 2002, related to an anonymous letter alleging sexual exploitation by Ram Rahim.</li>
  <li>A special CBI court had previously convicted Ram Rahim and four others in 2021, awarding them life imprisonment.</li>
  <li>In May 2024, the Punjab and Haryana High Court overturned this conviction.</li>
  <li>Ram Rahim's past convictions include the rape of two women, leading to widespread violence in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The CBI court concluded that Ram Rahim orchestrated the murder due to suspicions about Mr. Singh’s involvement in exposing allegations.”</blockquote>
<p>This case highlights the ongoing legal battles involving Gurmeet Ram Rahim and the significant societal implications stemming from his actions.</p>]]></description>

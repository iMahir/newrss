<figcaption>Paracetamol poses gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks for seniors: Study</figcaption>
<p>A new study from the University of Nottingham highlights the potential risks of repeated paracetamol use in individuals aged 65 and older, linking it to serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study analyzed health records of 180,483 seniors over a 20-year period.</li>
    <li>Repeated paracetamol usage (≥2 prescriptions within six months) was associated with increased risks of peptic ulcers, heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.</li>
    <li>Paracetamol, traditionally seen as a safe pain reliever, can cause liver toxicity, especially in older adults.</li>
    <li>The findings were published in the journal Arthritis Care and Research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Due to its perceived safety, paracetamol has long been recommended as the first line drug treatment for osteoarthritis by many treatment guidelines, especially in older people who are at higher risk of drug-related complications." - Professor Weiya Zhang</blockquote>
<p>This study raises critical questions about the safety of long-term paracetamol use in older adults, urging a reevaluation of treatment guidelines.]]></description>

<p>Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the Congress party's stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), arguing that they cannot reject EVMs after losses while celebrating wins with the same machines.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah addressed the Congress's doubts about EVMs following defeats in the Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly polls.</li>
    <li>He stated that one cannot selectively trust EVMs based on election outcomes.</li>
    <li>Abdullah encouraged parties to remain consistent in their views on voting mechanisms.</li>
    <li>He defended the Central Vista project, stating it was necessary for a new Parliament building.</li>
    <li>Reports indicate rising tension between the National Conference (NC) and Congress, particularly after recent elections in Jammu and Kashmir.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs, and you celebrate that as sort of a victory for your party, you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to." — Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>Abdullah's comments indicate growing friction within the INDIA alliance and highlight the need for party leaders to consistently support their electoral processes. His advocacy for principles over partisan loyalty bolsters his political stance amid rising tensions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>My Career Made, Then Unmade By Gandhis: Mani Shankar Aiyar's Big Claim</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Press Trust of India</p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has claimed that the Gandhi family played a significant role in both his political rise and subsequent marginalization within the party.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar stated, "The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis."</li>
    <li>He expressed frustration over a lack of substantial engagement with key members of the Gandhi family over the years.</li>
    <li>Aiyar mentioned he did not have the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi for a decade and had only limited interactions with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>He recalled needing to ask Priyanka to convey birthday wishes to Rahul during a period of his suspension from the party.</li>
    <li>Aiyar wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi seeking clarity on his suspension but received no acknowledgment.</li>
    <li>He reflected on the political environment in 2012 during crises for both Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh, noting Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership during that time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi.”</blockquote>
<p>This interview sheds light on the complex dynamics within the Congress party and highlights Aiyar's personal experiences regarding his political journey influenced by the Gandhi family.</p>]]></description>

<p>The swearing-in ceremony for new Ministers in Maharashtra will take place today, marking a significant expansion of the State’s Cabinet with over 30 MLAs set to take their oaths.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ceremony is scheduled for 4 p.m. at the Raj Bhavan in Nagpur.</li>
    <li>The Cabinet expansion involves the ruling coalition Mahayuti, including the BJP, Shiv Sena, and NCP.</li>
    <li>Over 30 MLAs are expected to be sworn in, with the Cabinet able to accommodate up to 43 members.</li>
    <li>Distribution of Cabinet positions may include around 20 for BJP, 11-12 for Shiv Sena, and 9-10 for NCP.</li>
    <li>This is the first swearing-in ceremony held in Nagpur in 33 years, since 1991.</li>
    <li>Devendra Fadnavis is visiting Nagpur for the first time since taking office, coinciding with local celebrations of 'Dev Diwali'.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Mr. Fadnavis is very particular that a few MLAs from Shiv Sena should not be part of his cabinet due to various reasons.”</blockquote>
<p>This expansion and ceremony are crucial as the ruling coalition finalizes its power-sharing arrangements ahead of the upcoming Winter Session of the State legislature, emphasizing the ongoing negotiations and political dynamics within the coalition.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian cricket team is facing a setback as Jasprit Bumrah is unlikely to recover in time for the Champions Trophy due to worsening back spasms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bumrah experienced back spasms during the final Test against Australia.</li>
  <li>His condition was found to be worse than anticipated, with swelling on his back.</li>
  <li>He is currently undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru.</li>
  <li>BCCI has requested an extension for the squad announcement due to Bumrah's injury.</li>
  <li>There is uncertainty whether to include him in the 15-man roster or as a reserve in the UAE.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"He (Bumrah) will be going to NCA for his rehabilitation. The initial report says he doesn't have a fracture but has swelling on his back."</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of Bumrah's recovery is critical, as his absence could significantly affect India's performance in the Champions Trophy, with the semi-finals set to begin shortly after his expected rehabilitation period.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SpaDeX Mission | Two satellites just 50 feet away for an exciting handshake says ISRO</h1>
<p><strong>Published Date:</strong> January 12, 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>
<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/puhks6/article69091198.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_PSLV-C60_lifts_off_w_2_1_G3DQ0333.jpg" alt="ISRO’s PSLV-C60 carrying SpaDeX lifts off" />

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is successfully nearing the docking of its SpaDeX satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target), which have now reduced their distance to 15 meters. This achievement follows a previous drift that had delayed the docking experiment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The two satellites are currently within 15 meters of each other, just 50 feet away from a handshake.</li>
  <li>ISRO encountered and corrected an unexpected drift between the satellites that postponed earlier docking schedules.</li>
  <li>The docking experiment was initially set for January 7, then moved to January 9, before being postponed again due to the drift issue.</li>
  <li>Successful docking would make India the fourth nation to attain this technology after the USA, Russia, and China.</li>
  <li>This mission is crucial for future projects, including manned lunar missions and the establishment of an Indian Space Station.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“At 15m we see each other clearer and clearer, we are just 50 feet away for an exciting handshake,” ISRO stated on X.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the SpaDeX mission represents a significant step forward for India's capabilities in space technology, with potential implications for future missions beyond Earth.</p>]]></description>

<p>California is grappling with raging wildfires in Los Angeles, resulting in significant destruction and loss of life. Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned remarks by Elon Musk suggesting looting has been decriminalized.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 11 people have died due to the wildfires, and approximately 12,000 structures have been destroyed.</li>
<li>Authorities estimate damage costs could reach as high as $150 billion.</li>
<li>Evacuations are in effect for over 150,000 residents as air quality severely deteriorates.</li>
<li>Newsom has doubled the deployment of National Guardsmen to assist with wildfire responses.</li>
<li>The Los Angeles area has struggled with insufficient water supply for firefighting efforts.</li>
<li>Noteworthy personalities, including Disney CEO Bob Iger, have pledged substantial aid for recovery efforts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Stop encouraging looting by lying and telling people it’s decriminalized. It’s not. It’s illegal as it always has been.” - Governor Gavin Newsom</blockquote>
<p>The situation remains critical as wildfires continue to blaze and officials warn of potential future flare-ups.</p>]]></description>

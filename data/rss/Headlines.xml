<p>This review takes a close look at the final flight of the agency’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, which was the first aircraft to fly on another world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingenuity completed its final flight on January 18, 2024.</li>
<li>During its mission, it performed 72 flights and flew over 30 times farther than planned.</li>
<li>The navigation system failure during Flight 72 likely caused the end of the mission.</li>
<li>Despite being grounded, Ingenuity continues to send weather data to the Perseverance rover.</li>
<li>Future Mars helicopters may benefit from the findings of Ingenuity's investigation.</li>
</ul>

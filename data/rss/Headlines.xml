<figcaption>Rohit Sharma could quit Test cricket after the Australia series</figcaption></p>
<p>The discussions surrounding India captain Rohit Sharma's potential retirement from Test cricket have intensified following a significant loss to Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rohit Sharma's performance and emotional state during the recent Test match raise questions about his future in the longest format of the game.</li>
<li>Justin Langer observed Rohit displaying unusual emotions on the field, suggesting that he may be considering retirement.</li>
<li>Langer noted the stress Rohit faces as captain when team performance falters and personal runs are lacking.</li>
<li>Contrastingly, Langer believes Virat Kohli still has years of top-level cricket ahead of him.</li>
<li>Both Langer and Ravi Shastri agree that this could be the end of Rohit's Test career but see a different trajectory for Kohli.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Rohit Sharma looks very tired to me. I saw him quite emotional on the field yesterday. That's unusual for us to see Rohit like that." - Justin Langer</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the ongoing discussions indicate a pivotal moment for Rohit Sharma as he contemplates his career while Virat Kohli seems to have more time left in international cricket.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Nimisha Priya's case has stirred significant attention.</figcaption>
<p>India is cautiously addressing the sensitive case of Nimisha Priya, a Kerala woman sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of her Yemeni business partner, amid the complexities of operating in regions controlled by the Houthi faction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nimisha Priya has been sentenced to death after being convicted of killing her business partner in Yemen.</li>
  <li>The Yemeni conflict involves multiple factions, complicating the legal and diplomatic situation.</li>
  <li>India does not have official communication with the Houthis, raising challenges for intervention.</li>
  <li>Negotiations may be underway for a possible settlement based on Yemeni customs of blood money.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The government is extending all possible help in the matter,” said Mr. Jaiswal.</blockquote>
<p>This case highlights the intricate intersection of legal processes, international relations, and local conflict in Yemen.</p>]]></description>

<li>Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reiterated India's longstanding position on sovereignty and the illegality of China's occupation.</li>
<li>India is also monitoring the situation concerning other geopolitical issues, such as the sentencing of Ms. Nimisha Priya in Yemen.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Creation of new counties will neither have a bearing on India’s long-standing and consistent position regarding our sovereignty over the area nor lend legitimacy to China’s illegal and forcible occupation.” - Randhir Jaiswal</blockquote>
<p>This protest highlights the ongoing tensions between India and China regarding territorial disputes and sovereignty issues.</p>]]></description>

<p>In all likelihood, Rohit Sharma has played his last Test for India. The selectors are also set to have a discussion with Virat Kohli regarding his future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rohit Sharma opted to "rest" for the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.</li>
<li>He has been informed that he is not part of the selectors' plans beyond the Australia tour.</li>
<li>His recent performance in Tests has been poor with scores of 3, 6, 10, 3, and 9.</li>
<li>The selectors will also discuss Virat Kohli's future after the series.</li>
<li>Ravindra Jadeja is expected to remain in the team's plans during this transition period.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Obviously, our captain (Rohit) has shown his leadership as well. He’s opted to rest in this game. So that shows that there’s a lot of unity in our team. There’s no selfishness. Whatever is in the team’s best interest, we’re looking to do that." - Jasprit Bumrah</blockquote>
<p>This decision marks a significant transition period for Indian cricket as the selectors plan for the future of the team.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Quadrantid Meteor Shower</figcaption>
<p>The Quadrantid meteor shower is set to peak tonight, providing a stellar display for sky gazers. This annual phenomenon, likely originating from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Quadrantids occur every year, typically peaking in early January.</li>
  <li>They originate from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, a fragment of a comet.</li>
  <li>Known for their sharp peak, they can produce bright meteors that may appear blue.</li>
  <li>The meteors radiate from near Boötes and the Big Dipper’s handle.</li>
  <li>Best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere, away from city lights.</li>
  <li>Quadrantids travel at approximately 41 km/s (25 miles per second).</li>
  <li>First observed in the 1820s and named after the now-defunct Quadrans Muralis constellation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The Quadrantids are known for their sharp peak, lasting only a few hours, but they can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</blockquote>
<p>Tonight’s viewing conditions could offer impressive displays for those in favorable locations, making it a perfect time for astronomy enthusiasts.</p>]]></description>

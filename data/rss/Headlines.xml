<p>Cyclone Chido, the most powerful storm to hit Mayotte in nearly a century, has caused devastating damages, and the death toll may reach into the thousands according to officials.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cyclone struck with winds over 200 kph (124 mph), affecting housing, government buildings, and hospitals.</li>
  <li>Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville reported that casualties could number in the thousands.</li>
  <li>French President Emmanuel Macron expressed condolences for the victims in Mayotte, calling it a horrific tragedy.</li>
  <li>The cyclone has severely impacted access to essential resources such as food, water, and sanitation.</li>
  <li>Efforts for disaster relief, including an air bridge from Reunion island, have been initiated.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear." - Mohamed Ishmael, resident of Mamoudzou.</blockquote>
<p>This cyclone challenges the leadership of new Prime Minister Francois Bayrou as authorities assess the extent of the damage and begin recovery efforts.</p>]]></description>

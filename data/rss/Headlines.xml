<figcaption>Several flights were also reportedly delayed at the IGI Airport in Delhi on Saturday. (Vipin Kumar/ Hindustan Times)</figcaption>
<p>Severe fog conditions in Delhi are causing significant disruptions in travel, with 47 trains delayed and multiple flights unable to take off due to low visibility.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Temperature in Delhi is expected to reach a minimum of 7°C and a maximum of 19°C.</li>
  <li>Foggy conditions are predicted to persist for three days, followed by potential rain or thunderstorms on January 22 and 23.</li>
  <li>Delhi's air quality improved due to recent rains, leading to the rollback of the Graded Response Action Plan restrictions.</li>
  <li>Cold wave conditions are affecting various regions of North India, including Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.</li>
  <li>Dense fog is expected in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and East Rajasthan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As per the air quality and weather forecast provided by IMD/IITM, there is a likelihood of AQI to remain in lower end of the Very Poor category in the coming days owing to the favourable meteorological conditions and strong wind speeds,” - CAQM statement.</blockquote>
<p>This weather pattern underscores the need for vigilance as transportation delays may continue and weather conditions evolve throughout the week.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/18/550x309/Kangana_Ranaut_1736147393754_1737168571344.png" alt="Emergency Box Office Collection Day 1" title="Emergency box office collection day 1: Kangana Ranaut's maiden solo directorial scores her biggest opening in five years.">
<figcaption>Emergency box office collection day 1: Kangana Ranaut's maiden solo directorial scores her biggest opening in five years.</figcaption>
<p>The film 'Emergency', Kangana Ranaut's first solo directorial, has hit cinemas and opened with impressive figures, marking her biggest box office opening in five years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film opened at ₹2.35 crore on its first day.</li>
  <li>This surpasses her previous openings, including 'Tejas' which earned ₹1.25 crore and 'Dhaakad' with ₹1.20 crore.</li>
  <li>Emergency's storyline centers around the 1975 Emergency in India, with Kangana portraying Indira Gandhi.</li>
  <li>Despite its opening success, the film faced controversy and protests related to its content, particularly from the SGPC.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Kangana mentioned that the SGPC's demand for a ban on 'Emergency' is a complete harassment of "art and the artist."</blockquote>
<p>The debut of 'Emergency' stands out as a significant moment in Kangana's career, illustrating both the challenges and triumphs of filmmaking in a politically sensitive landscape.</p>]]></description>

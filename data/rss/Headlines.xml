<p>The Andromeda galaxy, the closest large galaxy to Earth, has intrigued astronomers for over a century. A new study by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope reveals stunning details about this cosmic neighbour, shedding light on its complex evolution and differences from the Milky Way.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hubble's imaging uncovered over 200 million stars in Andromeda, marking the most detailed survey of the galaxy.</li>
  <li>The galaxy is located 2.5 million light-years away from Earth.</li>
  <li>Hubble’s data spans the entire disk of Andromeda, offering a clear view of its stellar population.</li>
  <li>The telescope can study stars brighter than our Sun.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Tuesday, Date Unspecified<br /><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>Brazil's government expressed serious concern regarding Meta Platforms' new hate speech policy changes, arguing that they do not comply with local legislation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Brazilian government is asking Meta to explain its policy changes.</li>
    <li>President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has labeled the situation as “extremely serious.”</li>
    <li>Meta has altered its approach towards discussions on immigration and gender identity.</li>
    <li>Brazil is a significant market for Meta, with roughly 100 million active Facebook users.</li>
    <li>The government believes that the changes could violate laws protecting the rights of citizens.</li>
    <li>Meta stated that the changes are aimed at increasing freedom of expression.</li>
    <li>A public hearing will be held to discuss these issues with experts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"AGU and other ministries understand that the current terms of use, as well as the changes now informed by Meta, do not fit with Brazil's legislation and are not sufficient to protect fundamental rights."</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the ongoing tensions between social media platforms and local laws regarding hate speech and freedom of expression.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Las Vegas police reported that Matthew Livelsberger, a decorated Army soldier, used generative AI tools like ChatGPT to assist in planning the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel. He fatally shot himself shortly before the explosion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Livelsberger had looked for information about explosive targets and the legality of fireworks.</li>
<li>The Cybertruck contained 60 pounds of pyrotechnic material and racing-grade fuel.</li>
<li>The explosion resulted in minor injuries to seven individuals, but minimal damage to the hotel.</li>
<li>Livelsberger left notes citing political grievances and a desire for a “wake up call” regarding national issues.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first incident that I’m aware of on US soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,” said Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</blockquote>
<p>This incident raises concerns about the use of generative AI in planning dangerous acts, as multiple government agencies continue to investigate the implications.</p>]]></description>

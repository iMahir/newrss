            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Disinfecting Wipes May Pose Health Risks</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong> October 2023 <strong>Source: </strong> Times of India</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that disinfecting wipes, commonly used for cleaning and sanitization, may pose significant health risks to users due to the chemicals they contain.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disinfecting wipes often contain harmful ingredients such as quaternary ammonium compounds.</li>
  <li>Prolonged exposure to these substances can lead to respiratory issues and skin irritation.</li>
  <li>The wipes may also contribute to antibiotic resistance over time.</li>
  <li>Health professionals recommend using alternative cleaning methods that are less harmful.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"While disinfecting wipes are convenient, their overuse can lead to health complications that are often overlooked." - Health Researcher</blockquote>
<p>This warning emphasizes the importance of being aware of the products we use in our daily cleaning routines.</p>]]></description>

<p>A crucial moment unfolded when Yashasvi Jaiswal’s run-out sparked a collapse for India, who ended day two of the fourth Test against Australia at 164/5, chasing a first innings score of 474.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaiswal scored 82 runs from 118 balls before his run-out, which triggered a poor performance from Indian batsmen.</li>
<li>Steve Smith scored his 34th Test century, contributing significantly to Australia's score.</li>
<li>India needs 111 more runs to avoid a follow-on, struggling at 310 runs behind.</li>
<li>Jaiswal and Kohli's partnership yielded 102 runs before the unfortunate dismissal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This moment will be one for posterity as Kohli looked down and perhaps felt that he could have at least said a loud ‘No’.”</blockquote>
<p>The day concluded with Australia firmly in control, leaving India with a challenging path ahead in the Test match.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Chinese foreign ministry announced plans for a $137 billion dam on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet, asserting that it will not adversely affect neighboring countries along the river.</p>

  <li>The dam is part of a major infrastructure project in the ecologically sensitive Himalayan region.</li>
  <li>China claims it has conducted extensive studies to ensure the project's safety and environmental impact.</li>
  <li>Work on the dam aims to foster international cooperation on disaster prevention and relief.</li>

  <li>Concerns have been raised about potential water flow reductions affecting downstream countries, especially India.</li>

These myths can create unnecessary stress or confusion for expectant mothers.</p><h2>Most uncommon facts about pregnancy</h2><ul><li><strong>Myth 1:</strong> You're eating for two. <em>Fact:</em> Most women only need an additional 300–500 calories per day during the second and third trimesters.</li><li><strong>Myth 2:</strong> Heartburn means your baby will have a lot of hair. <em>Fact:</em> While associated, not every case guarantees this outcome.</li><li><strong>Myth 3:</strong> You should avoid exercise during pregnancy. <em>Fact:</em> Exercise is safe and beneficial unless advised otherwise.</li><li><strong>Myth 4:</strong> Morning sickness only happens in the morning. <em>Fact:</em> It can strike at any time of the day.</li><li><strong>Myth 5:</strong> Carrying low means you're having a boy. <em>Fact:</em> Carrying depends on factors other than the baby's sex.</li><li><strong>Myth 6:</strong> Spicy food induces labour. <em>Fact:</em> There's no scientific evidence for this claim.</li><li><strong>Myth 7:</strong> You shouldn't dye your hair during pregnancy. <em>Fact:</em> Most research shows that hair dye is safe.</li><li><strong>Myth 8:</strong> Pregnant women should avoid caffeine entirely. <em>Fact:</em> Moderate intake is considered safe.</li><li><strong>Myth 9:</strong> The shape of your belly can predict the baby's gender. <em>Fact:</em> Gender predictions based on belly shape are myths.</li><li><strong>Myth 10:</strong> You can't fly during pregnancy. <em>Fact:</em> Air travel is safe until about 36 weeks.</li></ul><p>By separating fact from fiction, you can focus on what truly matters for your health and your baby's development.

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>FBI ‘Found Covid Was Leaked From China Lab’ But Joe Biden Was Kept In Dark: Report</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 27, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> News18</p>
<img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/07/1627283897_news18_logo-1200x800.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=360&amp;height=270" alt="US President Joe Biden | Reuters Image" />

<p>The FBI reportedly silenced evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab, findings which were excluded from a report presented to President Biden.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The FBI suppressed information from US defense and research institutions regarding the lab leak theory.</li>
  <li>Key findings were omitted from an August 2021 report which contradicted the theory.</li>
  <li>Research indicated that spike proteins aiding human transmission were consistent with prior studies from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</li>
  <li>Intelligence officials prevented researchers from discussing their analysis with Congress and the FBI.</li>
  <li>A whistleblower revealed improper classification of federal grant documents related to viral engineering.</li>
  <li>Chinese authorities maintain that the virus likely originated from bats, not a lab leak.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The scientists with subject matter expertise were silenced.”</blockquote>
<p>The event raises significant questions regarding transparency and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, indicating potential implications for future public health policies and international relations.</p>]]></description>

<p>The BCCI is set to hold a meeting with Gautam Gambhir and Chief Selector Ajit Agarkar to discuss the future of star players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after recent disappointing performances in international cricket.</p>
<ul>
<li>The upcoming meeting will review the recent tour to Australia and performances against New Zealand.</li>
<li>Concerns are growing about Kohli and Rohit's diminishing returns at the crease.</li>
<li>Selectors will also discuss team composition for the upcoming Champions Trophy in the UAE.</li>
<li>Questions remain over whether to transition younger players now or wait until after the next ICC event.</li>
<li>Kohli and Rohit's performances in the upcoming ODI Champions Trophy could be crucial for their futures.</li>

<p>Game Changer had a disappointing start at the Indian box office, collecting an approximate of Rs. 60 crore on its first day, which is considered underwhelming given the expectations set by its massive budget.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film grossed Rs. 59.50 crore on its opening day.</li>
  <li>Collections in Telugu states were below expectations, significantly lower than the targeted Rs. 60-65 crore.</li>
  <li>The Hindi version performed the best with Rs. 7 crore NETT.</li>
  <li>Low occupancy rates were observed with less than 50% in regular shows.</li>
  <li>The performance was notably poor in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, traditionally strong markets for director Shankar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A little salt blends well with flour,” but here the salt is probably more than flour.</blockquote>
<p>This lackluster performance raises questions about the film's future at the box office, given the high expectations set by its marketing and budget.</p>]]></description>

<p>Assam has reported its first case of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection this season, with a 10-month-old child testing positive. The infant is currently undergoing treatment at Assam Medical College and Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh and is said to be stable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ten-month-old child tests positive for HMPV in Dibrugarh, Assam.</li>
  <li>Child admitted to AMCH with cold-related symptoms four days ago.</li>
  <li>HMPV infection confirmed by ICMR-RMRC Lahowal after routine tests.</li>
  <li>HMPV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms.</li>
  <li>Similar HMPV cases reported in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The HMPV infection was confirmed yesterday after we got test results from Lahowal-based ICMR-RMRC. The child is stable now. It is a common virus, and there is nothing to worry about.” - Dr. Dhrubajyoti Bhuyan, AMCH superintendent</blockquote>
<p>The detection of HMPV is not unusual, as the virus circulates seasonally and typically impacts infants and individuals with weaker immune systems more severely.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a recent podcast, PM Narendra Modi stated that he is human and can make mistakes, a claim met with skepticism from Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who accused the Prime Minister of engaging in damage control due to his previous assertion of being 'non-biological'.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modi acknowledged his humanity and capacity for mistakes during a podcast with Nikhil Kamath.</li>
  <li>Ramesh's critique refers to Modi's earlier statement on his 'non-biological' status made just months prior.</li>
  <li>Modi emphasized the need for idealism in politics over strict ideological adherence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This from a man who proclaimed his non-biological status just eight months back. This is clearly damage control.” - Jairam Ramesh</blockquote>
<p>The exchange highlights ongoing tensions between Congress and the ruling party regarding Modi's leadership narrative.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>BCCI Takes Shock U-Turn On KL Rahul Selection In India Squad For England ODIs: Report © BCCI/Sportzpics</figcaption>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reversed its decision regarding KL Rahul's participation in the upcoming ODI series against England. Initially resting him, the board has now requested his availability as they aim to provide him with match practice ahead of the Champions Trophy in February.</p>
<ul>
    <li>BCCI had initially agreed to KL Rahul's break from the ODI assignment.</li>
    <li>Recent developments show the board now wants him available for selection.</li>
    <li>Rahul's performance in the Test series in Australia was notable, being the third-highest run-getter for India.</li>
    <li>Competition for the wicketkeeper batter's slot includes Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson.</li>
    <li>The board is seeking an extension from the ICC for the Champions Trophy squad announcement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The selectors initially decided to rest Rahul… However, they had a rethink and the BCCI has now asked him to play…”</blockquote>
<p>This change signifies the BCCI's emphasis on Rahul's performance potential and readiness for future tournaments, demonstrating a dynamic approach to player management.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian economy is expected to be "a little weaker" in 2025, as per IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, who attributes this forecast to uncertainty in global trade policies, particularly from the US.</p>
<ul>
  <li>IMF MD Kristalina Georgieva stated the Indian economy's anticipated weakness despite global growth.</li>
  <li>Concerns raised about regional divergence in economic performance globally.</li>
  <li>Georgieva cited rising long-term interest rates as a global challenge.</li>
  <li>The US economy is performing better than earlier projections, while the EU is experiencing stagnation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The US is doing quite a bit better than we expected before, the EU is somewhat stalling, (and) India a little weaker," said Kristalina Georgieva.</blockquote>

<p>Amit Shah, speaking at a conference for slum dwellers, criticized Arvind Kejriwal for the poor conditions in Delhi's slums, stating that the toilet in Kejriwal's 'Sheesh Mahal' is more expensive than basic housing for slum residents.

<li>Shah accuses AAP's policies of turning Delhi into a "living hell".</li>
<li>Kejriwal counters that residents will respond to Shah's criticism with their votes.</li>

<p>Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticized the current government for the rupee reaching its lowest value against the US dollar, demanding accountability from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rupee declined 18 paise to settle at 86.04 against the US dollar.</li>
  <li>Priyanka recalled PM Modi's past statements during UPA's tenure linking rupee value with government prestige.</li>
  <li>She emphasized that Modi should explain the current situation to the public.</li>
  <li>Contributing factors include global crude oil prices and foreign funds outflow.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Today he himself is the prime minister and all the records on the fall of the rupee have been broken. He should answer to the people of the country," Priyanka Gandhi stated.</blockquote>
<p>This situation emphasizes the need for the government to respond effectively to economic challenges amidst changing global dynamics.</p>]]></description>

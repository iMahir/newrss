<p>Feeding children ultra-processed foods leads to shrinking jaw sizes and increases the risk of dental deformities. This shift to soft, hyper-palatable diets reduces necessary chewing and impacts jaw development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>University researchers warn about the risks tied to ultra-processed foods.</li>
  <li>Eating habits shift from 'hunter-gatherer' diets to modern convenience foods.</li>
  <li>Toddlers in the UK derive half of their calories from ultra-processed foods.</li>
  <li>Studies show reduced chewing leads to dental issues like buck teeth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal recently responded to Rahul Gandhi's comments, asserting that Gandhi's focus is on preserving the Congress party rather than addressing national issues.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kejriwal claimed that Gandhi's fight is about saving Congress, while his own fight is for the country.</li>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi criticized Kejriwal, stating that he campaigns similarly to Prime Minister Modi, making false promises.</li>
  <li>Gandhi accused Kejriwal of failing to eliminate corruption in Delhi, despite his promises.</li>
  <li>He highlighted issues such as inflation and the lack of support for backward communities and minorities, linking this to both Modi and Kejriwal.</li>
  <li>The Delhi assembly elections are scheduled for February 5, with results on February 8.</li>

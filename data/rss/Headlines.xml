<figcaption>Varun Dhawan’s Baby John collects ₹23.90 crore by Day 4, recovering slightly with ₹4.25 crore on Saturday.</figcaption>
<p>Varun Dhawan’s film Baby John shows signs of recovery at the box office, earning ₹4.25 crore on Day 4 for a total of ₹23.90 crore, despite facing heavy competition from Pushpa 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film had an underwhelming debut, earning ₹11.25 crore on its opening day.</li>
<li>Box office collections declined by 57.78% on Thursday and another 23% on Friday.</li>
<li>Pushpa 2 continues to dominate, earning ₹12.5 crore on the same day.</li>
<li>Critics have given mixed reviews, praising the cast, especially Dhawan, but criticizing the slow pacing and plot predictability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What stands out most in Baby John is its stellar casting. Kudos to the casting director! Varun Dhawan shines as DCP Satya Verma.”</blockquote>
<p>Despite the modest recovery, Baby John remains overshadowed by its competitor, indicating a challenging box office journey ahead.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fintech’s New Fuel: Venture Debt Takes Centre Stage Amid a Funding Crunch</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Company Business News</p>
<p>As venture capital investments into India’s financial technology sector plunged this year, fintech companies are increasingly turning to venture debt as an alternative funding source.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Venture debt allows early-stage companies to raise capital without diluting equity.</li>
  <li>Venture debt is becoming more prevalent as venture capital becomes scarce due to regulatory oversight.</li>
  <li>Despite the rise of venture debt, venture capital remains the primary financing method for startups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Venture debt is essentially a high-interest loan advanced to early stage companies that want to raise capital without diluting equity."</blockquote>
<p>The growing use of venture debt highlights a shift in the fintech funding landscape caused by changing regulatory dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Raju Kapanur and five others in connection with hatching a conspiracy to kill BJP MLA Basavaraj Mattimadu and other leaders, police said on Sunday.</figcaption>
<p>The case revolves around the tragic death of Sachin Panchal, a contractor from Bidar, who allegedly ended his life by lying in front of a train. He left a suicide note accusing Minister Priyank Kharge’s aide and others of making death threats against him.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A case has been registered against Raju Kapanur and five accomplices for conspiracy related to deaths of political figures.</li>
  <li>Panchal's suicide note implicated Kapanur, alleging death threats and a plot to harm BJP leaders.</li>
  <li>Minister Eshwar Khandre visited Panchal's family, promising justice and compensation of ₹10 lakh.</li>
  <li>BJP has called for a CBI investigation, citing serious allegations from the suicide note.</li>
  <li>Priyank Kharge defended himself against accusations, stating his name was not mentioned in the note.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The government will ensure that justice is done, and the accused persons are punished. Government is with you," - Minister Eshwar Khandre</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the serious political implications and personal tragedies in Karnataka as the investigation continues.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Samsung Galaxy S25+ spy shots</figcaption>
<p>The latest live photos of the Samsung Galaxy S25+ suggest a familiar design with minor changes, particularly related to a new antenna for 5G capabilities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The photos indicate a new area on the device resembling the Camera Control button seen on iPhones.</li>
  <li>The large, slightly recessed area is likely the mmWave antenna for faster 5G, confirming it is a US model.</li>
  <li>Other modifications are minimal, with the design not featuring the chunky rings around the camera lenses.</li>
  <li>No significant camera upgrades are rumored for the vanilla and plus variants.</li>
  <li>The Galaxy S25 series is expected to be unveiled in January.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Samsung is expected to stick to its usual timeline.”</blockquote>
<p>This reinforces the anticipation surrounding the Galaxy S25 series, which continues to generate interest among tech enthusiasts.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a bizarre incident in Rochester, USA, two men died from a lung infection after using bat poop as fertilizer in their marijuana cultivation. The guano, which contains harmful spores, led to a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two men died after inhaling spores from bat poop used to fertilize marijuana.</li>
  <li>The lung infection they suffered from was identified as histoplasmosis.</li>
  <li>The infection is caused by a fungus found in bat and bird feces.</li>
  <li>Despite medical care, neither man survived after developing severe symptoms.</li>
  <li>Histoplasmosis cases have been reported across the United States, particularly in Ohio and Mississippi.</li>
  <li>Improper handling of bat guano poses significant health risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The increase in this rare lung disease seems to align with the rise in popularity of bat guano as a fertilizer among cannabis cultivators."</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, public awareness about the dangers of handling bat guano is limited, leading to tragic outcomes like that of the two men.</p>]]></description>

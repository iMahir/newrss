<figcaption>Larsen & Toubro Chairman S.N. Subrahmanyan has sparked an online debate.(X)</figcaption>
<p>Following remarks by L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan advocating for a 90-hour workweek, MP Raja Ram Singh has called for penalties against violations of working hour laws in India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subrahmanyan suggested working on Sundays, leading to widespread online outrage.</li>
  <li>MP Raja Ram Singh referenced statements from prominent business figures advocating longer work hours.</li>
  <li>Singh emphasized the negative impacts of long working hours on employee health and productivity.</li>
  <li>He requested enforcement of existing labour laws to protect workers' rights and well-being.</li>
  <li>Statistics from the International Labour Organization show India's workforce among the hardest working globally.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is important to note that not only does working longer hours not ensure increased productivity, but in fact reduces productivity.” - MP Raja Ram Singh</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the need for a review of workplace practices and protections for employees in India.</p>]]></description>

<p>The United States plans to impose stringent sanctions on Russia's oil industry, affecting around 180 ships and multiple traders. This move follows ongoing tensions due to the Ukraine war and could significantly disrupt Russian oil exports to major buyers like India and China.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanctions target around 180 ships, dozens of traders</li>
<li>Gazprom Neft, Surgut, ship insurers added to the list</li>
<li>Biden team had sought to avoid price spike</li>
<li>New Trump administration has said will seek to end Ukraine war</li>
<li>Reuters could not immediately verify the document</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>According to the document, the U.S. Treasury would allow a transition period to March 12, allowing some energy-related transactions to be completed.</blockquote>
<p>This action represents a significant escalation in U.S. efforts to minimize Russia's capacity to fund its military actions through oil exports.</p>]]></description>

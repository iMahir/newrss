            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NASA Unveils New 'Mars Chopper' Design Following Ingenuity's Success</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> NASA News</p>
<img src='image-url.jpg' alt='Mars Chopper rendering'>
<figcaption>NASA's new Mars Chopper design rendering.</figcaption>
<p>Nasa has introduced a new helicopter design, the Mars Chopper, which is set to enhance Mars exploration after the success of its predecessor, Ingenuity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Mars Chopper is larger and equipped with six rotors, each with six smaller blades to increase lift.</li>
  <li>It has a payload capacity of 5 kg, enabling it to carry scientific instruments for detailed terrain studies.</li>
  <li>The helicopter demonstrates capabilities to reach distances of up to three kilometers.</li>
  <li>It aims to assist in exploring areas that are inaccessible to rovers.</li>
  <li>Ingenuity performed 72 flights over three years, far exceeding its initial mission requirements.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Scientists could use Chopper to study large swaths of terrain in detail, quickly – including areas where rovers cannot safely travel.” - NASA</blockquote>
<p>The Mars Chopper's advanced design is expected to significantly contribute to future missions, providing vital aerial data for both robotic and potential human explorations.</p>]]></description>

<p>Puneet Khurana, owner of For God’s Cake bakery, allegedly died by suicide amid an ongoing divorce dispute with his wife. He was found hanging in his house in Model Town’s Kalyan Vihar area. His family claimed that Puneet was "upset with his wife" and had been facing mental torture and harassment from her and her family.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The couple got married in 2016 and co-owned the bakery and another eatery called Woodbox Cafe.</li>
  <li>Puneet's last conversation was with his wife, discussing their bakery business. His family claims the wife recorded the conversation and sent it to her relatives.</li>
  <li>Puneet's sister accused his wife and her family of mental torture and harassment, with a 59-minute video recording as evidence.</li>
  <li>The case comes weeks after a similar incident involving a Bengaluru-based techie.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notable Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
"You are calling me at 3 am, can’t you sleep? You disrespected me and my family."
- Puneet Khurana's wife, as per India Today
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion: The incident has once again highlighted the issue of mental harassment and torture within marriages, with calls for stricter laws and better support systems for victims.</p>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Dec. 19, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Oral Health Group</p>

<figcaption>Researchers are trying to find out what happens to teeth’s enamel as we age. (iStock)</figcaption>
<p>Researchers from the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are investigating the atomic composition of tooth enamel samples from individuals of different ages to understand the brittleness of teeth as we age.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study analyzed enamel samples from a 22-year-old and a 56-year-old.</li>
    <li>Findings revealed the older sample contained higher fluoride levels in the enamel's crystalline structure.</li>
    <li>The researchers employed atom probe tomography to map atoms in the enamel.</li>
    <li>The aim is to understand how mineral content changes with aging.</li>
    <li>Notably, the decrease of protein in enamel with age is still not understood.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We’re interested in understanding exactly how the mineral content is changing. And if you want to see that, you have to look at the scale of atoms.” - Jack Grimm</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, this research sheds light on the complex changes in tooth enamel with aging, emphasizing the need for further studies to unravel the connection between protein levels and enamel brittleness.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 24, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> NASA</p>
<p>The Parker Solar Probe is set to achieve a historic milestone this Christmas Eve by flying closer to the Sun than any previous human-made object.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spacecraft will pass just 3.8 million miles from the Sun’s surface during its 22nd close approach.</li>
<li>Currently the fastest human-made object, moving at 430,000 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Aims to explore why the Sun’s corona is significantly hotter than its surface.</li>
<li>Equipped with a specialized heat shield to withstand temperatures of around 1,800°F.</li>
<li>Data collection will begin shortly after the flyby, with updates provided by NASA.</li>
<li>The mission will continue with more flybys planned in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“By studying the Sun from such close proximity, the Parker Solar Probe is poised to answer long-standing questions about solar activity.”</blockquote>
<p>This flyby is a landmark achievement in solar exploration and will enhance our understanding of space weather and its impact on Earth.</p>]]></description>

<p>Justin Baldoni is facing serious allegations from his co-star Blake Lively, who has filed a lawsuit claiming sexual harassment and manipulation. His legal representation, Bryan Freedman, is defending him while also representing the notorious Menendez Brothers in an ongoing legal matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blake Lively has filed a suit against Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment.</li>
<li>Attorney Bryan Freedman is involved with both Baldoni's case and the Menendez Brothers' legal issues.</li>
<li>Baldoni's crisis management team has connections to Johnny Depp.</li>
<li>The case has drawn considerable media attention and public scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These claims are completely false, outrageous, and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt...” - Bryan Freedman</blockquote>
<p>The allegations made by Lively, which include attempts to damage her reputation, are taken very seriously in Hollywood, especially given the high-profile nature of the parties involved. As both cases unfold, they have been drawing contrasting public opinions.</p>]]></description>

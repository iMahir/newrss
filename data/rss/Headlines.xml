<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted that Russia has not faced defeat in Syria and announced plans to meet with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Putin stated that Russia made proposals to the new Syrian rulers to maintain military bases in the country.</li>
  <li>He mentioned his intention to discuss the fate of U.S. reporter Austin Tice with Assad.</li>
  <li>Putin emphasized that Russia has achieved its goals in Syria by preventing terrorist enclaves.</li>
  <li>He highlighted ongoing support from many in Syria for Russia's military presence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"You want to portray everything that is happening in Syria as some kind of failure, a defeat for Russia. I assure you, it is not. And I'll tell you why. We came to Syria 10 years ago to prevent a terrorist enclave from being created there," said Mr. Putin.</blockquote>

<p>A Pakistan court sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and his wife Bushra Bibi to 7 years for corruption related to the al-Qadir Trust case, involving losses of 190 million pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The verdict, delivered by Judge Nasir Javed Rana, resulted from a case initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in December 2023.</li>
<li>Khan and Bibi were fined and face additional imprisonment if they fail to pay.</li>
<li>The conviction has raised concerns about the integrity of the judiciary according to Khan's comments.</li>
<li>This ruling adds to Khan's legal troubles since his ouster as PM in 2022, as he faces numerous pending cases.</li>
<li>The political situation remains tense as negotiations are ongoing between the government and Khan’s political party, PTI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today’s verdict has tarnished the reputation of the judiciary...” - Imran Khan</blockquote>
<p>The conviction of Khan and Bibi represents both a legal and a political crisis in Pakistan, further complicating the country's already unstable governance.</p>]]></description>

<p>Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison by an anti-corruption court in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust land corruption case. His wife, Bushra Bibi, has received a 7-year sentence as well.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khan was sentenced in a significant corruption case involving a financial loss estimated at 190 million pounds.</li>
  <li>The verdict was announced in a prison setting in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been detained since August 2023.</li>
  <li>The case involved a settlement with a property tycoon and allegations of misappropriating funds returned to Pakistan by the UK’s National Crime Agency.</li>
  <li>Khan and Bibi are accused of accepting land in exchange for laundered money during Khan's time in power.</li>
  <li>The charges have been seen by Khan as politically motivated, aimed at preventing his return to political office.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All the charges against me are a plot by rivals to keep me from returning to office.” – Imran Khan</blockquote>
<p>This conviction adds to Khan's legal troubles following multiple convictions on various charges, highlighting the ongoing political and legal challenges he faces in Pakistan.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Stays HC Order Requiring Delhi Govt To Sign MoU With Centre On Implementation Of PM-ABHIM</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Today</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Law</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has temporarily stayed a Delhi High Court order mandating the Delhi government to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Centre for the implementation of the PM-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) scheme.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court stayed the order of the Delhi High Court which aimed to accelerate the health infrastructure in Delhi via PM-ABHIM.</li>
  <li>The Delhi government challenged the High Court's directive, arguing it overstepped the Centre's powers regarding health matters.</li>
  <li>Senior Advocate Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi defended the Delhi government, stating that the proposed MoU unfairly limited running expenditure responsibilities.</li>
  <li>The High Court had expressed urgency over the lack of medical facilities in Delhi and insisted on the scheme's implementation.</li>
  <li>The bench directed the Centre to respond to the Delhi government's plea.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The High Court had a suo motu PIL regarding ICU bed availability and criticized the delay in implementing PM-ABHIM in Delhi, contrasting it with 33 other States/UTs that have already implemented it.</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court's decision to stay the High Court's order indicates ongoing legal challenges regarding the implementation of crucial health infrastructure schemes in Delhi amid concerns of medical resource shortages.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Video discussing the findings on Mars' surface features.</figcaption>
<p>Recent observations of frozen dunes on Mars suggest the potential presence of water and microbial life in the planet's past.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Frozen sand dunes observed by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are stationary due to carbon dioxide frost.</li>
  <li>Understanding these features can help scientists determine if Mars once had conditions suitable for liquid water.</li>
  <li>The Martian axial tilt may have supported a thicker atmosphere in the past, impacting its climate.</li>
  <li>Research on frost patterns aids in uncovering Mars' climatic history and possible habitability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Studying these frost-covered dunes helps scientists assess whether liquid water was present on Mars for periods long enough to support life.”</blockquote>
<p>These findings deepen our understanding of Mars' climate evolution and its implications for astrobiology.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gges1eoxwaax1tu.jpeg?c=original" alt="India launched its first space docking mission on December 30, 2024">
<figcaption>India launches its first space docking mission.</figcaption>
<p>India made a significant leap in space exploration by becoming the fourth country to successfully execute an unmanned docking in space, marking a pivotal moment for its future missions and cementing its status as a global space power.</p>
<ul>
<li>The successful docking was accomplished through the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDex), deploying two small spacecraft.</li>
<li>The spacecraft, weighing about 220 kilograms each, were launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Center.</li>
<li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated ISRO for their historic achievement, emphasizing its importance for future missions.</li>
<li>The technology developed will be essential for future endeavors such as satellite servicing and launching multiple rockets.</li>
<li>India aims to send its first astronaut to the moon by 2040 and establish its own space station by 2035.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Spacecraft docking successfully completed! A historic moment,” the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) said on X.</blockquote>
<p>The advancement of in-docking technology is crucial for the future of India's space missions, as it prepares to enhance its operations and capabilities on the international stage.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Environmental Research</p>
<img src="https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2014/7/Body_Mass_Index-620x480.jpg" alt="Air pollution before conception may increase child BMI">
<figcaption>Air pollution before conception may increase child BMI</figcaption>
<p>A study involving over 5,000 mothers reveals that exposure to air pollution prior to pregnancy is associated with higher child BMI and obesity risk factors, indicating the critical nature of preconception environmental factors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research conducted by the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Duke University, and Fudan University involving 5,834 mother-child pairs in Shanghai.</li>
  <li>Significant pollutants affecting child BMI included PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
  <li>Higher pollution exposure linked to a notable increase in child BMI and growth rates up to the age of two.</li>
  <li>Precautions recommended for prospective parents to reduce pollution exposure, such as wearing masks and using air purifiers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The magnitude is small, but because air pollution is widespread and everybody is exposed, the risk of air pollution exposure on children's obesity risk may be substantial.” - Zhanghua Chen, PhD</blockquote>
<p>Further research is underway to explore the direct effects of air pollution on childhood obesity and to test interventions aimed at reducing pollution exposure.</p>]]></description>

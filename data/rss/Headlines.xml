<p>The article discusses the internal conflict within Trump's support base regarding H-1B visas for skilled workers, highlighting his alignment with Silicon Valley supporters against the anti-immigration stance of MAGA proponents.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump favors a more open high-skilled immigration policy, siding with Silicon Valley.</li>
  <li>Criticism arises after the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, who advocates for immigration reform.</li>
  <li>Trump’s allies, Musk and Ramaswamy, defend the H-1B program against MAGA criticisms.</li>
  <li>Concerns about the impact of H-1B visas on American jobs and racial undertones in the debate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"OF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process. HOWEVER, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America." - Elon Musk</blockquote>
<p>The conflict underscores a significant rift within the Republican Party as immigration policy continues to create divisions between traditional supporters and tech industry interests.</p>]]></description>

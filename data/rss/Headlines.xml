            <description><![CDATA[<h1>A man's brain is 10%-15% larger than a woman's: Understanding how it matters (at all)</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>This article explores the differences in brain size between men and women, discussing whether these differences are significant and what they might mean.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brain size is often cited to suggest differences in intelligence or capability.</li>
  <li>The average male brain is reported to be 10%-15% larger than the female brain.</li>
  <li>Experts argue that size does not equate to intelligence.</li>
  <li>Cultural perceptions and myths about gender and intelligence are examined.</li>
  <li>The article highlights the importance of context over mere anatomical differences.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Brain size is only one aspect of a complex interaction of factors that contribute to intelligence."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while there may be measurable differences in brain size, the implications of these differences are often overstated in societal discussions.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a recent speech, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi stated that the Congress party is not just opposing the BJP or RSS ideology, but is fighting the Indian state itself. This remark provoked a sharp response from several BJP leaders.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BJP leaders, including Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, criticized Gandhi's comments.</li>
  <li>Puri suggested that Gandhi should check his mental stability in light of his remarks.</li>
  <li>Gandhi's speech included criticisms of RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat's statement about India’s independence celebration.</li>
  <li>Nirmala Sitharaman questioned Gandhi's loyalty to the Constitution while making such claims.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The people in power today don't salute the tricolour, don't believe in the national flag or the constitution...” - Rahul Gandhi</blockquote>
<p>The controversy highlights the ongoing tensions between the Congress party and BJP in Indian politics, with Gandhi asserting that the Congress remains the only viable alternative to the BJP-led government.</p>]]></description>

<p>As both the US and China prepare to return humans to the Moon, the US lunar program faces delays, while China is projected to land astronauts by 2030. This article explores the implications of a potential new Moon race and the challenges both nations face.</p>
<ul>
<li>12 Americans landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972.</li>
<li>The US lunar program is behind schedule due to unprepared equipment.</li>
<li>China intends to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, backed by a smooth-running space program.</li>
<li>Nasa's Artemis program aims to land humans on the Moon by 2026, with several milestones including Artemis I and II.</li>
<li>Critics suggest Artemis is overly complicated compared to China’s direct approach.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Rushing back to the Moon could be costly, both financially and in the risk to human life.”</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming Moon missions highlight competitive international space efforts and the importance of responsible exploration principles.</p>]]></description>

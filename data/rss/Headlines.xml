<figcaption>Virat Kohli exchanged words with the media at the Melbourne Airport. (Screenshot)</figcaption>
<p>Indian cricketer Virat Kohli arrived in Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test and had a tense exchange with the media regarding their filming practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kohli was irritated over perceived filming of his family at the airport.</li>
<li>A Channel 7 reporter clarified that the situation arose from a misunderstanding.</li>
<li>Kohli emphasized his need for privacy concerning his children, stating, “With my kids I need some privacy, you can’t film without asking me.”</li>
<li>The misunderstanding was resolved when it was confirmed that his children were not being filmed.</li>
<li>Kohli's recent performance has been mixed, scoring a century in the first Test but only 26 runs in his other innings.</li>
<li>The Border-Gavaskar series is tied 1-1 going into the fourth Test at the MCG.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It was upon seeing the waiting cameras that Kohli became a little heated over what is largely a misunderstanding when he thought the media was filming him with his children,” reported Channel 7.</blockquote>
<p>The incident highlights ongoing tensions between celebrities and media privacy norms.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A recent report suggested that Starbucks could soon exit India due to widening losses.(Starbucks)</figcaption>
<p>Tata Consumer Products has officially denied claims suggesting that American coffee chain Starbucks might exit India due to financial struggles and rising costs, labeling the report as 'baseless.'</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tata Consumer Products labeled recent reports about Starbucks' potential exit from India as untrue.</li>
  <li>A Rajasthan-based media outlet published the original claim, sparking concerns over Starbucks' operations in the country.</li>
  <li>Despite reported losses, Tata maintains a strong partnership with Starbucks.</li>
  <li>Tata's CEO mentioned a delay in new store openings amid declining customer footfall.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Reports of Starbucks looking to exit India (are) completely false and baseless. Tata’s relationship with Starbucks stands strong with shared values and commitment to India." - Tata Consumer Products</blockquote>
<p>This clarification serves to reassure stakeholders that Starbucks remains committed to its Indian market, despite challenges.</p>]]></description>

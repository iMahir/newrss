<p>On Sunday, protesters vandalised Allu Arjun's Hyderabad home, demanding compensation for victims of a recent stampede linked to the premiere of his film 'Pushpa 2'.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protesters, identifying as OU JAC, vandalised the property in Jubilee Hills.</li>

<li>The protest included pelting stones and breaking flower pots.</li>
<li>Eight individuals were arrested at the scene by police.</li>
<li>The incident stemmed from a previous stampede at a film premiere that resulted in one death.</li>

<blockquote>“We demand that Allu Arjun take care of the late Revathi’s family. Why did so many film personalities visit him when he came out of jail after being there for 6 months, but none of them cared when a woman died.” - Protester</blockquote>

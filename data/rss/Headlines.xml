            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SpaceX's 31st Dragon Cargo Capsule Departs ISS to Head Home to Earth</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 16, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Space.com</p>
<p>SpaceX's 31st robotic cargo mission is on its way back to Earth, after successfully undocking from the International Space Station (ISS) this morning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Dragon cargo capsule undocked at 11:05 a.m. EST, beginning deorbit burns to complete its mission.</li>
  <li>It will splash down off the coast of Florida tomorrow, December 17, with thousands of pounds of equipment and samples from ISS research.</li>
  <li>The spacecraft is currently the only cargo craft capable of safely returning cargo to Earth, while others incinerate upon reentry.</li>
  <li>CRS-31 delivered 6,000 pounds of supplies for NASA's astronauts at the ISS in November.</li>
  <li>NASA can quickly retrieve the Dragon after splashdown to continue research on the returned experiments.</li>
  <li>Today's undocking was delayed from its original schedule due to bad weather in the splashdown zone.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“NASA will be able to retrieve the CRS-31 Dragon spacecraft relatively quickly after splashdown tomorrow, reaping the benefits of any experiments in need of quick attending following atmospheric reentry.”</blockquote>
<p>This mission is crucial for ongoing research and supply to astronauts on the ISS, highlighting the importance of commercial partnerships in space exploration.</p>]]></description>

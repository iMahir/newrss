<p>Australia captain Pat Cummins has heaped praise on India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, acknowledging his exceptional form and consistent ability to trouble batters across all formats. Speaking ahead of the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Cummins admitted that facing Bumrah is always a daunting task.</p>

<li>Cummins praised Bumrah’s exceptional form and consistent ability to trouble batters.</li>
<li>Cummins admitted that facing Bumrah is always a daunting task.</li>
<li>Australia has the chance to secure the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and secure their place in the World Test Championship final with a win or draw in Sydney.</li>
<li>Australia has confirmed changes in their lineup, with Mitch Marsh dropped and Beau Webster set to make his debut.</li>
<li>Mitchell Starc has been retained despite carrying a rib niggle.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"Bumrah is bowling well at the moment. He is always tough. Hopefully, by the time I come in, late in the day, he has bowled quite a bit, which might make it a bit easier for me. But he is bowling well. I’ve faced him quite a bit across the world in different formats, and he always poses a challenge."</blockquote>
<p>Cummins confirmed a few changes in Australia’s lineup, with all-rounder Mitch Marsh dropped following a string of underwhelming performances, and Beau Webster set to make his debut. Mitchell Starc has been retained despite carrying a rib niggle and will feature in the bowling attack alongside Cummins, Scott Boland, and Nathan Lyon.</p>]]></description>

(AFP)"><figcaption>US President Joe Biden makes a statement about the terrorist attack in New Orleans from Camp David, Maryland, on January 1, 2025. (AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Introduction: A truck attack in New Orleans on New Year's Eve left at least 15 people dead and dozens injured, with the FBI linking the suspect to ISIS-inspiration.</p>
<ol>
<li>US Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar, inspired by ISIS, drove a pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street.</li>
<li>Jabbar posted videos hours before the attack, expressing his desire to kill.</li>
<li>President Joe Biden condemned the attack, offered condolences, and assured the public that the FBI is investigating.</li>
<li>The truck attack turned festive Bourbon Street into a macabre mayhem of maimed victims and fleeing pedestrians.</li>
<li>The FBI believes Jabbar was not solely responsible and is investigating potential associates and explosives found at the scene.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>“This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil.” - New Orleans Police superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick</p></blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: The FBI is actively investigating the New Orleans truck attack, treating it as an act of terrorism, with President Biden offering condolences to the victims and their families.</p>]]></description>

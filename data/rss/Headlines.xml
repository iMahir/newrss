<p>Aamir Khan Productions has issued an official statement following the exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> from the Oscars 2025 shortlist for Best International Feature Film. The Film Federation of India’s decision to bypass the Kiran Rao-directed satire sparked significant backlash among cinephiles and industry figures alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film, which critiques the patriarchy in rural India, was critically acclaimed but not shortlisted for the Oscars.</li>
<li>Aamir Khan Productions expressed disappointment but emphasized gratitude for the support received.</li>
<li>The statement highlighted the honor of being considered among the finest films globally, despite the snub.</li>
<li>Critics have raised concerns about the selection criteria of the Film Federation of India.</li>
<li>The situation has drawn attention back to Payal Kapadia’s Cannes-winning film, <i>All We Imagine As Light</i>, viewed as India’s strongest contender.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Laapataa Ladies did not make it to the Academy Awards shortlist this year, and we are of course disappointed, but equally we are immensely grateful for the incredible support and belief we’ve received throughout this journey.”</blockquote>
<p>The exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> adds another chapter to India’s contentious history with the Academy Awards.</p>]]></description>

<p>The draw at the Gabba keeps India in the third spot of the World Test Championship (WTC) points table with a PCT of 58.88 after 17 matches. Persistent rain forced the match to conclude in a draw, impacting India's chances for the WTC final.</p>
<ul>
<li>The match ended in a draw due to rain after India began their chase of 275 runs.</li>
<li>India cannot afford another draw or loss in their remaining two matches to stay in contention for the WTC final.</li>
<li>Winning 3-1 in the remaining series would ensure India's qualification without depending on other results.</li>
<li>The draw maintains tight competition in the WTC standings, with Australia and South Africa also in contention.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The draw did keep India still in the hunt for a spot in the WTC final, but they have now entered a must-win territory.</blockquote>
<p>Overall, while India remains in contention for the World Test Championship final, they must secure victories in their upcoming matches to guarantee qualification.</p>]]></description>

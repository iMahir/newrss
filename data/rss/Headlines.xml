            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Objectionable That Arvind Kejriwal Called Atishi Temporary: Lt Governor</h1>
<p><strong>Date: </strong> Not specified | <strong>Source: </strong> Not specified</p>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong> Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena expressed his discontent over Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's reference to Atishi as a 'temporary Chief Minister', stating it undermines democratic principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saxena stated he was 'hurt' by Kejriwal's comment.</li>
<li>He emphasized that the term 'temporary Chief Minister' does not exist in the Constitution.</li>
<li>The LG praised Atishi for her governance efforts, contrasting her work with that of her predecessor, Kejriwal.</li>
<li>He listed areas where he believes the government has failed, while acknowledging Kejriwal's admissions of shortcomings.</li>
<li>Assembly elections in Delhi are scheduled for February next year.</li>
<li>Saxena had previously referred to Atishi as 'a thousand times better' than Kejriwal.</li>
<li>Atishi has yet to respond to the criticisms made by Saxena.</li>
<li>There was a prior incident in which Saxena overruled Atishi's request to hoist the national flag on Independence Day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is the first time in my two-and-a-half-year tenure that I am seeing a Chief Minister discharge the duties of a Chief Minister." - Lt Governor VK Saxena</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong> The ongoing tensions between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister highlight the political dynamics in Delhi ahead of the upcoming elections.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Research questions ‘iron deficiency’ as key cause of anaemia in India</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> January 17, 2025</p>

<p>A recent study suggests that the traditional belief that iron deficiency is the primary cause of anaemia in India may be outdated, highlighting alternative factors such as Vitamin B12 deficiency and air pollution. The findings call for a review of public health policies regarding anaemia.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study was published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</li>
<li>Anaemia affects 34.9% of the population tested, but only 9% had iron-deficiency anaemia.</li>
<li>Prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age increased from 53.2% to 57.2% as per the latest National Family Health Survey.</li>
<li>Other causes of anaemia include deficiencies in nutrients like B12 or folate and environmental factors such as pollution.</li>
<li>The study indicates the need for diversified dietary policies and holistic approaches, rather than focusing solely on iron supplementation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The key is to diversify diets. We have to intervene with ensuring more fruits, milk and vegetables are made available to a wider population which will improve absorption of essential nutrients.” - Dr. Anura Kurpad</blockquote>
<p>The findings of this study advocate for more comprehensive public health strategies to combat anaemia in India.</p>]]></description>

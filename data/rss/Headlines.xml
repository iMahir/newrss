<figcaption>Ram Charan in Game Changer (image courtesy of AA Films)</figcaption>
<p>Game Changer had a disappointing start at the Indian box office, collecting an approximate of Rs. 60 crore on its first day, which is considered underwhelming given the expectations set by its massive budget.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film grossed Rs. 59.50 crore on its opening day.</li>
  <li>Collections in Telugu states were below expectations, significantly lower than the targeted Rs. 60-65 crore.</li>
  <li>The Hindi version performed the best with Rs. 7 crore NETT.</li>
  <li>Low occupancy rates were observed with less than 50% in regular shows.</li>
  <li>The performance was notably poor in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, traditionally strong markets for director Shankar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A little salt blends well with flour,” but here the salt is probably more than flour.</blockquote>
<p>This lackluster performance raises questions about the film's future at the box office, given the high expectations set by its marketing and budget.</p>]]></description>

<p>Assam has reported its first case of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection this season, with a 10-month-old child testing positive. The infant is currently undergoing treatment at Assam Medical College and Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh and is said to be stable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ten-month-old child tests positive for HMPV in Dibrugarh, Assam.</li>
  <li>Child admitted to AMCH with cold-related symptoms four days ago.</li>
  <li>HMPV infection confirmed by ICMR-RMRC Lahowal after routine tests.</li>
  <li>HMPV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms.</li>
  <li>Similar HMPV cases reported in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The HMPV infection was confirmed yesterday after we got test results from Lahowal-based ICMR-RMRC. The child is stable now. It is a common virus, and there is nothing to worry about.” - Dr. Dhrubajyoti Bhuyan, AMCH superintendent</blockquote>
<p>The detection of HMPV is not unusual, as the virus circulates seasonally and typically impacts infants and individuals with weaker immune systems more severely.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>BCCI Takes Shock U-Turn On KL Rahul Selection In India Squad For England ODIs: Report © BCCI/Sportzpics</figcaption>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reversed its decision regarding KL Rahul's participation in the upcoming ODI series against England. Initially resting him, the board has now requested his availability as they aim to provide him with match practice ahead of the Champions Trophy in February.</p>
<ul>
    <li>BCCI had initially agreed to KL Rahul's break from the ODI assignment.</li>
    <li>Recent developments show the board now wants him available for selection.</li>
    <li>Rahul's performance in the Test series in Australia was notable, being the third-highest run-getter for India.</li>
    <li>Competition for the wicketkeeper batter's slot includes Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson.</li>
    <li>The board is seeking an extension from the ICC for the Champions Trophy squad announcement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The selectors initially decided to rest Rahul… However, they had a rethink and the BCCI has now asked him to play…”</blockquote>
<p>This change signifies the BCCI's emphasis on Rahul's performance potential and readiness for future tournaments, demonstrating a dynamic approach to player management.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian economy is expected to be "a little weaker" in 2025, as per IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, who attributes this forecast to uncertainty in global trade policies, particularly from the US.</p>
<ul>
  <li>IMF MD Kristalina Georgieva stated the Indian economy's anticipated weakness despite global growth.</li>
  <li>Concerns raised about regional divergence in economic performance globally.</li>
  <li>Georgieva cited rising long-term interest rates as a global challenge.</li>
  <li>The US economy is performing better than earlier projections, while the EU is experiencing stagnation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The US is doing quite a bit better than we expected before, the EU is somewhat stalling, (and) India a little weaker," said Kristalina Georgieva.</blockquote>
<p>Moving forward, details regarding the Indian economy's trajectory will be further elaborated during the upcoming World Economy Outlook update week.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Henry and Co restrict SL to 290 despite Nissanka, Kusal fifties</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified<br/><strong>Source:</strong> ESPNcricinfo</p>
<p>In a tightly contested ODI, Sri Lanka managed to score 290 for 8 thanks to Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis, who both achieved rapid fifties. Despite a middle-order slowdown, Janith Liyanage's steady batting helped Sri Lanka post a competitive total against New Zealand.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sri Lanka scored 290 for 8 in their innings, with Nissanka (66), Kusal (54), and Liyanage (53) being the top scorers.</li>
  <li>New Zealand's Matt Henry took 4 wickets for 55 runs, leading the bowling attack.</li>
  <li>The innings saw a middle-order collapse as New Zealand's spinners applied pressure.</li>
  <li>Nissanka retired hurt due to a hamstring strain but returned to contribute to the total.</li>
  <li>Sri Lanka scored 53 runs in the last six overs, attacking aggressively towards the end.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Sri Lanka had been coasting on 155 for 1 after 27 overs... but New Zealand's spinners stemmed the flow of runs."</blockquote>
<p>New Zealand's disciplined bowling showcased their ability to capitalize on mistakes, while Sri Lanka's batting depth was tested throughout the innings, suggesting a competitive chase ahead.</p>]]></description>

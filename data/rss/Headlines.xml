<p>The United States government managed to avoid a shutdown as the Senate worked through the night to ensure the passage of a bipartisan funding bill to manage federal operations temporarily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The House of Representatives approved the bill by a margin of 366-34 before it went to the Senate.</li>
<li>The Senate voted 85-11 in favor of the bill, averting a shutdown.</li>
<li>The funding package will last until March 14 and includes $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in agricultural assistance.</li>
<li>Outgoing President Joe Biden is expected to sign the legislation into law.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is a good time for the country,” said Speaker Mike Johnson after the House vote.</blockquote>
<p>This legislative action has made sure that the essential services of the government continue without interruption.</p>]]></description>

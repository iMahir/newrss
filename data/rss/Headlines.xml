<p>A groundbreaking study reveals that certain patients with artificial hearts, particularly those using left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), can regenerate heart muscle, potentially offering new hope for treating heart failure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The research, co-led by the University of Arizona, suggests heart cells can regenerate at a rate over six times higher than in healthy individuals.</li>
  <li>Current treatments for heart failure include medications, transplants, or LVADs, as there is no known cure.</li>
  <li>Dr. Hesham Sadek noted that, unlike skeletal muscle, heart muscle does not typically regenerate after an injury.</li>
  <li>The study raises implications for future therapies targeting mechanisms of heart muscle regeneration.</li>
  <li>This collaborative research was published in the journal <em>Circulation</em>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the strongest evidence we have so far that human heart muscle cells can actually regenerate.” - Dr. Hesham Sadek</blockquote>
<p>The findings underscore the potential for innovative therapies that could transform treatment for heart failure and enhance understanding of cardiology.</p>]]></description>

<p>Imagine robots understanding your emotions just by touching your skin. This futuristic idea might soon become a reality, thanks to a recent study published in the journal IEEE Access. Researchers have discovered that measuring how skin conducts electricity could help robots gauge human feelings more accurately.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The technique relies on skin conductance, changing with emotional states.</li>
  <li>Researchers studied 33 participants using emotionally charged videos.</li>
  <li>Fear triggered the longest-lasting skin conductance responses, an evolutionary survival mechanism.</li>
  <li>Emotions related to family bonding showed slower responses.</li>
  <li>Humor caused quick but short-lived reactions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Skin conductance offers a potential workaround, providing a non-invasive way to capture emotion in real time," the researchers explained.</blockquote>
<p>While the method isn’t perfect, researchers are optimistic about its potential. They suggest combining skin conductance with other physiological measures for improved accuracy. This breakthrough could lead to robots that not only interact but also empathize with humans.</p>]]></description>

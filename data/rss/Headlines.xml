            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Housing supply up 44 pc in NCR this year to 53K units; luxury home share in launches 60 pc: Anarock</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Anarock</p>
<p>This year, the Delhi-NCR housing market experienced a remarkable 44% growth in new housing supply, amounting to 53,000 units, with a substantial share being ultra-luxury homes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of new residential property launches totaled 36,735 units in 2023.</li>
  <li>Ultra-luxury homes, priced above ₹2.5 crore, constituted nearly 60% of the new supply.</li>
  <li>Sales in the Delhi-NCR market declined by 6% to 61,900 units compared to the previous year.</li>
  <li>Overall housing launches in seven major Indian cities saw a 7% decrease.</li>
  <li>The total sales across these seven cities also saw a marginal decline of 4% this year.</li>
  <li>Anarock's Chairman noted that elections and slowed project approvals affected new housing supply.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri stated, "2024 has been a mixed bag for the Indian housing sector... sales also saw a marginal decline... offset by a 16 percent jump in the overall sales value."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, despite the challenges posed by the economic environment, the luxury segment remains resilient, indicating a shift in consumer preferences in the housing market.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Nomura's Nathan Sribalasundaram writes that further CRR cuts cannot be ruled out and that alternative measures look more likely now.</figcaption>
<p>According to the report, RBI has been intervening "heavily" in the FX over the past two months, causing a drain on the INR liquidity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nomura emphasizes the need for more Variable Rate Reverse repos (VRRs), swaps, and Open Market Operations (OMOs) by the RBI.</li>
<li>There are indications that further Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) cuts might be necessary.</li>
<li>The intervention by RBI in the foreign exchange market has significantly impacted liquidity in the Indian rupee.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Further CRR cuts cannot be ruled out and that alternative measures look more likely now.”</blockquote>
<p>This analysis underscores the need for the RBI to adopt additional measures to stabilize the rupee liquidity and prevent negative economic impacts.</p>]]></description>

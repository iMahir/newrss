<figcaption>Markets remain under pressure following Fed's strict commentary. Support exists at 23,850, with resistance at 24,200, according to Rupak De of LKP Securities.</figcaption>
<p>Indian equity benchmark indices BSE Sensex and Nifty50 faced significant declines today, dipping below 78,500 and just above 23,700 respectively. Key factors include recent comments from the US Federal Reserve affecting investor confidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>BSE Sensex declined by 836 points (1.06%) to 78,382.17.</li>
<li>Nifty50 dropped by 241 points (1.01%) to 23,710.95.</li>
<li>Foreign investors sold shares worth 122.31 billion rupees ($1.44 billion) this week.</li>
<li>Weekly declines of both indices exceed 3%, marking the first drop after four weeks of gains.</li>
<li>Top gainers included Asian Paints, Nestle India, and Titan Company, while major losers were Tech Mahindra and Axis Bank.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Despite the weakness, oversold conditions and resilience in select pockets present buying opportunities.” - Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research, Religare Broking</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the current pressure on the stock market can be attributed to global economic conditions, particularly the US Federal Reserve's recent statements on interest rates, prompting caution among investors.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Kyoto University</p>
<img src='path_to_image.jpg' alt='LignoSat Wooden Satellite' />
<figcaption>LignoSat, the first-ever wooden satellite, ready for launch.</figcaption>
<p>The LignoSat, a groundbreaking wooden satellite, has successfully entered Earth's orbit, representing a milestone in sustainable space technology.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The satellite was launched as part of a five-satellite CubeSat mission, reaching an altitude of approximately 400 kilometers.</li>
  <li>Constructed primarily from magnolia wood, LignoSat features unique design and joins techniques aimed at eco-friendliness.</li>
  <li>The mission explores the performance of wood in space's harsh conditions, contributing to future sustainable satellite designs.</li>
  <li>LignoSat could significantly reduce space debris, as wooden satellites are expected to fully burn upon re-entry.</li>
  <li>Kyoto University's research team aims to understand the resilience of wood as a viable alternative to traditional satellite materials.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Timber could be used to construct homes and workspaces in space,” said astronaut Takao Doi, emphasizing wood's potential for future space habitats.</blockquote>
<p>LignoSat's mission is a significant step towards sustainable space exploration, providing important data and insights for the future of space technology.</p>]]></description>

<p><figcaption>Puneet Khurana, owner of For God’s Cake bakery, was found hanging in his house in Model Town's Kalyan Vihar area. (Image: Twitter)</figcaption></p>

<p>Puneet Khurana, owner of For God’s Cake bakery, allegedly died by suicide amid an ongoing divorce dispute with his wife. He was found hanging in his house in Model Town’s Kalyan Vihar area. His family claimed that Puneet was "upset with his wife" and had been facing mental torture and harassment from her and her family.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The couple got married in 2016 and co-owned the bakery and another eatery called Woodbox Cafe.</li>
  <li>Puneet's last conversation was with his wife, discussing their bakery business. His family claims the wife recorded the conversation and sent it to her relatives.</li>
  <li>Puneet's sister accused his wife and her family of mental torture and harassment, with a 59-minute video recording as evidence.</li>
  <li>The case comes weeks after a similar incident involving a Bengaluru-based techie.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notable Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
"You are calling me at 3 am, can’t you sleep? You disrespected me and my family."
- Puneet Khurana's wife, as per India Today
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion: The incident has once again highlighted the issue of mental harassment and torture within marriages, with calls for stricter laws and better support systems for victims.</p>

<p>Lucknow woke up to a horrifying incident where a 24-year-old man, Arshad, allegedly murdered his mother and four sisters at a hotel, claiming he acted to "protect" his family from neighbors who planned to sell his sisters in Hyderabad.</p>
<ol>
<li>The family, originally from Agra, had been staying at the hotel since December 30 to celebrate New Year.</li>
<li>Arshad served his family food and alcohol laced with intoxicants before killing them.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant and the three shots that sunk India at MCG</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 30, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Cricket.com.au</p>
<p>In a dramatic final session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, India lost to Australia by 184 runs, after falling short at 155 while chasing 339. Key players Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant made critical errors that shifted the game's momentum.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pat Cummins hailed the win as the “best Test he has been part of”.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma questioned Rishabh Pant's shot selection, emphasizing the need for players to recognize risk percentages.</li>
  <li>Virat Kohli’s innings ended disappointingly as he chased a wide delivery.</li>
  <li>The match saw a record attendance of 373,691, the highest for a Test in Australia.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a sad moment, but not a surprise,” remarked commentator Jim Maxwell on Kohli's dismissal.</p></blockquote>
<p>India's performance showcased not just individual errors but also a missed opportunity to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy should they win the next game.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India Initiates Countervailing Duty Probe on Subsidized Vietnamese Chemical Imports</h1>
<p><strong>New Delhi, Dec 30 (PTI)</strong></p>
<img src='https://example.com/image.jpg' alt='DGTR Logo' width='200'><figcaption>DGTR Logo</figcaption>
<p>India has started a countervailing duty investigation into increased imports of Calcium Carbonate Filler Masterbatch, a chemical used in the plastic industry, from Vietnam. The move follows a complaint from domestic manufacturers who allege that the increased imports are subsidized, causing material injury to their businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has initiated the probe.</li>
<li>Domestic manufacturers have alleged that producers/exporters in Vietnam have received actionable subsidies from various levels of the Vietnamese government.</li>
<li>Countervailing duties are country-specific duties imposed to safeguard domestic industries against unfair trade subsidies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"On the basis of the duly substantiated written application filed by the domestic industry...on the basis of the prima facie evidence submitted by the domestic industry, about the subsidization of the product...the authority, hereby, initiates an investigation."</blockquote>
<p>Vietnam is a key trading partner of India, with exports and imports reaching USD 5.47 billion and USD 9.34 billion respectively in 2023-24.</p>]]></description>

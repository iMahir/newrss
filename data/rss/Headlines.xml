<p>Israel's ceasefire deal with Hamas was delayed as Prime Minister Netanyahu insisted on receiving a list of hostages. Simultaneously, military operations in Gaza continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ceasefire's first phase begins, with a series of hostage exchanges planned.</li>
<li>Netanyahu warns that the ceasefire will not take effect without a list of hostages from Hamas.</li>
<li>Israeli military continues attacks in Gaza despite the ceasefire agreement.</li>
<li>The deal involves releasing 33 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</li>
<li>Continued military operations have reportedly resulted in casualties in Gaza.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We reserve the right to resume the war if necessary, with American support.” – Netanyahu</blockquote>
<p>This situation is fluid, with the peace process remaining tenuous amid ongoing military actions and negotiations.</p>]]></description>

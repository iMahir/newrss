<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 13, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> CNBC TV18</p>
<img alt="Sierra Leone declares emergency after confirming second Mpox case in four days" title="Sierra Leone declares emergency after confirming second Mpox case in four days" loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/default.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=360">
<figcaption>Image illustrating the Mpox outbreak in Sierra Leone.</figcaption>
<p>Sierra Leone has declared a state of emergency after confirming its second case of Mpox within four days, as health authorities express concern over the rapid spread of the disease.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first case involved recent travel to the northern Port Loko District.</li>
  <li>Both patients are currently receiving treatment in Freetown.</li>
  <li>Mpox was first identified in 1958, historically affecting mostly people in central and West Africa.</li>
  <li>In 2022, Mpox was confirmed to spread through sexual intercourse, leading to outbreaks in over 70 countries.</li>
  <li>Sierra Leone was previously the epicentre of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, resulting in significant loss of life and healthcare workforce.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Congo has borne the brunt of the epidemic, with a vast majority of the roughly 43,000 suspected cases and 1,000 deaths in Africa this year."</blockquote>
<p>This situation poses a significant public health challenge, especially in the context of Sierra Leone's past experiences with epidemics.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a press conference, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal alleged that the BJP is distributing gold chains to buy votes in the upcoming Delhi assembly elections. He has urged voters not to sell their votes under any circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kejriwal claimed BJP leaders are openly attempting to buy votes with cash and gifts.</li>
<li>He warned voters against accepting any monetary incentives from political parties.</li>
<li>Kejriwal called out the BJP for not having a clear vision or chief ministerial candidate.</li>
<li>The AAP leader stated that the distribution of gifts is a tactic to manipulate voter behavior.</li>
<li>BJP's Manoj Tiwari accused Kejriwal of breaking his promise to avoid alliances.</li>

<p>This election is critical for the future political landscape of Delhi, and the accusations of vote buying raise significant questions about electoral integrity.</p>]]></description>

<li>This rare celestial event coincided with Mars being the closest to Earth since December 2022.</li>
<li>Mars reached opposition on January 15, making it fully illuminated.</li>
<li>The phenomenon was a visual illusion caused by the moon crossing the ecliptic plane.</li>
<li>Observers noted the relative distances: Mars was 59.7 million miles away while the moon was 224,000 miles distant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Mars appeared fully illuminated and brighter than at any other time since December 2022, despite being outshone by Venus.</blockquote>
<p>The 'Wolf Moon' is traditionally associated with January and has several alternative names, including the Stay Home Moon and Snow Moon, with the next full moon set for February 12, 2025.</p>]]></description>

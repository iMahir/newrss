<figcaption>The risk for cancers of the breast, the mouth and the throat may rise with consumption of as little as one drink a day, or even less, said Dr Murthy. (File Photo/Representational)</figcaption>
<p>US Surgeon-General Vivek Murthy has called for alcoholic beverages to carry cancer warning labels, highlighting evidence that no level of alcohol consumption is safe when it comes to cancer risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the US, following tobacco and obesity.</li>
  <li>Consumption of just one drink per day can increase the risk for several cancers including breast, mouth, and throat.</li>
  <li>Alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the WHO, with no safe level of consumption.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy's report states alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer.</li>
  <li>Dr Murthy draws parallels with India's anti-smoking campaigns as a model for addressing alcohol-related harm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Alcohol has been confirmed as a group 1 carcinogen... there is no safe level of alcohol,” - Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects a growing recognition of the health risks associated with alcohol consumption and aims to reduce the incidence of alcohol-related cancers.</p>]]></description>

<p>Australian opener Sam Konstas has come under fire for a heated argument with India captain Jasprit Bumrah during the SCG Test.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Konstas engaged in a furious exchange with Bumrah before Usman Khawaja's dismissal.</li>
  <li>The altercation led to India celebrating Khawaja's wicket and marked a tense finale to day one.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest Konstas' behavior may have distracted Khawaja from finishing the day's play smoothly.</li>
  <li>Adam Gilchrist criticized Konstas, highlighting the unusual and intense nature of the celebration from the Indian team.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"They're charging in from everywhere … All sorts of drama here," said Adam Gilchrist. "It was Bumrah who turned to Konstas. He learns a tough lesson in his second Test match."</blockquote>
<p>The incident has sparked widespread discussion and criticism among commentators and former players regarding the balance between confidence and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>January 2025: Donald Trump's hush money sentencing does not indicate any jail time. (AP)</figcaption>
<p>A judge has set Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money case for January 10, indicating he is unlikely to receive jail time, despite facing conviction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The judge, Juan M. Merchan, will sentence Trump just before he returns to the White House on January 20.</li>
  <li>Trump is set to become the first president to take office while convicted of a felony.</li>
  <li>Merchan dismissed Trump's appeal to overturn the verdict, citing no legal impediment to proceeding with the sentencing.</li>
  <li>The case revolves around payments made to silence allegations from Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Only by bringing finality to this matter will the interests of justice be served.” - Judge Juan M. Merchan</blockquote>
<p>The ruling is significant as it affects Trump's ability to maneuver politically ahead of his inauguration, raising questions about the broader implications of legal challenges for elected officials.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Union health ministry has addressed concerns regarding a potential outbreak of the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China, affirming that there has been no significant increase in viral respiratory illness cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The health ministry stated there’s “no substantial increase” in respiratory illness cases.</li>
<li>Dr. Atul Goel emphasized the commonality of the virus, akin to any other respiratory virus.</li>
<li>Monitoring of both seasonal influenza and respiratory cases is ongoing.</li>
<li>Precautionary measures against spread are advised for respiratory infections.</li>
<!-- More points can be added if needed -->
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is nothing to be alarmed about in the present situation,” said Dr. Goel.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, officials maintain that while attention to HMPV is warranted, the public can remain calm as the healthcare system is prepared and no alarming rise in cases has been noted.</p>]]></description>

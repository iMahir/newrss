<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully completed the docking process of the SpaDeX satellites, marking a significant achievement in space history.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The SpaDeX mission launched on December 30, 2024, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.</li>
  <li>This makes India the fourth country to achieve successful space docking.</li>
  <li>The docking was initiated using a manoeuvre from a distance of 15 meters to 3 meters.</li>
  <li>The PSLV C60 rocket carried two small satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target).</li>
  <li>The SpaDeX mission is intended as a cost-effective demonstration of in-space docking technology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"India docked its name in space history! Good Morning India ISRO’s SpaDeX mission accomplishes historic docking success. Proud to witness this moment!" - ISRO</blockquote>
<p>This accomplishment is seen as a significant stepping stone for India’s future ambitious space missions, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulating ISRO for their success.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Delhi Directorate of Education (DoE) has ordered all government and private schools to conduct hybrid classes for students up to Class 9 and Class 11 due to a severe dip in air quality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The air quality index (AQI) in Delhi rose sharply from 275 to 396.</li>
  <li>All schools must adopt 'Hybrid Mode' for classes up to Class IX and XI.</li>
  <li>Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been invoked, banning all construction activities and non-essential polluting trucks.</li>
  <li>Delhi's air quality index has now reached levels above 400, categorized as severe.</li>
  <li>Previous measures had resulted in schools moving to fully online classes, but hybrid classes have become necessary.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All Heads of Schools of Govt., Govt. Aided, Unaided Recognized Private Schools of DOE, NDMC, MCD and Delhi Cantonment Board are directed to conduct classes in schools for children up to Class IX &amp; XI in a 'Hybrid Mode'.”</blockquote>
<p>This action is part of the ongoing struggle against high pollution levels in the capital, demonstrating the impact of environmental issues on education.</p>]]></description>

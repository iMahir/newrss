<p>Joe Rogan has expressed genuine concern over unverified drone sightings in New Jersey after watching a viral TikTok video suggesting they may be searching for harmful substances.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rogan's comments came after observing a theory by John Ferguson, a CEO of a drone company, who speculated that drones might be detecting gas leaks or radioactive materials.</li>
<li>Despite reassurances from government officials that the drones are not a public safety threat, Rogan remains skeptical of these claims.</li>
<li>Various theories about the purpose of the drone sightings have emerged, including suggestions of foreign involvement.</li>
<li>Former President Donald Trump has also weighed in, urging authorities to disclose more information about the sightings and suggesting a more aggressive approach.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first video about these drones that has got me genuinely concerned.” – Joe Rogan</blockquote>
<p>Rogan’s reaction highlights the public's interest and concern regarding the safety implications of unidentified drone activity.</p>]]></description>

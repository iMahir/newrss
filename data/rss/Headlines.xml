<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>

<p>The ongoing political dynamics in India have spotlighted the BJP's shifting stance towards Dr. B R Ambedkar, especially amidst recent tensions in Parliament regarding remarks made by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The recent showdown in Parliament highlights the BJP's evolving stance on Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>The BJP seeks to attract all Hindu castes, including Dalits, into its political fold.</li>
  <li>The party’s engagement with Ambedkar is described as politically expedient, especially in competition with the weakened Congress.</li>
  <li>Ambedkar's history as a critic of the caste system complicates his place within Hindu nationalist politics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BJP has attempted to bring all Hindu castes, including Dalits, under the fold of Hindutva — constantly redefining its position on Ambedkar.”</blockquote>
<p>This transformation in the BJP's approach to Ambedkar reflects broader changes in India's political landscape and the party’s strategy to unify diverse groups under its ideology.</p>]]></description>

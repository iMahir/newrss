<figcaption>“HMPV not a threat”: Health experts urge caution</figcaption>
<p>Health experts have reported seven cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in India in just two days, but they urge the public not to panic as the virus typically causes mild infections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Five cases were reported recently, primarily affecting infants and toddlers.</li>
  <li>Former AIIMS chief Dr. Randeep Guleria emphasized that HMPV is a common virus that is self-limiting.</li>
  <li>Union Health Minister JP Nadda reassured that health authorities are monitoring the situation closely.</li>
  <li>WHO notes that HMPV is common during winter and spring, with no unusual outbreak patterns reported.</li>
  <li>States are preparing measures to tackle any potential outbreak while advising the public to remain calm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is not a very worrying virus. It is not the one that is prevalent in China.” - Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah</blockquote>
<p>The overall consensus among health officials is to maintain vigilance but also to practice normal safety measures without inducing fear.</p>]]></description>

<p>Former India coach Ravi Shastri has advised struggling cricketers Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to return to domestic cricket as they face challenges in their careers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kohli and Rohit have had disappointing performances in 2024, particularly in Test matches.</li>
  <li>Shastri believes they should play domestic cricket to regain form and contribute to younger players.</li>
  <li>Rohit has not played a domestic match since 2016; Kohli since 2012.</li>
  <li>Playing domestic cricket would help them improve their playing against spin, an area of struggle for India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If there's a gap for them, I think they should go back and play some domestic cricket and see how it is.” - Ravi Shastri</blockquote>
<p>Shastri emphasizes the importance of playing domestic cricket not just for personal revival but for the future of Indian cricket, highlighting the need for engagement with the current generation.</p>]]></description>

<p>After a disappointing loss against Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy, the BCCI will review the performance of senior players Kohli and Sharma, but they will remain in contention for upcoming series.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India lost 1-3 against Australia, raising questions on players' performances.</li>
  <li>Gautam Gambhir, head coach, and his staff will not be blamed for the defeat.</li>
  <li>A review meeting is planned, but no dismissals are anticipated.</li>
  <li>Kohli and Rohit, influential players, will continue to be considered for the Champions Trophy.</li>
  <li>Gambhir expresses confidence in Kohli and Rohit to overcome their recent struggles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They still have hunger and passion, they are tough people. Hopefully, they can continue to take Indian cricket forward,” said Gambhir.</blockquote>
<p>Despite past successes, India's recent struggles in Test cricket have prompted this review, with attention now turning to the forthcoming matches against England and the Champions Trophy.</p>]]></description>

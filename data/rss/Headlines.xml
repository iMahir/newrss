            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Cancer cases rising for women and younger adults in US, report finds</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified<br><strong>Source:</strong> American Cancer Society</p>
<p>Certain types of cancer, especially among women and younger adults, are on the rise according to a new report from the American Cancer Society. This marks a significant shift in cancer trends, particularly highlighting a higher diagnosis rate among women than men.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The report analyzes cancer rates in the US from 1991 to 2021.</li>
  <li>For the first time since the early 1900s, cancer diagnoses in women under 65 have surpassed those in men of the same age group.</li>
  <li>Over 2 million new cancer cases and 618,000 cancer deaths are anticipated this year.</li>
  <li>Breast cancer and thyroid cancer are notable increases for women.</li>
  <li>Native Americans are at a higher risk for certain cancers compared to white populations.</li>
  <li>Cancer mortality has decreased by 34% since 1991, largely due to technological advances and improved detection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Cancer is the number one leading cause of death for all folks under the age of 85,” - William Dahut, chief scientific officer for ACS.</blockquote>
<p>While the trends are concerning, the report points to progress in reducing cancer mortality through early detection and a societal decline in smoking. Continued efforts are essential to address disparities in cancer care.</p>]]></description>

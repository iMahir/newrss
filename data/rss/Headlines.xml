<p>Apple is planning to introduce foldable smartphone technology, including a potential iPhone with a larger display and a foldable laptop device, in an effort to revitalize sales and compete in an evolving market.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>In the fold:</b> Apple faces competition from Samsung's foldable devices, though recent sales have struggled.</li>
<li><b>Fold over:</b> The foldable smartphone market saw a significant growth of 49% recently, influenced by new brands like Motorola and Huawei's impressive sales.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Not phoning it in:</b> After a decline in sales, Apple announced a slight rebound in iPhone sales, but there are concerns that new models aren't meeting expectations.</p>
<p><b>More options can unlock more appeal:</b> By expanding the range of products with varied designs and prices, Apple hopes to attract both current and potential customers.</p>
<p>Apple's proposed innovations could help the company regain momentum in a saturated smartphone market, hinting at a transformative phase in their product lineup.</p>]]></description>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has unveiled a new strategy to enhance robotic exploration of Mars, proposing a series of smaller, science-driven missions to prepare for future human exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nasa's 20-year plan encourages low-cost missions at each launch opportunity.</li>
<li>The strategy introduces three key science themes: searching for life, supporting human exploration, and understanding Mars as a dynamic planetary system.</li>
<li>Smaller missions are expected to cost between $100 million and $300 million each and will focus on specific scientific questions.</li>
<li>The plan emphasizes collaboration with commercial and international partners.</li>
<li>Nasa's 2025 budget proposal includes $40 million for Mars robotic exploration technologies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We want to do that with lower-cost missions that are science driven and has the capability of providing flexible, rapid response to discoveries.” - Becky McCauley Rench</blockquote>
<p>This strategy is aimed at expanding our understanding of Mars and lays the groundwork for future human missions to the planet, emphasizing scientific inquiry and innovative partnerships.</p>]]></description>

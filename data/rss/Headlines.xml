<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date] | <strong>Source:</strong> Mint</p>
<p>As cases of HMPV (human metapneumovirus) emerge globally, doctors are leveraging social media and humor to calm public fears and educate about the virus.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HMPV cases reported in China sparked widespread panic, especially in Asia.</li>
    <li>India has confirmed 13 cases, including a recent case in a 9-month-old child from Gujarat.</li>
    <li>Medical professionals emphasize that HMPV is not a cause for mass panic.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The HMPV virus needn’t be a cause for panic or anxiety.”</blockquote>
<p>This initiative aims to educate the public in a more accessible and relatable manner amidst rising fears of respiratory viruses.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ram Charan in Game Changer (image courtesy of AA Films)</figcaption>
<p>Game Changer witnessed a significant drop at the Indian box office on its second day with collections plummeting to Rs. 24.50 crore, reflecting a 60% decline overall.</p>
<ul>
<li>The two-day cumulative box office gross stands at approximately Rs. 83.50 crore in India.</li>
<li>Telugu states experienced an over 70% drop, accumulating only Rs. 12 crore on the second day.</li>
<li>Tamil Nadu's performance was disappointing, grossing a mere Rs. 4 crore over the two days.</li>
<li>The film's fate was sealed even before release due to its high budget and insufficient pre-release recoveries.</li>
<li>Holiday opportunities in Telugu states may help, but expectations are low.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The drop on the second day has sealed the fate of the film.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, despite the holiday period, the financial prospects for Game Changer appear bleak as it grapples with poor box office performance.</p>

<p>After years of using the Apple Watch and launching into the Android market with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, the author realizes the importance of features like the digital crown that are absent from the Samsung watch.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensive experience with Apple Watch since its 2014 launch.</li>
  <li>Amazed at the absence of the digital crown in the Galaxy Watch Ultra after trying it for just 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Notes functionality differences between the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, particularly in outdoor and activity settings.</li>
  <li>Recommends that future versions of Samsung watches include a digital crown for improved user experience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The lack of a digital crown has made me question everything I thought I knew about smartwatches."</blockquote>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a strong contender in the smartwatch market but its missing digital crown poses a significant usability issue for those coming from Apple devices.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully brought its SpaDeX satellites, Chaser and Target, within 3 meters of each other in a recent trial aimed at demonstrating in-space docking technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mission, launched on December 30, aims to showcase in-space docking using small spacecraft.</li>
<li>If successful, India will join the ranks of the US, Russia, and China in mastering significant space docking technologies.</li>
<li>ISRO is being cautious with the docking process, focusing on accuracy over speed due to the mission's complexity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Getting it right is more important than getting it done on schedule.” - ISRO representative</blockquote>
<p>This trial demonstrates significant progress in ISRO's ambition to enhance its space exploration capabilities, including future missions to the Moon and the establishment of a space station by 2035.</p>]]></description>

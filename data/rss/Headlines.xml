<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1326279152.jpg?c=original" alt="When it comes to whether drinking coffee affects your health, when you consume it may matter, a new study suggests.">
<figcaption>Study suggests that drinking coffee in the morning may lower risk of premature death.</figcaption>
<p>Recent research indicates that limiting coffee intake to the morning may reduce the risk of early death, a relationship studied across a vast dataset.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drinking coffee has been linked to better heart health and prolonged life.</li>
<li>Research shows that morning coffee drinkers have a 16% lower risk of premature death.</li>
<li>The study analyzed data from 40,725 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</li>
<li>Consuming coffee all day long does not confer the same health benefits.</li>
<li>Researchers categorized coffee intake into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and evening.</li>
<li>Factors such as age, sex, and health conditions were considered in the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first study testing coffee drinking timing patterns and health outcomes.” - Dr. Lu Qi</blockquote>
<p>The findings of the research highlight the significance of when coffee is consumed, suggesting health guidelines might need to consider timing in the future.</p>]]></description>

<p>Donald Trump has criticized the fees imposed on U.S. ships using the Panama Canal and has threatened to reclaim control of the waterway if Panama does not manage it efficiently.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump labeled the fees for U.S. ships as "unfair" and "ridiculous." </li>
  <li>He indicated concerns about China's influence over the canal.</li>
  <li>He threatened to demand the Panama Canal be returned to U.S. control if Panama fails its responsibilities.</li>
  <li>The Panama Canal was returned to Panama in 1999 after a deal signed in 1977.</li>
  <li>The canal is crucial, with an estimated 5% of global maritime traffic passing through it.</li>
  <li>The Panama Canal Authority reported record revenues of nearly $5 billion for the last fiscal year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>Trump's statements reflect his ongoing influence even before officially taking office, positioning himself as a defender of U.S. business interests.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>Delhi’s AQI has dropped to 'severe' levels, significantly impacting health.</li>
  <li>Minimum temperature recorded at 8 degrees Celsius on Sunday.</li>
  <li>Cold wave has led to an increase in smog conditions in the city.</li>

<figcaption>Blake Lively reportedly has a rift with Justin Baldoni</figcaption>
<p>WME has severed ties with director Justin Baldoni after Blake Lively filed a lawsuit against him, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation. The lawsuit has raised severe allegations, leading to WME parting ways with Baldoni while still representing Lively.</p>
<ul>
  <li>WME ended its representation of Justin Baldoni following Blake Lively's lawsuit.</li>
  <li>Lively's allegations include sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during filming.</li>
  <li>The lawsuit details instances of unwanted touching, inappropriate comments, and creation of a hostile work environment.</li>
  <li>Baldoni's legal team has denied the allegations, labeling them as false and outrageous.</li>
  <li>Baldoni's team is accused of attempting to discredit Lively through a smear campaign as shown in text messages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The allegations against Baldoni are described as false, outrageous, and intentionally salacious.”</blockquote>
<p>The severance from WME indicates the gravity of the allegations, with ramifications likely affecting Baldoni's career in the industry.</p>]]></description>

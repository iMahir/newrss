<figcaption>Baby John Box Office Day 2 Early Estimates! (Photo Credit – Instagram)</figcaption>
<p>The action thriller <em>Baby John</em>, led by Varun Dhawan, faced a disappointing downturn in box office collections after a promising opening. Despite expectations, the film struggled against competition and mixed reviews.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Points:</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Day 1 box office: 11.25 crores</li>
  <li>Day 2 early estimates: 4-5 crores</li>
  <li>Overall collection for two days: 15.25-16.25 crores</li>
  <li>Film’s release coincided with the successful <em>Pushpa 2</em></li>
  <li>Daily drop in revenue between 55-64% indicating poor audience reception</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The mixed word-of-mouth is visibly impacting the footfall, and the film will soon crash if it does not maintain its hold tomorrow."</blockquote>
<p>Overall, <em>Baby John</em> has not met the expected box office performance, raising concerns for its future runs amidst stiff competition.</p>]]></description>

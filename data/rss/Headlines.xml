<p>A Saudi national has been arrested for a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg that left at least two dead and over 60 injured. The event occurred during busy shopping hours, and early evidence indicates it was a deliberate act.</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker drove into a crowded Christmas market, killing two people, including a toddler, and injuring at least 68 others.</li>
<li>The incident occurred around 7 PM and was witnessed by many holiday shoppers.</li>
<li>Emergency responders were quick to arrive on the scene, and the driver was arrested shortly after.</li>
<li>The suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian man who has lived in Germany since 2006.</li>
<li>He possessed a permanent residence permit and has been practicing medicine locally.</li>
<li>Authorities stress there is no further threat to the public as the suspect appears to have acted alone.</li>
<li>The motive for the attack is still under investigation, with no known links to extremist ideologies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know, there is no further danger to the city,” - Reiner Haseloff, Governor of Saxony-Anhalt.</blockquote>
<p>The attack resonates with a similar incident in Berlin in 2016 where a truck plowed into a market, resulting in multiple fatalities.</p>]]></description>

<p>Gukesh Dommaraju, at just 18 years old, returns to India after winning the World Chess Championship against Ding Liren, celebrated by fans reminiscent of major sports victories in the country. With over 80 grandmasters, India's chess community is thriving, akin to the dominance of the Soviet Union in earlier decades. However, Gukesh faces immediate challenges ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gukesh won the championship 7.5-6.5 in Singapore, marking a significant achievement for India.</li>
<li>The reception at Chennai Airport indicates the massive popularity of chess in India.</li>
<li>He will begin competing in major tournaments soon, including Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee in January.</li>
<li>Magnus Carlsen acknowledged Gukesh's potential but warned of future challenges from rivals.</li>
<li>Gukesh's development as a player will be closely watched, given the historical challenges faced by young champions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It’s a motivating factor, trying to reach the level of greatness that Magnus has achieved.” - Gukesh Dommaraju</blockquote>
<p>The future for Gukesh is uncertain, as many young champions have historically faced challenges in maintaining their success. His immediate focus will be on improving his game and competing against top-tier players.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption><em>Split decision</em></figcaption>
<p>A federal jury has ruled that Qualcomm’s acquisition of Nuvia did not breach its licensing agreement with Arm, though the issue regarding Nuvia's compliance remains unresolved.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A jury in Delaware found no breach by Qualcomm in its agreement with Arm regarding the Nuvia acquisition.</li>
  <li>The case has been ongoing for two years, arising from Arm's allegations of misuse of chip designs licensed to Nuvia.</li>
  <li>The jury could not decide on Nuvia’s potential breach, allowing for future litigation.</li>
  <li>Qualcomm acquired Nuvia for $1.4 billion to enhance its chip offerings.</li>
  <li>Internal documents suggested Qualcomm may save $1.4 billion annually in Arm royalty payments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The jury has vindicated Qualcomm’s right to innovate...” - Ann Chaplin, Qualcomm’s General Counsel</blockquote>
<p>This ruling marks a pivotal moment for Qualcomm, reaffirming its licensing strategies while leaving some legal questions open for further examination.</p>]]></description>

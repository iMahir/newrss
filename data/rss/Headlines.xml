<p>The world's first wooden satellite, LignoSat, has been successfully sent into Earth's orbit. Built by Kyoto University in partnership with Sumitomo Forestry, this innovative satellite aims to explore the sustainability of wood in space.</p>
<ul>
<li>LignoSat was launched alongside five CubeSats, reaching a height of 400 km above Earth.</li>
<li>The satellite is constructed from 10 cm-long hinoki magnolia wood panels, utilizing a traditional Japanese wood-joinery method that eliminates the need for screws and glue.</li>
<li>Weighing approximately 900 grams, LignoSat will investigate wood's performance in space, especially under extreme temperature fluctuations.</li>
<li>The mission seeks to assess the feasibility of using wood for future lunar and Mars exploration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever," - Takao Doi, Astronaut</blockquote>
<p>Research conducted during this mission could pave the way for more sustainable manufacturing materials in satellite and space construction.</p>]]></description>

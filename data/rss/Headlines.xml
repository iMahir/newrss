<figcaption>Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44, the highest since August 27.</figcaption>
<p>Oil prices have risen to their highest level in over three months due to new US sanctions targeting Russian oil exports, affecting key importers like China and India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels shipping Russian oil.</li>
  <li>Brent crude futures reached $81.11 a barrel and peaked at $81.44, the highest since August 27.</li>
  <li>US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $77.97 a barrel after a high of $78.32.</li>
  <li>The sanctions aim to cut revenue that funds Russia's war efforts in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44."</blockquote>
<p>This escalation in oil prices highlights the impact of geopolitical tensions and ongoing sanctions on global markets.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Maha poll victory has ended Pawar’s ‘politics of deceit’, says Amit Shah(Devendra Fadnavis-X)</figcaption>
<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah praised the BJP's significant victory in Maharashtra's assembly elections, asserting it will have lasting effects on national politics and end the deceitful tactics of opposing leaders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shah highlighted that the victory gives a response to Sharad Pawar's politics of deceit, which began in 1978.</li>
<li>The BJP aims to remain "unconquerable" in future elections, according to Shah.</li>
<li>Shah declared that this victory will be remembered for the next 25 years in India's political history.</li>
<li>He emphasized that voters have reinforced their support for Modi's development agenda.</li>
<li>Shah criticized Pawar's leadership, citing failures to address issues like drought and suicide in Maharashtra.</li>
<li>He claimed that the INDIA alliance is fracturing, pointing to internal conflicts among its members.</li>
<li>Shah announced a goal for India to be Naxal-free by March 31, 2026.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The electoral victory (in Maharashtra) has buried the politics of betrayal that started by Sharad Pawar in 1978.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Amit Shah's statements underscore a confidence in the BJP's trajectory moving forward, while making a clear reference to the decline of Sharad Pawar's influence in Maharashtra politics.</p>]]></description>

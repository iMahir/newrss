<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 20 Dec 2024, 6:23 am</p>

<figcaption>The Moon started out molten and then cooled down, only to be reheated roughly 100 million years later. This heating event could have reset most of the ages recorded by lunar rocks. - Francis Nimmo</figcaption>
<p>The study discusses how new perspectives on the Moon's history may change scientists' understanding of its formation. The research explores tidal heating effects and challenges existing estimations concerning the Moon's age.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Moon's formation is linked to a Mars-sized object colliding with Earth.</li>
  <li>Initial Moon rocks suggest the Moon is about 4.35 billion years old, but this may not reflect its actual age.</li>
  <li>The research proposes that tidal heating might reset radiometric clocks in lunar rocks.</li>
  <li>Further analysis and samples from ongoing lunar missions may provide clarity on the Moon's formation timeline.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the Moon warmed up enough, its clocks would lose their memory and would start recording time only once the Moon cooled down again.”</blockquote>
<p>The implications of these findings could reshape our understanding of planetary formation and the early solar system's dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The US Capitol is pictured ahead of a vote on a revised continuing resolution bill in Washington, DC.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The US government faces a shutdown as lawmakers are unable to agree on a temporary funding plan amidst a significant debt ceiling crisis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Republican-led House rejected a temporary funding plan backed by President-elect Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>The bill failed with a vote of 235 to 174, reflecting division among Republicans.</li>
  <li>Trump is demanding a provision to raise the debt limit be included in any funding legislation.</li>
  <li>If the debt ceiling is not raised, it could lead to default and severe economic disruption.</li>
  <li>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson faces pressure as he navigates this critical issue.</li>
  <li>Key figures like Representative Chip Roy and Elon Musk have influenced the debate, voicing strong criticisms of proposed plans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To congratulate yourself because it’s shorter in pages but increases the debt by $5 trillion is asinine." - Representative Chip Roy</blockquote>
<p>As the deadline approaches, the nation awaits a resolution to avert a government shutdown and its possible repercussions.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>BJP MPs stage a protest alleging insult of Dr B R Ambedkar by the Congress party, at Parliament complex in New Delhi on Thursday. (Photo: PTI)</figcaption>
<p>The ongoing political dynamics in India have spotlighted the BJP's shifting stance towards Dr. B R Ambedkar, especially amidst recent tensions in Parliament regarding remarks made by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The recent showdown in Parliament highlights the BJP's evolving stance on Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>The BJP seeks to attract all Hindu castes, including Dalits, into its political fold.</li>
  <li>The party’s engagement with Ambedkar is described as politically expedient, especially in competition with the weakened Congress.</li>
  <li>Ambedkar's history as a critic of the caste system complicates his place within Hindu nationalist politics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BJP has attempted to bring all Hindu castes, including Dalits, under the fold of Hindutva — constantly redefining its position on Ambedkar.”</blockquote>
<p>This transformation in the BJP's approach to Ambedkar reflects broader changes in India's political landscape and the party’s strategy to unify diverse groups under its ideology.</p>]]></description>

Of the 35 monitoring stations listed on the government's Sameer app, Rohini, RK Puram, Sirifort, Dwarka Sector 8, Wazirpur were among those that recorded an AQI of over 450.</li><li>As per the CPCB, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good,' 51-100 'satisfactory,' 101-200 'moderate,' 201-300 'poor,' 301-400 'very poor,' 401-450 'severe,' and above 450 'severe plus.'</li><li>On Thursday, the city saw dangerously high levels of PM2.5, the primary pollutant, with 32 of the 35 monitoring stations recording air quality in the severe plus category. Some areas recorded AQI readings as high as 470. The PM2.5 particles, measuring 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, pose significant health risks as they can penetrate deep into the lungs when inhaled.</li></ul><blockquote>Delhi remains under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which includes the most stringent anti-pollution measures.

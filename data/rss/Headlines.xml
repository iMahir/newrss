            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why Modi govt 3.0 is maintaining an arm’s length from protesting farmers</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has indicated a distant approach from the ongoing farmers' protests led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, unlike the proactive measures taken during Modi's previous term.</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers have been protesting since February 2024 at the Punjab-Haryana borders, demanding legal status for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and a farm debt waiver.</li>
<li>Chouhan has extended an open invitation for talks, yet has not engaged directly with the protesting farmers.</li>
<li>The government's previous attempts to resolve farmer grievances, particularly in 2020-21, led to escalated tensions and prolonged protests.</li>
<li>Current protests are more localized and lack the broad unity seen in earlier movements.</li>
<li>Jagjit Singh Dallewal, president of BKU Sidhupur, is on a hunger strike demanding response to farmers' issues from the government.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Currently, the Supreme Court is looking into this issue. Whatever directives the Supreme Court gives, will be followed.” - Shivraj Singh Chouhan</blockquote>
<p>This current strategy marks a significant shift in the government's handling of farmer-related issues, emphasizing a more detached stance in contrast to previous direct engagements.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Union health ministry reassures the public that India is well-prepared to handle respiratory infections as reports of HMPV cases in China rise. The ministry describes the situation as not unusual.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Joint Monitoring Group meeting was held to assess the rising respiratory illness cases.</li>
  <li>Experts from WHO, IDSP, and other organizations participated in the deliberations.</li>
  <li>The ministry attributes the surge to seasonal pathogens such as Influenza virus, RSV, and HMPV.</li>
  <li>No significant increase in Influenza Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) cases in India.</li>
  <li>ICMR will enhance testing for HMPV and monitor trends throughout the year.</li>
  <li>Health systems are described as vigilant and prepared for any health challenges.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"There is nothing to be alarmed about in the present situation." - Dr. Atul Goel, DGHS</blockquote>
<p>In summary, India's health infrastructure is well-equipped to manage any respiratory illness increases, ensuring public health safety during the flu season.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Government Proposes Extension for Pharma Industry Compliance Deadline</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Saturday, January 4, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Economic Times</p>
<p>The government has issued a draft notification proposing to extend the deadline for compliance with the revised Schedule M in the pharmaceutical sector, responding to industry concerns regarding infrastructure upgrades.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The deadline extension is aimed at small and medium manufacturers with a turnover of less than 250 crores.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers can apply for an extension until December 31, 2025, by submitting an upgrade plan.</li>
  <li>Nearly half of the 10,000 drug manufacturing units face challenges in meeting the current compliance deadline.</li>
  <li>The revised Schedule M requires improvements in manufacturing practices and quality management systems.</li>
  <li>The government has acknowledged the industry's call for a two-year extension due to procurement delays and other challenges.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We have liberalised our scheme to specifically help the MSME upgrade their quality standards to revised Schedule M.” - Arunish Chawla, Former DoP Secretary</blockquote>
<p>This notification will be finalized after public comments are considered within the next seven days.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Struggling with 'this' while brushing? It could be a sign of dementia</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses how difficulty in performing everyday tasks, such as brushing teeth, may indicate dementia, particularly a condition known as apraxia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apraxia refers to the inability to perform learned motor tasks despite the individual wanting to and being physically able to do so.</li>
<li>Dr. Richard Restak emphasizes recognizing small changes early for timely care and support.</li>
<li>The article outlines the "Four A’s" of Alzheimer's: Amnesia, Aphasia, Agnosia, and Apraxia.</li>
<li>Amnesia includes memory loss and confusion, often seen in early stages of dementia.</li>
<li>Aphasia affects language skills, causing difficulties in communication.</li>
<li>Agnosia refers to trouble recognizing familiar objects or people.</li>
<li>Caregivers can significantly support individuals by breaking tasks into simpler steps and ensuring a safe environment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A person with apraxia may be able to recognise and even name a toothbrush and toothpaste but may be unable to carry out the act of squeezing the toothpaste onto the toothbrush.” - Dr. Richard Restak</blockquote>
<p>Early detection and understanding of these signs can improve the quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers.</p>]]></description>

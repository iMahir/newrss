<p>Lucknow woke up to a horrifying incident where a 24-year-old man, Arshad, allegedly murdered his mother and four sisters at a hotel, claiming he acted to "protect" his family from neighbors who planned to sell his sisters in Hyderabad.</p>
<ol>
<li>The family, originally from Agra, had been staying at the hotel since December 30 to celebrate New Year.</li>
<li>Arshad served his family food and alcohol laced with intoxicants before killing them.</li>
<li>Arshad recorded a video after the crime, explaining his actions and showing the bodies.</li>
<li>Police have detained Arshad, and his father remains at large.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our neighbours were trying to take over our property and planned to sell my sisters in Hyderabad. I couldn’t let that happen," Arshad purportedly said in the video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Police are reviewing CCTV camera footage to trace Arshad’s father and bring him to justice.</p>]]></description>

<p>Amid criticism, Rishabh Pant coped several blows to his body, steering India to 107/4 at Tea on Day 1 of the 5th Test against Australia in Sydney. Pant was unbeaten on 32 off 80 balls while Jadeja was batting alongside him on 50.</p>
<ul>
<li>India suffered a significant blow with Virat Kohli's dismissal, caught in the slips.</li>
<li>At the end of the first session, India lost Shubman Gill on the final delivery.</li>
<li>KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal also fell cheaply for India.</li>
<li>Scott Boland emerged as the standout bowler for Australia, taking two wickets.</li>
<li>@Jasprit Bumrah was acting captain in place of @Rohit Sharma who opted out of the match.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It's a tough situation for India right now as they have lost key wickets early on.”</blockquote>
<p>As the day progresses, the focus remains on how Pant and Jadeja can build a stronger partnership to recover the innings.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>Start your day with warm lemon water to boost hydration and reduce inflammation.</li>
  <li>Spend time laughing to release endorphins and improve blood vessel function.</li>
  <li>Swap phone scrolling for a brisk 10-minute walk after meals to lower blood sugar.</li>
  <li>Practice deep breathing for one minute every few hours to reduce stress.</li>
  <li>Snack on nuts instead of chips for better heart health.</li>
  <li>Replace late-night coffee with herbal tea to support relaxation and heart health.</li>
  <li>Keep a gratitude journal to lower stress and improve mood.</li>
</ul>

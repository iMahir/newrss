<figcaption>Maha poll victory has ended Pawar’s ‘politics of deceit’, says Amit Shah(Devendra Fadnavis-X)</figcaption>
<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah praised the BJP's significant victory in Maharashtra's assembly elections, asserting it will have lasting effects on national politics and end the deceitful tactics of opposing leaders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shah highlighted that the victory gives a response to Sharad Pawar's politics of deceit, which began in 1978.</li>
<li>The BJP aims to remain "unconquerable" in future elections, according to Shah.</li>
<li>Shah declared that this victory will be remembered for the next 25 years in India's political history.</li>
<li>He emphasized that voters have reinforced their support for Modi's development agenda.</li>
<li>Shah criticized Pawar's leadership, citing failures to address issues like drought and suicide in Maharashtra.</li>
<li>He claimed that the INDIA alliance is fracturing, pointing to internal conflicts among its members.</li>
<li>Shah announced a goal for India to be Naxal-free by March 31, 2026.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The electoral victory (in Maharashtra) has buried the politics of betrayal that started by Sharad Pawar in 1978.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Amit Shah's statements underscore a confidence in the BJP's trajectory moving forward, while making a clear reference to the decline of Sharad Pawar's influence in Maharashtra politics.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Paracetamol poses gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks for seniors: Study</figcaption>
<p>A new study from the University of Nottingham highlights the potential risks of repeated paracetamol use in individuals aged 65 and older, linking it to serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study analyzed health records of 180,483 seniors over a 20-year period.</li>
    <li>Repeated paracetamol usage (≥2 prescriptions within six months) was associated with increased risks of peptic ulcers, heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.</li>
    <li>Paracetamol, traditionally seen as a safe pain reliever, can cause liver toxicity, especially in older adults.</li>
    <li>The findings were published in the journal Arthritis Care and Research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Due to its perceived safety, paracetamol has long been recommended as the first line drug treatment for osteoarthritis by many treatment guidelines, especially in older people who are at higher risk of drug-related complications." - Professor Weiya Zhang</blockquote>
<p>This study raises critical questions about the safety of long-term paracetamol use in older adults, urging a reevaluation of treatment guidelines.]]></description>

<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has expressed that his political career has been significantly influenced by the Gandhi family, both positively and negatively, and has offered insights on the party's leadership decisions over the years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar claims his political career was “made and unmade” by the Gandhi family.</li>
    <li>He stated that he had limited personal interactions with Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>Aiyar believes if Pranab Mukherjee had become Prime Minister in 2012, the Congress would have performed better in the 2014 elections.</li>
    <li>He recalled feeling surprised when Sonia Gandhi remarked, "I’m not a Christian" during a Christmas greeting.</li>
    <li>Aiyar's upcoming book 'A Maverick in Politics' discusses these political dynamics and his experiences.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Aiyar reflects on his complex relationship with the Gandhi family while emphasizing the pivotal role of Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership in Congress's political fortunes.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How intermittent fasting could lead to hair loss</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 13, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Cell Press</p>
<p>Kilos are not the only thing that intermittent fasting will help you shed. A new study shows that the wildly popular weight-loss method could also inhibit hair growth.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intermittent fasting is a time-restricted diet where participants consume calories in an 8-12 hour window.</li>
    <li>Benefits include weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved diabetes control.</li>
    <li>A 2023 survey reported that over 12% of respondents in the US are practicing intermittent fasting.</li>
    <li>Research linked intermittent fasting to a 91% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.</li>
    <li>Disruptions in sleep cycles and gastric issues are also associated with intermittent fasting.</li>
    <li>A recent study shows a link between intermittent fasting and hair loss by inhibiting hair follicle regeneration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Commonly used intermittent fasting regimens inhibit hair follicle regeneration by selectively inducing apoptosis [programmed cell death] in activated hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs)…”</blockquote>
<p>Researchers found that mice on intermittent fasting exhibited slower hair regeneration, and similar effects were observed in a small human trial, albeit likely less severe in humans.</p>
<p>The study suggests that hair growth inhibition occurs because HFSCs cannot handle the oxidative stress from switching energy sources during fasting.</p>
<blockquote>“During fasting, adipose tissue starts to release free fatty acids...but these stem cells don’t have the right machinery to use them,” - Bing Zhang, senior author and stem cell biologist.</blockquote>
<p>Further research is needed to understand the effects of intermittent fasting on hair loss across different individuals.</p>]]></description>

<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/15/550x309/PTI12-14-2024-000217A-0_1734255937782_1734255986267.jpg" alt="New Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi,(PTI)" title="New Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi,(PTI)">
<figcaption>New Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi,(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the Congress party's stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), arguing that they cannot reject EVMs after losses while celebrating wins with the same machines.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah addressed the Congress's doubts about EVMs following defeats in the Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly polls.</li>
    <li>He stated that one cannot selectively trust EVMs based on election outcomes.</li>
    <li>Abdullah encouraged parties to remain consistent in their views on voting mechanisms.</li>
    <li>He defended the Central Vista project, stating it was necessary for a new Parliament building.</li>
    <li>Reports indicate rising tension between the National Conference (NC) and Congress, particularly after recent elections in Jammu and Kashmir.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs, and you celebrate that as sort of a victory for your party, you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to." — Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>Abdullah's comments indicate growing friction within the INDIA alliance and highlight the need for party leaders to consistently support their electoral processes. His advocacy for principles over partisan loyalty bolsters his political stance amid rising tensions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>My Career Made, Then Unmade By Gandhis: Mani Shankar Aiyar's Big Claim</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Press Trust of India</p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has claimed that the Gandhi family played a significant role in both his political rise and subsequent marginalization within the party.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar stated, "The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis."</li>
    <li>He expressed frustration over a lack of substantial engagement with key members of the Gandhi family over the years.</li>
    <li>Aiyar mentioned he did not have the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi for a decade and had only limited interactions with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>He recalled needing to ask Priyanka to convey birthday wishes to Rahul during a period of his suspension from the party.</li>
    <li>Aiyar wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi seeking clarity on his suspension but received no acknowledgment.</li>
    <li>He reflected on the political environment in 2012 during crises for both Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh, noting Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership during that time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi.”</blockquote>
<p>This interview sheds light on the complex dynamics within the Congress party and highlights Aiyar's personal experiences regarding his political journey influenced by the Gandhi family.</p>]]></description>

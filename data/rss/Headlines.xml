<figcaption>Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma (Getty Images)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent press conference, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir praised Rohit Sharma for prioritizing the team's needs over his personal batting form during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which India lost 1-3 to Australia.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma missed the first Test to be with his family for the birth of his second child.</li>
  <li>He batted in the middle order for two Tests to maintain the opening partnership but struggled with scores of 3 and 6.</li>
  <li>His return to the opening position in the fourth Test did not improve his score, adding just 11 runs.</li>
  <li>Eventually, he rested for the final Test after a prolonged slump in form.</li>
  <li>Gambhir emphasized Rohit’s accountability, stating, "To keep the dressing room happy, I have to be honest and fair to everyone." </li>
  <li>The loss against Australia means India missed out on the World Test Championship final and ended a decade-long hold on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Rohit Sharma showed accountability at the top," said Gautam Gambhir.</blockquote>
<p>This series loss highlights the challenges the Indian cricket team is currently facing as they undergo a transitional phase.</p>]]></description>

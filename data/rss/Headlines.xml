<img width="1200" height="720" src="https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hubble.jpg" alt="Hubble reveals ‘Bat Shadow’ around nebula">
<figcaption>Hubble space telescope</figcaption>
<p>Astronomers have uncovered a fascinating shadow in space, captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, reflecting the birth of planetary systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>The shadow, dubbed the ‘Bat Shadow’, is cast by a young star named HBC 672 located in the Serpens Nebula, about 1,300 light-years away.</li>
<li>This shadow spans approximately 200 times the length of our solar system.</li>
<li>Astronomers believe that our solar system may have once produced a similar shadow during its formation.</li>
<li>The shadow indicates an edge-on view of the disk, revealing its shape and gas content.</li>
<li>It provides valuable insights into the size and composition of dust grains in the protoplanetary disk.</li>
<li>Infrared observations allow scientists to see these shadows, which are otherwise invisible in visible light.</li>
<li>The discovery showcases the collaborative efforts of NASA and ESA in space exploration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The presence of a shadow means that the disk is being viewed nearly edge-on.”</blockquote>
<p>This remarkable discovery not only enhances our understanding of star formation but also reinforces the collaborative spirit of international space research.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Balanced vegetarian diets for aspiring athletes: What you need to know</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses how vegetarian diets can effectively meet the nutritional needs of aspiring athletes, emphasizing critical nutrients for performance and recovery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vegetarian athletes often struggle to meet protein, iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acid needs.</li>
<li>Plant proteins from whole grains, quinoa, lentils, and beans can help fulfill protein requirements.</li>
<li>Combining vitamin C-rich foods with iron-rich meals can enhance iron absorption.</li>
<li>Vitamin B12 can be obtained from supplements or fortified foods like plant-based milks.</li>
<li>Sources of calcium and omega-3s include tofu, almonds, leafy greens, and flaxseeds.</li>
<li>A balanced vegetarian diet should focus on whole foods, seasonal fruits, healthy fats, and electrolyte-rich drinks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A balanced, whole-food-based vegetarian diet is crucial for aspiring athletes.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, athletes considering a vegetarian diet must be mindful of their nutritional intake to ensure optimal performance and recovery.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Delhi High Court reprimands AAP government for mishandling CAG report. (PTI FILE PHOTO)</figcaption>
<p>The Delhi High Court has reprimanded the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for mishandling a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), accusing it of delaying necessary discussions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The court stated that the AAP government “dragged its feet” to prevent an assembly session from taking place.</li>
    <li>Justice Sachin Datta highlighted that reports should have been promptly forwarded to the Speaker for discussion.</li>
    <li>The Delhi government argued that upcoming elections hindered the holding of assembly sessions.</li>
    <li>Seven BJP MLAs petitioned to table 14 CAG reports in the assembly, claiming their right to engage with the documents.</li>
    <li>The court declined to immediately order a special assembly session, emphasizing the need for both parties to be heard first.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The way you have dragged your feet raises doubts about your bona fides.” – Justice Sachin Datta</blockquote>
<p>This judicial rebuke highlights concerns about government accountability and the implications for democratic processes leading up to elections.</p>]]></description>

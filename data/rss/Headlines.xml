            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Which infectious disease is likely to be biggest emerging problem in 2025</h1>
<p><strong>Updated: December 26, 2024</strong> | <strong>The Conversation</strong></p>
<img alt="Bird Flu Concern" title="H5N1 Bird Flu" src="https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/wire-updates/pti-preview-theweek.jpg">
<figcaption>Concerns rise over H5N1 bird flu as a potential pandemic threat.</figcaption>
<p>As COVID-19 recedes, health officials are increasingly worried about the potential rise of H5N1 bird flu in 2025, coupled with ongoing issues from malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The top infectious disease threats include malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, which together account for around 2 million deaths annually.</li>
<li>Bird flu (H5N1) is currently a major concern due to recent infections in cattle and the potential for transmission to humans.</li>
<li>61 human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US in 2024, largely among farm workers.</li>
<li>The H5N1 virus has a high mortality rate of 30% in human cases but does not currently spread efficiently between people.</li>
<li>A mutation could allow H5N1 to adapt to humans, raising the risk of a pandemic.</li>
<li>Countries like the UK are preparing by purchasing vaccines against H5N1 in case of an outbreak.</li>
<li>Interconnected health approaches are emphasized to address both animal and human health risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If this strain of bird flu makes that switch and can start transmitting between humans, governments must act quickly to control the spread."</blockquote>
<p>The urgency in addressing bird flu stems from its potential to disrupt animal health and have economic ramifications, highlighting the importance of proactive measures in pandemic preparedness.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a robust defense of Amit Shah, Prime Minister Modi refuted Congress' claims of insults to B.R. Ambedkar, asserting that Shah exposed the party’s historical disrespect towards the Constitution’s architect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modi emphasized that Congress is trying to obscure their history of insults to Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>The Prime Minister accused the Congress of using theatrics to distract from the facts presented by Shah.</li>
  <li>Mr. Modi mentioned the longstanding issues faced by Ambedkar’s legacy under Congress rule.</li>
  <li>He cited various government initiatives that align with Ambedkar's vision for social justice.</li>
  <li>Protests occurred in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha related to the controversy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They can try as they want but they can't deny that the worst massacres against SC/ST Communities have happened under their regimes.” - PM Modi</blockquote>
<p>The Prime Minister's remarks highlight ongoing tensions between the BJP and Congress, focusing particularly on historical narratives surrounding prominent leaders like Ambedkar.</p>]]></description>

<p>Aamir Khan Productions has issued an official statement following the exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> from the Oscars 2025 shortlist for Best International Feature Film. The Film Federation of India’s decision to bypass the Kiran Rao-directed satire sparked significant backlash among cinephiles and industry figures alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film, which critiques the patriarchy in rural India, was critically acclaimed but not shortlisted for the Oscars.</li>
<li>Aamir Khan Productions expressed disappointment but emphasized gratitude for the support received.</li>
<li>The statement highlighted the honor of being considered among the finest films globally, despite the snub.</li>
<li>Critics have raised concerns about the selection criteria of the Film Federation of India.</li>
<li>The situation has drawn attention back to Payal Kapadia’s Cannes-winning film, <i>All We Imagine As Light</i>, viewed as India’s strongest contender.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Laapataa Ladies did not make it to the Academy Awards shortlist this year, and we are of course disappointed, but equally we are immensely grateful for the incredible support and belief we’ve received throughout this journey.”</blockquote>
<p>The exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> adds another chapter to India’s contentious history with the Academy Awards.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Significant changes to the H-1B visa program were unveiled by the Biden administration to improve application efficiency and compliance. New eligibility requirements and streamlined processes are set to begin on January 17, 2025, offering a critical path for international professionals to work in the U.S.</figcaption>
<p>The Biden administration has announced reforms to the H-1B visa program aimed at streamlining the application process and curbing abuses within the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new rules will take effect on January 17, 2025, requiring a new application form, I-129.</li>
<li>Applicants must show that their degree field is directly relevant to the job tied to the visa.</li>
<li>Immigration officials can defer to prior approvals for extension requests, streamlining renewals.</li>
<li>The USCIS gains enhanced authority for workplace inspections to ensure compliance with H-1B regulations.</li>
<li>Filing fees remain substantial: $780 for paper submissions and $730 for online, while small employers and nonprofits face a reduced fee of $460.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These updates aim to make the H-1B process more efficient and ensure it meets the needs of our evolving economy.” - DHS</blockquote>
<p>This overhaul could have a lasting impact on the program and how international students and professionals navigate the visa process.</p>]]></description>

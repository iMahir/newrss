<p>The outbreak of cholera in Yemen has escalated significantly, with around 250,000 suspected infections reported, highlighting the dire humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yemen has reported 250,000 suspected cholera infections and 861 deaths as of December 1, 2024.</li>
  <li>There has been a 37% increase in cases and a 27% rise in the death rate in November 2024 compared to the previous year.</li>
  <li>The cholera outbreak is exacerbated by Yemen's prolonged conflict, economic struggles, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure.</li>
  <li>A significant funding gap of $20 million threatens to close essential treatment facilities, including diarrhea treatment centers.</li>
  <li>The WHO is collaborating with local authorities to address the outbreak through various interventions, including improving laboratory capacities and training health workers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Waterborne diseases like cholera and acute watery diarrhea have added immense pressure on Yemen’s already struggling health system.” - Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen</blockquote>
<p>This cholera surge poses a significant risk to the population, with millions requiring urgent humanitarian assistance amidst systematic challenges.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>NIFTY50 rebounds from its 200 EMA.</figcaption>
<p>The NIFTY50 index began the week positively after ending a five-day losing streak, yet it displayed signs of indecision with a doji candlestick pattern. Traders should keep an eye on the levels from December 20 to determine future direction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asian markets showed minor gains in the morning.</li>
  <li>U.S. indices continued to rise, particularly driven by semiconductor stocks.</li>
  <li>NIFTY50 closed above 200 day EMA, but formed a doji pattern suggesting indecision.</li>
  <li>Traders should watch for breaks above or below December 20’s high and low for signals.</li>
  <li>FIIs sold shares worth ₹168 crore; DIIs bought shares worth ₹2,227 crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The trend may remain range-bound unless the index breaks this range.”</blockquote>
<p>This analysis highlights the indecisiveness in the market while suggesting that crucial levels from recent sessions must be monitored for decisive movements.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Centre's decision to eliminate the ‘no detention policy’ for Classes 5 and 8 has been met with resistance from the Tamil Nadu government, which will continue its current policy to support underprivileged students.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Union government scrapped the ‘no detention policy’, allowing failure in year-end exams for Classes 5 and 8.</li>
  <li>Tamil Nadu education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi criticized the decision as detrimental to underprivileged students.</li>
  <li>The state will draft its own State Education Policy and maintain automatic promotions for its schools.</li>
  <li>At least 18 states and Union Territories have already abolished the ‘no detention policy’.</li>
  <li>No child can be expelled from any school until completing elementary education.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The current method of no detention policy will continue,” said Tamil Nadu's Education Minister.</blockquote>
<p>Despite the Centre's changes, Tamil Nadu remains committed to its educational practices aimed at supporting less privileged students.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Centre's decision to eliminate the ‘no detention policy’ for Classes 5 and 8 has been met with resistance from the Tamil Nadu government, which will continue its current policy to support underprivileged students.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Union government scrapped the ‘no detention policy’, allowing failure in year-end exams for Classes 5 and 8.</li>
  <li>Tamil Nadu education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi criticized the decision as detrimental to underprivileged students.</li>
  <li>The state will draft its own State Education Policy and maintain automatic promotions for its schools.</li>
  <li>At least 18 states and Union Territories have already abolished the ‘no detention policy’.</li>
  <li>No child can be expelled from any school until completing elementary education.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The current method of no detention policy will continue,” said Tamil Nadu's Education Minister.</blockquote>
<p>Despite the Centre's changes, Tamil Nadu remains committed to its educational practices aimed at supporting less privileged students.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Vitamin D has no role to play in preventing fractures: New Research</figcaption>
<p>New research from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) indicates that Vitamin D supplements do not prevent falls or fractures in older adults.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The USPSTF recommends against taking Vitamin D with or without calcium for older adults aged 60 and over who live at home.</li>
  <li>Falling is a primary cause of injury in older adults, but increases in risk of kidney stones have been noted with unnecessary supplementation.</li>
  <li>Effective preventive services for falls include screening for osteoporosis and structured exercise programs.</li>
  <li>The recommendations do not apply to those taking Vitamin D for medical reasons or individuals diagnosed with conditions affecting Vitamin D absorption.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Unfortunately, when we reviewed the latest evidence, we found that taking vitamin D with or without calcium does not prevent falls or fractures in older adults.” - John M. Ruiz, Ph.D., USPSTF member.</blockquote>
<p>The findings emphasize the need for alternative preventive methods for maintaining bone health in older adults.</p>]]></description>

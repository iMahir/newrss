<p>Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent speech in Parliament, describing it as unoriginal and boring, likening the experience to a tedious double mathematics class.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Priyanka Gandhi Vadra called PM Modi's address “double period of mathematics” and “boring”.</li>
    <li>She expressed disappointment, stating there was nothing new in his remarks.</li>
    <li>During the speech, PM Modi accused the Nehru-Gandhi family of undermining the Constitution throughout their rule.</li>
    <li>Modi emphasized that the Congress family's actions during their governance have had lasting negative impacts on Indian democracy.</li>
    <li>The Prime Minister recalled serious events, such as the Emergency, to highlight Congress's historical failures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“(JP) Nadda ji was also rubbing hands but as soon as Modi ji looked at him, he started acting as if he is listening attentively. Amit Shah also had his hand on head, (Piyush) Goyal ji was going off to sleep... I had thought that the PM will say something new, something nice.” - Priyanka Gandhi Vadra</blockquote>
<p>The exchanges in Parliament highlight ongoing tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, reflecting broader debates about governance and historical accountability in India.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A torn poster shows ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad at the entrance of the notorious security detention centre called Palestine Branch, in Damascus, Syria, Saturday, Dec. 14, 2024.(AP)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the final hours of Bashar al-Assad's rule in Syria, detailing his secretive plans to flee the country amidst collapsing power and escalating rebel control.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assad's departure was planned and executed without informing key aides and family members.</li>
    <li>On the eve of his flight, he assured military chiefs of Russian support while masking the true dire situation.</li>
    <li>He fled to Russia on December 8, 2024, after disguising the flight under radar.</li>
    <li>Significant unrest in Damascus accompanied Assad's departure, with civilians celebrating the fall of his regime.</li>
    <li>There were no military rescue efforts from Russia or Iran despite previous support during the civil war.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Assad didn't even make a last stand. He didn't even rally his own troops," said Nadim Houri, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bashar al-Assad's flight marked the end of his 24-year rule and the demise of his family's long-standing power, leaving a pivotal moment in Syria's tumultuous history.]]></description>

<figcaption>Dr SK Sarin, Director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences at Agenda Aaj Tak event.</figcaption>
<p>Liver specialist Dr SK Sarin emphasized that popular weight-loss medications should only be used under strict medical supervision, warning that these drugs are primarily beneficial for the wealthy due to their high costs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dr Sarin advocates for healthier lifestyle choices over reliance on medications for weight loss.</li>
    <li>Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic (semaglutide) enhance metabolic processes but can lead to side effects.</li>
    <li>Dr Sarin believes exercise and an active lifestyle remain the best methods for weight management.</li>
    <li>Increased calorie intake can lead to serious health complications such as fatty liver disease.</li>
    <li>Weight-loss drugs may have significant side effects, including gastrointestinal issues and rapid weight regains.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The best method for most people is still to exercise, burn calories, and lead an active lifestyle.” - Dr SK Sarin</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These drugs are not a magic solution. Once you stop taking them, weight gain often resumes rapidly.” - Dr Naresh Trehan</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, both doctors underline the importance of sustainable lifestyle changes, as opposed to solely relying on weight-loss drugs which come with potential risks and complications.</p>]]></description>

<p>NASA has made significant discoveries regarding Io, the most volcanically active body in our solar system, providing answers to longstanding questions about its volcanic activity.</p>

<ul>
    <li>NASA's Juno mission revealed that Io’s volcanoes are powered by individual magma chambers, not a global magma ocean.</li>
    <li>The findings end a 44-year-old mystery regarding the intense geological activity of Io.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate that Io's volcanic activity is influenced by its unique orbit around Jupiter, causing heat through gravitational interactions.</li>
    <li>New high-resolution images show volcanic features and fresh lava flows on Io's surface.</li>
    <li>Juno completed its 66th flyby over Jupiter and is scheduled for its next close approach in late December 2024.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a recent Parliament debate, Rahul Gandhi emphasized the importance of social justice, invoking Eklavya from the Mahabharata to criticize the Modi government's policies affecting marginalized communities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gandhi addressed a debate on the Constitution's 75-year journey, focusing on social justice and equitable representation.</li>
    <li>He criticized Hindutva ideologue Savarkar's views on the Constitution, quoting him on Manusmriti's relevance to Indian culture.</li>
    <li>Gandhi used Eklavya’s story to illustrate how the government is stifling the potential of marginalized youth.</li>
    <li>He called for a nationwide caste census and the removal of the 50% quota ceiling.</li>
    <li>The Congress leader linked current government favoritism to the hardships faced by disadvantaged groups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Like Dronacharya cut the thumb of Eklavya, you are cutting the thumbs of India’s youngsters."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rahul Gandhi's speech highlights the ongoing struggle for social justice in India, calling attention to systemic inequalities and advocating for reforms to empower marginalized communities.]]></description>

<figcaption>J&amp;K chief minister Omar Abdullah (File photo/ANI)</figcaption>
<p>Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the dual governance model in Jammu and Kashmir, describing it as a "recipe for disaster," and called for the restoration of statehood in the region.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah expressed cautious optimism regarding the central government's commitment to restore statehood, citing previous promises from Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah.</li>
    <li>He emphasized that having multiple power centres leads to inefficiency, using sports leadership as an analogy.</li>
    <li>Abdullah highlighted the lack of benefits from Union Territory status since taking office and criticized the idea of dual governance, referencing Delhi's arrangement.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court has ordered assembly elections by September and called for statehood restoration "at the earliest" by December 2023.</li>
    <li>He mentioned plans for a backup strategy if statehood isn't restored but chose not to disclose details.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "Let me just say this, having two power centres anywhere is a recipe for disaster... No organisation works well if there are multiple power centres." – Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Abdullah’s remarks reflect a strong stance against the current governance structure in Jammu and Kashmir, insisting on the need for restoring its statehood to ensure effective administration and representation.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fintech’s New Fuel: Venture Debt Takes Centre Stage Amid a Funding Crunch</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Company Business News</p>
<p>As venture capital investments into India’s financial technology sector plunged this year, fintech companies are increasingly turning to venture debt as an alternative funding source.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Venture debt allows early-stage companies to raise capital without diluting equity.</li>
  <li>Venture debt is becoming more prevalent as venture capital becomes scarce due to regulatory oversight.</li>
  <li>Despite the rise of venture debt, venture capital remains the primary financing method for startups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Venture debt is essentially a high-interest loan advanced to early stage companies that want to raise capital without diluting equity."</blockquote>
<p>The growing use of venture debt highlights a shift in the fintech funding landscape caused by changing regulatory dynamics.</p>]]></description>

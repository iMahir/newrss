<p>Israel conducted strikes on strategic locations in Yemen after intercepting a missile fired by Houthi rebels. The Israeli Defense Minister warned the Houthis that they would also be targeted.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Israeli military targeted ports and energy facilities used by Houthi rebels.</li>
  <li>Houthi media reported casualties and damage to infrastructure in Sanaa and Hodaidah.</li>
  <li>This action is part of an ongoing conflict where Houthis have launched multiple missiles towards Israel.</li>
  <li>Israeli officials characterized the Houthis as a significant threat, echoing concerns about Iranian support for the group.</li>
  <li>Israel's military stated it would respond to threats from any group in the region.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I warn the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organisation: Israel's long arm will reach you too," - Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz.</blockquote>
<p>This escalation underscores the growing regional tensions as the Houthis align their operations with the conflict in Gaza, promising to continue attacks until a ceasefire is achieved.</p>]]></description>

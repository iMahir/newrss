<p>India has formally protested China's recent establishment of two new counties in Hotan prefecture, reaffirming that such actions do not challenge India's sovereignty over the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>On January 3, 2024, India lodged a protest with China regarding the creation of new counties.</li>
<li>The Ministry of External Affairs emphasized that this action does not legitimize China's illegal occupation of Indian territory.</li>
<li>Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reiterated India's longstanding position on sovereignty and the illegality of China's occupation.</li>
<li>India is also monitoring the situation concerning other geopolitical issues, such as the sentencing of Ms. Nimisha Priya in Yemen.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Creation of new counties will neither have a bearing on India’s long-standing and consistent position regarding our sovereignty over the area nor lend legitimacy to China’s illegal and forcible occupation.” - Randhir Jaiswal</blockquote>
<p>This protest highlights the ongoing tensions between India and China regarding territorial disputes and sovereignty issues.</p>]]></description>

<p>In all likelihood, Rohit Sharma has played his last Test for India. The selectors are also set to have a discussion with Virat Kohli regarding his future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rohit Sharma opted to "rest" for the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.</li>
<li>He has been informed that he is not part of the selectors' plans beyond the Australia tour.</li>
<li>His recent performance in Tests has been poor with scores of 3, 6, 10, 3, and 9.</li>
<li>The selectors will also discuss Virat Kohli's future after the series.</li>
<li>Ravindra Jadeja is expected to remain in the team's plans during this transition period.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Obviously, our captain (Rohit) has shown his leadership as well. He’s opted to rest in this game. So that shows that there’s a lot of unity in our team. There’s no selfishness. Whatever is in the team’s best interest, we’re looking to do that." - Jasprit Bumrah</blockquote>
<p>This decision marks a significant transition period for Indian cricket as the selectors plan for the future of the team.</p>]]></description>

  <li>They originate from asteroid-like 2003 EH1, a fragment of a comet.</li>
  <li>Known for their sharp peak, they can produce bright meteors that may appear blue.</li>
  <li>The meteors radiate from near Boötes and the Big Dipper’s handle.</li>
  <li>Best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere, away from city lights.</li>
  <li>Quadrantids travel at approximately 41 km/s (25 miles per second).</li>
  <li>First observed in the 1820s and named after the now-defunct Quadrans Muralis constellation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The Quadrantids are known for their sharp peak, lasting only a few hours, but they can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under ideal conditions.</blockquote>
<p>Tonight’s viewing conditions could offer impressive displays for those in favorable locations, making it a perfect time for astronomy enthusiasts.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date Here]</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has called on the University Grants Commission to provide data regarding the establishment of Equal Opportunity Cells in higher educational institutions following a PIL concerning caste discrimination.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The court seeks data from universities along with complaints received and actions taken.</li>
  <li>Issues raised include the number of universities with Equal Opportunity Cells and their monitoring by the UGC.</li>
  <li>Concerns were highlighted about caste-based discrimination leading to student suicides.</li>
  <li>The petition was filed by the mothers of Rohit Vemula and Payal Tadvi, who suffered from caste discrimination.</li>
  <li>The court emphasized the need for a mechanism to enforce existing regulations aimed at preventing discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Ultimately it is in the interest of the students and the parents whose children have lost their lives. In the future, atleast some care should be taken that this doesn't happen.”</blockquote>

<p>Rohit Sharma's absence from the playing XI in Sydney signals a potential shift in the Indian cricket team's direction, as selectors look beyond him for future red-ball cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rohit Sharma was not included in the team for the Sydney Test, suggesting a significant change in the selectors' strategy post-Australia tour.</li>
  <li>Head coach Gautam Gambhir and the selectors communicated their plan, indicating a transition in leadership with upcoming series.</li>
  <li>Rohit's recent performance raised concerns, leading to a decision to rest him amidst struggles with the bat.</li>
  <li>Stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah addressed the team’s unity during the toss, acknowledging Rohit’s choice to rest.</li>
  <li>Former players anticipate this may mark Rohit's last Test as selectorial decisions lean towards younger talent for future events including the Champions Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I think it probably means that (if) India don’t qualify for the WTC final, the Melbourne Test will be Rohit Sharma’s last game.” - Sunil Gavaskar</blockquote>
<p>The decision regarding Rohit Sharma's role in the team reflects a broader strategy of transitioning to new players, signaling an ending of an era in Indian Test cricket.</p>]]></description>

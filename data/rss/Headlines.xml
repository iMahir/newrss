<figcaption>Paracetamol poses gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks for seniors: Study</figcaption>
<p>A new study from the University of Nottingham highlights the potential risks of repeated paracetamol use in individuals aged 65 and older, linking it to serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study analyzed health records of 180,483 seniors over a 20-year period.</li>
    <li>Repeated paracetamol usage (≥2 prescriptions within six months) was associated with increased risks of peptic ulcers, heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.</li>
    <li>Paracetamol, traditionally seen as a safe pain reliever, can cause liver toxicity, especially in older adults.</li>
    <li>The findings were published in the journal Arthritis Care and Research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Due to its perceived safety, paracetamol has long been recommended as the first line drug treatment for osteoarthritis by many treatment guidelines, especially in older people who are at higher risk of drug-related complications." - Professor Weiya Zhang</blockquote>
<p>This study raises critical questions about the safety of long-term paracetamol use in older adults, urging a reevaluation of treatment guidelines.]]></description>

<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has expressed that his political career has been significantly influenced by the Gandhi family, both positively and negatively, and has offered insights on the party's leadership decisions over the years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar claims his political career was “made and unmade” by the Gandhi family.</li>
    <li>He stated that he had limited personal interactions with Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>Aiyar believes if Pranab Mukherjee had become Prime Minister in 2012, the Congress would have performed better in the 2014 elections.</li>
    <li>He recalled feeling surprised when Sonia Gandhi remarked, "I’m not a Christian" during a Christmas greeting.</li>
    <li>Aiyar's upcoming book 'A Maverick in Politics' discusses these political dynamics and his experiences.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Aiyar reflects on his complex relationship with the Gandhi family while emphasizing the pivotal role of Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership in Congress's political fortunes.]]></description>

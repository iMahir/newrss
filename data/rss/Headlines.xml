<p>AMD has announced its Ryzen Z2 processors, a refresh of the Ryzen Z1 lineup tailored for handheld gaming PCs, with three new models set for release in early 2025.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Ryzen Z2 Extreme enhances CPU and GPU architectures for improved performance.</li>
  <li>The new lineup includes eight CPU cores and a powerful RDNA 3.5 GPU.</li>
  <li>The base Ryzen Z2 appears similar to the Ryzen Z1 Extreme but retains its core specifications.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These should both provide small bumps to CPU and GPU performance relative to the Ryzen Z1 Extreme.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, with the launch of Ryzen Z2 CPUs, AMD aims to elevate the gaming handheld experience, but potential buyers should consider which variant offers the best value.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption><em>Behold this home. Only someone who lives here could manage to afford a MicroLED display.</em> <cite>Image: Hisense</cite></figcaption>
<p>Hisense showcases its new large-scale TVs at CES, featuring the 136-inch MicroLED and the 116-inch TriChroma LED TV, aiming to enhance home theater experiences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 136-inch MicroLED 136MX is touted as a consumer-ready MicroLED display but remains high-end and expensive.</li>
  <li>Hisense claims the 136MX represents a significant step towards making cutting-edge display technology more accessible.</li>
  <li>The TV uses over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs for exceptional brightness and quality without the risk of burn-in.</li>
  <li>The new TriChroma LED TV utilizes RGB Local Dimming Technology to achieve a vibrant color spectrum and high brightness levels.</li>
  <li>The TriChroma is reported to cover 97% of the BT.2020 color space, making it superior in color vibrance among Mini LED displays.</li>
  <li>No pricing or release date information is available yet for the TriChroma TV.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The 136MX builds on Hisense’s legacy of display innovation, leveraging a high-density array of over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs to deliver unparalleled brightness, resolution, and precision.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both TVs aim to redefine viewing experiences, but they remain high-end options for most consumers.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>New research links millions of annual new cases of diabetes and heart disease to sugary beverages, with significant impacts in developing countries. Urgent global measures are recommended to tackle this growing health threat.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> A new study from Tufts University highlights the alarming rise of diabetes and heart disease linked to sugary drink consumption, particularly in developing nations.</p>
<ul>
<li>2.2 million new cases of type 2 diabetes and 1.2 million new cases of cardiovascular disease are linked to sugary drinks globally each year.</li>
<li>In Sub-Saharan Africa, sugary beverages contribute to more than 21% of new diabetes cases.</li>
<li>Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa report significant diabetes cases linked to sugary drink consumption.</li>
<li>Urgent interventions, including public health campaigns and sugary drink regulations, are recommended.</li>
<li>Mexico's sugar tax implemented in 2014 has shown early success in reducing sugary drink consumption.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We need urgent, evidence-based interventions to curb consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages globally, before even more lives are shortened by their effects on diabetes and heart disease.” – Laura Lara-Castor</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the study underscores the severe health implications of sugary drinks and the necessity for global action to protect public health.</p>]]></description>

<p>Google has unveiled a new ambient mode for Google TV devices that allows them to detect when a person enters a room and display relevant information like news and weather without any input from the user.</p>

  <li>Existing presence detection features offered by competitors like Amazon and Sony are noted.</li>
  <li>Google aims to make its TVs more of a living room hub, enhanced by AI upgrades with Gemini models.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Our vision is that this can be something so much more," - Jamieson Brettle, Google product manager.</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming Google TV products that support this feature are expected to launch later this year.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>US to impose sanctions on Russian oil fleet and traders, document shows</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 10, 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Reuters</p>
<img src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NZODG5TJ6NJQPO6SYU6TPCAFGM.jpg?auth=50def6aea4db6d1b18605d3761adf490a12b52ab6024d0d4cdd87de4ded40742&amp;width=4000&amp;quality=80" alt="Illustration shows pump jack in the front word 'Sanctions', U.S. and Russia flag colours">

<p>The United States plans to impose stringent sanctions on Russia's oil industry, affecting around 180 ships and multiple traders. This move follows ongoing tensions due to the Ukraine war and could significantly disrupt Russian oil exports to major buyers like India and China.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanctions target around 180 ships, dozens of traders</li>
<li>Gazprom Neft, Surgut, ship insurers added to the list</li>
<li>Biden team had sought to avoid price spike</li>
<li>New Trump administration has said will seek to end Ukraine war</li>
<li>Reuters could not immediately verify the document</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>According to the document, the U.S. Treasury would allow a transition period to March 12, allowing some energy-related transactions to be completed.</blockquote>
<p>This action represents a significant escalation in U.S. efforts to minimize Russia's capacity to fund its military actions through oil exports.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>(Image: Canva)</figcaption>
<p>A woman in her early 70s was admitted to a hospital in the UK after suffering heat stroke due to a 45-minute sauna session. Her body temperature soared to 107.6°F, significantly surpassing normal levels, leading to severe health complications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The woman fainted after her sauna session and was hospitalized.</li>
  <li>Her elevated body temperature posed risks of brain damage.</li>
  <li>Vital signs showed reduced blood pressure and accelerated heart rate.</li>
  <li>Diagnosed with severe exertional heat, she required immediate treatment.</li>
  <li>After treatment, her temperature normalized, but she faced significant health threats.</li>
  <li>She made a full recovery after 12 days in the hospital, without need for advanced organ support.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If not treated within an hour, heat stroke can be fatal leading to death."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the dangers of prolonged heat exposure is crucial, as immediate actions can save lives in heat stroke situations.</p>]]></description>

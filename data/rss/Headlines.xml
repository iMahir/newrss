<figcaption>Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi during a press conference in New Delhi, India, on Monday, January 13.(Hindustan Times)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent press conference, Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi labeled Pakistan as the “epicentre” of terrorism, adding that a significant percentage of active militants in Jammu and Kashmir are of Pakistani origin. He emphasized that troop levels along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will not be reduced this winter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gen Dwivedi stated that 80% of terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir are from Pakistan.</li>
  <li>The Army has received emergency procurement powers for counter-terror operations amidst increasing infiltration attempts from Pakistan.</li>
  <li>There has been a rise in terrorist activities particularly in North Kashmir and the Doda-Kishtwar region.</li>
  <li>Despite the escalation in attacks, the 2021 ceasefire agreement with Pakistan remains intact.</li>
  <li>The situation with China at the LAC is described as sensitive but stable, with no troop cuts planned.</li>
  <li>Trust-building measures are ongoing, and troop deployment reviews can happen before summer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“In recent months, increased terrorist activities were seen in North Kashmir. Last year, 60% of the terrorists eliminated were of Pakistan origin.” - General Upendra Dwivedi</blockquote>
<p>The emphasis on a balanced military deployment along the LAC suggests a proactive stance by the Indian Army, maintaining readiness for any potential conflict while also addressing the challenges posed by terrorism.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Sonu Sood’s Fateh sees a significant drop in box office collection.</figcaption>
<p>Sonu Sood's directorial debut, Fateh, has faced a disappointing box office performance, failing to reach even Rs. 1 crore on its fourth day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film opened with Rs. 2.4 crores but has dramatically dropped since then.</li>
  <li>Day 4 collection was only Rs. 85 lakhs, with total earnings so far at Rs. 7.60 crore.</li>
  <li>Despite promotional efforts and a reduced ticket price, the film struggled to attract viewers.</li>
  <li>Fateh is competing against Ram Charan’s Game Changer, which has grossed Rs. 97 crore in the same period.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Sonu Sood’s directorial debut delves deep into the pervasive threat of cybercrime, a modern plague wreaking havoc in India.”</blockquote>
<p>The film's lack of connection in storytelling has impacted its reception, despite strong action sequences and a relevant theme.</p>]]></description>

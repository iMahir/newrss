            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Cancer cases rising for women and younger adults in US, report finds</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified<br><strong>Source:</strong> American Cancer Society</p>
<p>Certain types of cancer, especially among women and younger adults, are on the rise according to a new report from the American Cancer Society. This marks a significant shift in cancer trends, particularly highlighting a higher diagnosis rate among women than men.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The report analyzes cancer rates in the US from 1991 to 2021.</li>
  <li>For the first time since the early 1900s, cancer diagnoses in women under 65 have surpassed those in men of the same age group.</li>
  <li>Over 2 million new cancer cases and 618,000 cancer deaths are anticipated this year.</li>
  <li>Breast cancer and thyroid cancer are notable increases for women.</li>
  <li>Native Americans are at a higher risk for certain cancers compared to white populations.</li>
  <li>Cancer mortality has decreased by 34% since 1991, largely due to technological advances and improved detection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Cancer is the number one leading cause of death for all folks under the age of 85,” - William Dahut, chief scientific officer for ACS.</blockquote>
<p>While the trends are concerning, the report points to progress in reducing cancer mortality through early detection and a societal decline in smoking. Continued efforts are essential to address disparities in cancer care.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Image illustrating the link between red meat consumption and cognitive decline.</figcaption>
<p>A new study has found a significant correlation between increased consumption of red meat, particularly processed varieties, and a heightened risk of cognitive decline and dementia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Study involved 133,771 individuals monitored for up to 43 years.</li>
<li>Processed red meats (e.g., bacon and sausages) linked with a 13% higher risk of dementia.</li>
<li>Replacing processed red meat with healthier options like nuts and fish may reduce dementia risk.</li>
<li>Participants eating unprocessed red meat showed no significant difference in dementia risk when compared across serving amounts.</li>
<li>Each additional serving of processed red meat was associated with 1.61 years of faster brain aging.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Reducing how much red meat a person eats and replacing it with other protein sources and plant-based options could be included in dietary guidelines to promote cognitive health.” - Dong Wang, MD, ScD</blockquote>
<p>This research emphasizes the importance of dietary choices for maintaining cognitive health and suggests further exploration into diverse population impacts.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Image depicting the increase in norovirus infections.</figcaption>
<p>Norovirus cases have surged recently, raising concerns among health authorities. This increase is attributed to a new strain, GII.17[P17], responsible for a significant portion of recent outbreaks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The CDC reported 91 norovirus outbreaks in just one week, marking the highest number recorded in recent years.</li>
  <li>The GII.17 strain has been linked to nearly 70% of these outbreaks.</li>
  <li>Experts are uncertain if this strain causes more severe disease but suspect lower immunity is a contributing factor.</li>
  <li>Common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, fever, headache, and body aches.</li>
  <li>Preventive measures include washing hands with soap and hot water, as hand sanitizers are less effective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease,” said Jan Vinjé, PhD, Head of the CDC's National Calcivirus Laboratory.</blockquote>
<p>This increase in norovirus cases highlights the importance of hygiene and awareness about the virus, especially during the winter months when such infections tend to spike.</p>]]></description>

  <li>This marks Williams' eighth spacewalk throughout her career.</li>
  <li>The spacewalk comes after a previous one was aborted due to safety concerns with the astronaut suits.</li>
  <li>Future plans include another spacewalk with astronaut Butch Wilmore next week.</li>

A recent publication by a global group of experts in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology calls for a paradigm shift in obesity diagnosis.</p><ul><li>A new approach suggests looking beyond BMI and incorporating additional measures of body fat as well as assessing individual health conditions.</li><li>This method aims to address shortcomings of the BMI system, which often leads to inadequate care.</li><li>Experts aim to clarify the longstanding debate on whether obesity should be classified as a disease.</li><li>Given that over one billion people globally are affected by obesity, the proposal emphasizes a universal definition focused on health.</li><li>The recommended changes are intended to enhance support from healthcare systems worldwide.</li></ul><blockquote>“This approach aims to fix problems with the old way of defining and diagnosing obesity, which often left people without the care they needed.”</blockquote><p>The Lancet Commission's suggestions mark a significant shift in how obesity is diagnosed and treated, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, individualized healthcare solutions to address a growing global health concern.</p>]]></description>

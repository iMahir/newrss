<p>California is grappling with raging wildfires in Los Angeles, resulting in significant destruction and loss of life. Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned remarks by Elon Musk suggesting looting has been decriminalized.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 11 people have died due to the wildfires, and approximately 12,000 structures have been destroyed.</li>
<li>Authorities estimate damage costs could reach as high as $150 billion.</li>
<li>Evacuations are in effect for over 150,000 residents as air quality severely deteriorates.</li>
<li>Newsom has doubled the deployment of National Guardsmen to assist with wildfire responses.</li>
<li>The Los Angeles area has struggled with insufficient water supply for firefighting efforts.</li>
<li>Noteworthy personalities, including Disney CEO Bob Iger, have pledged substantial aid for recovery efforts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Stop encouraging looting by lying and telling people it’s decriminalized. It’s not. It’s illegal as it always has been.” - Governor Gavin Newsom</blockquote>
<p>The situation remains critical as wildfires continue to blaze and officials warn of potential future flare-ups.</p>]]></description>

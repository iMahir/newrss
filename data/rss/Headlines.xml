            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Stock market crash: Sensex cracks 1200 points, Nifty 50 below 23,700; HMPV virus scare among 5 factors behind selloff</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>The Indian stock market witnessed a significant crash on Monday, with both Sensex and Nifty 50 indices falling over a percent due to investor fears sparked by a new virus outbreak in China. The Sensex dropped over 1,100 points, while Nifty 50 slipped below the 23,700 mark.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sectoral indices, including Nifty PSU Bank and Nifty Realty, experienced major losses.</li>
  <li>Top losers included Tata Steel, BPCL, and Adani Enterprises.</li>
  <li>The fall attributed to weak Asian markets, a virus outbreak, heavy losses in index heavyweights, strength of the US dollar, and broken technical support levels.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Nifty holds a good view until it stays above its 200 DMA which is placed at 23,900.” - Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd.</blockquote>

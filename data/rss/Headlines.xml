<p>Aimed at facilitating advanced research on diabetes, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in collaboration with the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) has set up the country’s first diabetes biobank in Chennai.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The biobank will gather, process, store, and distribute biospecimens for scientific studies.</li>
  <li>A variety of blood samples from different types of diabetes have been stored for future studies.</li>
  <li>The initiative aims to identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and develop personalized treatment strategies.</li>
  <li>A government study indicated a rising prevalence of diabetes among the general population in India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The biobank could help in the identification of novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and the development of personalised treatment strategies.” - Dr. V. Mohan</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>NASA releases long-term strategy for robotic Mars exploration</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 11, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> NASA</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has unveiled a new strategy to enhance robotic exploration of Mars, proposing a series of smaller, science-driven missions to prepare for future human exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nasa's 20-year plan encourages low-cost missions at each launch opportunity.</li>
<li>The strategy introduces three key science themes: searching for life, supporting human exploration, and understanding Mars as a dynamic planetary system.</li>
<li>Smaller missions are expected to cost between $100 million and $300 million each and will focus on specific scientific questions.</li>
<li>The plan emphasizes collaboration with commercial and international partners.</li>
<li>Nasa's 2025 budget proposal includes $40 million for Mars robotic exploration technologies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We want to do that with lower-cost missions that are science driven and has the capability of providing flexible, rapid response to discoveries.” - Becky McCauley Rench</blockquote>
<p>This strategy is aimed at expanding our understanding of Mars and lays the groundwork for future human missions to the planet, emphasizing scientific inquiry and innovative partnerships.</p>]]></description>

<p>TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have requested the US Supreme Court to prevent an impending government ban that would occur next month, citing supportive remarks from President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok seeks to delay the law's enforcement until the court reviews its appeal.</li>
<li>The ban is set to take place on January 19, the day before Trump's inauguration.</li>
<li>Trump's future enforcement actions may influence the ban as it relates to national security and user privacy.</li>
<li>TikTok claims the ban could harm free speech rights protected under the First Amendment.</li>
<li>Content creators have also joined TikTok in asking the Supreme Court to intervene.</li>
<li>Lawmakers argue the legislation is necessary to prevent espionage by China.</li>
<li> TikTok's user base has grown significantly, with a survey showing 17% of US adults regularly sourcing news from the platform.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It would not be in the interest of anyone — not the parties, the public, or the courts — for the act’s ban on TikTok to take effect...” - TikTok</blockquote>
<p>This legal battle underscores the intersection of technology, national security, and free expression in the digital age.</p>]]></description>

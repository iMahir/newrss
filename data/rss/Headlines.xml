<figcaption>Feeding children ultra-processed foods like cereals and ready meals leads to shrinking jaw sizes, increasing risks of dental deformities such as buck teeth, warns a study by the Catholic University of Valencia.</figcaption>
<p>Feeding children ultra-processed foods leads to shrinking jaw sizes and increases the risk of dental deformities. This shift to soft, hyper-palatable diets reduces necessary chewing and impacts jaw development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>University researchers warn about the risks tied to ultra-processed foods.</li>
  <li>Eating habits shift from 'hunter-gatherer' diets to modern convenience foods.</li>
  <li>Toddlers in the UK derive half of their calories from ultra-processed foods.</li>
  <li>Studies show reduced chewing leads to dental issues like buck teeth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Chewing plays a crucial role in the proper development of the jaws as it stimulates bone growth, strengthens facial muscles, and promotes proper dental alignment.” - Laura Marques Martinez</blockquote>
<p>Ultra-processed foods are also linked to several health risks, emphasizing the importance of diet on children's dental and overall health.</p>]]></description>

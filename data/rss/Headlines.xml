</figure>
<p>Over the next few weeks, a stunning parade of planets will glow across the night sky, putting on a celestial spectacle that both amateur and seasoned stargazers can easily observe. All month, four planets — Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars — will appear to line up and be bright enough to see with the naked eye in the first few hours after dark, according to NASA.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Venus and Saturn will appear very close together on Friday and Saturday.</li>
  <li>Mars is at 'opposition' this month, making it appear bigger and brighter.</li>
  <li>Jupiter will shine high overhead during the viewing time.</li>
  <li>Uranus and Neptune can be seen through binoculars or telescopes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"These multi-planet viewing opportunities aren't super rare, but they don't happen every year, so it's worth checking it out," - NASA</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the planetary lineup this January offers a unique opportunity for skywatchers to witness a spectacular celestial event.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The remarks by the bench came while discharging a bank manager of charge of abetting the suicide of a man who allegedly took his own life after being unable to repay the loan that he had availed from the bank. (Express File/Amit Mehra)</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that invoking abetment of suicide charges must not be done mechanically to comfort the deceased’s family. This judgment emphasizes the necessity of a higher legal threshold before such charges are applied.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The court discharged a bank manager accused of abetting a suicide linked to loan repayment issues.</li>
  <li>It criticized the casual application of Section 306 IPC by police, advocating for stricter adherence to legal standards.</li>
  <li>Justice Viswanathan emphasized genuine cases must not be overlooked while cautioning against procedural abuses.</li>
  <li>The court stated that emotional outbursts should not be interpreted as instigation to suicide.</li>
  <li>The decision sets a precedent for how law enforcement and courts should approach suicides connected to debt disputes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To attract the ingredient of Section 306, the accused should have abetted the commission of a suicide.”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling seeks to prevent the misuse of suicide abetment charges and ensure that only those responsible for instigating suicide face legal consequences.</p>]]></description>

<p>Sanju Samson has been performing exceptionally well in T20 internationals, scoring three centuries in his last five innings. Despite this, he may not be included in India's squad for the Champions Trophy, according to Harbhajan Singh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Samson has a T20I average of 56 and three recent centuries.</li>
<li>His lack of participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy may affect his selection.</li>
<li>Harbhajan Singh believes that performance in one format should be considered for other formats.</li>
<li>Samson's exemplifying performance brings into question the selectors' decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If a person is scoring three centuries in five matches, that means that he is in a zone where he can't be stopped.” - Harbhajan Singh</blockquote>
<p>The discussion around Samson's exclusion raises questions about the criteria utilized for selection, particularly when considering a player's performance in varying formats.</p>]]></description>

<p>A recent study suggests that the traditional belief that iron deficiency is the primary cause of anaemia in India may be outdated, highlighting alternative factors such as Vitamin B12 deficiency and air pollution. The findings call for a review of public health policies regarding anaemia.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study was published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</li>
<li>Anaemia affects 34.9% of the population tested, but only 9% had iron-deficiency anaemia.</li>
<li>Prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age increased from 53.2% to 57.2% as per the latest National Family Health Survey.</li>
<li>Other causes of anaemia include deficiencies in nutrients like B12 or folate and environmental factors such as pollution.</li>
<li>The study indicates the need for diversified dietary policies and holistic approaches, rather than focusing solely on iron supplementation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The key is to diversify diets. We have to intervene with ensuring more fruits, milk and vegetables are made available to a wider population which will improve absorption of essential nutrients.” - Dr. Anura Kurpad</blockquote>
<p>The findings of this study advocate for more comprehensive public health strategies to combat anaemia in India.</p>]]></description>

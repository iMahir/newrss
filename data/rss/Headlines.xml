<p>On Sunday, protesters vandalised Allu Arjun's Hyderabad home, demanding compensation for victims of a recent stampede linked to the premiere of his film 'Pushpa 2'.</p>
<ul>

<li>They demanded ₹1 crore for the family of a stampede victim.</li>
<li>The protest included pelting stones and breaking flower pots.</li>
<li>Eight individuals were arrested at the scene by police.</li>
<li>The incident stemmed from a previous stampede at a film premiere that resulted in one death.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SpaceX launches double moonshot mission as 2 lunar landers on rocket blast off</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, Cape Canaveral, Fla.<br /><strong>Source:</strong> Associated Press</p>
<p>SpaceX successfully launched two lunar landers for U.S. and Japanese companies aiming to enhance lunar exploration and business opportunities. The landers were launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and will follow separate paths to the moon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The mission includes ispace's Resilience lander and Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander.</li>
  <li>ispace's mission aims to test lunar soil collection and future resource utilization.</li>
  <li>Firefly's lander will conduct various experiments for NASA, including soil sampling.</li>
  <li>The two landers will have differing timelines for their moon landings in early March and late May or early June, respectively.</li>
  <li>The U.S. plans more lunar missions under NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon by the end of the decade.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We don’t think this is a race. Some people say ‘race to the moon,’ but it’s not about the speed.” - ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada</blockquote>
<p>Both companies face challenges but share a common goal of paving the way for future lunar exploration.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>4 signs of fatty liver visible on a person's body</figcaption>
<p>Fatty liver is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, which can sometimes lead to serious health problems. Recognizing these symptoms early can aid in getting medical care and managing the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h2>Dark patches on the neck or underarms</h2><p>These patches can indicate insulin resistance, commonly seen in people with fatty liver.</p></li>
  <li><h2>Swelling in the abdomen</h2><p>A swollen or bloated abdomen could signify fatty liver and may require medical attention.</p></li>
  <li><h2>Puffiness in the face or feet</h2><p>Fatty liver may cause fluid retention, leading to swelling in the face, feet, or ankles, known as edema.</p></li>
  <li><h2>Mild itchiness of the skin</h2><p>Persistent itchiness can be a symptom of liver issues due to bile salt buildup.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>According to a study done in 2017, anxiety, thirst, feelings of changing temperature, and bloating were the most common complaints of NAFLD.</blockquote>
<p>Early recognition of these signs could help in preventing more severe health issues related to fatty liver.</p>]]></description>

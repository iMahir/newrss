<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed readiness to negotiate with Ukraine, including with President Zelenskyy, while emphasizing no preconditions for talks need to be set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Putin asserted that any agreement must involve legitimate Ukrainian authorities.</li>
<li>He reiterated that Russia has become stronger since its invasion of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Putin rejected claims of Russia being in a weak position and asserted the need for Kyiv to make compromises as well.</li>
<li>He mentioned a preference for lasting peace over a temporary truce and pointed to a previous proposal made in Istanbul.</li>
<li>Putin stated he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and expressed confidence in Russia's sovereignty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We have moved back from the edge of the abyss," said Putin, asserting Russia's independent decision-making capabilities.</blockquote>
<p>Despite calls for negotiation, the ongoing conflict continues to severely impact relations between Russia and the West, with extensive casualties and displacement in Ukraine.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Two BJP MPs were injured during the Parliament incident, leading to the complaint against Gandhi.</li>
  <li>Congress is demanding action against BJP MPs for their conduct during the scuffle.</li>
  <li>The controversy occurred during protests over Amit Shah's remarks.</li>

<p>This situation underscores ongoing tensions between Congress and the BJP, particularly regarding how Parliament is being managed and the protection of civil rights within it.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A young man lost his battle with lung cancer after a misdiagnosis.</figcaption>
<p>Liam Handley, a 36-year-old from Derbyshire, was originally diagnosed with anxiety instead of lung cancer. Despite showing various symptoms, he was not given the necessary medical attention that could have saved his life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Misdiagnosed with anxiety after complaining of chest pains and stress.</li>
  <li>No referral for a chest X-ray despite multiple symptoms.</li>
  <li>Underwent a private CT scan revealing that he had advanced lung cancer.</li>
  <li>Passed away in 2021 after a nine-month battle with the disease.</li>
  <li>Lung cancer in non-smokers represents 10-20% of lung cancer cases globally.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We were also so angry... All the precious moments that could have made the difference were lost.” - Lynn Handley</blockquote>
<p>This case highlights the critical importance of correct diagnoses in healthcare, especially considering the rising number of lung cancer cases among non-smokers.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rupee value continues to fluctuate against the dollar.</figcaption>
<p>The rupee has for the first time breached the 85-per-dollar mark following comments from the Federal Reserve indicating there may be fewer rate cuts in the future. This significant movement reflects ongoing concerns in the forex market relating to US monetary policy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The rupee’s depreciation against the dollar has reached a new low, now at 85/$.</li>
    <li>This decline is primarily attributed to the Fed's recent statements about monetary policy.</li>
    <li>Market analysts warn of further volatility in the currency market as investors react to economic indicators.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The sentiments in the forex market are heavily influenced by Federal Reserve decisions,” said a financial analyst.</blockquote>
<p>The continued decline of the rupee raises concerns regarding inflation and economic stability in India, highlighting the interconnectedness of global economic policies.</p>]]></description>

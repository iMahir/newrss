<p>Shankar’s new film Game Changer, featuring Ram Charan and Kiara Advani, collected ₹17.92 crore on its second day, bringing its total to ₹68.92 crore amid stiff competition during the festival season.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film was released on January 10 and has received mixed reviews.</li>
  <li>It is competing with other notable Sankranthi releases.</li>
  <li>Despite high expectations, the occupancy rates were only decent compared to previous works by Shankar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Game Changer had high expectations but now faces stiff competition from newly released films.”</blockquote>
<p>This film showcases Ram Charan in dual roles as an IAS officer and an activist, portraying significant political themes in its narrative.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Union home minister Amit Shah addresses at the 'Jhuggi Basti Pradhan Sammelan', in New Delhi. (PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Amit Shah, speaking at a conference for slum dwellers, criticized Arvind Kejriwal for the poor conditions in Delhi's slums, stating that the toilet in Kejriwal's 'Sheesh Mahal' is more expensive than basic housing for slum residents. Kejriwal responded, asserting that the people of Delhi will retaliate against Shah's remarks in the upcoming elections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amit Shah claims Kejriwal has deprived slum dwellers of basic utilities like clean water.</li>
<li>Shah accuses AAP's policies of turning Delhi into a "living hell".</li>
<li>Kejriwal counters that residents will respond to Shah's criticism with their votes.</li>
<li>Shah cites PM Modi's housing program, indicating over 3.58 crore homes provided to the poor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Today, I'm saying to the AAP--they have become a disaster for the people of Delhi." - Amit Shah</blockquote>
<p>The exchange between the two political leaders highlights the ongoing contention leading up to the Delhi elections, with both sides prepared to leverage the housing and slum conditions as key issues in their campaigns.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Prior confirmed cases include an 80-year-old man and an 8-year-old boy.</li>
  <li>The state's first case involved a two-month-old boy from Rajasthan.</li>
  <li>HMPV spreads via respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces.</li>

<figcaption>Panama president José Raúl Mulino reacts after Donald Trump threatens to take control of Panama Canal (AP Photo/Pamela Smith, photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino dismissed US President-elect Donald Trump's accusation of Chinese troops operating the Panama Canal as unfounded.</p>
<ul>
<li>President Mulino called Trump's claims "nonsense" and stressed that there is currently no Chinese presence in the canal.</li>
<li>Mulino emphasized the canal's Panamanian ownership and independence, stating it is not up for negotiation.</li>
<li>He highlighted the respectful diplomatic relationship between Panama and China established after severing ties with Taiwan in 2017.</li>
<li>Trump's comments were made during a social media post and at a conference where he expressed grievances over Panama's fees.</li>
<li>Mulino asserted the sovereignty of Panama, countering Trump’s threats to seize control of the canal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal. For the love of God, you are free, the whole world is free, to visit the canal if you please.” - José Raúl Mulino</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights ongoing tensions in U.S.-Latin America relations, particularly concerning U.S. accusations regarding China's involvement in the region.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Varun Dhawan’s Baby John collects ₹23.90 crore by Day 4, recovering slightly with ₹4.25 crore on Saturday.</figcaption>
<p>Varun Dhawan’s film Baby John shows signs of recovery at the box office, earning ₹4.25 crore on Day 4 for a total of ₹23.90 crore, despite facing heavy competition from Pushpa 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film had an underwhelming debut, earning ₹11.25 crore on its opening day.</li>
<li>Box office collections declined by 57.78% on Thursday and another 23% on Friday.</li>
<li>Pushpa 2 continues to dominate, earning ₹12.5 crore on the same day.</li>
<li>Critics have given mixed reviews, praising the cast, especially Dhawan, but criticizing the slow pacing and plot predictability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What stands out most in Baby John is its stellar casting. Kudos to the casting director! Varun Dhawan shines as DCP Satya Verma.”</blockquote>
<p>Despite the modest recovery, Baby John remains overshadowed by its competitor, indicating a challenging box office journey ahead.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Company Business News</p>
<p>As venture capital investments into India’s financial technology sector plunged this year, fintech companies are increasingly turning to venture debt as an alternative funding source.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Venture debt allows early-stage companies to raise capital without diluting equity.</li>
  <li>Venture debt is becoming more prevalent as venture capital becomes scarce due to regulatory oversight.</li>
  <li>Despite the rise of venture debt, venture capital remains the primary financing method for startups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Venture debt is essentially a high-interest loan advanced to early stage companies that want to raise capital without diluting equity."</blockquote>
<p>The growing use of venture debt highlights a shift in the fintech funding landscape caused by changing regulatory dynamics.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>O P Chautala: The Rise and Fall of a Political Patriarch</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Friday<br><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>Om Prakash Chautala, former Chief Minister of Haryana and INLD patriarch, passed away at the age of 89. His political journey spanned over five decades, marked by significant ups and downs, including a conviction and imprisonment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chautala served as Haryana's CM five times.</li>
  <li>He was part of a prominent political family; his father was a Deputy Prime Minister.</li>
  <li>First took office as CM in December 1989 but resigned amidst controversy.</li>
  <li>Convicted in a recruitment scandal in 2013, serving 10 years in prison.</li>
  <li>Post-release, his party, INLD, struggled politically, leading to a split with the formation of JJP.</li>
  <li>INLD’s influence declined significantly, securing only 2 seats in the 2024 Assembly polls.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"He was a dominant figure in Haryana politics for over five decades."</blockquote>

<p>A recent study explores the relationship between self-reported walking speed and metabolic health risks in obese individuals, suggesting that evaluating perceived walking pace can be beneficial in public health.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The research includes over 24,000 adults from health checkups in Japan.</li>
  <li>Participants with a BMI over 25 and waist circumference above defined thresholds were classified as obese.</li>
  <li>45% of participants classified as obese reported faster walking speeds.</li>
  <li>Fast walking speed is associated with reduced risks of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia among obese individuals.</li>
  <li>Fast walking speed can lower the risk of these conditions by significant percentages, particularly highlighting benefits for metabolic health.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Fast walking speed can reduce the risks of diabetes and dyslipidemia by 30% and 3%, respectively."</blockquote>
<p>The findings underscore walking speed's role as a crucial factor in managing and preventing metabolic diseases in individuals suffering from obesity. Future research should focus on similar longitudinal studies to further validate these results.</p>]]></description>

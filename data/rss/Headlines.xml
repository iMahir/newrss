  <li>It has completed 21 passes of the Sun since its launch in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This close-up study of the Sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees...” - NASA</blockquote>

<figcaption>US President Joe Biden | Reuters Image</figcaption>
<p>The FBI reportedly silenced evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab, findings which were excluded from a report presented to President Biden.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The FBI suppressed information from US defense and research institutions regarding the lab leak theory.</li>
  <li>Key findings were omitted from an August 2021 report which contradicted the theory.</li>
  <li>Research indicated that spike proteins aiding human transmission were consistent with prior studies from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</li>
  <li>Intelligence officials prevented researchers from discussing their analysis with Congress and the FBI.</li>
  <li>A whistleblower revealed improper classification of federal grant documents related to viral engineering.</li>
  <li>Chinese authorities maintain that the virus likely originated from bats, not a lab leak.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The scientists with subject matter expertise were silenced.”</blockquote>
<p>The event raises significant questions regarding transparency and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, indicating potential implications for future public health policies and international relations.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>German Parliament ready for new elections.</figcaption>
<p>The German President has officially dissolved the current parliament, announcing early elections to be held on February 23. This decision comes in light of significant political shifts and demands from various factions within the government.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Early elections are set for February 23, 2024.</li>
  <li>The decision was prompted by recent political instability and mounting pressure for reforms.</li>
  <li>Key political figures support the move, citing the need for a renewed mandate from the electorate.</li>
  <li>Opposition parties are preparing their campaigns, while ruling party factions are in a state of reorganization.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is a necessary step to restore trust in our democracy," the President stated during the announcement.</blockquote>
<p>This dissolution marks a crucial turning point in German politics, as voters will now have the opportunity to express their views on the current governance and direction of the country.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Former prime minister Manmohan Singh passed away on December 26, 2024.</figcaption>
<p>Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who passed away on December 26, has been credited with a significant expansion of the Indian middle class through his role in economic liberalization during the 1990s and as prime minister from 2004 to 2014.</p>
<ul>
<li>Singh was the chief architect of India’s economic liberalization in the early 1990s.</li>
<li>The middle class gained benefits from tax breaks and increased job opportunities, especially in the service sector.</li>
<li>His leadership attracted NRI support and reshaped the image of the Indian middle class.</li>
<li>The economic reforms led to a rise in consumer goods availability, contributing to a more affluent middle class.</li>
<li>Critics highlight the Congress party's failure to maintain middle class support, leading to their electoral losses from 2014 onwards.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The middle class had enthusiastically voted for Manmohan Singh in 2009.”</blockquote>
<p>The legacy of Manmohan Singh continues to be significant in understanding the evolution of the Indian middle class and the economic policies that shaped modern India.</p>]]></description>

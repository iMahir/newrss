            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why Modi govt 3.0 is maintaining an arm’s length from protesting farmers</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Date Not Provided] <strong>Source:</strong> [Source Not Provided]</p>
<p>Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has indicated a cautious approach from the Modi government in addressing ongoing farmers’ protests, contrasting with previous engagement levels during earlier agitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Farmers have been protesting at Shambhu and Khanauri since February 2024.</li>
  <li>The current protests differ from the previous agitation against the now-repealed farm laws, focusing on issues like minimum support price and farm debt waivers.</li>
  <li>The government believes earlier engagement escalated tensions rather than resolved issues.</li>
  <li>Minister Chouhan offers weekly meetings yet has not engaged directly with the protesting farmers.</li>
  <li>The protesting farmers have not participated in discussions with the government’s committee formed to address agricultural issues.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Currently, the Supreme Court is looking into this issue. Whatever directives the Supreme Court gives, will be followed,” - Shivraj Singh Chouhan.</blockquote>
<p>The Modi government's current strategy seems to prioritize a more detached stance amid a complicated landscape of farmers' demands and protests.</p>]]></description>

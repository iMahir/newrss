            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Artificial Heart Can Regenerate Its Own Muscles, Study Finds</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified<br><strong>Source:</strong> International Business Times</p>
<img src="https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/806913/insulin-resistance-may-make-men-more-prone-common-heart-valve-disease-study.jpg?w=383&amp;h=303&amp;l=50&amp;t=40" alt="Insulin resistance may make men more prone to common heart valve disease: Study">
<figcaption>Heart muscles can regenerate in some people, says study</figcaption>
<p>Recent research suggests that some individuals with artificial hearts are capable of regenerating heart muscle, potentially leading to new treatments for heart failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is currently no cure for heart failure; treatments include transplants and artificial heart pumps.</li>
<li>Researchers utilized carbon dating to examine heart tissue from artificial heart patients.</li>
<li>The study, published in the journal <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.in/autism-significant-health-burden-india-study-876801" target="_blank">Circulation</a>, found these patients regenerate muscle cells at over six times the rate of healthy hearts.</li>
<li>Hesham Sadek noted that this evidence supports the idea that human heart muscle can regenerate.</li>
<li>Some patients have even been able to remove their artificial hearts due to improved heart function.</li>
<li>Future research may focus on enhancing regeneration through targeted molecular pathways.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This is the strongest evidence we have, so far, that human heart muscle cells can actually regenerate, which really is exciting, because it solidifies the notion that there is an intrinsic capacity of the human heart to regenerate.</blockquote>
<p>The findings indicate promising avenues for the treatment of heart conditions, suggesting that regeneration may become a key aspect of future cardiac therapies.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How Bat Poop Turned Deadly for Two Men Growing Marijuana</h1>

<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116406313,imgsize-1643339,width-400,resizemode-4/116406313.jpg" alt="How bat poop turned deadly for two men growing marijuana" title="(Image: Canva)" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high">

<p>In a bizarre incident in Rochester, USA, two men died from a lung infection after using bat poop as fertilizer in their marijuana cultivation. The guano, which contains harmful spores, led to a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two men died after inhaling spores from bat poop used to fertilize marijuana.</li>
  <li>The lung infection they suffered from was identified as histoplasmosis.</li>
  <li>The infection is caused by a fungus found in bat and bird feces.</li>
  <li>Despite medical care, neither man survived after developing severe symptoms.</li>
  <li>Histoplasmosis cases have been reported across the United States, particularly in Ohio and Mississippi.</li>
  <li>Improper handling of bat guano poses significant health risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The increase in this rare lung disease seems to align with the rise in popularity of bat guano as a fertilizer among cannabis cultivators."</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, public awareness about the dangers of handling bat guano is limited, leading to tragic outcomes like that of the two men.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Home minister Amit Shah is replying on the Constitution debate in the Rajya Sabha.</figcaption>
<p>The ongoing Winter Session of Parliament has seen home minister Amit Shah delivering sharp critiques of the Congress party, accusing them of failing to uphold the Constitution and excessively praising the Nehru-Gandhi family.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shah introduced the bill for “one nation, one election” in the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>Criticism aimed at Congress for their historical amendments to the Constitution.</li>
<li>The BJP continues to advocate for simultaneous elections despite opposition.</li>
<li>Shah remarked that Congress's fixation on the Nehru-Gandhi family undermines their political credibility.</li>
<li>Debates on the Constitution have highlighted different political views on federalism and governance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Congress considered the Constitution a ‘private territory’ of one family,” said Amit Shah.</blockquote>
<p>This session underscores ongoing tensions as the government pushes significant reform with the “one nation, one election” initiative, which faces scrutiny across political lines.</p>]]></description>

(Photo Credits: X)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> NASA's Juno mission has provided groundbreaking insights into the volcanic heat of Io, Jupiter's largest moon. The research published in Nature has revealed that the volcanoes on Io are powered by local magma chambers rather than a global magma ocean.</p><ol><li>Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system with over 400 active volcanoes.</li><li>The Juno spacecraft used high-precision Doppler measurements to probe Io’s gravitational field and internal structure.</li><li>The volcanic activity on Io is mainly due to tidal flexing—a gravitational pull by Jupiter that heats the moon's interior.</li><li>Each volcano on Io is fed by its own magma chamber, providing the energy for continuous eruptions.</li></ol><blockquote>The squeezing generates heat to the extent that Io’s insides are melting and erupting.</blockquote><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The findings from Juno reshape our understanding of Io and have broader implications for the study of other celestial bodies with subsurface oceans, such as Europa and Enceladus.</p>]]></description>

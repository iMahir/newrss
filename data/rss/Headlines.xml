</figure>
<p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has launched an investigation against certain Indian individuals, entities, and Canadian colleges for allegedly trafficking Indians into the US through Canada. The probe stems from a tragic incident in 2022 involving the deaths of a family from Gujarat while attempting to cross the border illegally.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The investigation targets Bhavesh Ashokbhai Patel and associates accused of human trafficking.</li>
  <li>Individuals were charged between ₹55 and ₹60 lakh for illegal entry into the US.</li>
  <li>Search operations were conducted at eight locations across various Indian cities.</li>
  <li>About 25,000 students are referred annually by one entity for overseas college admissions.</li>
  <li>Over 112 colleges in Canada are implicated in the ongoing investigation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All the accused, in conspiracy with each other, lured the innocent Indian nationals by charging them huge amounts for causing them to illegally enter the USA through Canada,” ED statement.</blockquote>
<p>The ED's investigation underscores the dire circumstances that lure individuals into seeking illegal pathways for migration, emphasizing the need for stringent measures against such trafficking schemes.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>IAS trainee Pooja Khedkar approached SC</figcaption>
<p>Puja Khedkar has moved to the Supreme Court after her anticipatory bail was rejected by the Delhi High Court in a case involving allegations of document forgery to secure eligibility for the UPSC exam.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khedkar is accused of forging documents to obtain benefits for the OBC and disability categories for the 2022 UPSC exam.</li>
  <li>The Delhi High Court described the case as a 'glaring example of fraud,' affecting public trust in competitive exams.</li>
  <li>Khedkar claims that she is being targeted after filing a complaint of sexual harassment against her senior and disputes the allegations against her.</li>
  <li>In July, she was banned from future UPSC examinations and denied appointment as a junior government officer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The public's trust in competitive exams and their white credibility would be severely damaged if such charges were proven true.</blockquote>
<p>Puja Khedkar's case highlights the serious implications of fraud in public service exams and raises concerns about the integrity of the selection process.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Deadly 'Zombie Deer' Disease Could Evolve</figcaption>
<p>Scientists warn that the incurable prion disease known as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), primarily affecting deer, could evolve to infect humans, potentially leading to severe health consequences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The disease has already been reported in feral pigs and could spill over to domestic swine.</li>
  <li>CWD exhibits symptoms similar to dementia in infected animals, such as drooling and aggression.</li>
  <li>Currently found in at least 33 states, including Wyoming and Wisconsin.</li>
  <li>There are concerns about  human exposure through consumption of infected meat.</li>
  <li>The disease is highly contagious among deer and other hoofed animals.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If they can get infected, surely it's possible domestic swine could also become infected? What would that do to the swine market?" - Dr. Michael Osterholm</blockquote>
<p>Experts express urgency for preparedness as the potential spillover of CWD to humans could lead to a health crisis.</p>]]></description>

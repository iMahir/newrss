<figcaption>(Image: Canva)</figcaption>
<p>In a bizarre incident in Rochester, USA, two men died from a lung infection after using bat poop as fertilizer in their marijuana cultivation. The guano, which contains harmful spores, led to a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two men died after inhaling spores from bat poop used to fertilize marijuana.</li>
  <li>The lung infection they suffered from was identified as histoplasmosis.</li>
  <li>The infection is caused by a fungus found in bat and bird feces.</li>
  <li>Despite medical care, neither man survived after developing severe symptoms.</li>
  <li>Histoplasmosis cases have been reported across the United States, particularly in Ohio and Mississippi.</li>
  <li>Improper handling of bat guano poses significant health risks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The increase in this rare lung disease seems to align with the rise in popularity of bat guano as a fertilizer among cannabis cultivators."</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, public awareness about the dangers of handling bat guano is limited, leading to tragic outcomes like that of the two men.</p>]]></description>

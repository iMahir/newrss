<figcaption>Mob justice incident involving Abdul Hai Kanu.</figcaption>
<p>In recent months, Bangladesh has experienced a surge in mob justice with incidents escalating after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government. The interim government, led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, has been unable to restore law and order amidst increasing violence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abdul Hai Kanu, a 78-year-old freedom fighter, was publicly humiliated and assaulted by a mob on December 22, highlighting the rise in mob justice.</li>
  <li>Over 82 people were killed due to mob incidents in just four months under the interim government.</li>
  <li>Despite police presence, fear among officers leads to reluctance in intervention during violent incidents.</li>
  <li>The country has seen a sharp rise in robbery and muggings, with at least 10 killed in Dhaka alone during this period.</li>
  <li>Human rights groups have reported a significant increase in fabricated legal cases during this time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are deeply concerned about mob justice. Police are not intervening, leading people to believe they can act without police interference.” - Advocate Saidur Rahman</blockquote>
<p>While mob violence has surged, there has been a noted decline in extrajudicial killings, previously rampant under the ousted regime. However, as political instability continues, the question of law and order remains critical in Bangladesh.</p>]]></description>

<p>Pushpa 2 continues its box office dominance, grossing over Rs. 1200 crore. With only Rs. 150 crore left to break the all-time record, the film is poised for further growth during the festive season.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pushpa 2 grossed approximately Rs. 15 crore on its 3rd Monday.</li>
  <li>The total Indian box office gross topped Rs. 1207.50 crore.</li>
  <li>The film is less than Rs. 150 crore short of the all-time box office record.</li>
  <li>The Hindi version has crossed Rs. 600 crore net, a historic first.</li>
  <li>Box office collections are boosted by festive periods, particularly Christmas.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The narrative that the film is underperforming in Telugu states is completely misguided."</blockquote>
<p>This film sets new benchmarks, especially in the Hindi-speaking market, indicating a significant shift in audience preferences. The ongoing box office success of Pushpa 2 demonstrates its widespread appeal and potential for long-term revenues.</p>]]></description>

<p>Manu Bhaker, the celebrated shooter and twin medal winner at the Paris Olympics, is devastated after being excluded from the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award shortlist despite her historic achievements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manu Bhaker won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics 2024, becoming the first Indian athlete of the Independence era to achieve this feat.</li>
<li>Despite being a strong candidate, she was not shortlisted for the Khel Ratna award.</li>
<li>Bhaker's father shared her disappointment, stating she felt she shouldn't have participated in the Olympics at all.</li>
<li>The sports ministry's decision has drawn backlash from fans and may prompt reconsideration.</li>
<li>She has a remarkable record of 17 gold, six silver, and five bronze medals in various shooting events since the Tokyo Games.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I shouldn't have gone to the Olympics and won medals for the country. In fact, I shouldn't have become a sportsperson.” - Manu Bhaker</blockquote>

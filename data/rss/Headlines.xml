<p>The family of 19-year-old Liri Albag has made an emotional appeal to Israeli politicians and world leaders, urging them to think of their own children while making decisions regarding hostages held by Hamas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Liri Albag has been held captive in Gaza since October 7, 2023.</li>
  <li>A video released by Hamas shows Albag calling for her release.</li>
  <li>Her family emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating, "it’s time to take decisions as if it were your own children there." </li>
  <li>As of January 2025, 96 hostages remain in Gaza, with 34 confirmed dead according to the Israeli military.</li>
  <li>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum continues to advocate for the release of the hostages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The forum said the latest video was “firm and incontestable proof of the urgency of bringing the hostages home”.</blockquote>
<p>The appeal highlights the ongoing tensions and demands from families of kidnapped individuals, as they seek a resolution to their loved ones' captivity amidst the broader conflict.</p>]]></description>

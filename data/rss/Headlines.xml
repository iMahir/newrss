            <description><![CDATA[<h1>My Career Made, Then Unmade By Gandhis: Mani Shankar Aiyar's Big Claim</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Press Trust of India</p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has claimed that the Gandhi family played a significant role in both his political rise and subsequent marginalization within the party.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar stated, "The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis."</li>
    <li>He expressed frustration over a lack of substantial engagement with key members of the Gandhi family over the years.</li>
    <li>Aiyar mentioned he did not have the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi for a decade and had only limited interactions with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>He recalled needing to ask Priyanka to convey birthday wishes to Rahul during a period of his suspension from the party.</li>
    <li>Aiyar wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi seeking clarity on his suspension but received no acknowledgment.</li>
    <li>He reflected on the political environment in 2012 during crises for both Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh, noting Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership during that time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi.”</blockquote>
<p>This interview sheds light on the complex dynamics within the Congress party and highlights Aiyar's personal experiences regarding his political journey influenced by the Gandhi family.</p>]]></description>

<p>The arrest of Telugu actor Allu Arjun has incited a major political debate in Telangana, with various parties reacting differently to the incident tied to a tragic stampede during the premiere of "Pushpa 2: The Rule".</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun was arrested in connection with a woman's death due to a stampede at the Sandhya Theatre during the film's premiere.</li>
    <li>Congress defended the arrest, emphasizing that it is lawful and that the party supports adherence to the legal process.</li>
    <li>Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw criticized Congress, claiming they disrespect the creative industry and misplace blame for poor theater arrangements.</li>
    <li>YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Andhra Pradesh opposition leader, condemned the arrest, suggesting it was unfair to hold Arjun accountable for the stampede.</li>
    <li>Arjun was initially sent to 14-day judicial custody but was later granted interim bail by the Telangana High Court.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The cases filed against Arjun are within the purview of law and the court granted him bail." - B Mahesh Kumar Goud, Telangana Congress president
</blockquote>
<p>The incident has highlighted tensions between political factions in Telangana, with stark differences in how they view responsibility for the tragedy and their attitudes toward the film industry. As reactions continue to unfold, it remains crucial to balance accountability with fair treatment of individuals involved.</p>]]></description>

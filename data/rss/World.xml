            <description><![CDATA[<h1>There's a new 'ism' in town</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2025</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>This article analyzes the shifting political landscape as traditional ideologies like Leftism, Rightism, and Centrism give way to a new force: populism. The author highlights how established parties are struggling to adapt, with figures like Trump and others redefining political norms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leftism is in decline across much of the western world.</li>
  <li>The Right is undergoing transformation, largely influenced by populist leaders.</li>
  <li>Populism is characterized by its transactional approach to politics.</li>
  <li>Traditional ideologies are losing ground to this new populist approach globally.</li>
  <li>In India, political strategies are increasingly centered on offering economic incentives to voters.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The beauty, charm and success of populism lies in its ease of use, in how little it demands from your head or heart, wisdom or conscience.”</blockquote>
<p>The rise of populism signifies a profound change in political dialogue, marking a potential reshaping of future democratic processes as parties work to align with this new trend.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>This handout picture released by the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO) shows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2-R), heading a security cabinet meeting to vote on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal that should take effect on January 19, 2025. (AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In a significant move towards ending the 15-month-long war in Gaza, Israel's government approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which will take effect on January 19, 2025, and includes a series of hostage exchanges.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ceasefire deal will facilitate the release of 33 Israeli hostages by Hamas.</li>
  <li>In exchange, Israel will free all Palestinian women and children under 19 currently in Israeli prisons.</li>
  <li>The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 46,000 casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza.</li>
  <li>Despite challenges, 24 cabinet members supported the deal, with strong opposition from hardline ministers.</li>
  <li>The deal was mediated by Qatar and the US and faced delays due to disputes and last-minute complications.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This agreement raises hopes for a reduction in hostilities.</blockquote>
<p>The approval marks a crucial step towards peace, though challenges remain as the situation in Gaza continues to evolve.</p>]]></description>

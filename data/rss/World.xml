<p>The upcoming inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump on January 20 is notable for breaking tradition as he invites foreign leaders to attend. Among the invitees is Chinese President Xi Jinping, though it remains uncertain if he will attend.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump has raised over $170 million for the inauguration, surpassing previous records.</li>
  <li>Significant global leaders, including Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, have received invitations.</li>
  <li>While Biden has confirmed his attendance, Xi may send a senior official in his stead.</li>
  <li>Key allies such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Argentina’s Javier Milei plan to attend.</li>
  <li>Notably absent will be Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The only president ever to avoid an inauguration is the guy that’s about to be inaugurated.” - Joe Biden</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Trump and the Middle East: His policies last term, changes he faces now</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not provided <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>As Donald Trump's second term inauguration approaches, he faces significant changes in the Middle East, where negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue amidst rising tensions and changing alliances.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump warns of dire consequences if Hamas does not release Israeli hostages.</li>
  <li>His previous administration achieved the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab states.</li>
  <li>In stark contrast to 2016, current Arab leaderships display unease over Israel's actions in Gaza.</li>
  <li>Trump's historical approach focused on anti-Iran posturing and significant U.S. support for Israel.</li>
  <li>Future outcomes may affect U.S.-Saudi security partnerships and Iran relations, with potential shifts from the previous administrations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“All hell will break loose and it will not be good for anyone” - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>Trump now navigates a complex geopolitical landscape that deviates from the stability he promoted, raising questions about his ability to negotiate peace effectively as the Middle East evolves.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The poster shared by Pakistan International Airlines on X that sparked an uproar.</figcaption>
<p>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has been at the center of attention following a controversial advertisement promoting its first flight to Paris in over four years. Despite facing backlash for its misleading ad, the flight was greeted positively upon arrival.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This was PIA's first flight to Paris since the pandemic, operating twice a week from Islamabad.</li>
  <li>The airline faced criticism for a poster that reminded many of a past ad linked to the 9/11 attacks.</li>
  <li>Social media users continue to mock the airline for the ad, prompting calls for its removal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Is this a threat?” asked X user Dr Parik Patel. “You can’t be serious this time! Fire your designer!” commented user Muhammad Uzair Balagamwala.</blockquote>
<p>The incident highlights the sensitive nature of airline marketing and the swift reactions it can provoke on social media platforms.</p>]]></description>

<p>Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, has issued a stern warning to US President-elect Donald Trump regarding his aggressive stance towards Canada, particularly concerning tariffs and proposed statehood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on Canadian imports unless more border security is ensured.</li>
<li>Trump mockingly suggested Canada could become the 51st state of the U.S.</li>
<li>Singh emphasized Canada's support during the Los Angeles fire crisis, stating, "Canadian firefighters showed up." </li>
<li>He criticized Trump's remarks, suggesting they resembled those of an "internet troll" rather than a president.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>I have a message for Donald Trump. Our country (Canada) is not for sale. Not now, not ever.</blockquote>
<p>Singh’s comments highlight Canada’s resilience and commitment to being a supportive neighbor amidst provocations from the U.S.</p>]]></description>

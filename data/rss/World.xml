<p>The current wildfires in Southern California are causing unprecedented destruction during winter, a season typically not associated with such events. Over 130,000 individuals have been evacuated, with the death toll rising to 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Palisades fire and several others are causing devastation in Hollywood Hills and other areas.</li>
<li>The wildfires have resulted in delays for significant events, including the Oscars nominations announcement.</li>
<li>Several factors, including dry weather following wet winters, strong Santa Ana winds, and climate change have contributed to the severity of the fires.</li>
<li>NASA reports that Southern California has experienced its driest start to winter on record since 1944, exacerbating fire risks.</li>
<li>Climate change is extending the wildfire season and increasing the intensity of these events.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Experts say the wildfire season in California has lengthened in recent years.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the ongoing wildfires highlight the urgent need for measures to address climate change and improve fire management practices.</p>]]></description>

<p>A COO recounted an incident where his Indian boss rejected a job candidate for indicating personal hobbies in his CV, sparking discussions about workplace culture and employee value.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parminder Singh, COO of Tatler Asia, shared a story on X about a capable candidate rejected for mentioning his hobbies.</li>
  <li>The boss questioned the candidate's work commitment, asking, 'Yeh aadmi yeh sab kuchh karta hai to kaam kab karega?'</li>
  <li>Singh lamented the lost opportunity to hire a well-rounded candidate, contrasting it with hiring practices at Google.</li>
  <li>There is growing outrage over a recent 90-hour workweek advocacy by SN Subrahmanyan, chairman of L&T.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I couldn't hire him, and I regret it. This happened many years ago. I've been away from India and assumed things would have changed, but it looks like they haven't.” - Parminder Singh</blockquote>
<p>This incident raises important questions about employer attitudes toward work-life balance and the value of diverse skills in the workplace.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>International Relations</figcaption>
<p>This article explores the complex geopolitical relationship involving Sri Lanka, India, and China, highlighting Sri Lanka's strategic importance in the Indian Ocean and the diplomatic balancing act it must maintain between the two major powers.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sri Lanka's geopolitical position enhances its significance in the Indian Ocean, attracting investments from both India and China.</li>
    <li>The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has led to substantial Chinese investments in Sri Lanka, particularly in infrastructure.</li>
    <li>India aims to counter China's influence by investing in energy, infrastructure, and cultural connections with Sri Lanka.</li>
    <li>The historical and cultural ties between India and Sri Lanka date back over 2,500 years, influencing current diplomatic engagements.</li>
    <li>Sri Lanka must navigate the strategic control exerted by China through projects like the Hambantota Port, which has raised concerns about debt and sovereignty.</li>
    <li>The recent visit of Sri Lankan President Dissanayake to India emphasizes Sri Lanka's commitment to strengthen ties with India while also managing relations with China.</li>
    <li>To avoid over-reliance, Sri Lanka is diversifying its investments and partnerships beyond just India and China, exploring relations with other nations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>President Dissanayake emphasized, "Sri Lanka shall not allow its territory to be utilized in a manner that might endanger India's interests."</blockquote>
<p>This article underscores the necessity for Sri Lanka to maintain strategic neutrality while leveraging its relationships to foster economic recovery and regional stability.</p>]]></description>

<p>The year 2024 has now been confirmed to have breached the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming threshold, becoming the first calendar year to do so. The annual average temperature of Earth’s surface in 2024 was 1.6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times (average of the 1850-1900 period), according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service run by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>"Hamas Solely Responsible": On Gaza Ceasefire Eve, Netanyahu Hints At Delay</h1>
<p><strong>Date: </strong> New Delhi</p>
<p><strong>Source: </strong> AFP</p>
<p>Hours before the start of a ceasefire in the Gaza war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that Israel cannot proceed with the ceasefire framework until the list of hostages to be released by Hamas is received. He stated that Hamas is solely responsible for any violations of the agreement.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ceasefire is set to begin on Sunday morning, as approved by the Israeli cabinet.</li>
  <li>Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued even after the ceasefire announcement.</li>
  <li>In recent violence, a family of five was killed in a strike in Khan Yunis.</li>
  <li>Qatari Prime Minister stated an initial 42-day ceasefire will see the release of 33 hostages.</li>
  <li>The ceasefire follows previous agreements, including a one-week truce in November 2023.</li>
  <li>Since Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, there have been significant casualties on both sides, with many civilians affected.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We will be unable to move forward with the framework until we receive the list of the hostages who will be released, as was agreed. Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. Hamas is solely responsible." - Benjamin Netanyahu</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel continues to have devastating effects on the region, with significant loss of life and destruction, as a new ceasefire sets to be implemented amidst the uncertainty of hostages' fate.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Trump offers to acquire Greenland: The long history of the US trying to take over the island</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2024<br /><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump’s renewed interest in acquiring Greenland has sparked serious discussions despite the island’s leaders ruling out the possibility. This article explores the long history of American interest in Greenland, its strategic resources, and geopolitical implications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump intends to negotiate the acquisition of Greenland, a proposal initially made during his first term.</li>
  <li>Greenland is rich in minerals crucial for future technologies, located strategically near Arctic shipping lanes.</li>
  <li>Historical offers to buy Greenland date back to 1946, reflecting ongoing U.S. interests in the island.</li>
  <li>The recent revival of interest is partly driven by the growing influence of China in the region.</li>
  <li>Chinese companies are significantly involved in Greenland's mineral sector, prompting U.S. concerns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Buying, or annexing a foreign territory by force, is an idea totally out of place in a 21st Century world.”</blockquote>
<p>The attempt to acquire Greenland underscores the ongoing strategic competition between the U.S. and China, making it a notable geopolitical issue.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How TikTok Grew from a Fun App for Teens into a Potential National Security Threat</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified<br><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>If it feels like TikTok has been around forever, that's probably because it has, at least if you're measuring via internet time. What's now in question is whether it will be around much longer and, if so, in what form?</p>
<img src='URL_of_the_image' alt='TikTok logo or relevant image' />
<figcaption>TikTok has become a global trendsetter amidst growing national security concerns.</figcaption>
<p>Starting in 2017, when ByteDance merged with Musical.ly, TikTok has grown from a niche teen app into a global trendsetter, while also emerging as a potential national security threat according to U.S. officials.</p>
<ul>
<li>2017: TikTok launches after ByteDance acquires Musical.ly.</li>
<li>2020: TikTok becomes the second-most downloaded app in the world.</li>
<li>2022: New rules are announced to deter harmful content.</li>
<li>2024: Congress passes a bill that could lead to a ban on TikTok.</li>
<li>2025: Supreme Court upholds the federal law banning TikTok unless it's sold by ByteDance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app.”</blockquote>
<p>As TikTok faces legal challenges, the platform's future remains uncertain, with significant implications for its millions of users in the U.S.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> November 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has introduced new pre-verification requirements for individuals seeking work visas, aimed at enhancing the labor sector and aligning with the Vision 2030 initiative.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new rules apply specifically to Indian workers, who are the second-largest expatriate group in the kingdom.</li>
  <li>Over 2.4 million Indian workers are currently employed in Saudi Arabia.</li>
  <li>The pre-verification process is designed to control the influx of workers and ensure high professional standards.</li>
  <li>Required steps for obtaining a work visa include securing a job offer, getting a letter of invitation, preparing necessary documents, and submitting an application to the relevant Saudi authorities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The pre-verification process aims to address the limited capacity of training centers and ensure high professional standards in the labor market."</blockquote>

<p>Ann Telnaes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, resigned from the Washington Post after her cartoon criticizing tech leaders, including Jeff Bezos, was rejected. The cartoon satirized their flattery towards President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Telnaes submitted a cartoon aimed at notable tech moguls which was ultimately pulled from publication.</li>
  <li>The cartoon humorously depicted Bezos and others kneeling before a statue of Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>Telnaes expressed frustration over being unable to address critical issues through her artwork.</li>
  <li>The incident follows previous controversies regarding editorial decisions at the Washington Post.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press.” - Ann Telnaes</blockquote>
<p>The resignation raises concerns about editorial censorship and creative freedom in journalism.</p>]]></description>

Photograph: Ann Telnaes</figcaption>
<p>The Washington Post’s Pulitzer prize-winning editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, has resigned from her position at the newspaper after its refusal to publish a satirical cartoon depicting the outlet’s owner, Jeff Bezos, kneeling before Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The cartoon, a critique of billionaire tech and media executives’ attempts to curry favor with Trump, was rejected by the Post’s opinions editor, David Shipley, who cited a desire to avoid repetition. Telnaes, however, believes the rejection was due to the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary, raising concerns about censorship and freedom of the press.</p>
<ul>
<li>Telnaes’s resignation comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the Post and Bezos’ decision to block an endorsement of Kamala Harris in the presidential election.</li>
<li>Trump’s victory over Harris in the election has led to conciliatory gestures from tech and media executives, including a dinner between Trump and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and a $15m settlement from ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos to resolve a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press." - Ann Telnaes</blockquote>
<p>Telnaes, who won the Pulitzer for illustrated reporting and commentary in 2001 and is a three-time finalist for the prestigious award, believes the Post’s decision to censor her work sets a dangerous precedent for free press.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>US President-elect Donald Trump(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The congressional joint session to count electoral votes on January 6 is expected to be less eventful than in 2021 when a violent mob interrupted the count. This time, Trump returns to office after winning the 2024 election.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Congress must meet to open sealed certificates from each state's electoral votes.</li>
<li>Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the certification of her own loss, just as Mike Pence did in 2021.</li>
<li>Congress tightened the rules for certification after the events of January 6, 2021.</li>
<li>The revised Electoral Count Act of 2022 clarified the vice president's role and raised the threshold for objections to electoral votes.</li>
<li>Once certified, the president is inaugurated on January 20.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The updated law clarifies that the vice president does not have the power to determine the results on Jan. 6.”</blockquote>
<p>The joint session will formally count the electoral votes, marking the final step in the presidential election process before inauguration.</p>]]></description>

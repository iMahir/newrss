<p>South Korean lawmakers have impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol following his controversial declaration of martial law, which sparked mass protests and a constitutional crisis.</p>
<ul>
    <li>204 out of 300 lawmakers voted in favor of the impeachment motion.</li>

    <li>The Constitutional Court will decide Yoon's fate, a process that may take up to six months.</li>
    <li>Yoon declared martial law on December 3rd, sending soldiers to the National Assembly to control lawmakers.</li>
    <li>The martial law was quickly rescinded after opposition lawmakers voted it down.</li>
    <li>Yoon faces ongoing criminal investigations related to the martial law declaration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is a victory for the South Korean people and for democracy." - Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the opposition Democratic Party</blockquote>

<p>Nearly 18,000 undocumented Indian nationals are on the deportation list prepared by the US government amidst a significant deportation initiative by the Trump administration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nearly 18,000 Indians are included in a wider ICE deportation list of approximately 1.5 million people.</li>
    <li>The US has around 725,000 illegal immigrants from India, which is the third-largest group of unauthorized immigrants.</li>
    <li>Over the last three years, an average of 90,000 Indians have been apprehended while attempting to cross US borders illegally.</li>
    <li>India is categorized by ICE as "uncooperative" regarding coordination for the return of its nationals.</li>
    <li>ICE considers 15 countries uncooperative, including India, in facilitating deportations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “The average of 90,000 Indians have been apprehended while attempting to cross US borders illegally over the last three financial years.”
</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the struggle of thousands of undocumented Indians in the US who seek to legalize their status while facing significant hurdles. The US government’s actions reflect broader immigration enforcement practices and international relations related to deportation. </p>]]></description>

<p>Satellite images reviewed by Maxar Technologies have confirmed the emergence of Iran's new drone ship, the Shahid Bagheri, currently docked in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Shahid Bagheri is anchored near the naval port of Bandar Abbas.</li>
    <li>Originally a commercial container ship, it has been converted into a drone carrier vessel for Iran's naval forces.</li>
    <li>This development demonstrates Iran's capability to deploy drones, even though the ship is stationed far from U.S. coastlines.</li>
    <li>The ship features a ski-jump ramp and an angled flight deck to assist in launching and recovering drones.</li>
    <li>Two other vessels, Shahid Mahdavi and Shahid Roudaki, have also been similarly modified.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Iranian drone ship in the Persian Gulf demonstrates Tehran’s ability to deploy drones, although the vessel is stationed thousands of miles from the U.S. coast.”</blockquote>
<p>This new drone ship marks a significant development in Iran's naval capabilities and indicates ongoing advancements in military technology.]]></description>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has announced plans to eliminate Daylight Saving Time (DST), deeming it a "very costly" practice for America.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trump stated that DST has a small but strong constituency, which he believes it "shouldn't" have.</li>
    <li>He emphasized that the Republican Party will strive to abolish DST due to its inconvenience and costliness.</li>
    <li>DST affects nearly 400 million people in North America and requires clock changes twice a year.</li>
    <li>The most recent legislative effort to change DST was through the stalled 'Sunshine Protection Act' aiming to make it permanent.</li>
    <li>Health experts have recommended making standard time permanent instead of continuing DST.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the debate over Daylight Saving Time continues as Trump seeks to rally support for its elimination, highlighting both its historical significance and contemporary criticisms.]]></description>

<figcaption>A video on the Greenland glacier outburst flood</figcaption>
<p>A major glacial lake outburst flood occurred in East Greenland, releasing over 3,000 billion litres of meltwater. This unprecedented event was monitored in real-time for the first time by researchers from the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The flood was caused by the release of Catalina Lake into the Scoresby Sound fjord.</li>
    <li>The water level in Catalina Lake dropped dramatically by 154 metres after a 25-kilometre-long tunnel was carved under the ice.</li>
    <li>This outburst released water equivalent to three times Denmark's annual consumption.</li>
    <li>Dr. Aslak Grinsted noted these floods are becoming more frequent due to climate change.</li>
    <li>The energy released matched that of the largest nuclear power plant for 22 days, highlighting potential renewable energy opportunities.</li>
    <li>15 million people globally are estimated to live in areas vulnerable to glacial floods, emphasizing the need for monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The outburst floods, driven by climate change, are becoming increasingly common.” - Dr Aslak Grinsted</blockquote>
<p>This significant glacial flood underscores the urgent need for monitoring glacial dynamics as changing climate conditions continue to impact worldwide water levels and energy potential.]]></description>

(REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier)</figcaption>
<p>On December 4, the French parliament called and passed a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet, ousting the government after just three months in office. Brookings Visiting Fellow Tara Varma breaks down the historic result.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Fifth Republic has only seen one other vote of no confidence since its founding in 1958.</li>
    <li>President Macron dissolved the National Assembly in June 2024 following poor election results for his party, leading to snap elections that resulted in a fragmented parliament.</li>
    <li>Barnier's government failed to secure a clear majority and faced obstacles in passing the budget, leading to the no-confidence vote.</li>
    <li>Following the vote, Macron announced plans to form a new government and invited select political parties to cooperate.</li>
    <li>The political climate in France reflects a larger trend of instability across Europe as various governments face radical opposition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“2024 was a year of significant elections worldwide, and we saw large levels of turnout everywhere, with people proudly exercising their right to vote.” - Tara Varma</blockquote>
<p>The rapid political shifts in France highlight both the challenges and opportunities for collaboration amongst diverse political factions in a time of uncertainty. President Macron's ability to effectively form a new government will be crucial in addressing the pressing issues facing the nation.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The U.S. Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, in collaboration with the U.S. Navy Strategic Systems Programs, recently completed a conventional hypersonic missile test from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Fla.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The US Army, in collaboration with the US Navy, has achieved a major milestone with the successful test-fire of its Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), known as Dark Eagle, after more than two years of challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>The successful test was conducted on December 12, 2024, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.</li>
<li>This test marks the second successful flight of the weapon’s All Up Round (AUR) this year and the first live-fire event for the LRHW system.</li>
<li>The LRHW is a key part of the Pentagon's hypersonic missile program, expected to arm the US Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyers and Block V Virginia-class submarines.</li>
<li>Dark Eagle features a two-stage rocket booster designed to carry a Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) to speeds exceeding Mach 5.</li>
<li>The missile has a range of 1,725 miles, aimed at overcoming advanced defensive systems.</li>
<li>The Army aims to deploy its first LRHW battery by fiscal year 2025, despite previous delays due to technical challenges.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This test marks an important milestone in the development of one of our most advanced weapons systems." - Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro</blockquote>
<p>The successful test of the Dark Eagle comes at a critical time as global competitors, including China and Russia, are making significant advancements in hypersonic weaponry.</p>]]></description>

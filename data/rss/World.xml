<p>The current wildfires in Southern California are causing unprecedented destruction during winter, a season typically not associated with such events. Over 130,000 individuals have been evacuated, with the death toll rising to 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Palisades fire and several others are causing devastation in Hollywood Hills and other areas.</li>
<li>The wildfires have resulted in delays for significant events, including the Oscars nominations announcement.</li>
<li>Several factors, including dry weather following wet winters, strong Santa Ana winds, and climate change have contributed to the severity of the fires.</li>
<li>NASA reports that Southern California has experienced its driest start to winter on record since 1944, exacerbating fire risks.</li>
<li>Climate change is extending the wildfire season and increasing the intensity of these events.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Experts say the wildfire season in California has lengthened in recent years.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the ongoing wildfires highlight the urgent need for measures to address climate change and improve fire management practices.</p>]]></description>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to resign as the leader of the Liberal Party as early as Monday, following increasing pressure after the resignation of his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation is anticipated amid falling poll numbers for the Liberal Party.</li>
  <li>The upcoming caucus meeting aims to address calls for his resignation.</li>
  <li>Freeland's resignation on December 16 has amplified scrutiny on Trudeau.</li>
  <li>Concerns are growing over economic instability and potential threats from the US administration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The country could face instability, notably from an economic threat in the potential of a 25% US tariff on Canadian imports from the incoming administration.” - Kody Blois, Liberal Party Leader</blockquote>
<p>This impending leadership change could significantly affect Canadian politics, including potential ramifications for Trudeau's role as prime minister.</p>]]></description>

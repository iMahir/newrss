<p>Mediators in Doha, Qatar, have agreed on a phased ceasefire deal in Gaza aimed at alleviating tensions and restoring some level of peace.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ceasefire will begin with a 42-day first phase starting Sunday.</li>
  <li>During this period, Hamas is to release 33 hostages.</li>
  <li>Israel will release between 900 and 1,650 Palestinian detainees, including all those detained since October 7, 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>This agreement is a critical step towards de-escalation in the long-standing conflict in the region, although the effectiveness of the ceasefire will depend on compliance from both parties.</p>]]></description>

<p>A Pakistan court sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and his wife Bushra Bibi to 7 years for corruption related to the al-Qadir Trust case, involving losses of 190 million pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The verdict, delivered by Judge Nasir Javed Rana, resulted from a case initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in December 2023.</li>
<li>Khan and Bibi were fined and face additional imprisonment if they fail to pay.</li>
<li>The conviction has raised concerns about the integrity of the judiciary according to Khan's comments.</li>
<li>This ruling adds to Khan's legal troubles since his ouster as PM in 2022, as he faces numerous pending cases.</li>
<li>The political situation remains tense as negotiations are ongoing between the government and Khan’s political party, PTI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today’s verdict has tarnished the reputation of the judiciary...” - Imran Khan</blockquote>
<p>The conviction of Khan and Bibi represents both a legal and a political crisis in Pakistan, further complicating the country's already unstable governance.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Trump's Treasury Pick Scott Bessent Pours Cold Water on US Digital Dollar Initiative</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> Decrypt</p>
<p>During a Senate confirmation hearing, Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, expressed his opposition to the implementation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), stating he sees no need for it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bessent stated, "I see no reason for the U.S. to have a central bank digital currency" during the confirmation hearing.</li>
  <li>His stance contrasts with ongoing federal CBDC exploration as various agencies consider its potential benefits.</li>
  <li>If confirmed, Bessent could reverse current federal efforts to research CBDCs, aligning with Trump's previous promises against a U.S. CBDC.</li>
  <li>Broader Republican opposition to CBDCs includes legislative moves like the House's passage of the Anti-Surveillance State Act.</li>
  <li>A large majority of countries globally are currently exploring their own CBDC initiatives, impacting discussions in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are digital versions of a nation's fiat currency and have been explored for years in the U.S."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bessent's remarks could significantly influence the future of digital currency policy under the new administration and mark a divergence from trends seen in numerous global economies.</p>]]></description>

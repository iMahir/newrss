<figcaption>A PAL Airlines aircraft was operating Air Canada flight AC2259 between St. John’s and Halifax.(Pixabay/Representative)</figcaption>
<p>An Air Canada flight experienced a harrowing incident at Halifax airport, skidding down the runway and catching fire due to a broken landing gear. This event occurred just hours after a deadly crash in South Korea.</p>
<ul>
<li>An Air Canada flight made an emergency landing at Halifax airport.</li>
<li>The aircraft skidded and caught fire after suffering landing gear failure.</li>
<li>No casualties were reported in the Halifax incident.</li>
<li>The incident followed a tragic plane crash in South Korea, where a Jeju Air Boeing 737 exploded on landing, resulting in 179 presumed deaths.</li>
<li>Footage purportedly showed the aircraft's wings scraping the runway, leading to the fiery mishap.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Jeju Air plane was carrying 181 passengers; only two are confirmed survivors.”</blockquote>
<p>This accident raises serious concerns about air safety, especially coming on the heels of another devastating plane mishap.</p>]]></description>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has expressed his support for the H-1B visa program amidst a public dispute initiated by Elon Musk, who defended the program against criticism from some of Trump's supporters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump stated he has always endorsed the H-1B visa program and utilized it for his businesses.</li>
  <li>Elon Musk vowed to go to “war” to protect the program, emphasizing its importance for the tech industry.</li>
  <li>The H-1B visa allows foreign tech workers to temporarily work in the US, with recent applications processed amid political contention.</li>
  <li>Trump's past criticisms of the program contrast with his current stance, which supports attracting international talent.</li>
  <li>Far-right activists have challenged Trump over immigration policy, highlighting conflict within the Republican party.</li>
  <li>The debate is heightened by ongoing discussions about the labor market and the role of immigrant workers in the economy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. It’s a great programme.” - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This issue illustrates the complexities surrounding immigration policy, especially as it relates to the tech sector and the opinions of influential figures like Musk.</p>]]></description>

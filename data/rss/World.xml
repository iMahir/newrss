<p>The U.S. report highlights an increased military presence and infrastructure development by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since the 2020 standoff with India, emphasizing China's preparations for potential conflicts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PLA's coercive actions have escalated in the Indo-Pacific region during 2023.</li>
  <li>Significant military infrastructure has been built since the 2020 standoff with India.</li>
  <li>China has not reduced its troop levels or military positions since the Galwan clash in June 2020.</li>
  <li>In November 2023, India and China agreed to disengage from two remaining friction points.</li>
  <li>Since 1998, China has settled several territorial disputes with its neighbors using a more assertive strategy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The PLA has not drawn down its positions or troop numbers since the 2020 clash and has built infrastructure and support facilities to maintain multiple Brigade deployments along the LAC.</blockquote>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted that Russia has not faced defeat in Syria and announced plans to meet with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Putin stated that Russia made proposals to the new Syrian rulers to maintain military bases in the country.</li>
  <li>He mentioned his intention to discuss the fate of U.S. reporter Austin Tice with Assad.</li>
  <li>Putin emphasized that Russia has achieved its goals in Syria by preventing terrorist enclaves.</li>
  <li>He highlighted ongoing support from many in Syria for Russia's military presence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"You want to portray everything that is happening in Syria as some kind of failure, a defeat for Russia. I assure you, it is not. And I'll tell you why. We came to Syria 10 years ago to prevent a terrorist enclave from being created there," said Mr. Putin.</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Putin's remarks reflect Russia's ongoing involvement and strategic interests in Syria, amidst shifting political dynamics in the region.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Canadian PM Trudeau's leadership has landed in hot waters after Trump's tariff threat. (AP/File)</figcaption>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing intensified pressure to resign as around 15 members of his own Liberal Party have publicly called for him to step down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The resignation of Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland has escalated calls for Trudeau's exit.</li>
  <li>MP Brendan Hanley remarked that Trudeau must step aside for the good of the party.</li>
  <li>Trudeau's leadership is under scrutiny following poor electoral performance and internal dissent.</li>
  <li>Polling suggests Trudeau would lose to Conservative rival Pierre Poilievre if an election were held now.</li>
  <li>Another Liberal MP, Wayne Long, noted that growing numbers of MPs want Trudeau to resign immediately.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This isn’t just about one man — it’s about saving our party from historic defeat.” - MP Wayne Long</blockquote>
<p>With increasing dissent within the party and external pressures, Trudeau's future remains uncertain as he reflects on recent events and considers possible cabinet reshuffles.</p>]]></description>

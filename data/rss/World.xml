<p>Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz has stated that the nation is closer than ever to a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza since the November 2023 truce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Katz reported that Israeli negotiators are engaged in talks with Qatari officials regarding the hostage situation.</li>
<li>A Hamas official indicated that negotiations include a potential ceasefire.</li>
<li>The war, which began on October 7, 2023, has led to significant casualties and hostage situations, with over 250 taken during the initial attack.</li>
<li>Historically, previous mediations have failed to secure lasting agreements.</li>

<p>TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have requested the US Supreme Court to prevent an impending government ban that would occur next month, citing supportive remarks from President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok seeks to delay the law's enforcement until the court reviews its appeal.</li>
<li>The ban is set to take place on January 19, the day before Trump's inauguration.</li>
<li>Trump's future enforcement actions may influence the ban as it relates to national security and user privacy.</li>
<li>TikTok claims the ban could harm free speech rights protected under the First Amendment.</li>
<li>Content creators have also joined TikTok in asking the Supreme Court to intervene.</li>
<li>Lawmakers argue the legislation is necessary to prevent espionage by China.</li>
<li> TikTok's user base has grown significantly, with a survey showing 17% of US adults regularly sourcing news from the platform.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It would not be in the interest of anyone — not the parties, the public, or the courts — for the act’s ban on TikTok to take effect...” - TikTok</blockquote>
<p>This legal battle underscores the intersection of technology, national security, and free expression in the digital age.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> A truck attack on New Year's revelers in New Orleans' French Quarter has left 15 dead and around 30 injured, with authorities treating it as a potential act of terrorism. The suspect, a US-born Army veteran, was killed by police.</p>
<ol>
<li>The attack occurred on Bourbon Street, a popular New Year's Eve destination, with crowds swelling for the Sugar Bowl game.</li>
<li>The suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was an Army veteran with financial struggles and a recent divorce.</li>
<li>Jabbar expressed a desire to kill and was inspired by ISIS, according to videos posted before the attack.</li>
<li>Two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were found in Jabbar's vehicle, and additional potential IEDs were discovered in the French Quarter.</li>
<li>World leaders, including Pope Francis and Indian PM Narendra Modi, condemned the attack and offered condolences.</li>
<li>Elon Musk suggested a possible link between the New Orleans attack and a Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Ziaur Rahman, Bangladesh’s Hero as Country Rewrites Its History</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> The Tribune</p>
<p>Bangladesh's government is rewriting history textbooks, shifting credit for the country's 1971 independence from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to Ziaur Rahman.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new textbooks, set to be used in 2025, will state that Ziaur Rahman declared independence.</li>
  <li>Ziaur Rahman is also noted for reiterating the declaration the following day on behalf of Mujib.</li>
  <li>This shift undermines the historical significance of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, considered the Father of the Nation.</li>
  <li>There are concerns about the influence of Islamist demands on the educational narrative.</li>
  <li>There are also reports of India’s role in the liberation war being downplayed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The country's new textbooks in 2025 will now credit Ziaur Rahman instead of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, as the one who declared the country’s independence.”</blockquote>
<p>This change in the educational narrative raises important questions about historical accountability and the influence of political agendas in shaping national identity.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Palestinian Authority has ordered the suspension of broadcasts by Al Jazeera across the Palestinian territories, citing accusations of incitement. This decision comes amid an ongoing conflict between the network and Israeli authorities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The suspension of Al Jazeera's broadcasts is reported due to claims of inciting content.</li>
  <li>The Palestinian Authority's decision follows previous actions against the network, including a raid of its office by Israeli forces.</li>
  <li>Al Jazeera's office in Ramallah has received an official suspension order.</li>
  <li>The decision affects all employees and journalists associated with the network in Palestine.</li>
  <li>Hamas and Islamic Jihad have condemned the decision, arguing it undermines media freedom.</li>
  <li>The tensions between Al Jazeera and the Palestinian Authority have escalated due to recent coverage of clashes in Jenin.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The Palestinian Authority's decision aligns with Israeli occupation practices targeting its media teams.</blockquote>
<p>The decision to suspend Al Jazeera's broadcasting underscores ongoing challenges in press freedom and raises concerns about media coverage in conflict zones.</p>]]></description>

<p>Once banished from the F-35 program and left with a capability gap, Turkey has turned around its destiny by expanding its aerospace industry. From developing fifth-generation fighters to advanced drones, Turkey is now a credible aerospace power.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turkey significantly reduced its military import reliance, going from 80% in 2004 to less than 20% today.</li>
  <li>The Turkish Aerospace Hürkus-II advanced trainer aircraft had its maiden flight on December 30.</li>
  <li>Baykar acquired the Italian aviation giant Piaggio Aerospace, expanding its reach into European markets.</li>
  <li>Turkey is indigenously developing its own stealth aircraft, known as KAAN, expected to enter service in the early 2030s.</li>
  <li>The upcoming Hurjet trainer is set for production in 2025, after its maiden flight in April 2024.</li>
  <li>Baykar's TB-2 drone has gained fame for its performance in conflicts and has been sold to numerous countries.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The rapid development of Turkey’s defense industries has resulted in many collateral benefits, such as consolidating President Erdoğan’s regime without any fear of military challenge.” - Prakash Nanda</blockquote>
<p>In summary, Turkey is poised to become a key player in aerospace and defense with substantial domestic advancements and international expansions.</p>]]></description>

<p>From January 1, 2025, Switzerland officially bans burqas, hijabs, and any other face coverings in public spaces, as mandated by a law solidified in 2023 after a 2021 referendum where 51.2% of voters supported the ban.</p>
<ul>
<li>The law includes fines of up to 1,000 francs for violators.</li>
<li>Exceptions are made for health-related facial coverings and coverings in places of worship.</li>
<li>The proposal was driven by the right-wing Swiss People's Party, citing concerns over extremism.</li>
<li>The Muslim population in Switzerland is predominantly from Turkey, Bosnia, and Kosovo, making up about 5% of the total population.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today’s decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority.” - Central Council of Muslims</blockquote>
<p>This law raises significant discussions on women's rights, identity, and the ongoing debate surrounding secularism and multiculturalism in Switzerland.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>ISIS flag displayed on the pickup truck used in the New Orleans terror attack.</figcaption>
<p>On Wednesday morning, a 42-year-old man identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar deliberately drove his pickup truck into a crowded street in New Orleans' French Quarter neighborhood, killing at least 15 people and injuring 30 others. Jabbar, a US Army veteran, was later killed in a shootout with police. The truck was adorned with an ISIS flag.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The FBI confirmed that Jabbar acted alone and recovered multiple firearms and explosives from his vehicle and the surrounding area.</li>
  <li>Jabbar expressed his allegiance to ISIS and desire to kill people in social media videos uploaded before the attack.</li>
  <li>Jabbar served in the US Army from 2007 to 2020, deploying to Afghanistan, and had a criminal history including theft and driving with an invalid license.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick described the incident as 'not just an act of terrorism. This is evil.'</blockquote>
<p>A college football game scheduled to be played nearby was postponed following the attack.</p>]]></description>

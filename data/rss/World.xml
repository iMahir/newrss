<p>Ann Telnaes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, resigned from the Washington Post after her cartoon criticizing tech leaders, including Jeff Bezos, was rejected. The cartoon satirized their flattery towards President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Telnaes submitted a cartoon aimed at notable tech moguls which was ultimately pulled from publication.</li>
  <li>The cartoon humorously depicted Bezos and others kneeling before a statue of Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>Telnaes expressed frustration over being unable to address critical issues through her artwork.</li>
  <li>The incident follows previous controversies regarding editorial decisions at the Washington Post.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press.” - Ann Telnaes</blockquote>
<p>The resignation raises concerns about editorial censorship and creative freedom in journalism.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>9999 and out: Steven Smith falls one short of landmark 10,000 Test runs</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> ESPN Cricinfo</p>
<p>Steven Smith narrowly missed reaching the 10,000-run milestone in Test cricket, falling out at 9999 runs during a match in Sydney. He will have to wait for the upcoming Test against Sri Lanka for another chance at this achievement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Smith edged to slip just five runs short of 10,000 runs on the previous day.</li>
<li>During the Pink Test on Jane McGrath Day, he was dismissed at 9999 runs.</li>
<li>Smith becomes the second batter in history to fall on 9999 runs, after Mahela Jayawardene.</li>
<li>If he reaches 10,000 runs, he will be the 15th player ever to achieve this milestone.</li>
<li>Border praised Smith, ranking him alongside Australia’s cricket greats.</li>
<li>Smith’s path to the milestone has been delayed after a lean season following Warner’s retirement.</li>
<li>He is expected to captain Australia during the Sri Lanka tour.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Averaging 57 or so is in the top echelon ever… as far as Australia’s concerned, Steve [Smith] ranks equally with that group, no problems whatsoever.” - Allan Border</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Smith's journey to 10,000 runs has faced unexpected delays, but his position as one of the top cricketers remains undoubted.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Washington Post Cartoonist Resigns Over Refusal to Publish Anti-Bezos Cartoon</h1>
<p><strong>Date: January 3, 2025<br>Source: The Guardian</strong></p>
<img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14266fd8d33d4533d652d885b1cfb829bd45757/0_0_1725_2100/master/1725.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none" alt="Ann Telnaes’s cartoon rejected by the Washington Post." width="445" height="541.7391304347826" loading="lazy" /><figcaption>Ann Telnaes’s cartoon rejected by the Washington Post. Photograph: Ann Telnaes</figcaption>
<p>The Washington Post’s Pulitzer prize-winning editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, has resigned from her position at the newspaper after its refusal to publish a satirical cartoon depicting the outlet’s owner, Jeff Bezos, kneeling before Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The cartoon, a critique of billionaire tech and media executives’ attempts to curry favor with Trump, was rejected by the Post’s opinions editor, David Shipley, who cited a desire to avoid repetition. Telnaes, however, believes the rejection was due to the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary, raising concerns about censorship and freedom of the press.</p>
<ul>
<li>Telnaes’s resignation comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the Post and Bezos’ decision to block an endorsement of Kamala Harris in the presidential election.</li>
<li>Trump’s victory over Harris in the election has led to conciliatory gestures from tech and media executives, including a dinner between Trump and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and a $15m settlement from ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos to resolve a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press." - Ann Telnaes</blockquote>
<p>Telnaes, who won the Pulitzer for illustrated reporting and commentary in 2001 and is a three-time finalist for the prestigious award, believes the Post’s decision to censor her work sets a dangerous precedent for free press.</p>]]></description>

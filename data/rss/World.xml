<figcaption>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during a news conference at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, where he announced his resignation.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In response to escalating discontent over the leadership, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as prime minister after months of political crisis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau claimed that India was sponsoring criminal activities on Canadian soil, a claim denied by New Delhi.</li>
  <li>His resignation follows serious internal divisions and slumping polls within his party.</li>
  <li>Allegations against India started in September 2023 regarding the killing of Khalistani militant Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</li>
  <li>Relations between India and Canada deteriorated following Trudeau's accusations, resulting in expelled diplomats and heightened tensions.</li>
  <li>Increased pro-Khalistani sentiments and attacks on temples in Canada were significant factors leading to Trudeau's political downfall.</li>
  <li>Trudeau's administration failed to provide evidence for his allegations despite international pressure, raising questions about their validity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The diplomatic fallout from Trudeau's claims was severe for his leadership in Canada, which has a significant Indian population.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Trudeau's resignation underscores the significant impact of political allegations on international relations and internal party dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<p>European leaders expressed their frustration with Elon Musk as a major controversy escalated involving misinformation online, historical sex offences, and the interference of a tech billionaire in European politics.</p>
<ul>
<li>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized Musk for spreading misinformation regarding sex offences in northern England.</li>
<li>Musk accused Starmer of being complicit in mass rapes due to his previous role as chief state prosecutor.</li>
<li>French President Emmanuel Macron condemned Musk for interfering in elections, particularly in Germany.</li>

<ul>
  <li>BRICS, originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, continues to expand its influence globally.</li>
  <li>The acceptance comes at a pivotal time as Brazil prepares to take over the rotating presidency of BRICS in 2025.</li>
  <li>Indonesia's membership was delayed due to its presidential elections, but the country is now set to contribute to the bloc's goals.</li>
  <li>The BRICS alliance aims to reform global governance and enhance cooperation among developing nations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Indonesia shares with the other members of the group support for the reform of global governance institutions and contributes positively to the deepening cooperation of the global south.” - Brazilian President<br></blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Biden to Ban Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling Along U.S. Coastlines</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2021 | <strong>Source:</strong> Reuters</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas development along most U.S. coastlines, a significant climate action that may face challenges from President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ban affects 625 million acres of federal waters.</li>
<li>It is primarily symbolic, as it does not impact current drilling operations.</li>
<li>The move aligns with Biden's climate change goals, including conserving 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.</li>
<li>Biden referenced the risks posed by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill to support the decision.</li>
<li>15% of U.S. oil production comes from federal offshore areas, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
<li>Trump criticized the ban and pledged to reverse it upon taking office.</li>
<li>Environmental groups hailed the ban as a victory for coastal communities.</li>
<li>The American Petroleum Institute argued the ban jeopardizes U.S. energy security.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage... It is not worth the risks." - President Joe Biden</blockquote>
<p>As the U.S. navigates its role as a leading oil producer, the future of offshore drilling policies remains uncertain amidst shifting political landscapes.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Race Is On Between West And East For Control In Syria</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 8, 2023 &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> OilPrice.com</p>
<p>Following the surprise removal of President Bashar al-Assad after 53 years in power, the U.S. and other global powers are reassessing their strategies for Syria's future control and energy management.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. had long-term plans anticipating al-Assad’s fall since 2011, focusing on oil and gas support for various factions.</li>
<li>Syria was a significant producer of oil, exporting to Europe before the onset of conflict in 2011.</li>
<li>Russia has strengthened its geopolitical stance in Syria, aiming to control energy projects and military bases.</li>
<li>Turkey is also engaging with Syria for economic reconstruction and energy utilization.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The U.S. wanted to put Moscow’s and Tehran’s leadership on notice that Washington can easily redraw and restructure borders and regimes in not just the Middle East but also in Eastern Europe, if it wants to.” - Senior security source in the E.U.</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing struggle for influence in Syria illustrates broader geopolitical tensions and the intricate link between natural resources and international relations.</p>]]></description>

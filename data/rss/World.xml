<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing intensified pressure to resign as around 15 members of his own Liberal Party have publicly called for him to step down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The resignation of Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland has escalated calls for Trudeau's exit.</li>
  <li>MP Brendan Hanley remarked that Trudeau must step aside for the good of the party.</li>
  <li>Trudeau's leadership is under scrutiny following poor electoral performance and internal dissent.</li>
  <li>Polling suggests Trudeau would lose to Conservative rival Pierre Poilievre if an election were held now.</li>
  <li>Another Liberal MP, Wayne Long, noted that growing numbers of MPs want Trudeau to resign immediately.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This isn’t just about one man — it’s about saving our party from historic defeat.” - MP Wayne Long</blockquote>
<p>With increasing dissent within the party and external pressures, Trudeau's future remains uncertain as he reflects on recent events and considers possible cabinet reshuffles.</p>]]></description>

<p>Israel conducted strikes on strategic locations in Yemen after intercepting a missile fired by Houthi rebels. The Israeli Defense Minister warned the Houthis that they would also be targeted.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Israeli military targeted ports and energy facilities used by Houthi rebels.</li>
  <li>Houthi media reported casualties and damage to infrastructure in Sanaa and Hodaidah.</li>
  <li>This action is part of an ongoing conflict where Houthis have launched multiple missiles towards Israel.</li>
  <li>Israeli officials characterized the Houthis as a significant threat, echoing concerns about Iranian support for the group.</li>
  <li>Israel's military stated it would respond to threats from any group in the region.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I warn the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organisation: Israel's long arm will reach you too," - Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz.</blockquote>
<p>This escalation underscores the growing regional tensions as the Houthis align their operations with the conflict in Gaza, promising to continue attacks until a ceasefire is achieved.</p>]]></description>

<p>Chris Langan, known for his high IQ, shares his views on death and existence. He believes that death may not be the end, suggesting a continuity into another dimension.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Langan claims that reality is a self-simulation and developed the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU).</li>
  <li>He discusses the concept of death as a transition rather than an end, implying a shift to another dimension.</li>
  <li>According to him, one may forget their previous life after this transition due to being in a state of meditation.</li>

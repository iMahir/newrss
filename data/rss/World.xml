<figcaption>Elon Musk, a Donald Trump confidant, has in the past endorsed his idea of Canada merging with the US.(Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>Tech billionaire and Tesla boss Elon Musk took a jab at outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after Trudeau rejected the Canada-US merger proposed by US President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Musk targeted Trudeau on social media after Trudeau dismissed any notion of a merger, emphasizing Canada's independence.</li>
  <li>Trudeau stated, "There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States," highlighting the beneficial partnership between the two nations.</li>
  <li>Musk replied, "Girl, you’re not the governor of Canada anymore, so doesn’t matter what you say," in a sassy retort.</li>
  <li>Trump previously endorsed the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state, suggesting military action was not necessary, but rather economic influence.</li>
  <li>Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre echoed Trudeau's sentiment, affirming Canada’s independence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Canada will never be the 51st state. Period. We are a great and independent country." - Pierre Poilievre</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing dialogue surrounding the proposed merger reflects deeper political tensions and differing perspectives on national identity.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Race for Canada's Next Prime Minister Begins After Trudeau's Resignation</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Tuesday, Date Unspecified | <strong>Source:</strong> The Tribune</p>
<p>The race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canadian Prime Minister commenced following his resignation amid political turmoil and trade tensions with the US. The Liberal Party faces the challenge of rebuilding amidst low poll standings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation creates an opportunity for Liberal Party leadership candidates.</li>
  <li>Polls indicate the party is likely to lose upcoming elections, impacting candidate interest.</li>
  <li>Potential candidates include Chrystia Freeland, Mark Carney, Anita Anand, François-Philippe Champagne, Melanie Joly, Dominic LeBlanc, and Christy Clark.</li>
  <li>Freeland's resignation was seen as a catalyst for Trudeau stepping down.</li>
  <li>Mark Carney is perceived as a strong candidate but lacks political experience.</li>
  <li>Anita Anand has held significant cabinet roles during the pandemic and military scrutiny.</li>
  <li>Christy Clark is a notable contender with past premier experience but faces language barriers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As a lifelong Liberal I look forward to joining tens of thousands of Canadians to choose our next leader.” - Christy Clark</blockquote>
<p>The leadership race injects uncertainty into Canada's political landscape as the Liberal Party strives to establish new leadership before Parliament reopens in March.</p>]]></description>

<p>A dangerous wildfire is raging in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, devastating nearly 3,000 acres and forcing over 30,000 residents to evacuate. The fire is exacerbated by hurricane-force winds.</p>
<ul>
<li>A wildfire in Los Angeles raged across an upscale section amid a fierce windstorm hitting Southern California.</li>
<li>The fire erupted midmorning and swelled quickly, taking many residents by surprise.</li>
<li>The fire came as the area was being hit by seasonal Santa Ana winds, with gusts up to 100 miles (160 kilometres) an hour expected.</li>
<li>The fire swiftly consumed nearly 2 square miles (just over 5 square kilometres) of land.</li>
<li>Hundreds of firefighters are on site, tackling the blaze from both ground and air.</li>
<li>Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley confirmed there were no immediate reports of casualties.</li>

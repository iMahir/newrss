<ul>
<li>The joint session of Congress took place on January 6, 2025, presided over by Vice President Harris.</li>
<li>Mr. Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Ms. Harris’s 226.</li>
<li>No attempts were made by Democrats to block the certification.</li>
<li>Security was heightened around the Capitol during the certification process due to past events.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!" - Donald Trump</blockquote>

<p>Indonesia has officially joined the BRICS economic alliance as its 10th member, following its acceptance during the group’s annual summit in 2023.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BRICS, originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, continues to expand its influence globally.</li>
  <li>The acceptance comes at a pivotal time as Brazil prepares to take over the rotating presidency of BRICS in 2025.</li>
  <li>Indonesia's membership was delayed due to its presidential elections, but the country is now set to contribute to the bloc's goals.</li>
  <li>The BRICS alliance aims to reform global governance and enhance cooperation among developing nations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Indonesia shares with the other members of the group support for the reform of global governance institutions and contributes positively to the deepening cooperation of the global south.” - Brazilian President<br></blockquote>
<p>The entry of Indonesia into BRICS indicates growing collaboration among emerging economies amid geopolitical challenges, especially with the US taking a more stringent stance towards such alliances.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Biden to Ban Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling Along U.S. Coastlines</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2021 | <strong>Source:</strong> Reuters</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas development along most U.S. coastlines, a significant climate action that may face challenges from President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ban affects 625 million acres of federal waters.</li>
<li>It is primarily symbolic, as it does not impact current drilling operations.</li>
<li>The move aligns with Biden's climate change goals, including conserving 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.</li>
<li>Biden referenced the risks posed by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill to support the decision.</li>
<li>15% of U.S. oil production comes from federal offshore areas, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
<li>Trump criticized the ban and pledged to reverse it upon taking office.</li>
<li>Environmental groups hailed the ban as a victory for coastal communities.</li>
<li>The American Petroleum Institute argued the ban jeopardizes U.S. energy security.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage... It is not worth the risks." - President Joe Biden</blockquote>
<p>As the U.S. navigates its role as a leading oil producer, the future of offshore drilling policies remains uncertain amidst shifting political landscapes.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 8, 2023 &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> OilPrice.com</p>
<p>Following the surprise removal of President Bashar al-Assad after 53 years in power, the U.S. and other global powers are reassessing their strategies for Syria's future control and energy management.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. had long-term plans anticipating al-Assad’s fall since 2011, focusing on oil and gas support for various factions.</li>
<li>Syria was a significant producer of oil, exporting to Europe before the onset of conflict in 2011.</li>
<li>Russia has strengthened its geopolitical stance in Syria, aiming to control energy projects and military bases.</li>
<li>Turkey is also engaging with Syria for economic reconstruction and energy utilization.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The U.S. wanted to put Moscow’s and Tehran’s leadership on notice that Washington can easily redraw and restructure borders and regimes in not just the Middle East but also in Eastern Europe, if it wants to.” - Senior security source in the E.U.</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing struggle for influence in Syria illustrates broader geopolitical tensions and the intricate link between natural resources and international relations.</p>]]></description>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as Liberal Party leader amidst party dissent and declining popularity, leading to a search for his successor.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation is a response to growing pressure from his party, with 131 out of 153 MPs opposing him.</li>
  <li>Chrystia Freeland, Mark Carney, Dominic LeBlanc, Melanie Joly, and Francois-Philippe Champagne are among the top contenders to succeed Trudeau.</li>
  <li>Two Indian-origin MPs, Anita Anand and George Chahal, are also potential candidates for party leadership.</li>
  <li>The party faces urgent decisions on appointing an interim leader or holding a leadership contest.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Liberals would be in the hands of an interim prime minister not chosen by members, which has never happened in Canada before.”</blockquote>
<p>The Liberal Party's upcoming leadership change may significantly impact Canadian politics, as the party struggles with public support amid economic challenges.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Child Tax Credit 2025 Overview</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Child Tax Credit (CTC) for 2025 is experiencing significant changes that require families to act sooner than expected. This government program aims to provide financial assistance to qualifying families while introducing adjusted eligibility criteria along with income limits.</p>
<ul>
<li>The income eligibility limit will remain $400,000 for married couples filing jointly and $200,000 for all other filers.</li>
<li>Families will receive up to $2,000 per child, but the value of the credit may be diminished due to rising living costs.</li>
<li>The CTC is vital for American families, especially in light of increasing expenses for housing, healthcare, and education.</li>
<li>To claim the credit for the 2025 tax year, families need to file their tax returns by April 15, 2026.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The CTC and other government assistance programs play an important role in helping families, particularly those with lower incomes.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the adjustments to the Child Tax Credit highlight the need for families to prepare ahead and understand the eligibility prerequisites and claiming process to best utilize available financial support.</p>]]></description>

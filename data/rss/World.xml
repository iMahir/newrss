<p>India's ranking has dropped by five points to 85 this year in a global passport index, topped by Singapore for the second consecutive year.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Henley Passport Index released by Henley & Partners shows India at 85th place.</li>
<li>In 2024, India was ranked 80th globally.</li>
<li>Pakistan and Bangladesh rank 103rd and 100th respectively in 2025.</li>
<li>The U.S. fell from 7th to 9th place, while China's ranking improved to 60th.</li>
<li>Japan ranks 2nd this year, having shared the top rank with Singapore in 2024.</li>
<li>Over the past decade, only 22 of the world's 199 passports have fallen in ranking.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Faced with unprecedented volatility, investors and wealthy families are adopting a strategy of geopolitical arbitrage to acquire additional residence and/or citizenship options..." - Juerg Steffen, CEO of Henley & Partners</blockquote>
<p>This decline in India's passport ranking reflects ongoing challenges in global mobility and may impact the perception of Indian citizenship.</p>]]></description>

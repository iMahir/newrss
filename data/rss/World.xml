<p>Once banished from the F-35 program and left with a capability gap, Turkey has turned around its destiny by expanding its aerospace industry. From developing fifth-generation fighters to advanced drones, Turkey is now a credible aerospace power.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turkey significantly reduced its military import reliance, going from 80% in 2004 to less than 20% today.</li>
  <li>The Turkish Aerospace Hürkus-II advanced trainer aircraft had its maiden flight on December 30.</li>
  <li>Baykar acquired the Italian aviation giant Piaggio Aerospace, expanding its reach into European markets.</li>
  <li>Turkey is indigenously developing its own stealth aircraft, known as KAAN, expected to enter service in the early 2030s.</li>
  <li>The upcoming Hurjet trainer is set for production in 2025, after its maiden flight in April 2024.</li>
  <li>Baykar's TB-2 drone has gained fame for its performance in conflicts and has been sold to numerous countries.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The rapid development of Turkey’s defense industries has resulted in many collateral benefits, such as consolidating President Erdoğan’s regime without any fear of military challenge.” - Prakash Nanda</blockquote>
<p>In summary, Turkey is poised to become a key player in aerospace and defense with substantial domestic advancements and international expansions.</p>]]></description>

<p>From January 1, 2025, Switzerland officially bans burqas, hijabs, and any other face coverings in public spaces, as mandated by a law solidified in 2023 after a 2021 referendum where 51.2% of voters supported the ban.</p>
<ul>
<li>The law includes fines of up to 1,000 francs for violators.</li>
<li>Exceptions are made for health-related facial coverings and coverings in places of worship.</li>
<li>The proposal was driven by the right-wing Swiss People's Party, citing concerns over extremism.</li>
<li>The Muslim population in Switzerland is predominantly from Turkey, Bosnia, and Kosovo, making up about 5% of the total population.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today’s decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority.” - Central Council of Muslims</blockquote>
<p>This law raises significant discussions on women's rights, identity, and the ongoing debate surrounding secularism and multiculturalism in Switzerland.</p>]]></description>

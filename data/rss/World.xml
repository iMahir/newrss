<figcaption>The poster shared by Pakistan International Airlines on X that sparked an uproar.</figcaption>
<p>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has been at the center of attention following a controversial advertisement promoting its first flight to Paris in over four years. Despite facing backlash for its misleading ad, the flight was greeted positively upon arrival.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This was PIA's first flight to Paris since the pandemic, operating twice a week from Islamabad.</li>
  <li>The airline faced criticism for a poster that reminded many of a past ad linked to the 9/11 attacks.</li>
  <li>Social media users continue to mock the airline for the ad, prompting calls for its removal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Is this a threat?” asked X user Dr Parik Patel. “You can’t be serious this time! Fire your designer!” commented user Muhammad Uzair Balagamwala.</blockquote>
<p>The incident highlights the sensitive nature of airline marketing and the swift reactions it can provoke on social media platforms.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The fireworks lit on the New Year’s Eve may have started the devastating Palisades Fire (Source: Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>The Palisades Fire, which killed at least 24 people in Los Angeles, is suspected to have started from fireworks set off on New Year’s Eve. Strong winds may have reignited the fire remnants, leading to the most destructive wildfire in California's history.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The fire started in the same area previously burned by New Year’s Eve fireworks.</li>
  <li>Residents reported slow response from firefighters during the second outbreak of the fire.</li>
  <li>The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) was engaged elsewhere when residents attempted to report the fire.</li>
  <li>The investigation is ongoing, with no definitive evidence linking the origins of the fire to the New Year’s Eve fireworks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The wildfire was actually started on New Year’s Eve by some 'idiots'... fireworks were lit off by people late at night.” - Local resident</blockquote>
<p>The Palisades Fire's legacy will likely reshape fire prevention strategies, highlighting the need for community awareness regarding safety during celebrations.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
<li>The NASAMS system has proven effective in countering missile threats in the Ukraine conflict.</li>
<li>The deal includes radar systems worth US$192.6 million to be located in key Taiwanese regions.</li>
<li>Taiwan aims to integrate advanced technologies to fortify its defenses amidst escalating military tensions.</li>
<li>This procurement is part of a broader strategy by Taiwan to acquire battle-tested weaponry amid growing threats from China.</li>

<figcaption>Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44, the highest since August 27.</figcaption>
<p>Oil prices have risen to their highest level in over three months due to new US sanctions targeting Russian oil exports, affecting key importers like China and India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels shipping Russian oil.</li>
  <li>Brent crude futures reached $81.11 a barrel and peaked at $81.44, the highest since August 27.</li>
  <li>US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $77.97 a barrel after a high of $78.32.</li>
  <li>The sanctions aim to cut revenue that funds Russia's war efforts in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Brent crude futures climbed $1.35, or 1.69%, to $81.11 a barrel by 2339 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $81.44."</blockquote>
<p>This escalation in oil prices highlights the impact of geopolitical tensions and ongoing sanctions on global markets.</p>]]></description>

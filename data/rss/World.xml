<p>Iran has lifted the ban on popular platforms WhatsApp and Google Play, marking a significant step in reducing internet restrictions enforced by the government.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Iranian government announced the lifting of the ban as the first step in easing internet limitations.</li>
  <li>Tehran's internet controls are among the strictest globally, but many Iranians bypass these using VPNs.</li>
  <li>A majority vote was passed to allow access to these platforms during a meeting led by President Masoud Pezeshkian.</li>
  <li>The lifting of the ban occurs shortly after Iran paused a new stricter law mandating women's hijab.</li>
  <li>The law previously proposed heavier penalties on hijab violations but is now on hold due to its controversial nature.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A positive majority vote has been reached to lift limitations on access to some popular foreign platforms...” - IRNA</blockquote>
<p>The recent developments in Iran suggest a potential thaw in the country's approach to internet freedom and social regulations, though challenges remain in the political landscape.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Syrian ex-rebel factions agree to merge under defence ministry</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 24, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Reuters</p>
<p>DAMASCUS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa reached an agreement on Tuesday with former rebel faction chiefs to dissolve all groups and consolidate them under the defence ministry, according to a statement from the new administration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa consolidated former rebel groups under the Defence Ministry.</li>
  <li>Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir announced plans for a restructuring of the ministry.</li>
  <li>Murhaf Abu Qasra, a prominent insurgent leader, appointed as interim defence minister.</li>
  <li>Sharaa aims to prevent clashes between different groups now unified under the ministry.</li>
  <li>Sharaa has assured Western officials that the HTS will not seek revenge against the former regime or suppress religious minorities.</li>
  <li>This development follows the rebels’ seizure of control in Damascus on December 8.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Syria's historic ethnic and religious minorities include Muslim Kurds and Shi'ites, who feared that any future Sunni Islamist rule would jeopardize their way of life.</blockquote>
<p>The new consolidation effort marks a significant step in post-civil war Syria, aiming for stability under a unified command.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Musk made this statement amid Krishnan's induction as Senior White House Policy Advisor on Artificial Intelligence.</figcaption>
<p>Elon Musk criticized the controversy around Sriram Krishnan's immigration views, describing opposing opinions as a “fixed pie” fallacy during his induction as a senior White House Policy Advisor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Musk took to X to share his thoughts on the debates surrounding green card caps.</li>
<li>Krisnan's stance aims to remove country caps for green cards, which he believes would enhance skilled immigration.</li>
<li>David Sacks clarified that Krishnan supports skills-based criteria for green cards, not an unlimited immigration program.</li>
<li>Several tech leaders, including Joe Lonsdale, defended Krishnan's appointment and views.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation.” - Elon Musk</blockquote>
<p>This discourse highlights important themes around immigration reform, economic policy, and national leadership in AI, particularly in the context of Trump's administration.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Mob justice incident involving Abdul Hai Kanu.</figcaption>
<p>In recent months, Bangladesh has experienced a surge in mob justice with incidents escalating after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government. The interim government, led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, has been unable to restore law and order amidst increasing violence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abdul Hai Kanu, a 78-year-old freedom fighter, was publicly humiliated and assaulted by a mob on December 22, highlighting the rise in mob justice.</li>
  <li>Over 82 people were killed due to mob incidents in just four months under the interim government.</li>
  <li>Despite police presence, fear among officers leads to reluctance in intervention during violent incidents.</li>
  <li>The country has seen a sharp rise in robbery and muggings, with at least 10 killed in Dhaka alone during this period.</li>
  <li>Human rights groups have reported a significant increase in fabricated legal cases during this time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are deeply concerned about mob justice. Police are not intervening, leading people to believe they can act without police interference.” - Advocate Saidur Rahman</blockquote>
<p>While mob violence has surged, there has been a noted decline in extrajudicial killings, previously rampant under the ousted regime. However, as political instability continues, the question of law and order remains critical in Bangladesh.</p>]]></description>

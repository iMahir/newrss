            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Bangladesh Political Crisis Impacts India's Foreign Tourist Arrivals</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Bangladesh-FTAs-box-01.jpg?resize=600,331" alt="Bangladesh’s share in India's foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs)"><figcaption>Bangladesh’s share in India's foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs)</figcaption>
<p>India's recovery in foreign tourist arrivals is hampered by a political crisis in Bangladesh, which has drastically reduced the number of Bangladeshi visitors, a key demographic for India’s tourism sector.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) in India were 9.8% lower in the first half of 2024 compared to 2019, worsening to 10.5% decline by August.</li>
<li>FTAs from Bangladesh fell by 20.3% year-on-year in July and 38.1% in August 2024.</li>
<li>Bangladesh constituted 20.8% of FTAs in the first half of 2024, dropping to 15.6% in August.</li>
<li>Outbound travel from India increased by 12% over the same period in 2019.</li>
<li>Political crisis culminated in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigning and fleeing the country on August 5, 2024.</li>
<li>Competitive visa policies and attractions in nearby Asian countries are further drawing tourists away from India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Countries such as Qatar, Dubai, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka are drawing tourists with more affordable options and favourable visa policies.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the political instability in Bangladesh significantly affects India's tourism sector, while other destinations capitalize on more favourable conditions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Israel Government Approves Ceasefire Deal with Hamas to End Gaza Conflict</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> January 18, 2025 06:54 AM IST - <strong>Source:</strong> HT News Desk</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/18/550x309/ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN-CONFLICT-1_1737158515552_1737158565828.jpg" alt="Netanyahu's security cabinet meeting" title="Netanyahu's security cabinet meeting" />
<figcaption>This handout picture released by the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO) shows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2-R), heading a security cabinet meeting to vote on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal that should take effect on January 19, 2025. (AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In a significant move towards ending the 15-month-long war in Gaza, Israel's government approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which will take effect on January 19, 2025, and includes a series of hostage exchanges.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ceasefire deal will facilitate the release of 33 Israeli hostages by Hamas.</li>
  <li>In exchange, Israel will free all Palestinian women and children under 19 currently in Israeli prisons.</li>
  <li>The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 46,000 casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza.</li>
  <li>Despite challenges, 24 cabinet members supported the deal, with strong opposition from hardline ministers.</li>
  <li>The deal was mediated by Qatar and the US and faced delays due to disputes and last-minute complications.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This agreement raises hopes for a reduction in hostilities.</blockquote>
<p>The approval marks a crucial step towards peace, though challenges remain as the situation in Gaza continues to evolve.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Israeli Air Force conducted significant airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, targeting key sites including ports and a power plant, and issued warnings to the group over its ongoing missile and drone attacks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Over 20 Israeli aircraft were involved in the strikes, dropping around 50 munitions.</li>
  <li>Main targets included the Hodeidah and Ras Isa ports, and the Hezyaz power plant.</li>
  <li>The IDF stated the power plant was crucial for the Houthi military operations.</li>
  <li>Israeli leaders warned of further action if attacks on Israel persisted.</li>
  <li>Netanyahu emphasized the need to counter Iranian influence via the Houthis.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"As we promised, the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us." - Benjamin Netanyahu</blockquote>
<p>The Israeli airstrikes represent a continuing escalation in the conflict, reflecting the regional tension stemming from Iran's involvement and the threat posed to Israel.</p>]]></description>

<p>The United States plans to impose stringent sanctions on Russia's oil industry, affecting around 180 ships and multiple traders. This move follows ongoing tensions due to the Ukraine war and could significantly disrupt Russian oil exports to major buyers like India and China.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanctions target around 180 ships, dozens of traders</li>
<li>Gazprom Neft, Surgut, ship insurers added to the list</li>
<li>Biden team had sought to avoid price spike</li>
<li>New Trump administration has said will seek to end Ukraine war</li>
<li>Reuters could not immediately verify the document</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>According to the document, the U.S. Treasury would allow a transition period to March 12, allowing some energy-related transactions to be completed.</blockquote>
<p>This action represents a significant escalation in U.S. efforts to minimize Russia's capacity to fund its military actions through oil exports.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>One of the strongest labor markets in US history just ended 2024 with a bang</h1>

<figcaption>Image showing the robust US job market statistics.</figcaption>
<p>The US economy finished strong in December 2024, adding 256,000 jobs and decreasing the unemployment rate to 4.1%. This marks a significant turn towards pre-pandemic norms and a noteworthy year for the labor market.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December.</li>
  <li>The unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%.</li>
  <li>In total, approximately 2.2 million jobs were added in 2024, averaging 186,000 jobs per month.</li>
  <li>The US labor market has seen job growth for 48 consecutive months.</li>
  <li>Stock futures dropped sharply despite the positive job report.</li>
  <li>The labor market's stability is continuously challenged by external economic pressures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The solid labor market has helped fuel consumer spending, which in turn has kept the overall economy strong as inflation has eased.”</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the labor market's resilience after the pandemic lays a complex foundation as the economy approaches 2025, raising questions about future job growth and the potential impacts of changing policies.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Deepak Shenoy Joins 90-Hour Work Week Debate, Emphasizes Work Quality Over Hours</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 10, 2025<strong> | Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>The ongoing debate concerning 70-90 hour work weeks was reignited by comments from industry leaders, with Deepak Shenoy sharing his perspective on productivity versus work hours.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deepak Shenoy argues that real work is accomplished in just 4-5 hours daily despite often working over 100 hours weekly.</li>
  <li>He suggests that motivated individuals perform best without enforced working hours.</li>
  <li>Shenoy challenges the concept of meetings as productive work, noting they drain energy.</li>
  <li>RPG Group Chairman Harsh Goenka voiced similar concerns, highlighting the dangers of extreme work schedules.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I've probably worked 100 hours a week for nearly all my working life, but most of that was as an entrepreneur. You don't have to enforce working hours. People who are motivated will work happily. In any case, most real work happens in 4-5 hours a day, but you don't know when that happens." — Deepak Shenoy</blockquote>
<p>Shenoy emphasizes finding a personal rhythm in work and play, arguing that success comes from engagement rather than rigid hours.</p>]]></description>

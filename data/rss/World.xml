<p>Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz has stated that the nation is closer than ever to a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza since the November 2023 truce.</p>

<li>Katz reported that Israeli negotiators are engaged in talks with Qatari officials regarding the hostage situation.</li>
<li>A Hamas official indicated that negotiations include a potential ceasefire.</li>

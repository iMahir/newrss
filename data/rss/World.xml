<p>Shigemi Fukahori, a 93-year-old survivor of the 1945 Nagasaki atomic bombing, known for his lifelong advocacy for peace and nuclear disarmament, has passed away in Nagasaki.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fukahori died on January 3, 2025, in a hospital in Nagasaki, reportedly from old age.</li>
<li>He was just 14 years old when the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, which killed tens of thousands.</li>
<li>Fukahori became more vocal about his experiences 15 years ago, inspired by a discussion with a survivor of the bombing of Guernica.</li>
<li>He often spoke to students, encouraging them to carry on his advocacy for peace.</li>
<li>During a visit from Pope Francis in 2019, Fukahori presented a wreath, symbolizing his lifelong commitment to peace.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“On the day the bomb dropped, I heard a voice asking for help. When I walked over and held out my hand, the person’s skin melted. I still remember how that felt.” - Shigemi Fukahori</blockquote>
<p>Fukahori's passing marks the loss of a significant voice in the movement advocating for nuclear disarmament and peace.</p>]]></description>

<p>The New Zealand government has relaxed various visa rules for immigrants seeking job opportunities in the country, particularly impacting Indian migrants.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The work experience requirement has been reduced from three years to two years, making it easier for migrants to seek employment.</li>
  <li>New visa pathways include a three-year multi-entry visa for experienced seasonal workers and a seven-month single-entry visa for lower-skilled workers.</li>
  <li>The median pay criteria for the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) and Specific Purpose Work Visa (SPWV) have been slashed, allowing for greater flexibility.</li>
  <li>A minimum annual earnings threshold of NZ$55,844 is required for AEWV holders wishing to bring children to New Zealand.</li>
  <li>Visas for skill levels 4 or 5 jobs have been extended from two to three years, with options for extensions for current employees.</li>
  <li>Changes have also been made to the Post Study Work Visa, allowing students to work in New Zealand for up to three years post-graduation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The new rules will significantly benefit Indian migrants looking for job opportunities in New Zealand.”</blockquote>
<p>This easing of visa rules indicates a positive shift for migrants while addressing labor shortages in New Zealand.</p>]]></description>

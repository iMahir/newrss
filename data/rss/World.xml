            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Israel Warns Houthi Group, Admits to Hamas Leader's Killing</h1>
<p><strong>Date: Dec 24, 2024</strong></p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz admitted on Monday that Israel killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July. In a warning to the Houthi group, Katz stated that Israel had 'defeated' other adversaries and would 'behead their leaders' just as they did with Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Katz's statement comes amid ongoing conflicts in the region, with Israel pounding Gaza and targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen have been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea, claiming to express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Mossad agents claim Hezbollah had ‘exploding pagers’ for decades</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> December 24th, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Dawn</p>
<p>Two former Israeli intelligence agents disclosed that Hezbollah unknowingly utilized Israeli-made walkie-talkies and pagers rigged with explosives, resulting in a catastrophic surprise attack in September 2024. The agents detailed how Mossad deceived Hezbollah into purchasing over 16,000 devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>On September 17, 2024, thousands of pagers exploded simultaneously across Lebanon, causing widespread panic and casualties.</li>
<li>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later acknowledged Israel's involvement in the attacks.</li>
<li>Mossad concealed explosives within the devices, ensuring they inflicted minimal collateral damage.</li>
<li>The operation aimed to create fake companies to sell the modified devices without linking them back to Israel.</li>
<li>Hezbollah purchased 5,000 booby-trapped pagers, which were detonated remotely when requisite.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We have an incredible array of possibilities of creating foreign companies that have no way being traced back to Israel,” said one agent.</blockquote>
<p>This revelation underscores the lengths to which intelligence agencies might go in modern warfare, blending technology and deception.</p>]]></description>

<p>A section of the Santa Cruz wharf in California collapsed during a major storm, leading to the rescue of two individuals while a third managed to swim to safety. The storm is expected to bring hurricane-force winds and hazardous surf conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The collapse occurred at approximately 12:45 PM local time, with about 150 feet of the wharf falling into the ocean.</li>
<li>Two people were rescued by lifeguards with no serious injuries reported.</li>
<li>The section of the wharf had been closed for repairs from previous storm damage and included facilities like restrooms and a restaurant.</li>
<li>Residents were warned to avoid low-lying beach areas and evacuations were ordered for nearby ocean-facing hotels.</li>
<li>This incident comes a year after another local pier was destroyed by similar winter storms.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The area will remain closed indefinitely due to hazards posed by debris,” said Santa Cruz officials.</blockquote>
<p>The storm is predicted to continue affecting California's central coast with ocean swells and hazardous conditions along the West Coast.</p>]]></description>

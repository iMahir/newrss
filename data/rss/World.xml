<figcaption>Musk made this statement amid Krishnan's induction as Senior White House Policy Advisor on Artificial Intelligence.</figcaption>
<p>Elon Musk criticized the controversy around Sriram Krishnan's immigration views, describing opposing opinions as a “fixed pie” fallacy during his induction as a senior White House Policy Advisor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Musk took to X to share his thoughts on the debates surrounding green card caps.</li>
<li>Krisnan's stance aims to remove country caps for green cards, which he believes would enhance skilled immigration.</li>
<li>David Sacks clarified that Krishnan supports skills-based criteria for green cards, not an unlimited immigration program.</li>
<li>Several tech leaders, including Joe Lonsdale, defended Krishnan's appointment and views.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation.” - Elon Musk</blockquote>
<p>This discourse highlights important themes around immigration reform, economic policy, and national leadership in AI, particularly in the context of Trump's administration.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Mob Justice Sur replaces Extrajudicial Killings in Yunus-led Interim Govt in Bangladesh, Stability Hangs in Balance</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 24, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>
<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/4mbqar/article68507334.ece/alternates/SQUARE_80/APTOPIX_Bangladesh_Protest_Photo_Gallery_59140.jpg" alt="Mob Justice Incident" width="100%" height="100%">
<figcaption>Mob justice incident involving Abdul Hai Kanu.</figcaption>
<p>In recent months, Bangladesh has experienced a surge in mob justice with incidents escalating after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government. The interim government, led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, has been unable to restore law and order amidst increasing violence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abdul Hai Kanu, a 78-year-old freedom fighter, was publicly humiliated and assaulted by a mob on December 22, highlighting the rise in mob justice.</li>
  <li>Over 82 people were killed due to mob incidents in just four months under the interim government.</li>
  <li>Despite police presence, fear among officers leads to reluctance in intervention during violent incidents.</li>
  <li>The country has seen a sharp rise in robbery and muggings, with at least 10 killed in Dhaka alone during this period.</li>
  <li>Human rights groups have reported a significant increase in fabricated legal cases during this time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are deeply concerned about mob justice. Police are not intervening, leading people to believe they can act without police interference.” - Advocate Saidur Rahman</blockquote>
<p>While mob violence has surged, there has been a noted decline in extrajudicial killings, previously rampant under the ousted regime. However, as political instability continues, the question of law and order remains critical in Bangladesh.</p>]]></description>

<p>A US court sentenced a gay couple to 100 years in prison without parole for raping two special needs sons they adopted, sexually abusing them, recording pedophilic pornography, and offering the kids to their friends.</p>
<ol>
<li>The couple forced their adopted sons, now 12 and 10 years old, to have sex with them.</li>
<li>They recorded the abuse and shared it with their friends.</li>
<li>The abuse came to light after police discovered sexual abuse material uploaded to a Google account.</li>
<li>The couple pleaded guilty to charges including aggravated sodomy, sexual exploitation of children, and child molestation.</li>
</ol><blockquote>"These two Defendants truly created a house of horrors and put their extremely dark desires above everything and everyone else." - Randy McGinley, District Attorney</blockquote>
<p>The couple was arrested in 2022, and their victims have shown remarkable resilience throughout the case.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Israel Warns Houthi Group, Admits to Hamas Leader's Killing</h1>
<p><strong>Date: Dec 24, 2024</strong></p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz admitted on Monday that Israel killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July. In a warning to the Houthi group, Katz stated that Israel had 'defeated' other adversaries and would 'behead their leaders' just as they did with Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Katz's statement comes amid ongoing conflicts in the region, with Israel pounding Gaza and targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen have been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea, claiming to express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<figcaption>Franco Pereyra is the co-founder of staffing agency Near</figcaption>
<p>Franco Pereyra, the COO of staffing agency Near, has ignited controversy with his remarks on paying overseas workers less than Americans, citing lower living costs as justification.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pereyra's comments on LinkedIn suggest it's acceptable for global talent to earn less due to lower living costs and limited opportunities abroad.</li>
<li>He acknowledged that while some exploitation occurs, it is not inherently wrong to pay overseas workers less.</li>
<li>His statements have been widely shared on social media, leading to a heated debate about labor practices and pay equity.</li>
<li>Workers from countries like India and the Philippines are highlighted as particularly vulnerable to being treated as disposable labor.</li>
<li>Pereyra warns that both workers and companies suffer from high turnover rates resulting from exploitative labor practices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A lot of people get upset and say workers in Latin America, India, and the Philippines are being exploited... But paying less for overseas work is not inherently wrong.” - Franco Pereyra</blockquote>
<p>The debate generated by Pereyra’s comments reflects broader issues in the global workforce regarding fair compensation and working conditions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Mossad agents claim Hezbollah had ‘exploding pagers’ for decades</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> December 24th, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Dawn</p>
<p>Two former Israeli intelligence agents disclosed that Hezbollah unknowingly utilized Israeli-made walkie-talkies and pagers rigged with explosives, resulting in a catastrophic surprise attack in September 2024. The agents detailed how Mossad deceived Hezbollah into purchasing over 16,000 devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>On September 17, 2024, thousands of pagers exploded simultaneously across Lebanon, causing widespread panic and casualties.</li>
<li>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later acknowledged Israel's involvement in the attacks.</li>
<li>Mossad concealed explosives within the devices, ensuring they inflicted minimal collateral damage.</li>
<li>The operation aimed to create fake companies to sell the modified devices without linking them back to Israel.</li>
<li>Hezbollah purchased 5,000 booby-trapped pagers, which were detonated remotely when requisite.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We have an incredible array of possibilities of creating foreign companies that have no way being traced back to Israel,” said one agent.</blockquote>
<p>This revelation underscores the lengths to which intelligence agencies might go in modern warfare, blending technology and deception.</p>]]></description>

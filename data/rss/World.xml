<p>Pakistan launched airstrikes in Afghanistan's Paktika province, reportedly targeting Taliban hideouts, which resulted in the death of at least 15 people, including women and children. The airstrikes have drawn international condemnation from the Afghan government.</p>
<ul>
<li>The strikes were carried out in a mountainous area along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</li>
<li>The Afghan Defense Ministry condemned the attacks, claiming they were a violation of international law.</li>
<li>This was the second strike on suspected TTP hideouts since March.</li>
<li>Local sources indicate the death toll may rise due to the nature of the attack.</li>
<li>The attacks occurred shortly after a diplomatic visit by Pakistan’s representative to Kabul.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemns this brutal act against all international principles,” - Afghan Defense Ministry</blockquote>
<p>The airstrike situation exacerbates the rising tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan amid growing cross-border militant threats.</p>]]></description>

<p>Islamabad: There is a raising discussion in Pakistan around the Shehbaz Sharif government attempting to acquire second-strike nuclear capability from China amidst US sanctions on Pakistan’s missile program.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pakistan is reportedly negotiating with China for nuclear second-strike capabilities in exchange for allowing China to build a naval base in Gwadar.</li>
  <li>Political commentator Kamar Cheema highlighted concerns that acquiring such capabilities could hinder Pakistan's relationship with the US.</li>
  <li>Cheema mentioned that while Pakistan claimed to have this capability in 2018, the current demand raises questions about its credibility.</li>
  <li>There are suggestions that China might discourage Pakistan from pursuing this nuclear capability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Pakistan seeks this capability in response to the threat from India. It would undoubtedly be a significant power for Pakistan.” - Kamar Cheema</blockquote>
<p>The geopolitical landscape remains tense as the implications of Pakistan's actions could have significant consequences on international relations, particularly with the US.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption></figcaption>
<p><strong>Moscow</strong>: Vladimir Putin has criticized Muhammad Yunus regarding corruption accusations tied to the Rooppur nuclear power project in Bangladesh.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, claims the USD 2.65 billion Rooppur project is transparent and prepared to defend its reputation in court.</li>
  <li>The Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission accused the Yunus-led interim government of attempting to tarnish the project's image.</li>
  <li>Accusations include irregularities amounting to nearly USD 5 billion in the Rooppur nuclear power project, which has been in development since 2011.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Rosatom is committed to a policy of openness in all its projects and the principle of tackling corruption...” - Rosatom Statement</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the allegations against the former government could significantly impact the Rooppur nuclear power project's future and the diplomatic relations between Russia and Bangladesh.</p>]]></description>

<p>Iran has condemned Israel's admission regarding the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, labeling it a 'heinous crime,' and maintains its stance on the legitimacy of its missile strike retaliation.</p>
<ul>

  <li>Haniyeh was perceived as pivotal in negotiating ceasefires for Gaza.</li>
  <li>Israel's defense minister confirmed responsibility for the killing.</li>
  <li>Iran had previously launched missile strikes against Israel in response to Haniyeh's assassination.</li>

<figcaption>Image related to the content</figcaption>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to “vigorously pursue” capital punishment following President Joe Biden’s decision to commute the sentences of most federal death row inmates. Trump criticized Biden's actions as senseless and a disservice to victims' families.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump's statement comes after Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates.</li>
  <li>Biden argued that the commutations align with a moratorium on federal executions, except in specific cases.</li>
  <li>Trump plans to direct the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty for violent offenders after taking office.</li>
  <li>Polling shows mixed support for the death penalty in America, with a noted decline in support over the years.</li>
  <li>Legal experts express skepticism about the feasibility of Trump's intentions under current law.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Joe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,” Trump stated on social media.</blockquote>
<p>In response to Biden's actions, Trump seeks to reinstate and expand the use of the death penalty, potentially affecting cases involving serious crimes such as drug trafficking and murders. The future of capital punishment in federal cases remains uncertain amidst varying public opinions and legal challenges.</p>]]></description>

<p>The bald eagle, recognized for its significance to the United States for over 240 years, has officially become the national bird after President Joe Biden signed a new legislation into law.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The bald eagle is a symbol of power and strength for the U.S.</li>
  <li>Recognized on the Great Seal since 1782 and declared the national emblem by Congress in the same year.</li>
  <li>This designation corrects a long-overlooked status and officially names it the national bird.</li>
  <li>The bald eagle is native to North America.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“But it had never been officially designated to be what many had just assumed it was — the national bird.”</blockquote>
<p>The official designation of the bald eagle as the national bird is a significant recognition of its place in American history and culture.</p>]]></description>

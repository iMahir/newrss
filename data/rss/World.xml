  <li>Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville reported that casualties could number in the thousands.</li>
  <li>French President Emmanuel Macron expressed condolences for the victims in Mayotte, calling it a horrific tragedy.</li>

<blockquote>"Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear." - Mohamed Ishmael, resident of Mamoudzou.</blockquote>

<figcaption>Joe Rogan worried about drone sightings after chilling new theory floats (AP Photo/Gregory Payan, File)(AP)</figcaption>
<p>Joe Rogan has expressed genuine concern over unverified drone sightings in New Jersey after watching a viral TikTok video suggesting they may be searching for harmful substances.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rogan's comments came after observing a theory by John Ferguson, a CEO of a drone company, who speculated that drones might be detecting gas leaks or radioactive materials.</li>
<li>Despite reassurances from government officials that the drones are not a public safety threat, Rogan remains skeptical of these claims.</li>
<li>Various theories about the purpose of the drone sightings have emerged, including suggestions of foreign involvement.</li>
<li>Former President Donald Trump has also weighed in, urging authorities to disclose more information about the sightings and suggesting a more aggressive approach.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first video about these drones that has got me genuinely concerned.” – Joe Rogan</blockquote>
<p>Rogan’s reaction highlights the public's interest and concern regarding the safety implications of unidentified drone activity.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Pakistan's Progress in Countering Terror Financing: A US Assessment</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> December 16th, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> Dawn</p>
<p>The US State Department's report recognizes Pakistan's substantial progress in combating terrorist financing while addressing regional extremist networks, amid a concerning rise in terrorist attacks.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The report commends Pakistan for completing its updated National Risk Assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing in 2023.</li>
    <li>Yet, 41 terrorist groups remain active in Pakistan, with cash couriers and illegal money transfers identified as key funding methods.</li>
    <li>The FATF removed Pakistan from its Grey List in October 2022, marking a significant achievement.</li>
    <li>Terrorist attacks surged over 50% in 2023, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</li>
    <li>Pakistan is taking steps in deradicalization and expanding counter-terrorism forums, despite ongoing issues with certain madressahs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The rise in terrorist activity alongside progress in countering terrorist financing highlights the complex reality Pakistan must navigate.” – Agha Murtaza Haider, security analyst</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Pakistan's efforts in countering terrorist financing are recognized, the sharp increase in terrorist activities poses significant challenges for the country.</p>

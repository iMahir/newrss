<p>A state appeals court has removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others, leaving the future of the prosecution uncertain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The case had been stalled for months while appeals were considered.</li>
<li>The ruling requires the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia to appoint a new prosecutor.</li>
<li>Trump's legal situation appears to be improving amidst ongoing legal challenges.</li>
<li>14 other defendants still face charges related to the case.</li>
<li>Concerns raised over potential conflicts of interest with Willis's romantic relationship with a special prosecutor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The prosecution was encumbered by an appearance of impropriety.” – Judge Scott McAfee</blockquote>
<p>This ruling highlights the ongoing complexities and controversies surrounding the legal proceedings against Trump and his co-defendants as they navigate serious allegations of attempting to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.</p>]]></description>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed readiness to negotiate with Ukraine, including with President Zelenskyy, while emphasizing no preconditions for talks need to be set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Putin asserted that any agreement must involve legitimate Ukrainian authorities.</li>
<li>He reiterated that Russia has become stronger since its invasion of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Putin rejected claims of Russia being in a weak position and asserted the need for Kyiv to make compromises as well.</li>
<li>He mentioned a preference for lasting peace over a temporary truce and pointed to a previous proposal made in Istanbul.</li>
<li>Putin stated he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and expressed confidence in Russia's sovereignty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We have moved back from the edge of the abyss," said Putin, asserting Russia's independent decision-making capabilities.</blockquote>
<p>Despite calls for negotiation, the ongoing conflict continues to severely impact relations between Russia and the West, with extensive casualties and displacement in Ukraine.</p>]]></description>

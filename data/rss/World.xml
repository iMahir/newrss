<p>India's ranking has dropped by five points to 85 this year in a global passport index, topped by Singapore for the second consecutive year.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Henley Passport Index released by Henley & Partners shows India at 85th place.</li>
<li>In 2024, India was ranked 80th globally.</li>
<li>Pakistan and Bangladesh rank 103rd and 100th respectively in 2025.</li>
<li>The U.S. fell from 7th to 9th place, while China's ranking improved to 60th.</li>
<li>Japan ranks 2nd this year, having shared the top rank with Singapore in 2024.</li>
<li>Over the past decade, only 22 of the world's 199 passports have fallen in ranking.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Faced with unprecedented volatility, investors and wealthy families are adopting a strategy of geopolitical arbitrage to acquire additional residence and/or citizenship options..." - Juerg Steffen, CEO of Henley & Partners</blockquote>
<p>This decline in India's passport ranking reflects ongoing challenges in global mobility and may impact the perception of Indian citizenship.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Taiwan Strengthens Defense with Patriot Missile System Amid Chinese Threats</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date: January 7, 2023 | Source: EurAsian Times</strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patriot-1.jpg" alt="Patriot Missile Defense System" width="1250" height="702"><figcaption>File Image: PAC-3 Patriot Missile Defense System</figcaption></figure>
<p>Taiwan conducted a joint military drill from January 7 to 9, demonstrating its military capabilities and readiness as tensions with China escalate. The exercises included the use of Patriot missile defense systems to counter perceived threats from Chinese forces.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The drills simulated a special forces attack on critical infrastructure in Hsinchu.</li>
  <li>Defensive maneuvers included countering drone infiltrations with detailed combat strategies.</li>
  <li>The Patriot missile system was showcased at an air base, demonstrating Taiwan's defense capabilities.</li>
  <li>Military activities included anti-submarine drills and rearming procedures for fighter jets.</li>
  <li>There are concerns about the effectiveness of the Patriot system against China’s J-20 fighters.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The J-20 is a low-observable aircraft, it is supposed to be invisible to radars. However, the very idea of anything being ‘completely invisible’ is ridiculous.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Taiwan’s military drills signal heightened readiness to defend against possible Chinese aggression while showcasing advanced defense systems critical for its national security.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Trump’s Aides Explore Tariff Plans - WAPO</figcaption>
<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is reportedly reworking his campaign pledge of universal tariffs, focusing specifically on industries deemed vital to national security.</p>
<ul>
<li>The team is narrowing the tariff focus to key sectors rather than applying it universally to all imports.</li>
<li>Targeted sectors could include defense and other critical industries necessary for national security.</li>
<li>Concerns arise regarding the disruptive effects of a universal tariff on consumer goods prices and supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The sector-based universal tariff is a little bit easier for everybody to stomach out the gate.”</blockquote>
<p>This proposed approach may mitigate the immediate disruptive impact of tariffs similar to those seen in current debates around international trade.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Justin Trudeau Set to Step Down as Liberal Party Leader Amid Political Turmoil</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 6, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> The Indian Express</p>
<p>Amidst widespread unpopularity, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will likely step down as head of the Liberal Party. This move comes ahead of an impending parliamentary election and follows the withdrawal of support from the New Democratic Party (NDP).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation as party leader is expected but may not lead to his resignation as Prime Minister.</li>
  <li>The Liberal Party is facing pressure following historically low approval ratings.</li>
  <li>The NDP withdrew support, criticizing Trudeau for inadequate opposition to the Conservative Party.</li>
  <li>Trudeau's administration has been marked by rising political divisiveness and a housing crisis.</li>
  <li>If a no-confidence vote occurs, the Liberals may lose their governing power without NDP support.</li>
  <li>Options for Trudeau include electing an interim leader or proroguing parliament.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Prime Minister no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister,” refers to the resignation of Trudeau's deputy, Chrystia Freeland.</blockquote>
<p>The political landscape in Canada is shifting dramatically, with early elections appearing likely in the near future.</p>]]></description>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to resign as the leader of the Liberal Party as early as Monday, following increasing pressure after the resignation of his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation is anticipated amid falling poll numbers for the Liberal Party.</li>
  <li>The upcoming caucus meeting aims to address calls for his resignation.</li>
  <li>Freeland's resignation on December 16 has amplified scrutiny on Trudeau.</li>
  <li>Concerns are growing over economic instability and potential threats from the US administration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The country could face instability, notably from an economic threat in the potential of a 25% US tariff on Canadian imports from the incoming administration.” - Kody Blois, Liberal Party Leader</blockquote>
<p>This impending leadership change could significantly affect Canadian politics, including potential ramifications for Trudeau's role as prime minister.</p>]]></description>

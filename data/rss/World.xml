<figcaption>Of the 386,000 H-1B visas granted in 2023, 72.3% were awarded to Indians. (Representative/News18 Hindi)</figcaption>
<p>The US administration has announced significant changes to the H-1B visa programme, effective from January 17, aimed at ensuring fairness, transparency, and efficiency in recruiting foreign talent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indians make up the largest group of H-1B visa holders, receiving 72.3% of visas granted in 2023.</li>
<li>Two main objectives for modernizing the programme: clarifying requirements and increasing efficiency.</li>
<li>The definition of specialized work has been revised to require a logical connection between the degree and job responsibilities.</li>
<li>F-1 visa holders’ statuses will now be automatically extended during the H-1B application process.</li>
<li>Non-profit and government research organizations are now exempt from the H-1B cap under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Employers must provide proof of a legitimate specialty job when applying for H-1B visas.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These reforms are designed to streamline the visa approval process and enhance programme flexibility.” - US Citizenship and Immigration Services</blockquote>
<p>With revised rules in place, Indian tech professionals stand to benefit significantly from these changes in the H-1B visa program.</p>

<figcaption>Image credit: X</figcaption>
<p>Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, has been married three times, each relationship controversial in its own right. This article delves into the details of these marriages and the public scrutiny surrounding them.</p>
<ul>
<li>His first marriage was to Jemima Goldsmith, a wealthy British socialite.</li>
<li>Khan's second marriage to Reham Khan lasted only a year and was marred by allegations of infidelity and accusations of having illegitimate children.</li>
<li>His third marriage to Bushra Bibi has also drawn criticism, particularly regarding its legality during her Iddat period.</li>
<li>Reham Khan's book raised significant allegations about Khan's personal life and purported responsibilities as a father.</li>
<li>Imran Khan's marriages have significantly influenced his political career, often overshadowing his public image.</li>
<li>Despite controversies, Imran Khan maintains a notable presence in Pakistani politics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"These allegations have tarnished Imran's public image, and he is often seen as a figure consumed by ego and seeking validation."</blockquote>
<p>The narrative of Imran Khan's marriages is pivotal in understanding his journey as a public figure in Pakistan, influencing both his political trajectory and public perception.</p>]]></description>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced a deal to release hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, coinciding with a ceasefire agreement that halts 15 months of conflict.</p>
<ul>
<li>Netanyahu confirmed that the ceasefire would start on Sunday, as 33 Israeli hostages would be released in the first phase.</li>
<li>A coalition of the US, Egypt, and Qatar facilitated the agreement, following prolonged negotiations.</li>
<li>Statistics from the ongoing conflict indicate significant civilian casualties, with 46,707 reported deaths in Gaza.</li>
<li>Hamas seized 251 hostages during an attack on October 7, 2023, shortly before the ceasefire announcement.</li>
<li>Netanyahu's coalition faces internal challenges with opposition from far-right factions regarding the hostage deal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We didn’t believe that 15 months would pass and the world doesn’t help him,” said a family member of a hostage.</blockquote>
<p>This ceasefire marks a crucial development in the long-standing conflict, with implications for humanitarian efforts and future negotiations.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>China's Bid to Challenge Boeing and Airbus in the Aircraft Market</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Financial Times</p>
<p>The article discusses China's initiative to reduce the dominance of Boeing and Airbus in the aircraft market, focusing on the efforts of state-run manufacturer Comac and its C919 aircraft.</p>
<img src='path_to_image.jpg' alt='C919 Aircraft' />
<figcaption>C919 Aircraft</figcaption>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The C919 made its first commercial flight in 2023 and is now flying domestic routes.</li>
  <li>Comac aims to expand C919 operations to Southeast Asia by 2026 and seeks European certification.</li>
  <li>The global aviation market requires 42,430 new aircraft in the next two decades.</li>
  <li>Comac faces challenges with certification and maintenance support for international markets.</li>
  <li>Comac is also developing a widebody aircraft, the C929, expected to enter service after 2040.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Maintenance support is the main issue,” said a person close to Indonesia’s TransNusa.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Comac is positioned to grow, significant hurdles remain before it can effectively compete with established giants in the global aircraft market.</p>]]></description>

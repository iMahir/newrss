<p>South Korea’s parliament has voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration this month, marking a significant political event in the country.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The National Assembly passed the impeachment motion with a vote of 204-85.</li>
    <li>Yoon’s presidential powers will be suspended pending the Constitutional Court's decision on his impeachment.</li>
    <li>The court has up to 180 days to decide Yoon's fate; if removed, a national election must be held within 60 days.</li>
    <li>Yoon stated he will “never give up” and called for stability during this “temporary” pause of his presidency.</li>
    <li>The martial law decree drew comparisons to South Korea's authoritarian past from the 1980s.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I will fight to the end in the face of opposition-led efforts to remove me from office.” - President Yoon Suk Yeol</blockquote>

<p>A 26-year-old Indian-origin former employee of OpenAI, Suchir Balaji, has tragically died by suicide in San Francisco, raising concerns about the impact of whistleblowing in the tech industry.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Suchir Balaji was found dead in his apartment on Buchanan Street on November 26.</li>
    <li>He publicly accused OpenAI of violating US copyright law three months prior to his death.</li>
    <li>OpenAI is facing multiple lawsuits claiming it illegally used copyrighted material to train its AI products.</li>
    <li>Balaji expressed concerns over the ethical implications of technologies developed by OpenAI.</li>
    <li>His family has requested privacy while they grieve his loss.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company. This is not a sustainable model for the internet ecosystem as a whole.” – Suchir Balaji</blockquote>
<p>This tragic incident shines a light on the pressures faced by whistleblowers in the tech sector, as well as the ongoing legal challenges surrounding artificial intelligence and copyright issues. Those in distress are encouraged to seek support and counseling.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses China’s strategic countermeasures against Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, highlighting potential economic impacts and policy shifts in response to U.S. trade threats.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trump plans a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% on Chinese imports.</li>
    <li>China has already banned crucial metal exports to the U.S., potentially costing the U.S. over $3 billion.</li>
    <li>China may devalue the Yuan to make exports cheaper, a measure anticipated to occur in 2025.</li>
    <li>The PBOC is considering a weaker Yuan, with projections reaching 7.5 per dollar.</li>
    <li>The Yuan has depreciated 4% against the dollar since late September.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A weaker yuan could benefit China by easing deflationary pressures, boosting export revenues, and making imported goods more expensive.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as Trump moves forward with his tariff policies, China's actions to strengthen its economic position through currency devaluation and export restrictions could reshape the global trade landscape significantly.]]></description>

<p>Nearly 18,000 undocumented Indian nationals are on the deportation list prepared by the US government amidst a significant deportation initiative by the Trump administration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nearly 18,000 Indians are included in a wider ICE deportation list of approximately 1.5 million people.</li>
    <li>The US has around 725,000 illegal immigrants from India, which is the third-largest group of unauthorized immigrants.</li>
    <li>Over the last three years, an average of 90,000 Indians have been apprehended while attempting to cross US borders illegally.</li>
    <li>India is categorized by ICE as "uncooperative" regarding coordination for the return of its nationals.</li>
    <li>ICE considers 15 countries uncooperative, including India, in facilitating deportations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “The average of 90,000 Indians have been apprehended while attempting to cross US borders illegally over the last three financial years.”
</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the struggle of thousands of undocumented Indians in the US who seek to legalize their status while facing significant hurdles. The US government’s actions reflect broader immigration enforcement practices and international relations related to deportation. </p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>Trump stated that there are mysterious drone sightings across the U.S. and demanded that the public be informed.</li>
  <li>The drone sightings have raised concerns among lawmakers, linking the incidents to potential threats from foreign adversaries like Iran.</li>

<p>Satellite images reviewed by Maxar Technologies have confirmed the emergence of Iran's new drone ship, the Shahid Bagheri, currently docked in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Shahid Bagheri is anchored near the naval port of Bandar Abbas.</li>
    <li>Originally a commercial container ship, it has been converted into a drone carrier vessel for Iran's naval forces.</li>
    <li>This development demonstrates Iran's capability to deploy drones, even though the ship is stationed far from U.S. coastlines.</li>
    <li>The ship features a ski-jump ramp and an angled flight deck to assist in launching and recovering drones.</li>
    <li>Two other vessels, Shahid Mahdavi and Shahid Roudaki, have also been similarly modified.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Iranian drone ship in the Persian Gulf demonstrates Tehran’s ability to deploy drones, although the vessel is stationed thousands of miles from the U.S. coast.”</blockquote>
<p>This new drone ship marks a significant development in Iran's naval capabilities and indicates ongoing advancements in military technology.]]></description>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has announced plans to eliminate Daylight Saving Time (DST), deeming it a "very costly" practice for America.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trump stated that DST has a small but strong constituency, which he believes it "shouldn't" have.</li>
    <li>He emphasized that the Republican Party will strive to abolish DST due to its inconvenience and costliness.</li>
    <li>DST affects nearly 400 million people in North America and requires clock changes twice a year.</li>
    <li>The most recent legislative effort to change DST was through the stalled 'Sunshine Protection Act' aiming to make it permanent.</li>
    <li>Health experts have recommended making standard time permanent instead of continuing DST.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the debate over Daylight Saving Time continues as Trump seeks to rally support for its elimination, highlighting both its historical significance and contemporary criticisms.]]></description>

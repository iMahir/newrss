<p><strong>Islamabad:</strong> Pakistan has struck gold, literally, as massive reserves estimated at 32.6 metric tons have been discovered along the Indus River in Punjab’s Attock region.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gold reserves are estimated to be worth Rs 600 billion.</li>
  <li>Gold deposits extend across a 32-kilometer area identified by the Geological Survey of Pakistan.</li>
  <li>The gold is primarily visible during winter months when the river's water levels recede.</li>
  <li>Albert reserves are affected by illegal excavations, prompting government bans on unauthorized extraction.</li>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, the Houthis, a Yemeni armed group, have intensified conflicts against Israel and the U.S., claiming support from China for acquiring advanced weaponry.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Houthis are part of a wider Iran-led resistance in the region, fiercely opposing Israeli and U.S. influence.</li>
  <li>Claims suggest China is supplying the Houthis with advanced weapons through a covert partnership.</li>
  <li>U.S. intelligence indicates a complex weapons supply network connecting the Houthis and Chinese manufacturers.</li>
  <li>Despite numerous airstrikes, the Houthis maintain control over significant regions in Yemen.</li>
  <li>Attacks from the Houthis on Israeli targets have escalated since October 2023, amidst a broader regional conflict.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are committed to continuing our military operation in support of Gaza, and we will not stop until the genocide crimes and the siege on Gaza stop.” - Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, Houthi political official</blockquote>
<p>The situation remains volatile as the future of U.S. and Israeli operations against the Houthis may face persistent challenges, as hinted by ongoing arms supply and military engagements.</p>]]></description>

<p>Germany has launched the Consular Services Portal, a global online platform allowing applicants to submit German visa applications digitally. This marks a significant shift from traditional paperwork to a streamlined digital process.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The system supports 28 categories of national visas, including for employment, education, training, and family reunification.</li>
  <li>Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock emphasized the need for modernization in the visa process to address the skilled worker shortage.</li>
  <li>The digital overhaul aims to improve efficiency and reduce waiting times, benefiting both applicants and businesses in need of skilled labor.</li>

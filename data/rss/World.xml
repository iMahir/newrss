<p><strong>Date: January 13, 2024</strong> | <strong>Source: NHK</strong></p>
<p>A strong earthquake of magnitude 6.9 struck southwestern Japan, prompting short-lived tsunami warnings and evacuation orders in coastal areas. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of significant damage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The earthquake occurred at 9:19 PM at a depth of 30 kilometers.</li>
  <li>A tsunami, reaching up to 1 meter, was monitored but called off shortly after.</li>
  <li>Residents experienced precautionary evacuations, and train services were disrupted.</li>
  <li>One minor injury was reported in Kyushu from a fall.</li>
  <li>Experts advised caution against landslides and remaining away from water bodies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"People should watch for landslides as well as falling objects in homes," said Shigeki Aoki, agency official.</blockquote>
<p>This earthquake is a reminder of Japan's vulnerability due to its location on the tectonically active “Ring of Fire.”</p>]]></description>

<p>As President-elect Trump prepares to take office, he faces a looming crisis with Iran's nuclear program, significantly advanced since his withdrawal from the previous nuclear deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump has a critical decision to make: negotiate with Iran or consider military action.</li>
<li>Iran is described as a de facto 'nuclear threshold state', accelerating its nuclear capabilities.</li>
<li>International diplomats predict a crisis with Iran on the agenda in 2025, necessitating urgent attention.</li>
<li>The 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran may need reevaluation given Iran's nuclear advancements.</li>
<li>Potential strikes against Iran's nuclear sites are being discussed, underscoring the seriousness of the situation.</li>
<li>Iran is willing to resume negotiations for a new nuclear deal, but significant challenges remain.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Anything can happen,” Trump told Time. “It’s a very volatile situation.”</blockquote>
<p>The situation with Iran's nuclear capabilities is precarious, and the need for timely diplomatic resolutions is urgent as Trump assumes office.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Trump’s Aides Explore Tariff Plans - WAPO</figcaption>
<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is reportedly reworking his campaign pledge of universal tariffs, focusing specifically on industries deemed vital to national security.</p>
<ul>
<li>The team is narrowing the tariff focus to key sectors rather than applying it universally to all imports.</li>
<li>Targeted sectors could include defense and other critical industries necessary for national security.</li>
<li>Concerns arise regarding the disruptive effects of a universal tariff on consumer goods prices and supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The sector-based universal tariff is a little bit easier for everybody to stomach out the gate.”</blockquote>
<p>This proposed approach may mitigate the immediate disruptive impact of tariffs similar to those seen in current debates around international trade.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Justin Trudeau Set to Step Down as Liberal Party Leader Amid Political Turmoil</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 6, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> The Indian Express</p>
<p>Amidst widespread unpopularity, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will likely step down as head of the Liberal Party. This move comes ahead of an impending parliamentary election and follows the withdrawal of support from the New Democratic Party (NDP).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation as party leader is expected but may not lead to his resignation as Prime Minister.</li>
  <li>The Liberal Party is facing pressure following historically low approval ratings.</li>
  <li>The NDP withdrew support, criticizing Trudeau for inadequate opposition to the Conservative Party.</li>
  <li>Trudeau's administration has been marked by rising political divisiveness and a housing crisis.</li>
  <li>If a no-confidence vote occurs, the Liberals may lose their governing power without NDP support.</li>
  <li>Options for Trudeau include electing an interim leader or proroguing parliament.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Prime Minister no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister,” refers to the resignation of Trudeau's deputy, Chrystia Freeland.</blockquote>
<p>The political landscape in Canada is shifting dramatically, with early elections appearing likely in the near future.</p>]]></description>

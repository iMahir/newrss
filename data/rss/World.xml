<figcaption>Rajeev Chandrasekhar reacted to US wildfires that ravaged Pacific Palisades.</figcaption>
<p>A devastating wildfire has struck the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, causing significant loss of life and property, while prompting critiques regarding California's substantial economy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wildfire has resulted in estimated losses between $52 billion and $57 billion.</li>
  <li>At least five lives have been lost and over 1,000 structures have been destroyed.</li>
  <li>Rajeev Chandrasekhar commented on the situation referencing California's economy as a $4.8 trillion powerhouse.</li>
  <li>The fires are fueled by hurricane-force winds, complicating firefighting efforts.</li>
  <li>Historical context shows that if damages continue to escalate, this could rival the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is California - a USD 4.8 trillion economic powerhouse state, in the world’s biggest economy USA." - Rajeev Chandrasekhar</blockquote>
<p>The wildfires have not only caused immediate destruction but could have lasting consequences on the health and economy of the region, raising concerns about air quality and the tourism industry.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits increase annually based on inflation rates. This year, seniors can expect a rise in their CPP payments due to high inflation rates that have impact on living costs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The CPP payments are set to increase due to inflation adjustments in January 2025.</li>
  <li>Estimates suggest a 3% rise in monthly payments.</li>
  <li>All recipients over 60, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased contributors will benefit from this increase.</li>
  <li>The CPP contribution rate has seen increases aimed at enhancing benefits over time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The aim of the CPP enhancement program is to increase benefits from 25% to 33% of working-age earnings.”</blockquote>
<p>This increment will ensure that CPP payments keep pace with the cost of living, providing support for elderly Canadians as inflation continues to be a concern.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Switzerland's Lower House of Parliament in 2023 cemented the burqa ban into federal law and set a fine of up to 1,000 francs for violators. (File Photo: AP)</figcaption>
<p>From January 1, 2025, Switzerland officially bans burqas, hijabs, and any other face coverings in public spaces, as mandated by a law solidified in 2023 after a 2021 referendum where 51.2% of voters supported the ban.</p>
<ul>
<li>The law includes fines of up to 1,000 francs for violators.</li>
<li>Exceptions are made for health-related facial coverings and coverings in places of worship.</li>
<li>The proposal was driven by the right-wing Swiss People's Party, citing concerns over extremism.</li>
<li>The Muslim population in Switzerland is predominantly from Turkey, Bosnia, and Kosovo, making up about 5% of the total population.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today’s decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority.” - Central Council of Muslims</blockquote>
<p>This law raises significant discussions on women's rights, identity, and the ongoing debate surrounding secularism and multiculturalism in Switzerland.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Trump's Push To Shut Down the Axis of Upheaval Starts With LNG</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> OilPrice.com</p>
<p>As Donald Trump’s new advisory team prepares for his second term, there is a strong belief that the 'Axis of Upheaval' is declining. This axis, comprising China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, aimed to diminish U.S. influence globally. However, recent analysis indicates that these nations are currently facing significant challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump's focus will be to reassert U.S. and allied influence in global affairs.</li>
<li>The immediate priority includes concluding the war in Ukraine.</li>
<li>Continued sanctions on Russia's LNG exports are expected to limit its financial capabilities.</li>
<li>Cooperation with European allies to cut off Russian energy resources is a key strategy.</li>
<li>Similar sanctions may be imposed on Iraq for aiding Iran's oil exports.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“China’s finances are failing, Russia’s military has failed, Iran’s proxies have been incapacitated, North Korea is on the sidelines, and now Trump is back.”</blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration’s policies suggest a bold approach to international relations, emphasizing accountability and pressure on adversarial nations.</p>]]></description>

<p>Gallant was a key figure in Israel's war on Gaza before he was removed from his post by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yoav Gallant announced his resignation from the Knesset after being removed as Defence Minister.</li>
  <li>His resignation comes in response to a new law regarding ultra-Orthodox men and military service.</li>
  <li>Opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the government's actions related to military draft exemptions.</li>
  <li>Benny Gantz urged Gallant to remain in politics and stand against the government's plans.</li>
  <li>Gallant was previously fired by Netanyahu for a lack of mutual trust during ongoing military operations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Gallant told the simple truth today: He was fired to pass a disgraceful evasion... a betrayal of our fighters, our dead, and our wounded.” — Yair Lapid</blockquote>
<p>Gallant's resignation highlights the ongoing political tensions in Israel regarding military service laws and the handling of the conflict with Gaza.</p>]]></description>

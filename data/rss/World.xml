<figcaption>Ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas</figcaption>
<p>The recent ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has fueled a flurry of political posturing from both former President Trump and current President Biden, who are eager to take credit for the deal. However, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has postponed formal approval, creating uncertainty about the deal's future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump and Biden both claim influence in facilitating the ceasefire.</li>
<li>Netanyahu has delayed the deal's approval, citing security concerns.</li>
<li>The situation highlights tensions between immediate political gains and long-term peace efforts.</li>
<li>Reactions vary considerably among officials in the U.S. and Israel.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"In times of crisis, the people of Israel deserve a stable and secure environment, which requires thorough deliberation of any agreement." - Israeli Official</blockquote>
<p>This situation underscores the complexity of international diplomacy, particularly in conflict zones like the Middle East, where multiple stakeholders vie for influence and recognition.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Israel-Hamas ceasefire live updates: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the final details are being worked out.</figcaption>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Hamas of backtracking on details of a Gaza ceasefire deal, impacting its approval by the Israeli government. The ceasefire deal, mediated by the US, Egypt, and Qatar, aims to pause the ongoing war and facilitate the release of hostages.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ceasefire in Gaza is set to begin on Sunday, involving the release of 33 Israeli hostages in the first phase.</li>
<li>Netanyahu claims Hamas is attempting to alter agreed security arrangements.</li>
<li>A total of 46,707 people, mostly civilians, have died in Gaza due to Israeli actions since the conflict began.</li>
<li>81 deaths were reported in Gaza in the last 24 hours amid ongoing violence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is no basis to (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu's claims about the movement backtracking from terms in the ceasefire agreement.” - Sami Abu Zuhri, Senior Hamas leader</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing violence and the complexity of the ceasefire negotiations reflect deep-rooted tensions in the region, with urgent calls for humanitarian assistance emerging as critical to the survival of Gazan civilians.</p>]]></description>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a significant warning regarding the ceasefire with Hamas, stating Israel reserves the right to resume military actions in Gaza if deemed necessary, with the backing of the United States.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Netanyahu pledged to secure the return of hostages held by Hamas, asserting, “We reserve the right to resume the war if necessary, with American support.”</li>
  <li>The ceasefire is set to take effect after 15 months of conflict and is seen as a critical step towards ending hostilities.</li>
  <li>Netanyahu emphasized that the initial phase of the ceasefire is temporary and contingent upon various factors, including potential compliance from Hamas.</li>
  <li>Concerns regarding the complexities of implementation were raised, especially given the presence of hardline elements within the Israeli government.</li>
  <li>The ceasefire agreement anticipates the release of female hostages and subsequent exchanges involving Palestinian prisoners.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If we are forced to resume the war, we will do so with force,” said Netanyahu.</blockquote>
<p>This ceasefire, mediated by Qatar and the US, aims to create a fragile peace by facilitating humanitarian aid access and addressing the dire conditions in Gaza, where a majority of the population has been displaced.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>"Hamas Solely Responsible": On Gaza Ceasefire Eve, Netanyahu Hints At Delay</h1>
<p><strong>Date: </strong> New Delhi</p>
<p><strong>Source: </strong> AFP</p>
<p>Hours before the start of a ceasefire in the Gaza war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that Israel cannot proceed with the ceasefire framework until the list of hostages to be released by Hamas is received. He stated that Hamas is solely responsible for any violations of the agreement.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ceasefire is set to begin on Sunday morning, as approved by the Israeli cabinet.</li>
  <li>Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued even after the ceasefire announcement.</li>
  <li>In recent violence, a family of five was killed in a strike in Khan Yunis.</li>
  <li>Qatari Prime Minister stated an initial 42-day ceasefire will see the release of 33 hostages.</li>
  <li>The ceasefire follows previous agreements, including a one-week truce in November 2023.</li>
  <li>Since Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, there have been significant casualties on both sides, with many civilians affected.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We will be unable to move forward with the framework until we receive the list of the hostages who will be released, as was agreed. Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. Hamas is solely responsible." - Benjamin Netanyahu</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel continues to have devastating effects on the region, with significant loss of life and destruction, as a new ceasefire sets to be implemented amidst the uncertainty of hostages' fate.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Trump offers to acquire Greenland: The long history of the US trying to take over the island</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2024<br /><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump’s renewed interest in acquiring Greenland has sparked serious discussions despite the island’s leaders ruling out the possibility. This article explores the long history of American interest in Greenland, its strategic resources, and geopolitical implications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump intends to negotiate the acquisition of Greenland, a proposal initially made during his first term.</li>
  <li>Greenland is rich in minerals crucial for future technologies, located strategically near Arctic shipping lanes.</li>
  <li>Historical offers to buy Greenland date back to 1946, reflecting ongoing U.S. interests in the island.</li>
  <li>The recent revival of interest is partly driven by the growing influence of China in the region.</li>
  <li>Chinese companies are significantly involved in Greenland's mineral sector, prompting U.S. concerns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Buying, or annexing a foreign territory by force, is an idea totally out of place in a 21st Century world.”</blockquote>
<p>The attempt to acquire Greenland underscores the ongoing strategic competition between the U.S. and China, making it a notable geopolitical issue.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Imran Khan Sentenced to 14 Years in Corruption Case</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> August 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> BBC News</p>
<p>Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has been sentenced to 14 years in prison over a corruption case, marking the longest jail term against him amid numerous charges.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khan has been detained since August 2023 and faces over 100 charges.</li>
  <li>The convictions stem from accusations of receiving a bribe through a land parcel from a real estate tycoon.</li>
  <li>Khan's party claims the land was meant for a spiritual education center, not for personal gain.</li>
  <li>A significant fine of over £4,000 has also been imposed on Khan.</li>
  <li>Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, has been sentenced to seven years in prison.</li>
  <li>The verdict followed delays as Khan's party negotiated with the government.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Imran Khan will not give in, he will not give up, he will not break.” - Gohar Ali Khan, PTI Chairman</blockquote>
<p>Despite legal challenges, Khan maintains a considerable influence on Pakistan's political landscape, as evidenced by the last elections where PTI candidates secured significant seats.</p>

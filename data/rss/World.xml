<p>Cyclone Chido, the most powerful storm to hit Mayotte in nearly a century, has caused devastating damages, and the death toll may reach into the thousands according to officials.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cyclone struck with winds over 200 kph (124 mph), affecting housing, government buildings, and hospitals.</li>
  <li>Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville reported that casualties could number in the thousands.</li>
  <li>French President Emmanuel Macron expressed condolences for the victims in Mayotte, calling it a horrific tragedy.</li>
  <li>The cyclone has severely impacted access to essential resources such as food, water, and sanitation.</li>
  <li>Efforts for disaster relief, including an air bridge from Reunion island, have been initiated.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear." - Mohamed Ishmael, resident of Mamoudzou.</blockquote>
<p>This cyclone challenges the leadership of new Prime Minister Francois Bayrou as authorities assess the extent of the damage and begin recovery efforts.</p>]]></description>

<p>Joe Rogan has expressed genuine concern over unverified drone sightings in New Jersey after watching a viral TikTok video suggesting they may be searching for harmful substances.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rogan's comments came after observing a theory by John Ferguson, a CEO of a drone company, who speculated that drones might be detecting gas leaks or radioactive materials.</li>
<li>Despite reassurances from government officials that the drones are not a public safety threat, Rogan remains skeptical of these claims.</li>
<li>Various theories about the purpose of the drone sightings have emerged, including suggestions of foreign involvement.</li>
<li>Former President Donald Trump has also weighed in, urging authorities to disclose more information about the sightings and suggesting a more aggressive approach.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the first video about these drones that has got me genuinely concerned.” – Joe Rogan</blockquote>
<p>Rogan’s reaction highlights the public's interest and concern regarding the safety implications of unidentified drone activity.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>FILE - An image of ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad covers the facade of a provincial government office in the aftermath of the opposition's takeover of Hama, Syria,(AP)</figcaption>
<p>The report reveals that ousted Syrian President Bashar Al Assad allegedly transferred $250 million in cash to Moscow between 2018 and 2019, indicating strong financial ties with Russia during the Syrian Civil War.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cash was primarily in $100 and €500 denominations.</li>
  <li>Transactions occurred in amounts such as $10 million and $20 million at a time.</li>
  <li>The funds were recorded being deposited in Russian banks after flights from the Syrian Central Bank to Moscow.</li>
  <li>The assistance from Russia was crucial for Assad's regime amid the civil war.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The transactions happened between March 2018 to September 2019, after Russian Forces helped repel rebel forces from Damascus."</blockquote>
<p>This revelation highlights the depth of Assad's reliance on Russia for financial and military support throughout the conflict.</p>

<p>Rockland County Executive Ed Day has expressed his frustration regarding unidentified drone sightings in New Jersey and New York, demanding clarity from federal authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Day has written to President Biden asking for an investigation by the FAA and FBI.</li>
<li>Drones have been spotted in the region since mid-November, causing concern among residents.</li>
<li>The Federal government has stated they cannot verify over 3,000 reports of these drones.</li>
<li>Day criticized the federal response as “completely unacceptable”.</li>
<li>Former President Trump suggested that the government is withholding information about the drone sightings.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable—not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Ed Day said.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the mystery surrounding the drone sightings has prompted significant public concern, and local leaders are demanding accountability and transparency from federal authorities.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>UnitedHealthcare made headlines for terrifying 2015 caught-on-camera murders (REUTERS/Eric Miller/File Photo)(REUTERS)</figcaption>
<p>The recent murder of Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione is another grim chapter in UnitedHealthcare's history with violence, reminiscent of a horrifying 2015 event where a former employee killed a reporter and her cameraman live on air.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian Thompson was shot dead by Luigi Mangione in Midtown.</li>
<li>The incident echoes the 2015 murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward by Vester Lee Flanagan II.</li>
<li>Flanagan, who was fired from a news outlet, later worked at UnitedHealthcare.</li>
<li>The 2015 incident was televised and showed the shocking nature of the event.</li>
<li>Mangione is facing multiple charges including murder and remains jailed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).”</blockquote>
<p>This tragic string of events highlights the alarming connections between violent actions and individuals associated with UnitedHealthcare.</p>]]></description>

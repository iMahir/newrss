<ul>
  <li>Last year, Musk made the original offer while criticizing Wikipedia's funding model.</li>

  <li>Musk has previously questioned the Wikimedia Foundation's financial needs.</li>

<blockquote>“True. Offer still stands” — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)</blockquote>
<p>Despite the playful nature of the proposal, it has sparked discussions about the monetization and naming of digital platforms.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Deadly Christmas: Missile Strikes, Plane Crash, and Air Attacks</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> December 25, 2024 - <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/">Kyiv Independent</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Christmas Day 2024 witnessed a series of deadly events around the world, including missile strikes, a plane crash, and air attacks, turning the usually joyous occasion into a somber one.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Russia launched a massive aerial strike on Ukraine, targeting cities with deadly missiles and drones, causing civilian casualties and disrupting energy infrastructure.</li>
  <li>An Embraer airliner carrying 62 passengers crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, with only 32 survivors, likely due to strong GPS jamming.</li>
  <li>Pakistani air strikes in Afghanistan resulted in scores of civilian casualties, including women and children.</li>
  <li>The deadly incidents reignited memories of the Christmas bombings during the Vietnam War in 1972, which killed over 1,600 people in North Vietnam.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Every Russian massive strike takes time to prepare. It is never a spontaneous decision. It is a conscious choice not only of targets but also of time and date. - Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These tragic events underscore the ongoing global conflicts and safety concerns in various parts of the world.</p>]]></description>

<p>Bangladesh has expressed intentions to welcome the Pakistani Army for a training program, leading to concerns in India regarding the potential military collaboration and implications for regional security.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bangladesh has invited the Pakistani Army to provide training, marking their first collaborative effort since the 1971 India-Pakistan war.</li>
<li>The training will officially begin in February 2025 at the Momenshahi Cantonment of the Bangladesh Army.</li>
<li>Bangladesh has significantly increased its orders for arms and ammunition from Pakistan.</li>
<li>The initiative has raised concerns regarding the potential threat to India's northeastern states and the stability of the region.</li>
<li>A joint naval exercise named 'Aman 2025' is scheduled to occur, which marks a significant shift in Bangladesh's military alliances.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The closeness of two countries raises alarms about the security of the Siliguri corridor, a strategic link for India's Northeast.”</blockquote>
<p>The developing military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan pose a new challenge for India’s security frameworks, prompting critical monitoring of this evolving situation.</p>]]></description>

<p>Tom Homan, set to become Trump's border czar, disclosed that Congress will need to allocate $86 billion for the upcoming mass deportation initiative. Homan assures that while the initial costs are high, the long-term savings will benefit taxpayers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump's administration plans to initiate the largest deportation operation in U.S. history on day one.</li>
<li>The deportation plan involves securing extra funding for detention beds, deportation flights, and health services.</li>
<li>Homan emphasizes prioritizing deportation of criminally active illegal immigrants.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It’s going to be expensive, and everybody is focused on how expensive it’s gonna be. We need to understand, it’s gonna be expensive in the beginning, but in the long run it’s going to save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money.” - Tom Homan</blockquote>

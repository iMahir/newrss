<p>In a recent Christmas Day statement, Donald Trump sharply criticized Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates. Trump directed harsh remarks at these inmates and the Democrats, expressing his disdain and opposition to the clemency granted.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump told death row inmates to “go to hell” in response to Biden's clemency.</li>
  <li>The statement came after Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 death row inmates, many of whom include violent criminals.</li>
  <li>Trump referred to Biden derogatorily as “sleepy Joe” and criticized the Democrats as “radical left lunatics.”</li>
  <li>He vowed to “make America great again” in the upcoming weeks.</li>
  <li>Trump’s comments were aimed at discrediting the Democrats' approach to justice and politics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To the 37 most violent criminals, who killed, raped, and plundered… I refuse to wish a Merry Christmas to those lucky 'souls' but, instead, will say, GO TO HELL!” - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This statement highlights Trump's controversial rhetoric and the political tensions surrounding criminal justice in the United States as he prepares to take office.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Mossad Chief Advocates Targeting Iran to Counter Houthi Threats; Netanyahu Disagrees</h1>

(Mohammed HUWAIS / AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent development, Mossad chief David Barnea has urged Israeli leadership to focus on attacking Iran to mitigate threats from the Houthi rebels, contrasting with the views of PM Netanyahu and Defense Minister Katz who prefer direct strikes against the Houthis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Barnea believes targeting Iran is more effective as it funds and arms the Houthis.</li>
<li>Israeli officials indicated plans for increased military activity against the Houthis in response to recent missile and drone attacks.</li>
<li>PM Netanyahu maintains that the situation with Iran must be addressed separately in due time.</li>
<li>Air Force Chief Tomer Bar affirmed the commitment to intensify attacks on Houthi targets.</li>
<li>Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant supports collaboration with the US against both the Houthis and Iran.</li>
<li>The article details ongoing Houthi assaults, including missile strikes that have resulted in injuries in Israel.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We need to go head-on against Iran,” Barnea stated, highlighting the urgency of the situation.</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing conflict with the Houthis reflects broader regional tensions, as missile and drone assaults from Yemen have become increasingly common.</p>
<p>As the Israeli military contemplates its strategy amidst escalating tensions, the coordination with US forces is expected to play a crucial role in shaping future actions against both the Houthis and Iran.</p>]]></description>

<p>Musa Hasahya Kasera, a 70-year-old villager from Mukiza in eastern Uganda, is facing the immense challenge of providing for his extraordinary family — 12 wives, 102 children, and 578 grandchildren. His situation has garnered local admiration and concern.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hasahya's family began with his first marriage at age 17 in 1972.</li>
  <li>The size of his family has put immense pressure on resources and living conditions.</li>
  <li>He struggles to provide enough food, often resorting to feeding his large family only once or twice a day.</li>
  <li>Family meetings are held monthly to resolve conflicts among wives and children.</li>
  <li>Despite hardships, local officials recognize his ability to maintain relative peace among his family.</li>
  <li>His wives' living conditions have led to some discontent; two have left the household.</li>
  <li>To prevent further expansion, Hasahya's wives are now using contraceptives.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I have learned my lesson,” Hasahya said. “I do not expect more children. I can’t look after any more.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Hasahya's family continues to grow, the pressing challenges of food security and family dynamics highlight the struggle of managing such a large household.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivers remarks after meeting with the French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs at the Quai d'Orsay in Paris.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In a clear stance against President-elect Donald Trump's aggressive rhetoric, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that a US takeover of Greenland is not a viable option.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blinken criticized Trump's statement about acquiring Greenland, emphasizing that it's not going to happen.</li>
  <li>Trump mentioned he would consider military action for economic security, including seizing Greenland.</li>
  <li>Blinken highlighted Biden's administration's focus on strengthening alliances rather than alienating them.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest that Biden's team is preparing the incoming administration for global engagement.</li>
  <li>Blinken alluded to diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and Ukraine that set a positive groundwork for the future.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The idea expressed about Greenland is obviously not a good one, but maybe more important: it’s obviously one that’s not going to happen.” - Antony Blinken</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Blinken's remarks highlight a shift towards collaborative foreign policy, reinforcing the commitment to international alliances under the Biden administration.</p>]]></description>

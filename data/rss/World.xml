<figcaption>He failed to complete a shot, and the ball went in the air, allowing Scott Boland to settle under it and complete a simple catch. The contribution of 3 runs increased his tally of poor scores in red-ball cricket.</figcaption>
<p>Ricky Ponting has lambasted Rohit Sharma for his lazy shot against Pat Cummins during the fourth Test at the MCG, which saw the Indian captain score only three runs. This performance has contributed to his ongoing struggles in red-ball cricket.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ponting criticized Sharma for being lazy and not committed during his innings.</li>
  <li>Sharma’s struggles with form continued after a poor home series against Bangladesh and New Zealand.</li>
  <li>This dismissal marks an ongoing trend for Sharma, who has yet to find his footing in Australia.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“He was lazy and not switched on. The type of shot he played was strange. He has been one of the best hookers and pullers since he started playing international cricket but he is not there at the moment.” - Ricky Ponting</blockquote>
<p>The criticism from Ponting highlights the growing concern over Sharma's form and readiness to compete against top-tier Australian bowlers.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Miraculous Landing After Shootdown By Russian SAM: Azerbaijan Plane Crash Reminds Of 'Very Similar' 2003 Incident</h1>
<p><strong>The Azerbaijani plane crash in Kazakhstan has sparked speculations that a Russian surface-to-air missile may have struck the aircraft. The tragic incident has also revived memories of an aircraft that was hit by a missile in 2003 and managed to land safely with no fatalities.</strong></p>
<img src="https://www.eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WhatsApp-Image-2024-12-26-at-1.33.27-AM.jpeg" alt="Wreckage of the Azerbaijan airline that crashed in Aktau, Kazakhstan" width="800" height="450">
<figcaption>Wreckage of the Azerbaijan airline that crashed in Aktau, Kazakhstan</figcaption>
<p>The aircraft, an Embraer 190, was flying from Baku to Grozny but crashed near Aktau in Kazakhstan. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, stated that the plane was shot down by a Russian air defense system. The crash has raised suspicions of a Russian strike on the aircraft.</p>
<p>The incident has drawn parallels with a 2003 event involving a DHL cargo plane that was hit by a missile but landed safely. The Azerbaijan Airlines crash, with 38 fatalities, is under investigation.</p>]]></description>

<p>As TikTok’s fate hangs in the balance, TikTok CEO, Shou Chew, is planning to attend President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday. The executive will join Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk on the dais.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump's previous administration initiated calls to ban TikTok due to security concerns.</li>
  <li>During his 2024 campaign, Trump promised to save the app after realizing its popularity among young users.</li>
  <li>Chew's presence at the inauguration comes as TikTok nears a potential shutdown in the U.S. on January 19, pending a Supreme Court decision.</li>
  <li>Trump has openly discussed his favorable experiences with TikTok in reaching audiences during his campaign.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on a law that could effectively ban TikTok in the U.S.</blockquote>
<p>This significant event highlights the intertwining of social media and politics, especially as TikTok faces potential legal challenges that could alter its future in the U.S.</p>]]></description>

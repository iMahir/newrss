            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Iranian Woman Defies Cleric By Wearing His Turban as Hijab</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 09, 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/09/550x309/Hijab_1736416843523_1736416848427.jpeg" alt="The incident took place at Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport.(X/@AlinejadMasih)">
<figcaption>The incident took place at Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport.(X/@AlinejadMasih)</figcaption>
<p>A viral video from Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport captures a woman snatching a cleric’s turban and wearing it as a scarf during a confrontation, symbolizing a powerful act of defiance against Iran's strict hijab laws.</p>
<ul>
<li>The incident escalated when the cleric demanded the woman wear a hijab.</li>
<li>In the video, the woman questions the cleric's honor before searching for her husband.</li>
<li>The event is part of a larger movement of civil disobedience in Iran against mandatory hijab laws, following the death of Mahsa Amini.</li>
<li>The Iranian International reported mixed reactions, with some supporting the woman's boldness and others labeling her actions as stemming from psychological issues.</li>
<li>Over 30,000 women faced legal consequences for hijab non-compliance in December, indicating intensified enforcement of the law.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We’re witnessing something quite unprecedented: Women leading the charge against an immoral, illegitimate Islamic regime.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the ongoing rebellion against oppressive dress codes in Iran and the increasing resolve of women to resist such mandates.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's newly inaugurated president.</figcaption>
<p>Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's newly inaugurated president, provided a rapid response to Donald Trump’s suggestion to rename the Gulf of Mexico, using a historical map as a visual aid to convey her message.</p>
<ul>
<li>Claudia Sheinbaum presented a 400-year-old map of North America labeled 'América Mexicana'.</li>
<li>Sheinbaum humorously suggested renaming the region 'Mexican America'.</li>
<li>She addressed Trump’s comments regarding Mexico's sovereignty, emphasizing Mexico's independence.</li>
<li>She highlighted the misinformation surrounding Trump's remarks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“In Mexico, the people rule. We are a free, independent, and sovereign country. We will always defend that.” - Claudia Sheinbaum</blockquote>

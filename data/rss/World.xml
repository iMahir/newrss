<p>A powerful earthquake of magnitude 6.9 struck the Kyushu region of Japan at 9:19 PM local time, prompting tsunami advisories for nearby coastal areas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The quake occurred at a depth of 30 kilometers.</li>
  <li>Tsunami advisories predicted waves of up to one meter high.</li>
  <li>Residents in the Kochi Prefecture were advised to evacuate as a precaution.</li>
  <li>A 20-centimeter-high tsunami impacted Miyazaki city, home to about 400,000 residents.</li>
  <li>The Japan Meteorological Agency is investigating connections to the Nankai Trough.</li>
  <li>Japan's location in the Ring of Fire makes it prone to frequent seismic activities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Basically, when a ‘downgoing’ oceanic plate is shoved into a hotter mantle plate, it heats up, volatile elements mix, and this produces the magma.”</blockquote>
<p>This earthquake highlights the ongoing risks faced by Japan due to its geological position and may lead to increased awareness and preparedness in the region.</p>]]></description>

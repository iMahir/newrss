<p>Shigemi Fukahori, a 93-year-old survivor of the 1945 Nagasaki atomic bombing, known for his lifelong advocacy for peace and nuclear disarmament, has passed away in Nagasaki.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fukahori died on January 3, 2025, in a hospital in Nagasaki, reportedly from old age.</li>
<li>He was just 14 years old when the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, which killed tens of thousands.</li>
<li>Fukahori became more vocal about his experiences 15 years ago, inspired by a discussion with a survivor of the bombing of Guernica.</li>
<li>He often spoke to students, encouraging them to carry on his advocacy for peace.</li>
<li>During a visit from Pope Francis in 2019, Fukahori presented a wreath, symbolizing his lifelong commitment to peace.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“On the day the bomb dropped, I heard a voice asking for help. When I walked over and held out my hand, the person’s skin melted. I still remember how that felt.” - Shigemi Fukahori</blockquote>
<p>Fukahori's passing marks the loss of a significant voice in the movement advocating for nuclear disarmament and peace.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>The work experience requirement has been reduced from three years to two years, making it easier for migrants to seek employment.</li>
  <li>New visa pathways include a three-year multi-entry visa for experienced seasonal workers and a seven-month single-entry visa for lower-skilled workers.</li>
  <li>The median pay criteria for the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) and Specific Purpose Work Visa (SPWV) have been slashed, allowing for greater flexibility.</li>
  <li>A minimum annual earnings threshold of NZ$55,844 is required for AEWV holders wishing to bring children to New Zealand.</li>
  <li>Visas for skill levels 4 or 5 jobs have been extended from two to three years, with options for extensions for current employees.</li>
  <li>Changes have also been made to the Post Study Work Visa, allowing students to work in New Zealand for up to three years post-graduation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The new rules will significantly benefit Indian migrants looking for job opportunities in New Zealand.”</blockquote>

<p>Amid growing outrage over the prevalence of grooming gangs in the UK, a controversial tweet by journalist Sulaiman Ahmed has sparked widespread condemnation for his justification of sexual acts with minors.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A two-year-old tweet by Sulaiman Ahmed attempted to deflect attention from Pakistani grooming gangs to white individuals.</li>
    <li>Ahmed claimed underage victims ‘consented’ to sexual acts, misleadingly framing statutory rape claims.</li>
    <li>Public backlash included criticisms from netizens and political commentators condemning Ahmed's views as dangerous and harmful.</li>
    <li>Ahmed has a history of defending controversial positions related to Pakistan and Islam.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Social workers said CONSENT was given by these women. When CONSENT is given there is no rape and there CANNOT be any grooming…” — Sulaiman Ahmed</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing discourse reveals significant tensions in how sexual violence is perceived and discussed in the context of ethnicity and religion within the UK.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rockland County Executive Ed Day has expressed his frustration regarding unidentified drone sightings in New Jersey and New York, demanding clarity from federal authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Day has written to President Biden asking for an investigation by the FAA and FBI.</li>
<li>Drones have been spotted in the region since mid-November, causing concern among residents.</li>
<li>The Federal government has stated they cannot verify over 3,000 reports of these drones.</li>
<li>Day criticized the federal response as “completely unacceptable”.</li>
<li>Former President Trump suggested that the government is withholding information about the drone sightings.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable—not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Ed Day said.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the mystery surrounding the drone sightings has prompted significant public concern, and local leaders are demanding accountability and transparency from federal authorities.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>UnitedHealthcare made headlines for terrifying 2015 caught-on-camera murders (REUTERS/Eric Miller/File Photo)(REUTERS)</figcaption>
<p>The recent murder of Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione is another grim chapter in UnitedHealthcare's history with violence, reminiscent of a horrifying 2015 event where a former employee killed a reporter and her cameraman live on air.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian Thompson was shot dead by Luigi Mangione in Midtown.</li>
<li>The incident echoes the 2015 murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward by Vester Lee Flanagan II.</li>
<li>Flanagan, who was fired from a news outlet, later worked at UnitedHealthcare.</li>
<li>The 2015 incident was televised and showed the shocking nature of the event.</li>
<li>Mangione is facing multiple charges including murder and remains jailed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).”</blockquote>
<p>This tragic string of events highlights the alarming connections between violent actions and individuals associated with UnitedHealthcare.</p>]]></description>

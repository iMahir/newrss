<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to resign as the leader of the Liberal Party as early as Monday, following increasing pressure after the resignation of his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation is anticipated amid falling poll numbers for the Liberal Party.</li>
  <li>The upcoming caucus meeting aims to address calls for his resignation.</li>
  <li>Freeland's resignation on December 16 has amplified scrutiny on Trudeau.</li>
  <li>Concerns are growing over economic instability and potential threats from the US administration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The country could face instability, notably from an economic threat in the potential of a 25% US tariff on Canadian imports from the incoming administration.” - Kody Blois, Liberal Party Leader</blockquote>
<p>This impending leadership change could significantly affect Canadian politics, including potential ramifications for Trudeau's role as prime minister.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ruling People Power Party lawmakers stand outside the official residence of the impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, South Korea, January 6, 2025.</figcaption>
<p>South Korea's anti-corruption agency has requested police to execute an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a previous attempt was blocked.</p>
<ul>
<li>The investigation follows allegations that President Yoon masterminded an insurrection during a brief declaration of martial law.</li>
<li>A stand-off on January 3 prevented the execution of the arrest warrant due to a human chain formed by presidential guards.</li>
<li>Critics have expressed frustration over delays in executing the warrant, which is set to expire soon.</li>
<li>The CIO has requested police involvement, as they are unable to prosecute the president themselves.</li>
<li>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting South Korea amid the ongoing political turmoil.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are reviewing the law internally,” a police official stated following the request from the CIO.</blockquote>
<p>The situation reflects significant political tensions within South Korea as the investigation unfolds.</p>]]></description>

<p>Five Indian-origin men have been arrested and charged with the murder of an Indian whose body was found in a forest in New Jersey. The last suspect, Sandeep Kumar, was arrested on Friday.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The victim, Kuldeep Kumar, was found with gunshot wounds in the Greenwood Wildlife Management Area.</li>
  <li>Kumar had been reported missing on October 26, with his body discovered two months later.</li>
  <li>The alleged murder occurred around October 22, and the FBI assisted in identifying the victim.</li>
  <li>Four of the accused hail from Indiana, while one is from New York.</li>
  <li>They are currently held in an Indiana jail awaiting extradition to New Jersey.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The accused men were arrested by the FBI without incident on December 20,” said Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer.</blockquote>

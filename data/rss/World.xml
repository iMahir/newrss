<p>US President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to create a new government agency called the External Revenue Service on January 20, coinciding with his second inauguration. This agency will focus on collecting tariffs and duties from foreign sources as part of a broader strategy to implement new import tariffs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump aims to shift revenue collection from the IRS to the new department.</li>
  <li>He criticized existing trade agreements for burdening American taxpayers.</li>
  <li>The proposal includes tariffs of 10% on global imports and higher tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.</li>
  <li>Economic forecasts predict significant revenue generation from the proposed tariffs, but potential adverse effects on the economy.</li>
  <li>Senator Ron Wyden condemned Trump's plan as a tax increase on families and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects Trump's ongoing commitment to reshape U.S. trade policy and revenue structure as he resumes presidential duties.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the warning from Brigadier General Doug Wickert regarding the imminent overpowering of China’s fighter jets over those of the United States by 2027, with a projection of a 12 to 1 ratio in key regions of the Western Pacific.</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2027, China’s modern fighter jet fleet is expected to outnumber the U.S. fleet by a significant margin.</li>
<li>The rapid modernization of China's military is described as “unprecedented” and “far outpacing” the United States efforts.</li>
<li>Recent advancements include the introduction of new sixth-generation fighter jets.</li>
<li>The U.S. must accelerate its development of next-generation fighter jets as concerns grow over falling behind.</li>
<li>China currently holds a significant advantage in various military assets including manned bombers and naval capabilities.</li>
<li>Concerns about cyber espionage efforts by China and the risks they pose to U.S. national security have also been raised.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are the smallest and oldest that we have ever been. The PLA is the largest and most modern that it has ever been. That is a risk. That is uncertainty,” Wickert said.</blockquote>
<p>This alarming projection highlights the shifting balance of power in military capabilities between the U.S. and China, necessitating urgent action to maintain strategic advantages.</p>]]></description>

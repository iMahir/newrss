<p>In an interview with USA Today, President Joe Biden shared that he received a compliment from former President Donald Trump regarding his economic record. Biden reflected on his potential to have defeated Trump in the presidential election and expressed uncertainty about pursuing another term.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Biden claims he could have beaten Trump had he not dropped out of the race.</li>
  <li>Trump complimented Biden on his economic achievements.</li>
  <li>Biden stated, 'It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes' when asked about his chances of winning.</li>
  <li>He expressed uncertainty about another full term, questioning, 'Who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?'</li>
  <li>Biden dropped out of the 2024 race on July 21, 2024, endorsing Kamala Harris.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Biden: 'The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time.'</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Biden's reflections highlight his confidence in his leadership record while navigating the complexities of politics as he approaches the end of his term.</p>]]></description>

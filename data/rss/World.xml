<p>The tragic Jeju Air flight 7C2216 crash has raised significant questions regarding the actual cause, with experts disputing the likelihood of a bird strike leading to the aircraft's malfunction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The plane was landing at Muan International Airport when it crashed, resulting in the death of 179 people.</li>
<li>Experts argue that a bird strike could not have solely caused the malfunctioning of the landing gear.</li>
<li>Survivors of the crash are stable and conscious but the majority of passengers have not been identified.</li>

<p>Recent military confrontations along the Durand Line have resulted in significant casualties for both Afghan and Pakistani forces. Following airstrikes by Pakistan in Afghanistan, Afghan forces launched counterstrikes across the border, leading to escalating tensions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>19 Pakistani soldiers were reported killed as Afghan forces crossed the contested Durand Line.</li>
  <li>The Afghan attacks were in retaliation for previous Pakistani airstrikes that killed 46 Afghan civilians, predominantly women and children.</li>
  <li>Afghan Defense Minister claims that the operations targeted areas used to launch attacks on Afghanistan.</li>
  <li>Both nations have acknowledged ongoing clashes and casualties on their sides, indicating a significant rise in border tensions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We do not consider it to be the territory of Pakistan… but it was on the other side of the hypothetical line.” - Enayatullah Khowarazmi, Afghan Ministry of Defense</blockquote>
<p>The escalating situation illustrates the persistent instability and the historical complexities surrounding the Durand Line, which has never been officially recognized by Afghanistan. The conflict reflects broader geopolitical dynamics in South Asia.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Panama president José Raúl Mulino reacts after Donald Trump threatens to take control of Panama Canal (AP Photo/Pamela Smith, photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP)</figcaption>
<p>Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino dismissed US President-elect Donald Trump's accusation of Chinese troops operating the Panama Canal as unfounded.</p>
<ul>
<li>President Mulino called Trump's claims "nonsense" and stressed that there is currently no Chinese presence in the canal.</li>
<li>Mulino emphasized the canal's Panamanian ownership and independence, stating it is not up for negotiation.</li>
<li>He highlighted the respectful diplomatic relationship between Panama and China established after severing ties with Taiwan in 2017.</li>
<li>Trump's comments were made during a social media post and at a conference where he expressed grievances over Panama's fees.</li>
<li>Mulino asserted the sovereignty of Panama, countering Trump’s threats to seize control of the canal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal. For the love of God, you are free, the whole world is free, to visit the canal if you please.” - José Raúl Mulino</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights ongoing tensions in U.S.-Latin America relations, particularly concerning U.S. accusations regarding China's involvement in the region.</p>]]></description>

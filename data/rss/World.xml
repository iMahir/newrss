<figcaption>Homelessness surges to record levels in the US</figcaption>
<p>The United States has reported its highest level of homelessness, with a significant rise in multiple states amidst a deepening housing crisis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>771,480 people were homeless on a single night in January 2024, an 18.1% increase from 2023.</li>
  <li>Illinois saw the steepest rise in homelessness at 116.2%, with the Chicago area contributing significantly due to an influx of migrants.</li>
  <li>Hawaii experienced an 87% rise, partly due to last year's Maui wildfires.</li>
  <li>New York and Massachusetts recorded increases of over 53% primarily driven by asylum seekers.</li>
  <li>California accounted for nearly 25% of the nation’s homeless population, despite efforts to reduce unsheltered homelessness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing." - Renee Willis, Interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition</blockquote>
<p>Family homelessness increased nationwide by 39%, with nearly 150,000 children affected. The surge highlights the ongoing affordable housing crisis exacerbated by the end of pandemic-era protections and increasing immigrant numbers.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Debate on H-1B visas intensifies as Trump signals support for skilled immigration, highlighting GOP divisions.(REUTERS)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the internal conflict within Trump's support base regarding H-1B visas for skilled workers, highlighting his alignment with Silicon Valley supporters against the anti-immigration stance of MAGA proponents.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump favors a more open high-skilled immigration policy, siding with Silicon Valley.</li>
  <li>Criticism arises after the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, who advocates for immigration reform.</li>
  <li>Trump’s allies, Musk and Ramaswamy, defend the H-1B program against MAGA criticisms.</li>
  <li>Concerns about the impact of H-1B visas on American jobs and racial undertones in the debate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"OF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process. HOWEVER, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America." - Elon Musk</blockquote>
<p>The conflict underscores a significant rift within the Republican Party as immigration policy continues to create divisions between traditional supporters and tech industry interests.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Pentagon’s 2024 annual report assesses that although China’s PLA Air Force (PLAAF) is advancing quickly, it still does not match the combat capabilities of the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Analysts are questioning whether the recent unveiling of China’s sixth-generation fighter could alter the balance of power in the skies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The report highlights advancements in China’s unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which are nearing parity with USAF systems.</li>
  <li>China's progress includes improvements in air-to-air missiles, electronic warfare, and fifth-generation fighters.</li>
  <li>The PLAAF operates the outdated Xi’an H-6 bombers, while the USAF has long-standing bomber capabilities like the B-52 and B-21 Raider.</li>
  <li>China aims to boost its J-20 fighter fleet significantly by 2035, while the USA continues to lead in fifth-generation aircraft with plans to acquire more stealth fighters.</li>
  <li>China recently revealed its sixth-generation fighter, the J-36, raising questions about its capabilities and potential impact.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“China is fast modernizing and increasing its nuclear warhead numbers, with a target of 1,500 by 2035.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while China is making notable advancements in military technology, the USAF maintains considerable advantages in experience and capabilities. Ongoing developments like the J-36 will require close observation as they may shift military dynamics in Asia.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the crash of an Azerbaijani airliner, suggesting that Russian air defense systems may have caused the incident.</p>
<ul>
<li>The plane crashed on December 25, 2024, killing 38 people and injuring 29 others.</li>
<li>A U.S. official stated there were indications that the jet was downed by Russian air defenses.</li>
<li>Azerbaijan's Minister of Digital Development pointed out potential external impacts as per preliminary expert conclusions.</li>
<li>Survivors described loud noises and explosions before the crash, indicating possible weapon discharge.</li>
<li>Azerbaijan Airlines has blamed the crash on “physical and technical interference.”</li>
<li>Investigations are ongoing with teams examining the crash site in Grozny.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If it’s proven that the plane crashed after being hit by Russian air defenses, it would be the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine.”</blockquote>
<p>The incident raises significant concerns over air safety in conflict regions and the impact of military actions on civilian aviation.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> The Economic Times</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and delay a ban on TikTok, citing concerns over freedom of expression and potential economic impacts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump argues that banning TikTok would infringe on First Amendment rights.</li>

<figcaption>The WalkON Suit F1 exoskeleton designed for paraplegics.</figcaption>
<p>A group of South Korean researchers has developed a wearable robot named <strong>WalkON Suit F1</strong> that could revolutionize mobility for paraplegic individuals, allowing them to walk instead of using wheelchairs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The suit is lightweight, weighing only 50 kilograms, and operates using 12 motors simulating natural walking movements.</li>
  <li>It processes over 1,000 data points per second to anticipate user movements and maintain balance.</li>
  <li>Equipped with a camera system, it can identify obstacles and elevation changes.</li>
  <li>The exoskeleton can attach to the user while they remain seated, making it easier to integrate into daily life.</li>
  <li>During tests, the user reached speeds of 3.2 km/h and performed complex maneuvers such as climbing stairs.</li>
  <li>Kim Seung-hwan, a member of the team, won a gold medal in the exoskeleton category at Cybathlon 2024.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The success of this design was reflected in the Cybathlon 2024, where we won the gold medal in the exoskeleton category." - Kim Seung-hwan</blockquote>

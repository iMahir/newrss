<p>US President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to create a new government agency called the External Revenue Service on January 20, coinciding with his second inauguration. This agency will focus on collecting tariffs and duties from foreign sources as part of a broader strategy to implement new import tariffs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump aims to shift revenue collection from the IRS to the new department.</li>
  <li>He criticized existing trade agreements for burdening American taxpayers.</li>
  <li>The proposal includes tariffs of 10% on global imports and higher tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.</li>
  <li>Economic forecasts predict significant revenue generation from the proposed tariffs, but potential adverse effects on the economy.</li>
  <li>Senator Ron Wyden condemned Trump's plan as a tax increase on families and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share." - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This initiative reflects Trump's ongoing commitment to reshape U.S. trade policy and revenue structure as he resumes presidential duties.</p>]]></description>

Gen. Doug Wickert, 412th Test Wing commander, points to an image of the B-21 Raider in flight during an Edwards-based test mission. USAF</figcaption></figure>
<p>The article discusses the warning from Brigadier General Doug Wickert regarding the imminent overpowering of China’s fighter jets over those of the United States by 2027, with a projection of a 12 to 1 ratio in key regions of the Western Pacific.</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2027, China’s modern fighter jet fleet is expected to outnumber the U.S. fleet by a significant margin.</li>
<li>The rapid modernization of China's military is described as “unprecedented” and “far outpacing” the United States efforts.</li>
<li>Recent advancements include the introduction of new sixth-generation fighter jets.</li>
<li>The U.S. must accelerate its development of next-generation fighter jets as concerns grow over falling behind.</li>
<li>China currently holds a significant advantage in various military assets including manned bombers and naval capabilities.</li>
<li>Concerns about cyber espionage efforts by China and the risks they pose to U.S. national security have also been raised.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are the smallest and oldest that we have ever been. The PLA is the largest and most modern that it has ever been. That is a risk. That is uncertainty,” Wickert said.</blockquote>
<p>This alarming projection highlights the shifting balance of power in military capabilities between the U.S. and China, necessitating urgent action to maintain strategic advantages.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Pakistan’s ISI back in Bangladesh? Weapons being supplied to Rohingya militants in Bangladesh camps, training given to new recruits in....</figcaption>
<p>In a significant setback for the Bangladesh interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, Former prime minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has demanded that general elections be held by July-August this year, opposing Yunus’s proposed timeline of December or mid-2026.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alamgir, BNP secretary general, criticized the long timeline for elections, emphasizing the need for timely democratic processes.</li>
  <li>The BNP opposes holding local elections before parliamentary polls, insisting on prioritizing national elections.</li>
  <li>Zia is currently in London receiving medical treatment, while her party continues to challenge the interim government's policies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We believe, as the Election Commission has already been formed and there is relative stability in governance, there is no reason to delay the national election further. Delays only deepen the political and economic crises.” - Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir</blockquote>
<p>In light of these developments, the situation for Yunus' government remains tense, as the BNP pushes for an earlier election to ensure a democratic transition, following previous electoral failures.</p>]]></description>

<p>A French woman named Anne was duped of over 800,000 euros in a scam where she believed she was in a romantic relationship with Hollywood actor Brad Pitt.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scammer contacted Anne on Instagram, posing as Pitt and used AI-generated content to maintain the illusion.</li>
<li>He convinced her that he needed financial help due to blocked bank accounts amid a divorce from Angelina Jolie.</li>
<li>Anne, who was struggling in her marriage, divorced her husband under the pretense of marrying Pitt.</li>
<li>Ultimately, she transferred approximately 800,000 euros intended for her divorce settlement.</li>
<li>The scam came to light after Anne saw reports of Pitt's relationship with someone else, leading to her hospitalization for severe depression.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“At first, I thought it was fake, but I could not understand what was happening to me.” - Anne</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the pervasive issue of online scams and the dangers of social media deception.</p>]]></description>

<p>Hamas has confirmed acceptance of a draft agreement for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, according to officials involved in the negotiations. Mediators from Qatar announced that talks are at their most promising stage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hamas’ acceptance marks a critical step in negotiations mediated by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar.</li>
  <li>About 100 Israelis are held hostage, with many believed to be deceased.</li>
  <li>The agreement includes a three-phase plan for releasing hostages and a humanitarian aid surge.</li>
  <li>Upcoming U.S. presidential inauguration adds urgency to reach a final deal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,” said Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, there seems to be a significant movement towards a potential ceasefire and a resolution that could reshape the current conflict landscape in Gaza.</p>]]></description>

<p>In the week since the fires in Los Angeles County broke out, thousands of homes have been destroyed, at least 24 lives have been lost, and 16 people are reported missing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Eaton fire accounted for 16 deaths, and the Palisades fire for 8.</li>
  <li>Approximately 150,000 people remain under evacuation orders.</li>
  <li>More than 12,000 buildings are estimated to have been burnt.</li>
  <li>Only 13% of the Palisades fire and 27% of the Eaton fire are contained.</li>
  <li>Fierce Santa Ana winds have contributed to the fire's rapid spread.</li>
  <li>Early estimates indicate potential costs of up to $150 billion.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, January 14, 2025," warned fire behaviour analyst Dennis Burns.</blockquote>
<p>The devastation from these wildfires highlights the urgent need for improved fire management and preventative measures as Los Angeles faces fierce weather conditions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Trump's Push To Shut Down the Axis of Upheaval Starts With LNG</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> OilPrice.com</p>
<p>As Donald Trump’s new advisory team prepares for his second term, there is a strong belief that the 'Axis of Upheaval' is declining. This axis, comprising China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, aimed to diminish U.S. influence globally. However, recent analysis indicates that these nations are currently facing significant challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump's focus will be to reassert U.S. and allied influence in global affairs.</li>
<li>The immediate priority includes concluding the war in Ukraine.</li>
<li>Continued sanctions on Russia's LNG exports are expected to limit its financial capabilities.</li>
<li>Cooperation with European allies to cut off Russian energy resources is a key strategy.</li>
<li>Similar sanctions may be imposed on Iraq for aiding Iran's oil exports.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“China’s finances are failing, Russia’s military has failed, Iran’s proxies have been incapacitated, North Korea is on the sidelines, and now Trump is back.”</blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration’s policies suggest a bold approach to international relations, emphasizing accountability and pressure on adversarial nations.</p>]]></description>

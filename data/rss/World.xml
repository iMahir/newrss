            <title><![CDATA[Inside Israel’s Shadow War Against Iran in Syria - New Lines Magazine]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Inside Israel’s Shadow War Against Iran in Syria</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 1, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> New Lines</p>
<p>This article explores classified documents that reveal the covert mechanisms by which Israel has conducted military operations against Iranian presence in Syria, specifically detailing Israel's intelligence operations and the geopolitical dynamics between Israel, Syria, Russia, and Iran in light of the Syrian civil war and recent regional conflicts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The documents suggest Israel's ongoing efforts to prevent Iranian weapon transfers through Syria.</li>
<li>Evidence shows an Israeli operative named “Mousa” communicated directly with Syrian officials regarding military strategies and threats.</li>
<li>The fallout from these operations has led to significant shifts in regional power dynamics, particularly after the collapse of Assad's regime in December 2023.</li>
<li>Assad's regime has had to navigate the complex relationship with Iran while managing Israeli airstrikes aimed at Iranian assets in Syria.</li>
<li>The situation escalated dramatically following the unexpected actions by anti-Assad rebels, prompting Israel to adopt a more aggressive military posture.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The details of this unique covert deconfliction mechanism with Russia show clearly the overall Israeli comfort with Assad’s regime, emphasizing the old adage ‘the devil you know.’” - Marc Polymeropolous, former CIA officer.</blockquote>
<p>This analysis highlights the shifting alliances and ongoing conflict in the region, underscoring how Israeli military strategies have significantly altered the operational landscape in Syria while concurrently exposing the vulnerabilities of Assad's government in relation to both Iran and Russia.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 16, 2023, <strong>Source:</strong> Channel News Asia</p>
<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed concerns regarding China's influence following revelations about a suspected Chinese spy's links to Prince Andrew.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Starmer emphasized the need for engagement with China on essential issues like climate change while maintaining a cautious stance.</li>
  <li>The suspected spy, identified as H6, was connected to Prince Andrew, leading to heightened scrutiny.</li>
  <li>Critics, including former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, argued that the UK government has shown weakness toward China.</li>
  <li>Judges upheld a ban on H6 from entering the UK, highlighting potential political interference.</li>
  <li>Duncan Smith indicated that the situation reflects broader espionage concerns tied to China's activities in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The reality is it's an excuse not to upset China.” - Iain Duncan Smith</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the UK faces increasing pressure to reevaluate its approach toward China amid alarming espionage allegations and political implications.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is currently in exile in Russian capital Moscow. (File)(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In his first public statement since being ousted, Bashar al-Assad claimed that Syria has succumbed to 'terrorism' and emphasized his intention to fight against it, denying any desire to seek refuge or abdicate his position.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assad states he never intended to step down and is prepared to combat terrorism.</li>
  <li>He argues that Syria has fallen to terrorist hands and cannot be viewed as liberation.</li>
  <li>Assad asserts that the narrative framing terrorism as liberation is misinformation.</li>
  <li>He highlights a communication blackout that delayed his statement.</li>
  <li>He claimed to have coordinated his movements with Russian allies during the conflict.</li>
  <li>Despite his exile, he professes a strong bond with the Syrian people remains.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The person who has never abandoned the resistance... cannot possibly be the same person who would forsake his own people.”</blockquote>
<p>Assad's remarks reflect his view of the ongoing conflict in Syria as a struggle against terrorism, framing his leadership and resilience amidst the war. He conveys a sense of hope for Syria's future independence.</p>]]></description>

<p>More than 50 people were killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, with reports including children and a journalist among the deceased. The ongoing violence has brought the total Palestinian death toll to over 45,000 since the conflict began.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Israeli attacks targeted sites associated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</li>
  <li>Casualties included a cameraman from Al Jazeera and members of the Civil Defence agency.</li>
  <li>The death toll from the war has been controversial, with different figures reported by Hamas and the Israeli government.</li>

<p>The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, exacerbated by continuous strikes and widespread displacement among civilians. The conflict shows no signs of abating, raising serious concerns about the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers.</p>]]></description>

<p>A report from Amnesty International reveals that Serbian journalist Slaviša Milanov's phone was compromised by a spyware called NoviSpy after it was unlocked by a Cellebrite tool while in police custody.</p>
<ul>
<li>NoviSpy can capture personal data, audio, and videos from infected devices.</li>
<li>The spyware was reportedly installed during Milanov's detention in early 2024.</li>
<li>Other targets of this spyware include activists from various causes.</li>
<li>This case highlights the use of invasive technology for surveillance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"These tools provide the state with an enormous capability to gather data both covertly and overtly." - Amnesty International</blockquote>
<p>This incident underscores growing concerns about surveillance technology and privacy violations, calling for greater scrutiny over the use of such tools by government agencies.</p>]]></description>

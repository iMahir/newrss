<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to resign as the leader of the Liberal Party as early as Monday, following increasing pressure after the resignation of his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trudeau's resignation is anticipated amid falling poll numbers for the Liberal Party.</li>
  <li>The upcoming caucus meeting aims to address calls for his resignation.</li>
  <li>Freeland's resignation on December 16 has amplified scrutiny on Trudeau.</li>
  <li>Concerns are growing over economic instability and potential threats from the US administration.</li>

<figcaption>Ruling People Power Party lawmakers stand outside the official residence of the impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, South Korea, January 6, 2025.</figcaption>
<p>South Korea's anti-corruption agency has requested police to execute an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a previous attempt was blocked.</p>
<ul>
<li>The investigation follows allegations that President Yoon masterminded an insurrection during a brief declaration of martial law.</li>
<li>A stand-off on January 3 prevented the execution of the arrest warrant due to a human chain formed by presidential guards.</li>
<li>Critics have expressed frustration over delays in executing the warrant, which is set to expire soon.</li>
<li>The CIO has requested police involvement, as they are unable to prosecute the president themselves.</li>
<li>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting South Korea amid the ongoing political turmoil.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are reviewing the law internally,” a police official stated following the request from the CIO.</blockquote>
<p>The situation reflects significant political tensions within South Korea as the investigation unfolds.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a notable shift in India’s foreign policy, the country has decided to resume operations at its embassy in Pyongyang after a hiatus of more than three years, reflecting a growing interest in stabilizing diplomatic relations with North Korea.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India's Act East policy involves strengthening ties with Southeast Asian nations while managing relationships on the Korean peninsula.</li>
  <li>The Indian embassy in Pyongyang was closed in July 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with diplomatic staff returning to New Delhi.</li>
  <li>Recently, India dispatched a team to North Korea to resume operations, highlighting its strategic importance in the region.</li>
  <li>North Korea's growing nuclear capabilities and alliances with Russia, China, and Iran raise concerns for India, necessitating a diplomatic presence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Reopening the embassy in Pyongyang is seen as the first step to reestablishing a channel of communication.”</blockquote>
<p>This development underscores India's intent to engage more actively in Northeast Asian geopolitics and counterbalance growing ties between North Korea and other regional powers.</p>]]></description>

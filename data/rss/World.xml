            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Donald Trump Threatens to Reclaim Control Over Panama Canal Due to 'Ridiculous Fees'</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Dec 23, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/23/550x309/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-17_1734914705686_1734914745401.jpg" alt="US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during Turning Point's annual AmericaFest 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona.(AFP)" title="US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during Turning Point's annual AmericaFest 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona.(AFP)">
<figcaption>US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during Turning Point's annual AmericaFest 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent rally, US President-elect Donald Trump voiced intentions of reclaiming control over the Panama Canal, citing high fees that shippers are charged as “ridiculous.” He lamented the decision to cede control of the canal to Panama in 1999, claiming it was a foolish move.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump stated that the United States was being "ripped off" regarding canal fees.</li>
  <li>He emphasized that if the legal principles behind the canal's cession are not respected, he will demand its return to the United States.</li>
  <li>Panama’s President, Jose Raul Mulino, defended the country's sovereignty over the canal, asserting that fees are determined by expert assessments.</li>
  <li>The canal's reduced operating capacity due to droughts in Central America has led to increased fees, which are expected to rise further in the upcoming year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The tariffs are not set on a whim.” - President Jose Raul Mulino</blockquote>
<p>This exchange highlights ongoing tensions over the Panama Canal and its crucial economic role for Panama, generating significant government revenue.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date: </strong>22 December 2024, <strong>Source: </strong>IST</p>
<p>The Chinese military has condemned a Pentagon report claiming that corruption is hindering the modernization of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), arguing that the report was misleading and exaggerated China’s military threat.</p>
<ul>
  <li>China's Defense Ministry labeled the Pentagon's report as a "desperate slander" and accused the U.S. of fabricating false narratives.</li>
  <li>Defense spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang argued against the report, stating that it misinterprets China's defense strategies and interferes in domestic affairs.</li>
  <li>Zhang claimed the U.S. uses such reports to justify its military developments.</li>
  <li>The Pentagon's report indicates a new wave of corruption investigations within PLA could affect modernization goals for 2027.</li>
  <li>At least 15 high-ranking military officials were removed in corruption investigations from mid-2023.</li>
  <li>The comprehensive report elaborated on various issues regarding China's military capabilities and modernization efforts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The 'war-addicted' United States has become the biggest destroyer of international order and the greatest threat to global security. - Zhang Xiaogang</blockquote>
<p>China hopes for a more positive relationship with the U.S. regarding military cooperation and mutual trust.</p>]]></description>

<p>The festive spirit of Christmas was shattered by a horrifying murder-suicide carried out by Aziz Yazdanpanah, a 56-year-old Iranian-born man who dressed up as Santa Claus. In Grapevine, Texas, known as the Christmas Capital of Texas, Aziz killed his estranged wife, their two teenage children, his wife’s sister, her husband, and their niece during a family Christmas gathering.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aziz arrived at the house dressed as Santa, with his niece texting her boyfriend about his unexpected presence.</li>
<li>Aziz killed six family members before calling 911 and confessing to the murders. He then took his own life.</li>
<li>The motive behind the killings is believed to be Aziz's marital and financial troubles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>In a chilling 911 call, Aziz said, "I am shooting people."</blockquote>
<p>This tragic event remains the deadliest crime in the history of Grapevine.</p>]]></description>

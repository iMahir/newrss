<p>In a clear stance against President-elect Donald Trump's aggressive rhetoric, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that a US takeover of Greenland is not a viable option.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blinken criticized Trump's statement about acquiring Greenland, emphasizing that it's not going to happen.</li>
  <li>Trump mentioned he would consider military action for economic security, including seizing Greenland.</li>
  <li>Blinken highlighted Biden's administration's focus on strengthening alliances rather than alienating them.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest that Biden's team is preparing the incoming administration for global engagement.</li>
  <li>Blinken alluded to diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and Ukraine that set a positive groundwork for the future.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The idea expressed about Greenland is obviously not a good one, but maybe more important: it’s obviously one that’s not going to happen.” - Antony Blinken</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Blinken's remarks highlight a shift towards collaborative foreign policy, reinforcing the commitment to international alliances under the Biden administration.</p>]]></description>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump is requesting the Supreme Court to intervene and cancel the sentencing scheduled for January 10, 2025, in his hush money case, after New York courts refused to postpone it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump's lawyers have filed an appeal, citing potential harm to the Presidency.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court has requested a response from New York prosecutors.</li>
<li>Judge Juan M. Merchan indicated there would be no jail time, fines, or probation for Trump.</li>
<li>Trump’s legal team argues for presidential immunity from criminal prosecution.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government.”</blockquote>

<figcaption>Elon Musk, a Donald Trump confidant, has in the past endorsed his idea of Canada merging with the US.(Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>Tech billionaire and Tesla boss Elon Musk took a jab at outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after Trudeau rejected the Canada-US merger proposed by US President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Musk targeted Trudeau on social media after Trudeau dismissed any notion of a merger, emphasizing Canada's independence.</li>
  <li>Trudeau stated, "There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States," highlighting the beneficial partnership between the two nations.</li>
  <li>Musk replied, "Girl, you’re not the governor of Canada anymore, so doesn’t matter what you say," in a sassy retort.</li>
  <li>Trump previously endorsed the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state, suggesting military action was not necessary, but rather economic influence.</li>
  <li>Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre echoed Trudeau's sentiment, affirming Canada’s independence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Canada will never be the 51st state. Period. We are a great and independent country." - Pierre Poilievre</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing dialogue surrounding the proposed merger reflects deeper political tensions and differing perspectives on national identity.</p>]]></description>

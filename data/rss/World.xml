<figcaption>US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during Turning Point's annual AmericaFest 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent rally, US President-elect Donald Trump voiced intentions of reclaiming control over the Panama Canal, citing high fees that shippers are charged as “ridiculous.” He lamented the decision to cede control of the canal to Panama in 1999, claiming it was a foolish move.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump stated that the United States was being "ripped off" regarding canal fees.</li>
  <li>He emphasized that if the legal principles behind the canal's cession are not respected, he will demand its return to the United States.</li>
  <li>Panama’s President, Jose Raul Mulino, defended the country's sovereignty over the canal, asserting that fees are determined by expert assessments.</li>
  <li>The canal's reduced operating capacity due to droughts in Central America has led to increased fees, which are expected to rise further in the upcoming year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The tariffs are not set on a whim.” - President Jose Raul Mulino</blockquote>
<p>This exchange highlights ongoing tensions over the Panama Canal and its crucial economic role for Panama, generating significant government revenue.</p>]]></description>

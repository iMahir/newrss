<p>Donald Trump posted a distorted map suggesting Canada should be part of the US alongside a caption on Truth Social. This has drawn a swift response from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party.</p>

<li>Trump has previously expressed interest in integrating Canada as the 51st state.</li>
<li>He suggested using "economic force" rather than military to pursue this ambition.</li>
<li>Trudeau firmly rejected the notion, stating there's no chance Canada would join the US.</li>
</ul>

<p>Germany has secured approval to purchase five PULS rocket systems from Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems, as part of a shift towards modernizing its military capabilities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The deal is valued at €65 million (US$68 million) and follows a competitive selection against Lockheed Martin's HIMARS system.</li>
  <li>PULS offers versatility in munitions, potentially including GMLRS rockets pending U.S. approval.</li>
  <li>Germany joins other European nations like Serbia and the Netherlands in investing in Israeli PULS systems.</li>
  <li>The PULS system can launch a greater quantity of rockets in less time compared to HIMARS.</li>
  <li>Germany’s acquisition reflects ongoing concerns over security dynamics following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“PULS’s affordability, flexibility, and ability to carry out a wide array of missions have made it an attractive alternative to HIMARS for European countries.” - Sébastien Roblin</blockquote>
<p>This procurement signals a strategic shift for Germany, seeking new artillery solutions amid rising geopolitical tensions in Europe.</p>]]></description>

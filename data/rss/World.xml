<p><strong>Date: January 14, 2024 | Source: EurAsian Times</strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://www.eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1290-x-650-px-2.png" alt="US President-elect Donald Trump" width="1290" height="650">
<figcaption>US President-elect Donald Trump (Image for Representation)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Donald Trump aims to expedite the delivery of arms to Taiwan, reducing a backlog exceeding $20 billion, to enhance Taiwan's combat readiness against increasing Chinese military threats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump plans to clear a backlog of arms sales to Taiwan that currently totals $21 billion.</li>
<li>Mike Waltz, the incoming US national security advisor, emphasized the need for timely delivery of these military supplies.</li>
<li>China's military activities in the Taiwan Strait heighten the urgency of enhancing Taiwan's defense capabilities.</li>
<li>Trump's military strategies include selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, which may face delays due to supply chain issues.</li>
<li>The continuous military support aims to deter potential Chinese aggression towards Taiwan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We have over a $20 billion backlog of things that they paid for and that we need to work hard to free up.” - Mike Waltz</blockquote>
<p>The acceleration of arms deliveries is critical in light of rising tensions in East Asia, showcasing the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Men run past a burning vehicle inside the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital during a protest rally in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</figcaption>
<p>The Constitution Reform Commission in Bangladesh has proposed significant changes including removing the state principles of secularism, socialism, and nationalism from the constitution. This comes in light of the country’s recent political upheaval following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The commission proposes to introduce a bicameral parliament structure.</li>
    <li>Only 'democracy' will remain among the four fundamental principles of state policy.</li>
    <li>A new set of state principles proposed includes equality, human dignity, and social justice.</li>
    <li>Recommendations also include limiting the prime minister's tenure to two terms.</li>
    <li>A National Constitutional Council is suggested to establish checks and balances.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our party supports the need for reforms and has submitted its proposals, but these should be implemented by an elected government, not the interim administration,” said Shama Obaed, BNP organizing secretary.</blockquote>
<p>The proposed changes could reshape the political landscape in Bangladesh and may provoke public response regarding their legality and necessity.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Saudi Mining Minister discusses potential investment in Pakistan.</figcaption>
<p>Saudi Mining Minister Bandar Alkhorayef has announced plans for a significant investment in Pakistan’s mining infrastructure, focusing specifically on the underdeveloped Reko Diq mine in Balochistan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Saudi Development Fund may contribute over $100 million to the investment.</li>
  <li>Manara Minerals, a joint venture between Ma’aden and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, is leading the initiative.</li>
  <li>Alkhorayef emphasized the importance of infrastructure to make the deal economically attractive.</li>
  <li>Executives from Manara previously visited Pakistan to discuss stake acquisition in Reko Diq, known for its vast copper-gold deposits.</li>
  <li>Separately, Alkhorayef discussed Aramco’s lithium extraction project, noting it is promising but not yet commercially viable.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Without that infrastructure, the economics of the deal are not attractive,” said Minister Alkhorayef.</blockquote>
<p>This potential investment highlights Saudi Arabia's efforts to diversify its economy by investing in overseas mining projects and resources essential for technology.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Canadian government has announced revisions to open work permit (OWP) regulations benefiting thousands of Indians. Starting January 21, 2025, only spouses of certain international students and foreign workers will be eligible to apply for OWPs under new criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eligibility will be restricted to spouses of students in master’s programmes of 16 months or more, doctoral programmes, and specific professional programmes.</li>
<li>Foreign workers must be in high-demand jobs within specific sectors such as natural sciences, construction, and healthcare.</li>
<li>Dependent children will no longer qualify for family OWPs, and spouses must have 16 months remaining on their work permits to apply.</li>
<li>There will be a projected decline in the proportion of temporary residents in Canada from 6.5% to 5% by 2026.</li>
<li>The Canadian government has also reduced targets for international student study permits in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The revised OWP eligibility will be restricted to spouses of international students…” - Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)</blockquote>
<p>This change is expected to facilitate employment for spouses while their partners study or work in Canada.</p>]]></description>

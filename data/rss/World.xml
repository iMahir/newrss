<figcaption>Corruption may have disrupted Chinese military modernization goals, Pentagon report says</figcaption>
<p>The Pentagon's annual report highlights that corruption within China's military may hinder its modernization efforts aimed for 2027.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 15 high-ranking officers and defense executives removed between July and December 2023.</li>
<li>The corruption issues may disrupt military projects and leadership stability.</li>
<li>Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered military readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan by 2027.</li>
<li>Compounding issues could affect the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force's critical nuclear mission.</li>
<li>Public sentiment in Taiwan reflects skepticism regarding an imminent invasion, but acknowledges China as a significant threat.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The PLA made uneven progress toward its 2027 capability milestone for modernization, which, if realized, could make the PLA a more credible military tool for the CCP’s Taiwan unification efforts."</blockquote>
<p>Ongoing corruption investigations could have far-reaching implications for China's military capabilities and plans.</p>]]></description>

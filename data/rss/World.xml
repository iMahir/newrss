            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Washington Post Cartoonist Resigns Over Refusal to Publish Anti-Bezos Cartoon</h1>
<p><strong>Date: January 3, 2025<br>Source: The Guardian</strong></p>
<img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14266fd8d33d4533d652d885b1cfb829bd45757/0_0_1725_2100/master/1725.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none" alt="Ann Telnaes’s cartoon rejected by the Washington Post." width="445" height="541.7391304347826" loading="lazy" /><figcaption>Ann Telnaes’s cartoon rejected by the Washington Post. Photograph: Ann Telnaes</figcaption>
<p>The Washington Post’s Pulitzer prize-winning editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, has resigned from her position at the newspaper after its refusal to publish a satirical cartoon depicting the outlet’s owner, Jeff Bezos, kneeling before Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The cartoon, a critique of billionaire tech and media executives’ attempts to curry favor with Trump, was rejected by the Post’s opinions editor, David Shipley, who cited a desire to avoid repetition. Telnaes, however, believes the rejection was due to the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary, raising concerns about censorship and freedom of the press.</p>
<ul>
<li>Telnaes’s resignation comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the Post and Bezos’ decision to block an endorsement of Kamala Harris in the presidential election.</li>
<li>Trump’s victory over Harris in the election has led to conciliatory gestures from tech and media executives, including a dinner between Trump and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and a $15m settlement from ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos to resolve a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press." - Ann Telnaes</blockquote>
<p>Telnaes, who won the Pulitzer for illustrated reporting and commentary in 2001 and is a three-time finalist for the prestigious award, believes the Post’s decision to censor her work sets a dangerous precedent for free press.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>US President-elect Donald Trump(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The congressional joint session to count electoral votes on January 6 is expected to be less eventful than in 2021 when a violent mob interrupted the count. This time, Trump returns to office after winning the 2024 election.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Congress must meet to open sealed certificates from each state's electoral votes.</li>
<li>Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the certification of her own loss, just as Mike Pence did in 2021.</li>
<li>Congress tightened the rules for certification after the events of January 6, 2021.</li>
<li>The revised Electoral Count Act of 2022 clarified the vice president's role and raised the threshold for objections to electoral votes.</li>
<li>Once certified, the president is inaugurated on January 20.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The updated law clarifies that the vice president does not have the power to determine the results on Jan. 6.”</blockquote>
<p>The joint session will formally count the electoral votes, marking the final step in the presidential election process before inauguration.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Elon Musk criticized PM Starmer on social media, accusing him of complicity in a child sex abuse scandal.</li>
  <li>Musk claims Starmer failed to provide justice to victims over the past decade.</li>
  <li>UK health secretary Wes Streeting responded, urging Musk to focus on collaborative efforts to tackle the issue.</li>

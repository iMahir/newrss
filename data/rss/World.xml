<figcaption>From Donald Trump's victory to the COP29 summit, a list of six key factors that contributed to the apparent decline of the global order in 2024.</figcaption>
<p>2024 was a pivotal year that posed severe challenges to the ‘rules-based international order’, raising critical questions about the sustainability of a liberal, democratic world founded on free trade and international cooperation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of a rules-based global order has been destabilized, especially following major global events.</li>
<li>War in the Middle East and Ukraine has shown the limitations of international agreements and support.</li>
<li>Global South's discontent with the leadership of the developed nations has grown significantly.</li>
<li>Streaming of live warfare has changed the public perception of conflicts.</li>
<li>Increased questioning of multilateral institutions amid deepening challenges.</li>
<li>The unified support for Ukraine among Western nations is beginning to erode.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This year was not the first in which the liberal world order was challenged, but the challenges were deeper and more visible in 2024.” - Ashok Sajjanhar</blockquote>
<p>The events of 2024 markedly indicate a year of transformation and critical reassessment of the global order, pushing towards new geopolitical realities.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The US Capitol is pictured ahead of a vote on a revised continuing resolution bill in Washington, DC.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>The US government faces a shutdown as lawmakers are unable to agree on a temporary funding plan amidst a significant debt ceiling crisis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Republican-led House rejected a temporary funding plan backed by President-elect Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>The bill failed with a vote of 235 to 174, reflecting division among Republicans.</li>
  <li>Trump is demanding a provision to raise the debt limit be included in any funding legislation.</li>
  <li>If the debt ceiling is not raised, it could lead to default and severe economic disruption.</li>
  <li>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson faces pressure as he navigates this critical issue.</li>
  <li>Key figures like Representative Chip Roy and Elon Musk have influenced the debate, voicing strong criticisms of proposed plans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To congratulate yourself because it’s shorter in pages but increases the debt by $5 trillion is asinine." - Representative Chip Roy</blockquote>
<p>As the deadline approaches, the nation awaits a resolution to avert a government shutdown and its possible repercussions.</p>]]></description>

<p>A state appeals court has removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others, leaving the future of the prosecution uncertain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The case had been stalled for months while appeals were considered.</li>
<li>The ruling requires the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia to appoint a new prosecutor.</li>
<li>Trump's legal situation appears to be improving amidst ongoing legal challenges.</li>
<li>14 other defendants still face charges related to the case.</li>
<li>Concerns raised over potential conflicts of interest with Willis's romantic relationship with a special prosecutor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The prosecution was encumbered by an appearance of impropriety.” – Judge Scott McAfee</blockquote>
<p>This ruling highlights the ongoing complexities and controversies surrounding the legal proceedings against Trump and his co-defendants as they navigate serious allegations of attempting to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.</p>]]></description>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed readiness to negotiate with Ukraine, including with President Zelenskyy, while emphasizing no preconditions for talks need to be set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Putin asserted that any agreement must involve legitimate Ukrainian authorities.</li>
<li>He reiterated that Russia has become stronger since its invasion of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Putin rejected claims of Russia being in a weak position and asserted the need for Kyiv to make compromises as well.</li>
<li>He mentioned a preference for lasting peace over a temporary truce and pointed to a previous proposal made in Istanbul.</li>
<li>Putin stated he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and expressed confidence in Russia's sovereignty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We have moved back from the edge of the abyss," said Putin, asserting Russia's independent decision-making capabilities.</blockquote>
<p>Despite calls for negotiation, the ongoing conflict continues to severely impact relations between Russia and the West, with extensive casualties and displacement in Ukraine.</p>]]></description>

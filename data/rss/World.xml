<figcaption>Of the 386,000 H-1B visas granted in 2023, 72.3% were awarded to Indians. (Representative/News18 Hindi)</figcaption>
<p>The US administration has announced significant changes to the H-1B visa programme, effective from January 17, aimed at ensuring fairness, transparency, and efficiency in recruiting foreign talent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indians make up the largest group of H-1B visa holders, receiving 72.3% of visas granted in 2023.</li>
<li>Two main objectives for modernizing the programme: clarifying requirements and increasing efficiency.</li>
<li>The definition of specialized work has been revised to require a logical connection between the degree and job responsibilities.</li>
<li>F-1 visa holders’ statuses will now be automatically extended during the H-1B application process.</li>
<li>Non-profit and government research organizations are now exempt from the H-1B cap under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Employers must provide proof of a legitimate specialty job when applying for H-1B visas.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These reforms are designed to streamline the visa approval process and enhance programme flexibility.” - US Citizenship and Immigration Services</blockquote>
<p>With revised rules in place, Indian tech professionals stand to benefit significantly from these changes in the H-1B visa program.</p>

<p>Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, has been married three times, each relationship controversial in its own right. This article delves into the details of these marriages and the public scrutiny surrounding them.</p>
<ul>
<li>His first marriage was to Jemima Goldsmith, a wealthy British socialite.</li>
<li>Khan's second marriage to Reham Khan lasted only a year and was marred by allegations of infidelity and accusations of having illegitimate children.</li>
<li>His third marriage to Bushra Bibi has also drawn criticism, particularly regarding its legality during her Iddat period.</li>
<li>Reham Khan's book raised significant allegations about Khan's personal life and purported responsibilities as a father.</li>
<li>Imran Khan's marriages have significantly influenced his political career, often overshadowing his public image.</li>
<li>Despite controversies, Imran Khan maintains a notable presence in Pakistani politics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"These allegations have tarnished Imran's public image, and he is often seen as a figure consumed by ego and seeking validation."</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Netanyahu confirmed that the ceasefire would start on Sunday, as 33 Israeli hostages would be released in the first phase.</li>
<li>A coalition of the US, Egypt, and Qatar facilitated the agreement, following prolonged negotiations.</li>
<li>Statistics from the ongoing conflict indicate significant civilian casualties, with 46,707 reported deaths in Gaza.</li>

<p>As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office, forecasts suggest the inauguration could be one of the coldest in US history. The event, scheduled for January 20, is expected to occur amidst bitterly cold temperatures and a chance of snow.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ceremony will take place with temperatures well below the seasonal average, potentially dropping into the teens.</li>
<li>Forecasts predict wind chills in the single digits and gusty winds reaching up to 30 mph.</li>
<li>The cold weather may evoke memories of past extreme inaugurations, particularly Ronald Reagan's second in 1985.</li>
<li>Despite the harsh conditions, officials plan to proceed with the inauguration as scheduled.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This will be a very cold day, with wind chill values in the single digits to low teens,” said Brian LaSorsa, meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</blockquote>
<p>Trump's inauguration is set against a backdrop of historic cold, and public preparations are underway for a challenging weather experience during the significant event.</p>]]></description>

<p>Mediators in Doha, Qatar, have agreed on a phased ceasefire deal in Gaza aimed at alleviating tensions and restoring some level of peace.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ceasefire will begin with a 42-day first phase starting Sunday.</li>
  <li>During this period, Hamas is to release 33 hostages.</li>
  <li>Israel will release between 900 and 1,650 Palestinian detainees, including all those detained since October 7, 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>This agreement is a critical step towards de-escalation in the long-standing conflict in the region, although the effectiveness of the ceasefire will depend on compliance from both parties.</p>]]></description>

<p>A Pakistan court sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and his wife Bushra Bibi to 7 years for corruption related to the al-Qadir Trust case, involving losses of 190 million pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The verdict, delivered by Judge Nasir Javed Rana, resulted from a case initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in December 2023.</li>
<li>Khan and Bibi were fined and face additional imprisonment if they fail to pay.</li>
<li>The conviction has raised concerns about the integrity of the judiciary according to Khan's comments.</li>
<li>This ruling adds to Khan's legal troubles since his ouster as PM in 2022, as he faces numerous pending cases.</li>
<li>The political situation remains tense as negotiations are ongoing between the government and Khan’s political party, PTI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today’s verdict has tarnished the reputation of the judiciary...” - Imran Khan</blockquote>
<p>The conviction of Khan and Bibi represents both a legal and a political crisis in Pakistan, further complicating the country's already unstable governance.</p>]]></description>

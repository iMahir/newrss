<p>Controversial MAGA figure Valentina Gomez has sparked widespread outrage after posting a graphic video that simulates the public execution of a migrant. The 25-year-old real estate investor, known for her provocative views, stated that undocumented immigrants who commit violent crimes "deserve to be ended," further fueling the backlash surrounding the disturbing footage.</p>
<ul><li>Gomez shared a video on X demonstrating a dummy being shot in the back of the head with a handgun.</li><li>The video was later restricted by X due to potential violent speech policy but spread widely online.</li><li>Gomez called for similar treatment for pedophiles and criticized Congress for lack of action.</li></ul>
<p>Gomez, a Colombian-born American real estate investor and political activist, gained notoriety for her provocative political campaign, including controversial stunts targeting the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, Gomez secured only 7.4% of the vote in the Republican primary for Missouri Secretary of State.</p>]]></description>

<p>Iran has lifted the ban on popular platforms WhatsApp and Google Play, marking a significant step in reducing internet restrictions enforced by the government.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Iranian government announced the lifting of the ban as the first step in easing internet limitations.</li>
  <li>Tehran's internet controls are among the strictest globally, but many Iranians bypass these using VPNs.</li>
  <li>A majority vote was passed to allow access to these platforms during a meeting led by President Masoud Pezeshkian.</li>
  <li>The lifting of the ban occurs shortly after Iran paused a new stricter law mandating women's hijab.</li>
  <li>The law previously proposed heavier penalties on hijab violations but is now on hold due to its controversial nature.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A positive majority vote has been reached to lift limitations on access to some popular foreign platforms...” - IRNA</blockquote>
<p>The recent developments in Iran suggest a potential thaw in the country's approach to internet freedom and social regulations, though challenges remain in the political landscape.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 24, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Reuters</p>
<p>DAMASCUS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa reached an agreement on Tuesday with former rebel faction chiefs to dissolve all groups and consolidate them under the defence ministry, according to a statement from the new administration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa consolidated former rebel groups under the Defence Ministry.</li>
  <li>Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir announced plans for a restructuring of the ministry.</li>
  <li>Murhaf Abu Qasra, a prominent insurgent leader, appointed as interim defence minister.</li>
  <li>Sharaa aims to prevent clashes between different groups now unified under the ministry.</li>
  <li>Sharaa has assured Western officials that the HTS will not seek revenge against the former regime or suppress religious minorities.</li>
  <li>This development follows the rebels’ seizure of control in Damascus on December 8.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Syria's historic ethnic and religious minorities include Muslim Kurds and Shi'ites, who feared that any future Sunni Islamist rule would jeopardize their way of life.</blockquote>
<p>The new consolidation effort marks a significant step in post-civil war Syria, aiming for stability under a unified command.</p>]]></description>

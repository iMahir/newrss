<figcaption>The victim, was going through a rough patch in her marriage with a millionaire, and the fraudster sent her poems and songs and AI photos posing as Pitt. (Image: X/ @LouisPisano)</figcaption>
<p>A French woman named Anne was duped of over 800,000 euros in a scam where she believed she was in a romantic relationship with Hollywood actor Brad Pitt.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scammer contacted Anne on Instagram, posing as Pitt and used AI-generated content to maintain the illusion.</li>
<li>He convinced her that he needed financial help due to blocked bank accounts amid a divorce from Angelina Jolie.</li>
<li>Anne, who was struggling in her marriage, divorced her husband under the pretense of marrying Pitt.</li>
<li>Ultimately, she transferred approximately 800,000 euros intended for her divorce settlement.</li>
<li>The scam came to light after Anne saw reports of Pitt's relationship with someone else, leading to her hospitalization for severe depression.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“At first, I thought it was fake, but I could not understand what was happening to me.” - Anne</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the pervasive issue of online scams and the dangers of social media deception.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>TikTok is facing potential bans in the US, leading users to explore alternatives.</figcaption>
<p>TikTok’s future in the US is uncertain with potential bans looming, but users are turning to the Xiaohongshu app, also known as Rednote, which offers similar features.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A law signed by former President Joe Biden gives TikTok until January 19, 2025, to sell its US operations or face a ban.</li>
    <li>Rednote is rapidly gaining popularity, ranked top app in the Apple Store and 34th on Google Play Store.</li>
    <li>Rednote, launched in China in 2013, has 300 million monthly active users, combining features of Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Rednote allows users to share videos, photos, and text posts, attracting a young audience in the US.”</blockquote>
<p>The rise of Rednote might be a signal of evolving preferences among users as concerns surrounding TikTok escalate.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Special Counsel Report Condemns Trump’s ‘Criminal Efforts to Retain Power’ in 2020</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 14, 2025 &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> CNN</p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland has released the special counsel Jack Smith's report detailing Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, labeling these actions as criminal attempts to retain power.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The 130-page report outlines extensive evidence of Trump's attempts to subvert election results.</li>
    <li>It highlights Trump's pressure on state officials, the fraudulent elector scheme, and his conduct leading up to the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021.</li>
    <li>Smith asserts that the investigation was a necessary step to uphold the integrity of the electoral process.</li>
    <li>The report refuted Trump's claims of exoneration and reaffirmed the sufficiency of evidence against him.</li>
    <li>Smith stated that while the Constitution restricts prosecuting a sitting president, evidence was sufficient for a conviction during Trump's presidency.</li>
    <li>The special counsel concluded that Trump's actions undermined 130 years of peaceful electoral transitions.</li>
    <li>Despite numerous investigations on January 6 and aftermath, Smith’s office did not bring additional indictments against co-conspirators involved in Trump's case.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The (Justice) Department’s view that the Constitution prohibits Mr. Trump’s indictment while he is in office is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged.”</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the report underscores the significance of holding Trump accountable amid previous claims of misconduct during the election process.</p>]]></description>

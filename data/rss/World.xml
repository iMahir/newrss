<figcaption>Chris Langan, who claims his IQ is between 190 and 210, discussed what happens when a person dies in a podcast. (Sandym10, YouTube/@CTMURadio)</figcaption>
<p>Chris Langan, known for his high IQ, shares his views on death and existence. He believes that death may not be the end, suggesting a continuity into another dimension.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Langan claims that reality is a self-simulation and developed the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU).</li>
  <li>He discusses the concept of death as a transition rather than an end, implying a shift to another dimension.</li>
  <li>According to him, one may forget their previous life after this transition due to being in a state of meditation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Death might be a shift in the ‘syntax’ of existence.” - Chris Langan</blockquote>
<p>Langan posits that understanding death could reshape how humans perceive life after death, emphasizing the importance of not fearing it.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Arakan Army is increasingly becoming a powerful force at the Bangladesh border, raising tensions as it has begun to contest control in southern regions of Bangladesh amid significant political and economic challenges in the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bangladesh is currently facing severe economic challenges and instability.</li>
<li>The Arakan Army, a rebel group from Myanmar, has reportedly advanced into Bangladesh, capturing areas near the border.</li>
<li>The advance is allegedly connected with violent acts against minorities and jihadi groups in the region.</li>
<li>There are claims of collusion between these groups and notorious organizations like Al-Qaeda.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Jihadi and extremist groups are oppressing and committing atrocities against Buddhists and Hindus."</blockquote>
<p>The escalating situation at the Bangladesh border with increased pressure from the Arakan Army requires attention as it could reshape political dynamics in the region.</p>]]></description>

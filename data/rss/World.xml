<p>Pakistan launched airstrikes in Afghanistan's Paktika province, reportedly targeting Taliban hideouts, which resulted in the death of at least 15 people, including women and children. The airstrikes have drawn international condemnation from the Afghan government.</p>
<ul>
<li>The strikes were carried out in a mountainous area along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</li>
<li>The Afghan Defense Ministry condemned the attacks, claiming they were a violation of international law.</li>
<li>This was the second strike on suspected TTP hideouts since March.</li>
<li>Local sources indicate the death toll may rise due to the nature of the attack.</li>
<li>The attacks occurred shortly after a diplomatic visit by Pakistan’s representative to Kabul.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemns this brutal act against all international principles,” - Afghan Defense Ministry</blockquote>
<p>The airstrike situation exacerbates the rising tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan amid growing cross-border militant threats.</p>]]></description>

<p>Indian refiners have halted dealings with U.S.-sanctioned oil tankers and entities but expect a smooth transition for Russian crude supplies due to a two-month wind-down period.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on several Russian oil producers and 183 vessels transporting Russian oil.</li>
  <li>India will allow Russian oil cargoes booked before January 10 to discharge at ports.</li>
  <li>No major disruptions in supplies are anticipated in the next two months.</li>
  <li>India may seek deeper discounts on Russian crude below the $60 price cap.</li>
  <li>The Kremlin warned that U.S. sanctions could destabilize global markets.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We are the third-largest consumer. Russia will find ways to reach us," an Indian government official stated.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while India stops trading with sanctioned entities, it aims to maintain its crude oil supplies through strategic adaptations in the face of U.S. sanctions.</p>]]></description>

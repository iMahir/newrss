<figcaption>Indian embassy in North Korea</figcaption>
</div>
<p>In a notable shift in India’s foreign policy, the country has decided to resume operations at its embassy in Pyongyang after a hiatus of more than three years, reflecting a growing interest in stabilizing diplomatic relations with North Korea.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India's Act East policy involves strengthening ties with Southeast Asian nations while managing relationships on the Korean peninsula.</li>
  <li>The Indian embassy in Pyongyang was closed in July 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with diplomatic staff returning to New Delhi.</li>
  <li>Recently, India dispatched a team to North Korea to resume operations, highlighting its strategic importance in the region.</li>
  <li>North Korea's growing nuclear capabilities and alliances with Russia, China, and Iran raise concerns for India, necessitating a diplomatic presence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Reopening the embassy in Pyongyang is seen as the first step to reestablishing a channel of communication.”</blockquote>
<p>This development underscores India's intent to engage more actively in Northeast Asian geopolitics and counterbalance growing ties between North Korea and other regional powers.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Iranian women wearing hijab walk down a street in the capital Tehran on February 7, 2018.</figcaption>
<p>The Islamic Republic of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council has ceased its enforcement of a controversial hijab law that sought to punish women who failed to don the Islamic dress code, following escalating protests.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The government plans to introduce an amendment to clarify ambiguities of the Hijab and Chastity law.</li>
    <li>The controversial law would have imposed harsh penalties, including fines and prison sentences for non-compliance.</li>
    <li>President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed concerns about the law provoking unnecessary conflicts.</li>
    <li>Human rights organizations condemned the proposed law, labeling it as “draconian” and detrimental to women's rights.</li>
    <li>The suspension of the law is seen as a significant victory for Iranian women's rights activists.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This law will further worsen the status of women and girls.” - Amnesty International</blockquote>
<p>This decision represents a turning point for women's rights in Iran, reflecting the impact of years of protests against mandatory hijab laws.</p>]]></description>

  <figcaption>Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree speaks during a rally in solidarity with the people of Gaza in Sanaa on 13 December 2024 (AFP)</figcaption>
</div>
<p>The Israeli army is reportedly planning to strike Yemen following missile and drone attacks by the Houthi movement, which the Houthis claim are in retaliation for the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Houthis claimed to have hit a military target near Tel Aviv with a ballistic missile.</li>
  <li>Israeli defenses reportedly intercepted the missile before it could enter Israeli airspace.</li>
  <li>The Houthi attacks are said to be part of their efforts to pressure Israel to cease its military actions in Gaza.</li>
  <li>Israeli intelligence associates the escalating Houthi attacks with Iranian influence and orchestrations.</li>
  <li>The Houthis have attacked shipping lanes, causing international concern and strategic military responses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They are trying to promote significant damage to Israeli assets such as the seaports of Ashdod and Haifa, the power plants of the Israel Electric Corporation, and the gas rigs off the coast of Israel,” Kan reported.</blockquote>
<p>This anticipated response from Israel represents a significant escalation in regional tensions and highlights ongoing conflicts rooted in the broader context of Middle Eastern geopolitics.</p>]]></description>

<p>The general prosecutor of Azerbaijan announced that Russia has vowed to identify and punish those responsible for a recent plane crash that resulted in 38 fatalities.</p>
<ul>
<li>The crash involved an Azerbaijan Airlines plane on December 25.</li>
<li>Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, has demanded accountability from Russia.</li>
<li>Russia's investigative committee pledged to take 'intensive measures' to bring guilty parties to justice.</li>
<li>Aliyev alleged that Russian authorities are attempting to cover up the true cause of the crash.</li>
<li>Conflicting reports arose about the cause of the crash involving Russian air defense systems.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done.” - Ilham Aliyev</blockquote>
<p>This event marks a significant diplomatic tension between Azerbaijan and Russia, raising concerns over accountability and the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.</p>]]></description>

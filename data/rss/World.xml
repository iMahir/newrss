<figcaption>New Orleans attack puts spotlight on Islamic State com</figcaption>
<p>A recent attack in New Orleans by a U.S. Army veteran, who identified himself with the Islamic State, has raised concerns about the group's ability to inspire violence even after significant losses in recent years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The attacker rammed a truck into New Year's revelers while flying the Islamic State flag, resulting in 14 fatalities.</li>
    <li>The Islamic State's leadership structure has become more clandestine, but their capacity to inspire lone wolf attacks remains strong.</li>
    <li>Despite the U.S.-led coalition's efforts, the group has continued some major operations and recruiting.</li>
    <li>Geopolitical turmoil, particularly in the Middle East, presents opportunities for the Islamic State’s resurgence.</li>
    <li>The U.N. warns of a potential resurgence of the group alongside concerns about its affiliates, particularly in Afghanistan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"History shows how quickly moments of promise can descend into conflict and violence." - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken</blockquote>
<p>The New Orleans attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by extremist ideologies and highlights the need for continued vigilance in counterterrorism efforts.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>January 2025: Donald Trump's hush money sentencing does not indicate any jail time. (AP)</figcaption>
<p>A judge has set Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money case for January 10, indicating he is unlikely to receive jail time, despite facing conviction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The judge, Juan M. Merchan, will sentence Trump just before he returns to the White House on January 20.</li>
  <li>Trump is set to become the first president to take office while convicted of a felony.</li>
  <li>Merchan dismissed Trump's appeal to overturn the verdict, citing no legal impediment to proceeding with the sentencing.</li>
  <li>The case revolves around payments made to silence allegations from Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Only by bringing finality to this matter will the interests of justice be served.” - Judge Juan M. Merchan</blockquote>
<p>The ruling is significant as it affects Trump's ability to maneuver politically ahead of his inauguration, raising questions about the broader implications of legal challenges for elected officials.</p>]]></description>

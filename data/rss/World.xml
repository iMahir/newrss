<figcaption>A torn poster shows ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad at the entrance of the notorious security detention centre called Palestine Branch, in Damascus, Syria, Saturday, Dec. 14, 2024.(AP)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the final hours of Bashar al-Assad's rule in Syria, detailing his secretive plans to flee the country amidst collapsing power and escalating rebel control.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assad's departure was planned and executed without informing key aides and family members.</li>
    <li>On the eve of his flight, he assured military chiefs of Russian support while masking the true dire situation.</li>
    <li>He fled to Russia on December 8, 2024, after disguising the flight under radar.</li>
    <li>Significant unrest in Damascus accompanied Assad's departure, with civilians celebrating the fall of his regime.</li>
    <li>There were no military rescue efforts from Russia or Iran despite previous support during the civil war.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Assad didn't even make a last stand. He didn't even rally his own troops," said Nadim Houri, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bashar al-Assad's flight marked the end of his 24-year rule and the demise of his family's long-standing power, leaving a pivotal moment in Syria's tumultuous history.]]></description>

<p>The Russian Federation has reportedly developed the Kalinka system, designed to locate and disrupt signals from SpaceX's Starlink, which has played a crucial role for Ukraine in the ongoing conflict.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Kalinka system aims to detect and counter Starlink communications used by Ukrainian forces.</li>
    <li>It is currently undergoing combat tests and can identify unmanned boats and drones.</li>
    <li>The system allows Russian forces to target Starlink-linked assets from a distance of up to 15 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Kalinka can detect both moving and stationary Starlink communication nodes.</li>
    <li>It is part of a broader initiative supported by Russia's United Russia party, involving over 200 defense technology companies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Before the introduction of Kalinka, unmanned boats were tracked visually.” - Andrei Bezrukov, chairman of the board of the Center for Unmanned Systems and Technologies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The development of the Kalinka system highlights ongoing efforts to counter the advantages provided by Starlink technology in warfare, particularly in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and concerns from China regarding Starlink's military utility.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Baba Vanga, the "Nostradamus of the Balkans."</figcaption>
<p>Baba Vanga, a blind Bulgarian mystic often called the "Nostradamus of the Balkans," remains a subject of fascination due to her intriguing prophecies.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Foresees a devastating war between the West and East, potentially leading to Europe's destruction.</li>
    <li>Predicts that Syria's fall will mark the beginning of catastrophic events.</li>
    <li>Claims of alien contact warn of a global crisis or even an apocalypse.</li>
    <li>Anticipates humanity achieving telepathic communication by 2025, influenced by technologies like Elon Musk's brain chip.</li>
    <li>Foresees groundbreaking scientific and medical advances, particularly in nanotechnology, while cautioning against potential misuse.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Baba Vanga's predictions remain both alarming and thought-provoking, drawing constant interest and debate."</blockquote>
<p>Overall, while many claim that Baba Vanga's predictions often come true, others believe they are merely random statements open to broad interpretation.</p>]]></description>

</figure>
<p>The F-22 Raptor, known for its unmatched capabilities as an air superiority fighter, was once considered for transformation into the FB-22 stealth bomber variant, a concept that reflects the changing dynamics of military aviation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1999 Congressional report raised alarms about the aging bomber fleet and obsolescence of non-stealth aircraft.</li>
    <li>The FB-22 was proposed as an interim solution, adapting the F-22 airframe to meet strategic needs.</li>
    <li>Significant modifications included redesigned wings, enlarged weapon bays, and increased fuel capacity.</li>
    <li>The FB-22 aimed to triple the F-22's combat radius from 600 to 1,600 miles.</li>
    <li>The program was ultimately shelved due to budget constraints and shifting priorities, leading to the development of the B-21 Raider.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The FB-22’s proposed capabilities would have positioned it as a unique asset in the Air Force arsenal."
</blockquote>
<p>The cancellation of the FB-22 highlights the complexities of military planning, but its legacy continues to influence future innovations in airpower, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in modern warfare.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
    <li>The National Assembly passed the impeachment motion with a vote of 204-85.</li>
    <li>Yoon’s presidential powers will be suspended pending the Constitutional Court's decision on his impeachment.</li>

    <li>Yoon stated he will “never give up” and called for stability during this “temporary” pause of his presidency.</li>
    <li>The martial law decree drew comparisons to South Korea's authoritarian past from the 1980s.</li>

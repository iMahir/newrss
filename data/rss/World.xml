<figcaption>In a spat over immigration permits that allow highly qualified foreign workers to enter the US, US President-elect Donald Trump has taken sides with his pals Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.(AFP)</figcaption>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has expressed his support for the H-1B visa program amidst a public dispute initiated by Elon Musk, who defended the program against criticism from some of Trump's supporters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trump stated he has always endorsed the H-1B visa program and utilized it for his businesses.</li>
  <li>Elon Musk vowed to go to “war” to protect the program, emphasizing its importance for the tech industry.</li>
  <li>The H-1B visa allows foreign tech workers to temporarily work in the US, with recent applications processed amid political contention.</li>
  <li>Trump's past criticisms of the program contrast with his current stance, which supports attracting international talent.</li>
  <li>Far-right activists have challenged Trump over immigration policy, highlighting conflict within the Republican party.</li>
  <li>The debate is heightened by ongoing discussions about the labor market and the role of immigrant workers in the economy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. It’s a great programme.” - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<p>This issue illustrates the complexities surrounding immigration policy, especially as it relates to the tech sector and the opinions of influential figures like Musk.</p>]]></description>

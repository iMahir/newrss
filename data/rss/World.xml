  <li>The median pay criteria for the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) and Specific Purpose Work Visa (SPWV) have been slashed, allowing for greater flexibility.</li>
  <li>A minimum annual earnings threshold of NZ$55,844 is required for AEWV holders wishing to bring children to New Zealand.</li>
  <li>Visas for skill levels 4 or 5 jobs have been extended from two to three years, with options for extensions for current employees.</li>

<figcaption>OpIndia Staff</figcaption>
<p>Amid growing outrage over the prevalence of grooming gangs in the UK, a controversial tweet by journalist Sulaiman Ahmed has sparked widespread condemnation for his justification of sexual acts with minors.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A two-year-old tweet by Sulaiman Ahmed attempted to deflect attention from Pakistani grooming gangs to white individuals.</li>
    <li>Ahmed claimed underage victims ‘consented’ to sexual acts, misleadingly framing statutory rape claims.</li>
    <li>Public backlash included criticisms from netizens and political commentators condemning Ahmed's views as dangerous and harmful.</li>
    <li>Ahmed has a history of defending controversial positions related to Pakistan and Islam.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Social workers said CONSENT was given by these women. When CONSENT is given there is no rape and there CANNOT be any grooming…” — Sulaiman Ahmed</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing discourse reveals significant tensions in how sexual violence is perceived and discussed in the context of ethnicity and religion within the UK.</p>]]></description>

<p>As everyone is busy chasing resolutions for the new year, Christians in Russia are getting into the Christmas spirit as they are preparing to break their 40-day fast with a giant feast joined by friends and family. About 12% of Christians across the globe celebrate Christmas on January 7 due to their adherence to the Julian Calendar.</p>
<h4>Key Points:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Julian Calendar, created by Julius Caesar, is about 13 days behind the Gregorian Calendar used by most Christians today.</li>
<li>Orthodox Christians who follow the Julian Calendar celebrate Christmas on January 7 as a result of this difference.</li>
<li>Traditions include a 40-day fast and a festive meal on Christmas Eve featuring 12 traditional dishes representing Christ’s apostles.</li>
<li>In 2023, Ukraine changed its Christmas date from January 7 to December 25 to assert its own cultural identity.</li>
<li>The Ukrainian government has also banned the Ukrainian Orthodox Church linked to Moscow amidst ongoing tensions.</li>
<li>Over time, Russia may also have to change its Christmas date as the difference between the two calendars continues to grow.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notable Quotes or Statistics:</h4>
<blockquote>“Ukrainians wanted to live their own life with their own traditions and holidays.”</blockquote>

<p>Ann Telnaes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, resigned from the Washington Post after her cartoon criticizing tech leaders, including Jeff Bezos, was rejected. The cartoon satirized their flattery towards President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Telnaes submitted a cartoon aimed at notable tech moguls which was ultimately pulled from publication.</li>
  <li>The cartoon humorously depicted Bezos and others kneeling before a statue of Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>Telnaes expressed frustration over being unable to address critical issues through her artwork.</li>
  <li>The incident follows previous controversies regarding editorial decisions at the Washington Post.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press.” - Ann Telnaes</blockquote>
<p>The resignation raises concerns about editorial censorship and creative freedom in journalism.</p>]]></description>

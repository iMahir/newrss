<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The origin of Iran's nuclear technology has been a topic of speculation, with many pointing fingers at Pakistan, China, and Russia. However, a recent article reveals a surprising source.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The US and France played significant roles in Iran's nuclear program.</li>
  <li>Iran's nuclear program began in the 1950s with US support.</li>
  <li>France and Germany also contributed to Iran's nuclear infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The US provided Iran with nuclear technology, fuel, equipment, and training through its 'Atoms for Peace' program." - India.com</blockquote>

<p>Controversial MAGA figure Valentina Gomez has sparked widespread outrage after posting a graphic video that simulates the public execution of a migrant. The 25-year-old real estate investor, known for her provocative views, stated that undocumented immigrants who commit violent crimes "deserve to be ended," further fueling the backlash surrounding the disturbing footage.</p>
<ul><li>Gomez shared a video on X demonstrating a dummy being shot in the back of the head with a handgun.</li><li>The video was later restricted by X due to potential violent speech policy but spread widely online.</li><li>Gomez called for similar treatment for pedophiles and criticized Congress for lack of action.</li></ul>
<p>Gomez, a Colombian-born American real estate investor and political activist, gained notoriety for her provocative political campaign, including controversial stunts targeting the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, Gomez secured only 7.4% of the vote in the Republican primary for Missouri Secretary of State.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.(Reuters file)</figcaption>
<p>Iran has lifted the ban on popular platforms WhatsApp and Google Play, marking a significant step in reducing internet restrictions enforced by the government.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Iranian government announced the lifting of the ban as the first step in easing internet limitations.</li>
  <li>Tehran's internet controls are among the strictest globally, but many Iranians bypass these using VPNs.</li>
  <li>A majority vote was passed to allow access to these platforms during a meeting led by President Masoud Pezeshkian.</li>
  <li>The lifting of the ban occurs shortly after Iran paused a new stricter law mandating women's hijab.</li>
  <li>The law previously proposed heavier penalties on hijab violations but is now on hold due to its controversial nature.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A positive majority vote has been reached to lift limitations on access to some popular foreign platforms...” - IRNA</blockquote>
<p>The recent developments in Iran suggest a potential thaw in the country's approach to internet freedom and social regulations, though challenges remain in the political landscape.</p>]]></description>

<p>DAMASCUS, Syria – Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has announced plans to dissolve all armed rebel factions and consolidate them under the defense ministry, aiming to eliminate weapons outside of state control.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharaa's consolidation agreement excludes representatives from Kurdish-led forces.</li>
<li>Former rebel factions will be utilized to restructure the defense ministry.</li>
<li>Sharaa aims to prevent clashes between various armed groups.</li>
<li>Specific emphasis on maintaining state control over weapons throughout Syria.</li>
<li>The US is reportedly encouraging Israel to establish ties with the new leadership.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We will absolutely not allow there to be weapons in the country outside state control.” – Ahmed al-Sharaa</blockquote>
<p>This new direction follows the recent fall of the Assad regime after over 13 years of civil war, signaling a potential shift in Syria's political landscape.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 24, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Reuters</p>
<p>DAMASCUS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa reached an agreement on Tuesday with former rebel faction chiefs to dissolve all groups and consolidate them under the defence ministry, according to a statement from the new administration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa consolidated former rebel groups under the Defence Ministry.</li>
  <li>Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir announced plans for a restructuring of the ministry.</li>
  <li>Murhaf Abu Qasra, a prominent insurgent leader, appointed as interim defence minister.</li>
  <li>Sharaa aims to prevent clashes between different groups now unified under the ministry.</li>
  <li>Sharaa has assured Western officials that the HTS will not seek revenge against the former regime or suppress religious minorities.</li>
  <li>This development follows the rebels’ seizure of control in Damascus on December 8.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Syria's historic ethnic and religious minorities include Muslim Kurds and Shi'ites, who feared that any future Sunni Islamist rule would jeopardize their way of life.</blockquote>
<p>The new consolidation effort marks a significant step in post-civil war Syria, aiming for stability under a unified command.</p>]]></description>

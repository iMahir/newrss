            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Elon Musk emerges as power player amid US government shutdown crisis</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> December 21, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>

<figcaption>Elon Musk's influence is now being felt far beyond the business world.(REUTERS)</figcaption>
<p>In the midst of the US shutdown crisis, Elon Musk emerged as a significant influencer, wielding considerable power alongside President-elect Donald Trump. The world's richest person played a key role as the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives passed legislation on Friday that would avert a midnight government shutdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The House passed a bipartisan bill by a vote of 366-34 to avoid a government shutdown.</li>
<li>Trump and Musk actively opposed a prior bipartisan funding plan due to controversial provisions.</li>
<li>Musk used social media to influence public opinion and shape policy discussions around the funding bill.</li>
<li>The final package stripped many controversial provisions and would fund the government through March.</li>
<li>Musk's role suggests increasing influence in Washington, particularly as head of the Department of Government Efficiency in Trump's administration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces," Musk wrote on X, signaling his approval of the revised bill.</blockquote>
<p>The government shutdown crisis was narrowly averted, but the power struggle between the White House, Congress, and Musk's influence continues.</p>]]></description>

<p>A Saudi national has been arrested for a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg that left at least two dead and over 60 injured. The event occurred during busy shopping hours, and early evidence indicates it was a deliberate act.</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker drove into a crowded Christmas market, killing two people, including a toddler, and injuring at least 68 others.</li>
<li>The incident occurred around 7 PM and was witnessed by many holiday shoppers.</li>
<li>Emergency responders were quick to arrive on the scene, and the driver was arrested shortly after.</li>
<li>The suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian man who has lived in Germany since 2006.</li>
<li>He possessed a permanent residence permit and has been practicing medicine locally.</li>
<li>Authorities stress there is no further threat to the public as the suspect appears to have acted alone.</li>
<li>The motive for the attack is still under investigation, with no known links to extremist ideologies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know, there is no further danger to the city,” - Reiner Haseloff, Governor of Saxony-Anhalt.</blockquote>
<p>The attack resonates with a similar incident in Berlin in 2016 where a truck plowed into a market, resulting in multiple fatalities.</p>]]></description>

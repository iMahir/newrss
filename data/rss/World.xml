<p>A devastating wildfire has struck the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, causing significant loss of life and property, while prompting critiques regarding California's substantial economy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wildfire has resulted in estimated losses between $52 billion and $57 billion.</li>
  <li>At least five lives have been lost and over 1,000 structures have been destroyed.</li>
  <li>Rajeev Chandrasekhar commented on the situation referencing California's economy as a $4.8 trillion powerhouse.</li>
  <li>The fires are fueled by hurricane-force winds, complicating firefighting efforts.</li>
  <li>Historical context shows that if damages continue to escalate, this could rival the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is California - a USD 4.8 trillion economic powerhouse state, in the world’s biggest economy USA." - Rajeev Chandrasekhar</blockquote>
<p>The wildfires have not only caused immediate destruction but could have lasting consequences on the health and economy of the region, raising concerns about air quality and the tourism industry.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits increase annually based on inflation rates. This year, seniors can expect a rise in their CPP payments due to high inflation rates that have impact on living costs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The CPP payments are set to increase due to inflation adjustments in January 2025.</li>
  <li>Estimates suggest a 3% rise in monthly payments.</li>
  <li>All recipients over 60, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased contributors will benefit from this increase.</li>
  <li>The CPP contribution rate has seen increases aimed at enhancing benefits over time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The aim of the CPP enhancement program is to increase benefits from 25% to 33% of working-age earnings.”</blockquote>
<p>This increment will ensure that CPP payments keep pace with the cost of living, providing support for elderly Canadians as inflation continues to be a concern.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Los Angeles wildfire is potentially one of the most expensive natural disasters in US history, with damages estimated between $52 billion and $57 billion.

<ul>
  <li>The wildfire has a potential cost of up to $57 billion, making it one of the costliest disasters.</li>
  <li>It threatens high-value areas around Santa Monica and Malibu.</li>
  <li>At least five fatalities and over 1,000 structures have been destroyed.</li>
  <li>The wildfires are likely to have long-term health effects and impact the tourism sector.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is already one of the worst wildfires in California history,” said Jonathan Porter, AccuWeather’s chief meteorologist.</blockquote>

<figcaption>The incident took place at Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport.(X/@AlinejadMasih)</figcaption>
<p>A viral video from Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport captures a woman snatching a cleric’s turban and wearing it as a scarf during a confrontation, symbolizing a powerful act of defiance against Iran's strict hijab laws.</p>
<ul>
<li>The incident escalated when the cleric demanded the woman wear a hijab.</li>
<li>In the video, the woman questions the cleric's honor before searching for her husband.</li>
<li>The event is part of a larger movement of civil disobedience in Iran against mandatory hijab laws, following the death of Mahsa Amini.</li>
<li>The Iranian International reported mixed reactions, with some supporting the woman's boldness and others labeling her actions as stemming from psychological issues.</li>
<li>Over 30,000 women faced legal consequences for hijab non-compliance in December, indicating intensified enforcement of the law.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We’re witnessing something quite unprecedented: Women leading the charge against an immoral, illegitimate Islamic regime.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the ongoing rebellion against oppressive dress codes in Iran and the increasing resolve of women to resist such mandates.</p>]]></description>

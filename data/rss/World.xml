<p>Recent military confrontations along the Durand Line have resulted in significant casualties for both Afghan and Pakistani forces. Following airstrikes by Pakistan in Afghanistan, Afghan forces launched counterstrikes across the border, leading to escalating tensions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>19 Pakistani soldiers were reported killed as Afghan forces crossed the contested Durand Line.</li>
  <li>The Afghan attacks were in retaliation for previous Pakistani airstrikes that killed 46 Afghan civilians, predominantly women and children.</li>
  <li>Afghan Defense Minister claims that the operations targeted areas used to launch attacks on Afghanistan.</li>
  <li>Both nations have acknowledged ongoing clashes and casualties on their sides, indicating a significant rise in border tensions.</li>

<p>The escalating situation illustrates the persistent instability and the historical complexities surrounding the Durand Line, which has never been officially recognized by Afghanistan. The conflict reflects broader geopolitical dynamics in South Asia.</p>]]></description>

<li>Mulino asserted the sovereignty of Panama, countering Trump’s threats to seize control of the canal.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Ukraine halts transit of Russian gas to Europe after a prewar deal expired</h1>
<p><strong>Published on: January 01, 2025, by The Hindu</strong></p>

<figcaption>German Galushchenko, the Energy Minister of Ukraine, confirmed the decision on social media.</figcaption>
<p>Ukraine has halted the flow of Russian gas supplies to European customers after a prewar transit deal expired, citing national security concerns. This decision follows nearly three years of conflict as Russia continues its invasion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The energy minister, German Galushchenko, announced the stoppage “in the interest of national security.”</li>
<li>Russia’s Gazprom claims it lacks the ability to supply gas due to Ukraine's refusal to extend the transit deal.</li>
<li>The cease in gas transit could lead to significant financial losses for Russia as Europe aims to phase out Russian gas.</li>
<li>Prior to the war, Russia supplied approximately 40% of the EU's pipeline natural gas.</li>
<li>Ukraine's move aligns with Europe’s strategy to eliminate reliance on Russian gas by 2027.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses.” - German Galushchenko</blockquote>
<p>As a result of the ongoing conflict, Europe has begun diversifying its gas suppliers, significantly reducing dependence on Russian energy.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Pakistan's Deadliest Year: A Surge in Militant Attacks in 2024</h1>
<p><strong>Published on: 2024-12-31<br>Source: <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/pakistan-sees-surge-in-deadly-attacks-in-2024/a-71176292">DW</a></strong></p>
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Image of Pakistan" width="300" height="200"><figcaption>Image caption: Pakistan, 2024</figcaption>
<p>Pakistan suffered an alarming surge in militant attacks in 2024, an annual report showed on Tuesday. The Islamabad-based research group, Center for Research and Security Studies, disclosed that 2024 was the deadliest year for Pakistani security services in nine years, with a 40% increase in militant attacks compared to the previous year. A total of 905 incidents resulted in 1,177 deaths and 1,292 injuries, including 444 Islamist terrorist attacks that killed 685 soldiers and police officers and 927 civilians. The surge in violence was attributed to Islamist militants operating from across the border with Afghanistan.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed the highest number of attacks, seeking to implement Islamic Sharia law in the country.</li>
  <li>The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) insurgent group was responsible for the second-highest number of attacks, seeking independence from the federal government.</li>
  <li>The surge in attacks resulted in an average of nearly seven lives lost daily.</li>
  <li>The cumulative losses of civilians and security personnel accounted for over 63% of the total recorded this year.</li>
  <li>The frequency and intensity of BLA attacks have significantly evolved in terms of operational strategy and capabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>On Tuesday, militants mounted assaults against a security post, a government office, and a police van in the country's restive northwest, killing a policeman and two others, including a child.</p>
<blockquote>"On average, nearly seven lives were lost daily," the report said, also taking into account the number of dead insurgents.</blockquote>
<p>The Pakistani Taliban is suspected to be behind these recent attacks. The surge in violence has raised concerns about the country's security and stability.</p>]]></description>

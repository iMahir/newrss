He added that the manifesto would outline how the 1972 Constitution had harmed the people of Bangladesh and provide a framework for its replacement.</p><h2>Critics Oppose the Proposal</h2><p>People who oppose the proposal view it as an insult to the historic importance of the 1972 Constitution which was drafted by representatives just a year after the neighbouring country gained its independence.</p><h2>BNP Strongly Opposed The Proposal</h2><p>Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) strongly condemned the proposal. Senior BNP leader Mirza Abbas has termed the idea of ‘burying’ the Constitution as fascist. He suggested that if there is an issue in the document it should be addressed through amendments.</p><p>As per a spokesperson for the interim government, the manifesto is not linked to the government and is considered a private initiative.</p><p>As per local leaders of the country, this issue could intensify political polarisation in Bangladesh. They warned that if the movement gains traction, it could dramatically reshape the country’s political landscape, which is already fraught with challenges.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1> Taliban Bans Windows Overlooking Women's Spaces: 'Can Lead To Obscene...'</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> Last Updated: December 30, 2024, 13:59 IST. Source: News18, via AFP.</p>
<figure><img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/07/1627283897_news18_logo-1200x800.jpg?impolicy=website&width=360&height=270" alt="Taliban security personnel | File image/AFP" title="Taliban security personnel | File image/AFP"><figcaption>Taliban security personnel | File image/AFP</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a recent decree, the Taliban's supreme leader has ordered the ban on construction of windows in residential buildings that overlook areas used by Afghan women, stating that existing ones should be blocked. This is the latest in a series of restrictions imposed by the Taliban since their return to power in August 2021, aimed at further secluding women from public spaces.</p>
<ul><li>The new order states that new buildings should not have windows through which it is possible to see into 'the courtyard, kitchen, neighbour’s well and other places usually used by women'.</li><li>Existing windows that provide such views should be blocked, with owners encouraged to build walls or obstruct the view.</li><li>Municipal authorities and other relevant departments will have to monitor construction sites to ensure compliance with this new rule.</li></ul>
<blockquote>'Seeing women working in kitchens, in courtyards or collecting water from wells can lead to obscene acts,' according to the decree.</blockquote>
<p>This decree is part of a broader trend of the Taliban progressively erasing women from public spaces, which the United Nations has condemned as 'gender apartheid'.</p>]]></description>

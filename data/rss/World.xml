<li>Palestinian officials report that some sticking points in ceasefire negotiations have been resolved.</li>
<li>The identities of Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for hostages are still under negotiation.</li>
<li>Israeli officials express that they are closer to an agreement than in previous months, indicating potential stages to the ceasefire.</li>
<li>The conflict, which escalated on October 7, 2023, has resulted in significant casualties and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</li>
<li>The UN has raised alarms about impending famine conditions in Gaza as humanitarian aid efforts are hindered.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This ceasefire can last six months or it can last 10 years, it depends on the dynamics that will form on the ground.” - Amichai Chikli, Israeli diaspora minister</blockquote>
<p>While some progress has been made, the resolution remains heavily contingent on broader political dynamics and the future governance of Gaza.</p>]]></description>

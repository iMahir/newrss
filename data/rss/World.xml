<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> December 25, 2024 - <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/">Kyiv Independent</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Christmas Day 2024 witnessed a series of deadly events around the world, including missile strikes, a plane crash, and air attacks, turning the usually joyous occasion into a somber one.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Russia launched a massive aerial strike on Ukraine, targeting cities with deadly missiles and drones, causing civilian casualties and disrupting energy infrastructure.</li>
  <li>An Embraer airliner carrying 62 passengers crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, with only 32 survivors, likely due to strong GPS jamming.</li>
  <li>Pakistani air strikes in Afghanistan resulted in scores of civilian casualties, including women and children.</li>
  <li>The deadly incidents reignited memories of the Christmas bombings during the Vietnam War in 1972, which killed over 1,600 people in North Vietnam.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Every Russian massive strike takes time to prepare. It is never a spontaneous decision. It is a conscious choice not only of targets but also of time and date. - Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These tragic events underscore the ongoing global conflicts and safety concerns in various parts of the world.</p>]]></description>

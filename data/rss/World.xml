            <description><![CDATA[<h1>European Markets Decline; Novo Nordisk Shares Drop After Drug Trial Results</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 20, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> CNBC</p>
<p>The European markets saw significant declines as investors reacted to political instability in the U.S. and monetary policy shifts across Europe. Novo Nordisk's stock suffered a major drop following disappointing results from a key drug trial.</p>
<ul>
  <li>European markets were overall down, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling by 1.7%.</li>
  <li>Political turmoil in the U.S. contributed to market apprehension, with a partial government shutdown imminent due to legislative failures.</li>
  <li>Novo Nordisk experienced its largest drop, losing over 20% of its value after news from a trial of its CagriSema obesity drug.</li>
  <li>China kept its interest rates steady, reflecting careful economic management amid monetary policy updates from major western economies.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin prices fell by approximately 8%, marking volatility in the cryptocurrency market.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The U.S. president-elect has issued a fresh trade threat to the EU regarding oil and gas purchases.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the combination of global political events and underwhelming corporate performances have resulted in heightened volatility in the European markets.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/World-Yearender.jpg?w=640" alt="World Yearender" width="640" height="360">
<figcaption>From Donald Trump's victory to the COP29 summit, a list of six key factors that contributed to the apparent decline of the global order in 2024.</figcaption>
<p>2024 was a pivotal year that posed severe challenges to the ‘rules-based international order’, raising critical questions about the sustainability of a liberal, democratic world founded on free trade and international cooperation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of a rules-based global order has been destabilized, especially following major global events.</li>
<li>War in the Middle East and Ukraine has shown the limitations of international agreements and support.</li>
<li>Global South's discontent with the leadership of the developed nations has grown significantly.</li>
<li>Streaming of live warfare has changed the public perception of conflicts.</li>
<li>Increased questioning of multilateral institutions amid deepening challenges.</li>
<li>The unified support for Ukraine among Western nations is beginning to erode.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This year was not the first in which the liberal world order was challenged, but the challenges were deeper and more visible in 2024.” - Ashok Sajjanhar</blockquote>
<p>The events of 2024 markedly indicate a year of transformation and critical reassessment of the global order, pushing towards new geopolitical realities.</p>]]></description>

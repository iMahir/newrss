<p>In a startling report, a Bangladesh inquiry commission has implicated former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in enforced disappearances during her time in office, recommending the disbandment of the Rapid Action Battalion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearance reported Sheikh Hasina's involvement in over 1,676 cases, estimating the total could exceed 3,500 cases.</li>
    <li>The report calls for the disbandment of the Rapid Action Battalion due to its role in human rights abuses.</li>
    <li>Four individuals were arrested for attacks on a Hindu community in Sunamganj district, linked to communal tensions.</li>
    <li>The commission noted the involvement of several high-ranking officials, including Hasina's defense adviser.</li>
    <li>A further interim report is expected in March 2025, with a full review taking an additional year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You are doing a really very important job. We are ready to give you all kinds of support that you need.” - Mohammad Yunus, Chief Adviser</blockquote>
<p>This inquiry underscores the systematic issues regarding enforced disappearances in Bangladesh, highlighting serious concerns over human rights under Sheikh Hasina's administration.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>18,000 Indians at risk of being deported from US as Trump vows immigration crackdown</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert date] <strong>Source:</strong> [Insert source]</p>
<p>US President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office soon, and stricter immigration policies are beginning to take effect, placing approximately 18,000 undocumented Indians at risk of deportation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>ICE has released a list of 1.45 million people targeted for deportation, including nearly 18,000 Indians.</li>
    <li>Legalizing status for many undocumented Indians is complicated, often taking two to three years.</li>
    <li>India ranks 13th in the number of undocumented immigrants, with 17,940 individuals, while countries like Honduras and Guatemala have higher numbers.</li>
    <li>India is classified as an “uncooperative” country in the deportation process, alongside several others.</li>
    <li>Trump plans to implement significant deportation efforts, aiming to send thousands of undocumented Indians back to India.</li>
    <li>Over the past three years, about 90,000 Indians were apprehended attempting to enter the US illegally.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “I’ll get them into every country, or we won’t do business with those countries,” Trump stated. 
    “I want them out, and the countries have got to take them back. If they don’t take them back, we won’t do business with those countries, and we will impose substantial tariffs on them.”
</blockquote>
<p>The implementation of Trump's immigration policies is expected to pose serious challenges for undocumented Indians in the US, and may impact diplomatic relations between the US and India.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A torn poster shows ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad at the entrance of the notorious security detention centre called Palestine Branch, in Damascus, Syria, Saturday, Dec. 14, 2024.(AP)</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the final hours of Bashar al-Assad's rule in Syria, detailing his secretive plans to flee the country amidst collapsing power and escalating rebel control.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assad's departure was planned and executed without informing key aides and family members.</li>
    <li>On the eve of his flight, he assured military chiefs of Russian support while masking the true dire situation.</li>
    <li>He fled to Russia on December 8, 2024, after disguising the flight under radar.</li>
    <li>Significant unrest in Damascus accompanied Assad's departure, with civilians celebrating the fall of his regime.</li>
    <li>There were no military rescue efforts from Russia or Iran despite previous support during the civil war.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Assad didn't even make a last stand. He didn't even rally his own troops," said Nadim Houri, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bashar al-Assad's flight marked the end of his 24-year rule and the demise of his family's long-standing power, leaving a pivotal moment in Syria's tumultuous history.]]></description>

<p>The Russian Federation has reportedly developed the Kalinka system, designed to locate and disrupt signals from SpaceX's Starlink, which has played a crucial role for Ukraine in the ongoing conflict.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Kalinka system aims to detect and counter Starlink communications used by Ukrainian forces.</li>
    <li>It is currently undergoing combat tests and can identify unmanned boats and drones.</li>
    <li>The system allows Russian forces to target Starlink-linked assets from a distance of up to 15 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Kalinka can detect both moving and stationary Starlink communication nodes.</li>
    <li>It is part of a broader initiative supported by Russia's United Russia party, involving over 200 defense technology companies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Before the introduction of Kalinka, unmanned boats were tracked visually.” - Andrei Bezrukov, chairman of the board of the Center for Unmanned Systems and Technologies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The development of the Kalinka system highlights ongoing efforts to counter the advantages provided by Starlink technology in warfare, particularly in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and concerns from China regarding Starlink's military utility.</p>]]></description>

<p>The F-22 Raptor, known for its unmatched capabilities as an air superiority fighter, was once considered for transformation into the FB-22 stealth bomber variant, a concept that reflects the changing dynamics of military aviation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1999 Congressional report raised alarms about the aging bomber fleet and obsolescence of non-stealth aircraft.</li>
    <li>The FB-22 was proposed as an interim solution, adapting the F-22 airframe to meet strategic needs.</li>
    <li>Significant modifications included redesigned wings, enlarged weapon bays, and increased fuel capacity.</li>
    <li>The FB-22 aimed to triple the F-22's combat radius from 600 to 1,600 miles.</li>
    <li>The program was ultimately shelved due to budget constraints and shifting priorities, leading to the development of the B-21 Raider.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The FB-22’s proposed capabilities would have positioned it as a unique asset in the Air Force arsenal."
</blockquote>
<p>The cancellation of the FB-22 highlights the complexities of military planning, but its legacy continues to influence future innovations in airpower, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in modern warfare.</p>]]></description>

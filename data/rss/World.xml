<li>Friends honored him by getting tattoos that read “KB 1-1-2025.”</li>
<li>A memorial was held at the Episcopal School chapel, which overflowed with attendees.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Why innocent people have to suffer, especially a guy like Kareem, who was well-liked, not a hurtful bone in his body. He's a very kind, gentle guy.” - Travis Bourgeois, Kareem’s former football coach</blockquote>

<figcaption>Elon Musk's support for dissolving Parliament in the UK has led to backlash from officials, who criticized his understanding of local issues.</figcaption>
<p>Elon Musk has sparked political controversy in the UK by urging King Charles III to dissolve Parliament and call for new elections, following criticisms of the government’s handling of crime.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Musk criticized Labour leader Keir Starmer for his past role in the Crown Prosecution Service related to rape gang investigations.</li>
  <li>Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Labour Minister Andrew Gwynne dismissed Musk's comments as misinformed.</li>
  <li>The debate intensified with Musk suggesting that Minister Jess Phillips “deserves to be in prison” for her stance on public inquiries into grooming.</li>
  <li>Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick praised Musk's initiative in raising the issue, highlighting the establishment’s slow response to justice for victims.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The King must step in. We can't have Keir heading the country, while he was the one heading the Crown Prosecution Service while all this was happening.” - Elon Musk</blockquote>
<p>Musk's involvement has drawn significant backlash, suggesting that he should focus on American issues instead of UK politics.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>India vs Australia LIVE Score, 5th Test Day 2: Prasidh Krishna struck out of nowhere to end a dangerous-looking stand between Beau Webster and Alex Carey</figcaption>
<p>On Day 2 of the 5th Test, Jasprit Bumrah left the field amid an injury scare after bowling just one over post-lunch. Meanwhile, Prasidh Krishna made significant strides for India by taking key wickets, including that of Steve Smith.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia started the day at 9/1, finishing Lunch at 101/5, trailing by 84 runs.</li>
<li>Jasprit Bumrah initially took the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne but left the ground due to injury.</li>
<li>Prasidh Krishna struck crucial blows with the wickets of Smith and Carey during the match.</li>
<li>Beau Webster notched a half-century on debut, showing resilience against India's bowlers.</li>
<li>The match holds significant implications for India's standings in the World Test Championship.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“An injury to Bumrah is arguably the one thing India dread the most, with the pacer being the visitors' only consistent performer throughout the series.”</blockquote>
<p>The stakes for this match are high, as Australia aims to break a decade-long drought without winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, while India seeks victory for a shot at the World Test Championship finals.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>New Orleans attack puts spotlight on Islamic State com</figcaption>
<p>A recent attack in New Orleans by a U.S. Army veteran, who identified himself with the Islamic State, has raised concerns about the group's ability to inspire violence even after significant losses in recent years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The attacker rammed a truck into New Year's revelers while flying the Islamic State flag, resulting in 14 fatalities.</li>
    <li>The Islamic State's leadership structure has become more clandestine, but their capacity to inspire lone wolf attacks remains strong.</li>
    <li>Despite the U.S.-led coalition's efforts, the group has continued some major operations and recruiting.</li>
    <li>Geopolitical turmoil, particularly in the Middle East, presents opportunities for the Islamic State’s resurgence.</li>
    <li>The U.N. warns of a potential resurgence of the group alongside concerns about its affiliates, particularly in Afghanistan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"History shows how quickly moments of promise can descend into conflict and violence." - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken</blockquote>
<p>The New Orleans attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by extremist ideologies and highlights the need for continued vigilance in counterterrorism efforts.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>January 2025: Donald Trump's hush money sentencing does not indicate any jail time. (AP)</figcaption>
<p>A judge has set Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money case for January 10, indicating he is unlikely to receive jail time, despite facing conviction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The judge, Juan M. Merchan, will sentence Trump just before he returns to the White House on January 20.</li>
  <li>Trump is set to become the first president to take office while convicted of a felony.</li>
  <li>Merchan dismissed Trump's appeal to overturn the verdict, citing no legal impediment to proceeding with the sentencing.</li>
  <li>The case revolves around payments made to silence allegations from Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Only by bringing finality to this matter will the interests of justice be served.” - Judge Juan M. Merchan</blockquote>
<p>The ruling is significant as it affects Trump's ability to maneuver politically ahead of his inauguration, raising questions about the broader implications of legal challenges for elected officials.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date & Source: June 20, 2023, from Times of India</strong></p>
<img src="https://cdn.taboola.com/libtrc/static/thumbnails/3328ab25edc146fd4120d6886baefcdd.jpg" alt="Russia Ukraine Gas Pipeline"><figcaption>Russia's pipeline network</figcaption>
<p>After over three decades, Russia has stopped gas transit through Ukraine. This decision, effective from June 20, 2023, comes amidst political tensions and Russia's increasing use of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Russia cites maintenance work on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as the reason for the halt.</li>
  <li>The move could disrupt European gas supplies, as Ukraine is a major transit route for Russian gas to Europe.</li>
  <li>The Ukrainian and European gas markets have been preparing for such a scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ukraine's state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, has already started preparations to cover gas supplies to customers, including using underground gas storage facilities.</p>

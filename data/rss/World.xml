            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Special Counsel Report Condemns Trump’s ‘Criminal Efforts to Retain Power’ in 2020</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 14, 2025 &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> CNN</p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland has released the special counsel Jack Smith's report detailing Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, labeling these actions as criminal attempts to retain power.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The 130-page report outlines extensive evidence of Trump's attempts to subvert election results.</li>
    <li>It highlights Trump's pressure on state officials, the fraudulent elector scheme, and his conduct leading up to the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021.</li>
    <li>Smith asserts that the investigation was a necessary step to uphold the integrity of the electoral process.</li>
    <li>The report refuted Trump's claims of exoneration and reaffirmed the sufficiency of evidence against him.</li>
    <li>Smith stated that while the Constitution restricts prosecuting a sitting president, evidence was sufficient for a conviction during Trump's presidency.</li>
    <li>The special counsel concluded that Trump's actions undermined 130 years of peaceful electoral transitions.</li>
    <li>Despite numerous investigations on January 6 and aftermath, Smith’s office did not bring additional indictments against co-conspirators involved in Trump's case.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The (Justice) Department’s view that the Constitution prohibits Mr. Trump’s indictment while he is in office is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged.”</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the report underscores the significance of holding Trump accountable amid previous claims of misconduct during the election process.</p>]]></description>

<p>A powerful earthquake of magnitude 6.9 struck the Kyushu region of Japan at 9:19 PM local time, prompting tsunami advisories for nearby coastal areas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The quake occurred at a depth of 30 kilometers.</li>
  <li>Tsunami advisories predicted waves of up to one meter high.</li>
  <li>Residents in the Kochi Prefecture were advised to evacuate as a precaution.</li>
  <li>A 20-centimeter-high tsunami impacted Miyazaki city, home to about 400,000 residents.</li>
  <li>The Japan Meteorological Agency is investigating connections to the Nankai Trough.</li>
  <li>Japan's location in the Ring of Fire makes it prone to frequent seismic activities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Basically, when a ‘downgoing’ oceanic plate is shoved into a hotter mantle plate, it heats up, volatile elements mix, and this produces the magma.”</blockquote>
<p>This earthquake highlights the ongoing risks faced by Japan due to its geological position and may lead to increased awareness and preparedness in the region.</p>]]></description>

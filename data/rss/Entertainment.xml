<p>Actor Allu Arjun, who was jailed following an incident at a film premiere, spent a normal night in prison and had rice and vegetable curry for dinner, according to an official from Telangana's prisons department.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun spent a night in Chanchalguda Central Prison after being arrested in the 'Pushpa 2' stampede case.</li>
    <li>The actor was granted a four-week interim bail on the day of his arrest but was not released until the following morning.</li>
    <li>During his time in jail, he did not request any special privileges and was treated as a special prisoner as per court order.</li>
    <li>The delay in his release was due to procedural issues, as inmates are not typically released after 7 PM.</li>
    <li>The incident at the movie premiere resulted in the death of a woman, leading to charges against Arjun and his security team.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“He was quite normal and did not appear depressed. Normally, the dinner time is 5:30 pm. However, late admissions are also served food. He had rice and vegetable curry.”</blockquote>
<p>The situation highlights the challenges faced during high-profile releases and the implications of crowd management at events.]]></description>

<p>Mukesh Khanna, the iconic Shaktimaan actor, turned down an offer from Yash Raj Films to sell the rights of his character, stating he didn't want it to be turned into a 'disco drama'.</p>

    <li>Mukesh Khanna claims he was contacted by Aditya Chopra's team about selling the rights ten years ago.</li>
    <li>He refused the offer and instead presented a counter-offer, indicating his desire to retain control over the character.</li>
    <li>Khanna expresses support for Allu Arjun as a potential Shaktimaan in a reboot but criticizes Ranveer Singh's suitability for the role.</li>
    <li>Shaktimaan originally aired from 1997 to 2005 and remains a beloved figure in Hindi television.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I told them, ‘Tell Aditya, whoever he is, if you want to make it, make it with me’. I didn’t want to give away the rights only for them to make a disco drama. I refused." - Mukesh Khanna</blockquote>
<p>This reflection emphasizes Khanna's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the Shaktimaan character amidst potential commercialization by major film studios.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
    <li>Khanna was never contacted by the show's producers and would have declined anyway due to content concerns.</li>

    <li>He expressed disapproval of a promo where Kapil asked actor Arun Govil a crass question, regarding Lord Ram.</li>
    <li>Khanna commented on the lack of respect in asking inappropriate questions to respected actors.</li>
    <li>He took a dig at Kapil’s comedy style and his cross-dressing antics on the show.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Though people laugh, mujhe koi shalinta nahi dikhti (I don’t see any decency in it)." - Mukesh Khanna</blockquote>
<p>Khanna's critique highlights a significant division between traditional values in comedy and contemporary humor, emphasizing the need for respect in public discourse.</p>]]></description>

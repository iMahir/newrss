<figcaption>Diljit Dosanjh has been performing in India for several weeks now.</figcaption>
<p>In a recent announcement during his Chandigarh concert, singer Diljit Dosanjh revealed that he will not hold concerts in India until the country's concert infrastructure is properly developed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diljit made the announcement during a show in Chandigarh on December 14, 2024.</li>
  <li>He emphasized the lack of infrastructure for live shows, which he sees as a significant source of revenue and employment.</li>
  <li>During the concert, he dedicated his performance to India's FIDE World Champion, Gukesh Dommaraju.</li>
  <li>Prior to the show, an advisory from the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights urged Diljit to avoid alcohol-themed songs.</li>
  <li>His upcoming show in Guwahati on December 29 will conclude his tour in India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Here we don't have infrastructure for live shows. This is a source of big revenue, many people get work and are able to work here...I'll try next time that the stage is at the centre so that you can be around it. Till this happens, I won't do shows in India, that's for sure.”</blockquote>
<p>Until improvements are made, Diljit remains firm on his decision not to perform in India, illustrating the need for better concert facilities to enhance the live music experience.</p>]]></description>

<p>Bigg Boss 8 Telugu has reached its conclusion, with Nikhil Maliyakkal emerging as the winner amidst controversy from fans of runner-up Gautam Krishna.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nikhil Maliyakkal wins Bigg Boss 8 Telugu.</li>
  <li>Gautam Krishna was the runner-up and entered as a wild card contestant.</li>
  <li>Fans accuse the show makers of favoritism towards Nikhil due to his connections with the channel.</li>
  <li>The audience showed a regional preference for Gautam, who is a Telugu native.</li>
  <li>Gautam joined six weeks late, which impacted his competition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Fans are upset over the results, claiming Gautam should have won.”</blockquote>
<p>The fan reaction seems to indicate a deep divide and dissatisfaction with the show’s outcome, raising questions about the fairness of the voting process.</p>]]></description>

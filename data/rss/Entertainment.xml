<p>Salman Khan has upgraded security at his residence due to ongoing threats to his life. His balcony is now protected by bullet proof glass following previous gunfire incidents linked to a local gang.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recent threats from Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang have prompted the installation of bullet proof glass at Salman Khan’s Galaxy Apartments.</li>
  <li>In April 2024, gunshots were reported outside his residence, attributed to the Bishnoi gang.</li>
  <li>The gang has allegedly demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore for Khan’s safety.</li>
  <li>Along with the glass installation, Khan has also acquired a bulletproof SUV and increased armed security.</li>
  <li>Salman Khan is set to release a new film titled Sikandar in Eid 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If the demand isn’t met, he would suffer a fate worse than Baba Siddique," highlighting the severity of the threats faced by Khan.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the recent series of threats and violent incidents has led Salman Khan to significantly strengthen his personal security measures, underscoring the risks associated with his celebrity status.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Game Changer Hindi Box Office Day 1: Won’t Meet The Opening Of Ram Charan’s Bollywood Debut? (Photo Credit – Facebook/YouTube)</figcaption>
<p>The Hindi-dubbed release of the film "Game Changer" may fail to match the box office numbers of Ram Charan’s earlier Bollywood debut, causing concerns for its performance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Game Changer to release nationwide on January 10, 2025.</li>
  <li>The film struggles to generate pre-release buzz, potentially affecting box office earnings.</li>
  <li>Ram Charan's debut collaboration with director Shankar follows a series of delays since its announcement in February 2021.</li>
  <li>Comparative analysis shows the Hindi opening could be as low as 2-3 crores, trailing behind the 3.50 crore opening of Zanjeer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"In a worst-case scenario, it might even struggle to earn what Ram Charan’s Bollywood debut earned at the Indian box office on day 1."</blockquote>
<p>The film's performance is being closely watched as it could impact Ram Charan's standing in the Hindi film market.</p>]]></description>

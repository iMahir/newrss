<p>This year, the Christmas season looks lackluster for Telugu cinema, with many big releases postponed, leaving only smaller films to fill the holiday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent years saw major hits during Christmas like Akhanda and Pushpa: The Rise.</li>
<li>This year, several big-budget movies have been delayed to 2025.</li>
<li>The current lineup includes smaller films that are failing to attract audiences.</li>
<li>Bookings for the Hindi film Baby John are very poor in Telugu states.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This quiet holiday season raises the question of whether any of these films can surprise and entertain viewers.”</blockquote>
<p>As Tollywood faces a quieter Christmas, the industry watches closely to see if any unexpected hits emerge from the smaller releases.</p>]]></description>

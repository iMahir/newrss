(Diljit Dosanjh - X)</figcaption>
<p>Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has drawn criticism from protesting farmers who question his commitment to their cause given his earlier support for the farmers' movement.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diljit described his meeting with Modi as a “fantastic start” to the New Year.</li>
  <li>Farmers expressed disappointment, saying he should have joined their protests instead of meeting with the Prime Minister.</li>
  <li>The meeting raised doubts about his intentions towards the farmers' issues.</li>
  <li>Jagjit Singh Dallewal, a farmer leader, continues a hunger strike demanding legal guarantees for minimum support prices (MSP).</li>
  <li>The farmers' struggle persists until their demands are met.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If Diljit truly cared about farmers, he would have come and joined us in solidarity...”</blockquote>
<p>Diljit's past support for farmers contrasts sharply with his recent actions, prompting a strong backlash from the community he previously championed.</p>]]></description>

<p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's entry into content creation has faced challenges as their initial Netflix projects have not achieved significant viewership, prompting concerns from the streaming service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The couple's Netflix projects, including the documentary Polo, have failed to attract an audience.</li>
  <li>They reportedly received a significant amount of money for these projects, raising expectations.</li>
  <li>Harry's passion for Polo has not resonated with viewers, leading to frustration about the project's reception.</li>
  <li>Despite the initial success of their 2022 documentary, their subsequent work has struggled to gain traction.</li>
  <li>Meghan has announced a new cooking and lifestyle show, set to premiere on January 15, which aims to revitalize their Netflix presence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Fact is, Harry and Meghan were paid an exorbitant amount of money by Netflix and have little to show for it. Whether they admit it or not, the pressure is on for the Sussexes to deliver a hit.”</blockquote>
<p>This latest challenge highlights the pressures faced by Harry and Meghan as they navigate the competitive world of entertainment while trying to regain momentum with their upcoming projects.</p>]]></description>

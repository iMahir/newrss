<p>This year, the Christmas season looks lackluster for Telugu cinema, with many big releases postponed, leaving only smaller films to fill the holiday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent years saw major hits during Christmas like Akhanda and Pushpa: The Rise.</li>
<li>This year, several big-budget movies have been delayed to 2025.</li>
<li>The current lineup includes smaller films that are failing to attract audiences.</li>
<li>Bookings for the Hindi film Baby John are very poor in Telugu states.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This quiet holiday season raises the question of whether any of these films can surprise and entertain viewers.”</blockquote>
<p>As Tollywood faces a quieter Christmas, the industry watches closely to see if any unexpected hits emerge from the smaller releases.</p>]]></description>

<p>Justin Baldoni is facing serious allegations from his co-star Blake Lively, who has filed a lawsuit claiming sexual harassment and manipulation. His legal representation, Bryan Freedman, is defending him while also representing the notorious Menendez Brothers in an ongoing legal matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blake Lively has filed a suit against Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment.</li>
<li>Attorney Bryan Freedman is involved with both Baldoni's case and the Menendez Brothers' legal issues.</li>
<li>Baldoni's crisis management team has connections to Johnny Depp.</li>
<li>The case has drawn considerable media attention and public scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These claims are completely false, outrageous, and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt...” - Bryan Freedman</blockquote>
<p>The allegations made by Lively, which include attempts to damage her reputation, are taken very seriously in Hollywood, especially given the high-profile nature of the parties involved. As both cases unfold, they have been drawing contrasting public opinions.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Still from Theri and Baby John</figcaption>
<p>Varun Dhawan’s upcoming film, <strong>Baby John</strong>, is an official remake of the 2016 Tamil blockbuster <strong>Theri</strong>, featuring Vijay. Directed by Atlee, <strong>Baby John</strong> marks Dhawan's first portrayal of a cop and raises expectations for a captivating narrative as it explores themes of familial bonds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Connections:</strong> The film draws from the emotional core of <strong>Theri</strong>, emphasizing the father-daughter relationship and the protagonist's dual life as a father and a police officer.</li>
<li><strong>Character Dynamics:</strong> The movie updates character relationships, including the love story between the cop and his wife, which has evolved since <strong>Theri</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Casting Choices:</strong> Rajpal Yadav's addition is noted as a change from the original, bringing a fresh dynamic to the supporting roles.</li>
<li><strong>A Deeper Narrative:</strong> While promising more action and drama, the film aims to retain its emotional depth with themes of revenge and justice.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Baby John, summa Therikka vidunga” (Baby John, let the sparks fly).</blockquote>
<p>This film not only aims to resonate with fans of the original but also seeks to establish Varun Dhawan in a new light as he takes on the iconic role of a police officer. Expectations are set high as the film gears up for a big release this Christmas.</p>]]></description>

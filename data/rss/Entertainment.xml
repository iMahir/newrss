<figcaption>Mukesh Khanna reveals why he turned down an offer to sell the rights of Shaktimaan to Yash Raj Fims’ Aditya Chopra.</figcaption>
<p>Mukesh Khanna, the iconic Shaktimaan actor, turned down an offer from Yash Raj Films to sell the rights of his character, stating he didn't want it to be turned into a 'disco drama'.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mukesh Khanna claims he was contacted by Aditya Chopra's team about selling the rights ten years ago.</li>
    <li>He refused the offer and instead presented a counter-offer, indicating his desire to retain control over the character.</li>
    <li>Khanna expresses support for Allu Arjun as a potential Shaktimaan in a reboot but criticizes Ranveer Singh's suitability for the role.</li>
    <li>Shaktimaan originally aired from 1997 to 2005 and remains a beloved figure in Hindi television.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I told them, ‘Tell Aditya, whoever he is, if you want to make it, make it with me’. I didn’t want to give away the rights only for them to make a disco drama. I refused." - Mukesh Khanna</blockquote>
<p>This reflection emphasizes Khanna's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the Shaktimaan character amidst potential commercialization by major film studios.</p>]]></description>

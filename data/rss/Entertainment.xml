<p>It has been 28 days, and Pushpa 2 is still performing exceptionally well at the box office, with estimated earnings of 1208 - 1209 crore! Mounted on a budget of 500 crore, the film has registered a profit of 141.6% at the box office in India.</p>
<h4>Pushpa 2 India Box Office Day 28 Estimates</h4>
<p>On the 28th day, January 1, the fourth Wednesday, Pushpa 2 roared yet again on the New Year holiday with almost a 70% jump from the previous day and brought almost 13 - 13.5 crore collection at the box office, taking the total earnings to more than 1208 crore!</p>
<p>Will Pushpa 3 See The Light Of The Day?</p>
<p>Earlier this year, at the Berlin Film Festival, Allu Arjun has already discussed the idea of Pushpa 3 and turning the film into a franchise.

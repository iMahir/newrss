<p>After a long time, a lead debut pair arrives in the theaters with Aaman Devgan and Rasha Thadani. Azaad has opened at the box office with decent numbers, surpassing many talked about films of 2024!</p>
<h4><strong>Best Debut Since 2024</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Azaad Box Office Day 1 Estimates</strong></h4>
<p>On the opening day, Azaad earned in the range of <strong>1.5 – 1.7 crore</strong>. This number has arrived despite tough competition from Kangana Ranaut’s Emergency and Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2 Reloaded.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azaad:</strong> 1.50 crore* (estimated)</li>
<li><strong>Kill:</strong> 1.35 crore</li>
<li><strong>Ishq Vishk Rebound:</strong> 1.20 crore</li>
<li><strong>Laapataa Ladies:</strong> 1.02 crore</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Will Loveyapa Surpass This Target?</strong></h4>
<p>Aaman Devgan and Rasha Thadani’s opening number will now be the target for the next set of debutants, Junaid Khan and Khushi Kapoor, whose film Loveyapa will arrive on February 7.</p>
<h4><strong>About Azaad</strong></h4>
<p>Helmed by Abhishek Kapoor, the film's synopsis mentions a young stable boy bonding with a spirited horse amidst rebellion in 1920s India.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Box office numbers are based on estimates and not independently verified.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Game Changer: One Week to Match Opening Day Reported Number - TrackTollywood]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Game Changer: Exaggerated Opening Day Collections Spark Controversy</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Date not provided] <strong>Source:</strong> [Source not provided]</p>
<p>The makers of Game Changer are facing backlash after it was revealed that their claimed opening day gross of ₹186 crore was inflated by over ₹100 crore. This discrepancy led to criticisms from trade analysts and audiences as the film's actual first-week gross reached only ₹187 crore.</p>
<img src="[Image URL not provided]" alt="Game Changer Film Poster">
<figcaption>Game Changer Film Poster</figcaption>
<p>The controversy centers around misleading financial claims which have damaged the film's reputation. Acknowledging the negative feedback, the production team chose not to release further box office numbers, allowing attention to return to the film rather than its inflated earnings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Claimed opening day gross was ₹186 crore.</li>
  <li>Actual first-week gross matched opening day at ₹187 crore.</li>
  <li>Criticism from trade analysts regarding misleading box office reporting.</li>
  <li>Producers' decision to stop releasing inflated numbers was appreciated.</li>
  <li>The episode highlights the importance of transparency in box office reporting.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Honesty in box office reporting is crucial to maintaining credibility in an industry that thrives on audience trust and goodwill.”</blockquote>
<p>The nuances of box office collections have significant implications, and Game Changer's team is likely to take away lessons that might guide future film promotions.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>The incident occurred outside Saif Ali Khan's residence, where he was found bleeding from the neck.</li>

  <li>Ram Charan plays Ram Nandan IAS, facing political challenges in Visakhapatnam.</li>
  <li>The bustling and technically advanced song Naanaa Hyraanaa is not included in the initial release due to processing issues.</li>
  <li>The song will be added to the runtime starting January 14.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The song was shot using about Rs 27 Crore and is the first Indian song filmed with an infrared camera.”</blockquote>
<p>Despite initial setbacks, Game Changer has set the stage for an exciting inclusion with its unique song Naanaa Hyraanaa, promising to enhance the cinematic experience moving forward.</p>]]></description>

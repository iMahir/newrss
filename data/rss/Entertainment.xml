<figcaption>Debate continues on who is the hero of the year in Indian cinema.</figcaption>
<p>The debate on who deserves the title of Hero of the Year in Indian cinema in 2024 continues, with Allu Arjun and Prabhas being the main contenders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allu Arjun gained significant attention due to the success of his film <em>Pushpa 2</em> and the controversy surrounding his recent arrest.</li>
<li>A tragic incident at the premiere of <em>Pushpa 2</em> led to a stampede, resulting in the death of a woman.</li>
<li>Prabhas achieved remarkable success with <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em>, grossing around Rs1200 crore worldwide.</li>
<li><em>Pushpa 2</em>, released in December 2024, grossed close to Rs1700 crore, becoming the highest-grossing Hindi film in India.</li>
<li>The police have filed a case regarding the stampede incident, and Chief Minister Revanth Reddy criticized Arjun’s alleged irresponsibility.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Allu Arjun is the Hero of the Year from Tollywood, given the kind of news columns he dominated this year.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the year has seen both Allu Arjun and Prabhas achieve significant milestones, with Allu Arjun's controversies and successes making him the focal point of media attention.</p>]]></description>

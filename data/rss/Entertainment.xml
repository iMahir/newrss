<p>In a candid interview, Arjun Kapoor shares insights from his early acting career, focusing on a short film he made with childhood friend Varun Dhawan, revealing how it affected his opportunities with Karan Johar's Dharma Productions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arjun Kapoor and Varun Dhawan have been childhood friends and acted together early in their careers.</li>
  <li>Arjun discussed a short film where he believed he had a lead role but discovered he was actually cast as the villain.</li>
  <li>He humorously attributes getting ‘less work’ from Dharma Productions to Varun's misleading direction in the film.</li>
  <li>Arjun quoted Varun’s memorable dialogue from the film to highlight its unexpected twist.</li>
  <li>He mentioned the short film was even shown to Karan Johar, which he feels impacted his later career opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Varun basically made a fool of me... I found out after the shoot that I was the villain.”</blockquote>
<p>This light-hearted reflection on their past underscores the bond between the two actors and offers insights into the unpredictability of show business.</p>]]></description>

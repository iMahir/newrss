<p><strong>Published: December 29, 2024 7:32 AM IST by Sanskruti Nemane</strong></p>
<p>Mika Singh, the well-known singer and producer, shared his troubling experience working with actors Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover during the production of his film <em>Dangerous</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mika initially planned to cast a newcomer but decided to include Bipasha when she expressed interest in working with her husband Karan.</li>
<li>Despite staying within budget, the collaboration turned into a nightmare for Mika.</li>
<li>The shooting schedule was expected to be one month but extended to two due to ongoing issues.</li>
<li>Major conflicts arose including demands for separate hotel rooms and reluctance to perform contractual scenes.</li>
<li>Mika advised others to be cautious about producing films given his negative experience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They were a married couple so I booked a single room for them. But, they were like, ‘No, we need our separate rooms.’” - Mika Singh</blockquote>
<p>Ian tougher landscape for smaller producers, Mika vowed to steer clear of film production in the future.</p>]]></description>

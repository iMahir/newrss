            <title><![CDATA[Top Highest Grossing Films in APTS: Allu Arjun starrer Pushpa 2 second beating Baahubali 2 & Kalki - PINKVILLA]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Pushpa 2 Becomes Second Highest Grossing Film in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> Dec 26, 2024 &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> Pinkvilla</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-12/496938107_pushpa-3.jpg" alt="Allu Arjun in Pushpa 2" title="Allu Arjun in Pushpa 2 (image courtesy of Mythri Movie Makers)">
<figcaption>Allu Arjun in Pushpa 2 (image courtesy of Mythri Movie Makers)</figcaption></p>
<p>The Allu Arjun-starrer Pushpa 2 has grossed approximately Rs. 316 crore, making it the second highest-grossing film ever in the Telugu states, just behind RRR.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pushpa 2 grossed Rs. 316 crore in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</li>
  <li>The film ranks behind RRR and ahead of Baahubali 2 in box office performance.</li>
  <li>It is increasing its gross with New Year holidays approaching, likely nearing Rs. 350 crore.</li>
  <li>In Ceded districts, it became the second film to cross Rs. 50 crore.</li>
  <li>Despite high gross, distributor recovery narratives suggest underperformance.</li>
  <li>By the end of its run, Pushpa 2 will have sold over 1.60 crore tickets, second only to RRR.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Despite extraordinary business in Ceded, the profits will only be 20 percent or so, while Nizam will just about breakeven."</blockquote>
<p>In summary, Pushpa 2's success is notable, both in gross earnings and ticket sales, but current narratives regarding its performance may not align with its box office numbers.</p>]]></description>

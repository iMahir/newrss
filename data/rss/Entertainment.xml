<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 20, 2023</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-116486691,thumbsize-48066,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/116486691.jpg" alt="Pushpa 2: Allu Arjun Film REMOVED From PVR Inox Across North India. Here's WHY" title="Pushpa 2: Allu Arjun Film REMOVED From PVR Inox Across North India. Here's WHY">
<figcaption>Pushpa 2: Allu Arjun Film REMOVED From PVR Inox Across North India. Here's WHY</figcaption>
<p><em>Pushpa 2: The Rule</em> continues its impressive run at the box office, becoming the fastest Indian film to cross Rs 1050 crore worldwide. However, the film has now been removed from all PVR INOX chains in North India due to distribution conflicts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pushpa 2 is performing strongly but faces competition from the upcoming film <em>Baby John</em>.</li>
  <li>Distributor Anil Thadani requested equal showings for both films during the holiday season.</li>
  <li>If theatres do not comply, they might not receive the release order for Pushpa 2, impacting its showings.</li>
  <li>This is reminiscent of previous disputes between Thadani's AA Films and PVR Inox.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If theatres don’t agree, he has warned they won’t get the release order to show Pushpa 2 over the weekend, making the situation more difficult.”</blockquote>
<p>The situation highlights the challenges faced by successful films during peak release periods, indicating the competitive nature of film distribution in India.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Bachhala Malli Movie Review</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 20-12-2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Gulte</p>
<p>Subbu Mangadevvi's second directorial film, Bachhala Malli, featuring Allari Naresh, aims to deliver a serious rustic action drama. The film explores themes of stubbornness, love, and personal transformation.</p>
<img src='path-to-image.jpg' alt='Bachhala Malli Movie Poster'>
<figcaption>Bachhala Malli Movie Poster</figcaption>
<ul>
  <li>Rating: 2.25/5</li>
  <li>Allari Naresh delivers a commendable performance, particularly in the film's climax.</li>
  <li>Amritha Aiyer plays Kaveri, but her character feels out of place.</li>
  <li>Positives include realistic action choreography and the song 'Mari Antha Kopam'.</li>
  <li>Negatives highlight a lack of depth in writing, predictable screenplay, and uninspiring character development.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Overall, Bachhala Malli is a genuine effort to make a hard-hitting &amp; realistic movie.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, despite strong performances, the film suffers from poor writing and predictable direction.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Bachchala Malli Movie Review</figcaption>
<p>Bachchala Malli depicts the life struggle of Malli from childhood to love life set in a rustic backdrop, aiming for emotional depth but falling short.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allari Naresh shines in an intense role as Malli.</li>
<li>First half presents a routine narrative with a need for deeper emotional impact.</li>
<li>Background music aligns well with the story's tone.</li>
<li>Potential for a stronger second half remains.</li>
<li>Cast includes Allari Naresh and Amritha Aiyer, directed by Subbu Mangadevvi.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The desired emotional impact doesn’t quite land, though the effort is evident.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, while the film showcases Malli's journey, it may need more depth to resonate fully with the audience.</p>]]></description>

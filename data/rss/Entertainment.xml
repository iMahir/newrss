Several names have been floating around in the media to carry forward this cop-based action entertainer. Now, we have exclusively learned that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has signed Kannada film director Prem and has entrusted him with the responsibility of developing the script for Rowdy Rathore 2.</p><p>According to sources close to the development, Sanjay Leela Bhansali is very excited to bankroll the sequel to Rowdy Rathore and had locked the core plot of the film a while back. The basic idea of Rowdy Rathore 2 has been in place for the longest time, and SLB was looking to partner with the right forces to develop a banger of a sequel to this 2012 blockbuster. His thoughts have aligned with Prem, and the duo is working towards developing the script of Rowdy Rathore 2.</p><p>The source further added that the Rowdy Rathore sequel will move into the casting stage once the screenplay is locked. Prem will full-fledgedly move into the pre-production of Rowdy Rathore 2 after the release of KD – The Devil. The film is expected to take off sometime by the end of 2025, and the casting will begin from Summer next year. Right now, the energies are being invested to develop a script that does justice to the legacy of the first part.</p><p>Will Akshay Kumar return to Rowdy Rathore 2? "We shall know that at the right time. It could be Akshay Kumar, a new hero, or who knows, a two-hero film too," the source concluded.</p>]]></description>

<p>The remake of Tamil blockbuster Theri, Ustaad Bhagat Singh starring Pawan Kalyan, finds itself in jeopardy as the Hindi remake, Baby John, is heading towards a big disaster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby John's failure at the box office indicates audience displeasure towards remakes.</li>
<li>Pawan Kalyan and director Harish Shankar have not resumed Ustaad Bhagat Singh's shoot due to other commitments.</li>
<li>Fans and audiences are doubtful about Ustaad Bhagat Singh's success, fearing a similar fate as Baby John.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Now fans and audiences are also doubtful of the result of Ustaad Bhagat Singh... They fear if this might become a big threat for Ustaad Bhagat Singh like it happened for Baby John."</blockquote>
<p>The future of Ustaad Bhagat Singh remains uncertain, with Pawan Kalyan focused on other projects and no clear updates on the film's restart.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The Mohanlal-starrer Barroz is facing a disappointing run at the box office, failing to cross <strong>10 crores</strong> in its extended opening weekend.</p>
<ol>
<li>The film collected <strong>1.35 crores</strong> on its 5th day, showing only an 8% growth from the previous day.</li>
<li>Barroz is struggling to cross <strong>10 crores</strong>, with a current total India net collection of <strong>8.71 crores</strong>.</li>
<li>The movie faces tough competition from recent South releases like UI, Marco, and Viduthalai Part 2.</li>
<li>Barroz is reportedly mounted on a budget of <strong>80 crores</strong>, with less than 10% of its budget recovered so far.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>The movie is reportedly mounted at a scale of <strong>80 crores</strong>. It is yet to recover more than 90% of its budget. But that seems extremely difficult now since the audience has completely rejected the film.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Barroz is on its way to becoming a major box office disaster, with a bleak outlook for recovery.</p>]]></description>

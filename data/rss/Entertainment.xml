<p>Bhajan Singh Rana, the autorickshaw driver, recounted the urgent transport of actor Saif Ali Khan to Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital after Khan was injured in a stabbing incident.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The incident occurred outside Saif Ali Khan's residence, where he was found bleeding from the neck.</li>
  <li>Rana took approximately 8-10 minutes to reach the hospital, where Khan requested a stretcher upon arrival.</li>
  <li>A child was also present with Khan during the transport.</li>
  <li>Rana did not charge Khan for the ride, highlighting a moment of kindness amidst the chaos.</li>
  <li>Doctors noted that Khan entered the hospital "like a lion," showcasing his resilience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The actor sat by himself in the three-wheeler. He did not seem scared and appeared normal,” informed Rana.</blockquote>
<p>This event emphasizes the bravery and quick action of Rana as well as Saif Ali Khan's courage in a life-threatening situation.</p>]]></description>

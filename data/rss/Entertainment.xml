<p>Aamir Khan Productions has issued an official statement following the exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> from the Oscars 2025 shortlist for Best International Feature Film. The Film Federation of India’s decision to bypass the Kiran Rao-directed satire sparked significant backlash among cinephiles and industry figures alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film, which critiques the patriarchy in rural India, was critically acclaimed but not shortlisted for the Oscars.</li>
<li>Aamir Khan Productions expressed disappointment but emphasized gratitude for the support received.</li>
<li>The statement highlighted the honor of being considered among the finest films globally, despite the snub.</li>
<li>Critics have raised concerns about the selection criteria of the Film Federation of India.</li>
<li>The situation has drawn attention back to Payal Kapadia’s Cannes-winning film, <i>All We Imagine As Light</i>, viewed as India’s strongest contender.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Laapataa Ladies did not make it to the Academy Awards shortlist this year, and we are of course disappointed, but equally we are immensely grateful for the incredible support and belief we’ve received throughout this journey.”</blockquote>
<p>The exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> adds another chapter to India’s contentious history with the Academy Awards.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Laapataa Ladies is out of the Oscars 2025 race.</figcaption>
<p>The announcement of the 2025 Oscars shortlist has left many disappointed as India's official entry, Laapataa Ladies, directed by Kiran Rao, failed to make the cut. Viewers are expressing their frustration online, blaming the Film Federation of India (FFI) for the omission.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laapataa Ladies was directed by Kiran Rao and selected as India's official entry earlier this year.</li>
<li>Many believed Payal Kapadia's film, All We Imagine As Light, had a better chance of earning a nomination.</li>
<li>The FFI has faced criticism for its selection process and track record at the Oscars.</li>
<li>Following the announcement, the internet is calling for reforms within the FFI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Film Federation of India requires a full revamp. The ones who are there now should step down and let others who understand and know the art of cinema take over.”</blockquote>
<p>With recent failures in selection, many argue that an overhaul of the FFI is necessary for the future of Indian cinema at international awards.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Arjun Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar Reunite for Mere Husband Ki Biwi</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> Jan 02, 2025 <strong>by:</strong> Devansh Sharma</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/02/550x309/The_Lady_Killer_1725368983879_1735808197706.jpg" alt="Arjun Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar in The Lady Killer." title="Arjun Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar in The Lady Killer.">
<figcaption>Arjun Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar in The Lady Killer.</figcaption>
<p>Actors Arjun Kapoor, Bhumi Pednekar, and Rakul Preet Singh will share the screen in a film titled "Mere Husband Ki Biwi" after their previous collaboration in the poorly received film "The Lady Killer".</p>
<ul>
  <li>The upcoming film is set to be released on February 21, 2025.</li>
  <li>A playful announcement on Instagram describes the film's love story as unique: "Yahaan pyaar ki geometry thodi twisted hai - kyunki ye love triangle nahi, pura circle hai!"</li>
  <li>The film will be directed by Mudassar Aziz, known for his work on films like "Khel Khel Mein" and "Pati Patni Aur Woh".</li>
  <li>The film's producers include Vashu Bhagnani, Jackky Bhagnani, and Deepshikha Deshmukh.</li>
  <li>Arjun and Bhumi's last film, "The Lady Killer," was a commercial failure, earning only ₹60,000 against a budget of ₹45 crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It's lighthearted, relatable, and full of moments that will stay with you long after you leave the theater,” said director Mudassar Aziz.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the reunion of Arjun Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar aims to create a better reception from audiences, following their last film's disappointing performance.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Game Changer Movie Poster</figcaption>
<p>The grand arrival of Game Changer, a highly anticipated political drama directed by Shankar Shanmugam, is just around the corner, set to release on January 10, 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>The movie has been granted a U/A certificate by the CBFC with a runtime of 2 hours and 45 minutes.</li>
<li>CBFC objections include the requirement for the movie's title to be presented in Telugu and the exclusion of the honorific 'Padmasree' before Brahmanandam's name.</li>
<li>The concerns prompt questions about inconsistencies with previous films like Prabhas’ Kalki 2898 AD.</li>
<li>The objections may relate to past controversies surrounding the misuse of award titles by actors, including a directive from the Andhra Pradesh High Court.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It remains to be seen who will provide clarity on these matters.”</blockquote>
<p>As the film's release approaches, the clarity regarding these objections is eagerly awaited by audiences.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the steep decline in filmmaker Anil Sharma's career, highlighting the contrast between his recent success with "Gadar 2" and the anticipated poor performance of his latest film, "Vanvaas."</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gadar 2 was a blockbuster, achieving impressive box office numbers.</li>
  <li>"Vanvaas" features Nana Patekar and lacks star appeal, with low marketing.</li>
  <li>The film is projected to earn less than 10 crores, a significant drop from over 500 crores for Gadar 2.</li>
  <li>Anil Sharma's ability to attract audiences is called into question.</li>
  <li>The film releases on December 20, yet many are unaware of its screening.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“From over a 500 crore collection, Anil will drop to a less than 10 crore average.”</blockquote>
<p>This article illustrates the challenges faced by filmmakers in adapting to current cinematic trends, showcasing how quickly fortunes can shift in the film industry.</p>]]></description>

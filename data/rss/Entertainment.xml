<p>The action thriller <em>Baby John</em>, led by Varun Dhawan, faced a disappointing downturn in box office collections after a promising opening. Despite expectations, the film struggled against competition and mixed reviews.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Points:</strong></h4>

  <li>Day 2 early estimates: 4-5 crores</li>
  <li>Overall collection for two days: 15.25-16.25 crores</li>
  <li>Film’s release coincided with the successful <em>Pushpa 2</em></li>

</ul>
<blockquote>"The mixed word-of-mouth is visibly impacting the footfall, and the film will soon crash if it does not maintain its hold tomorrow."</blockquote>

<figcaption>Mukesh Khanna shares his thoughts on Ranbir Kapoor's casting as Lord Ram.</figcaption>
<p>Mukesh Khanna has expressed concerns about Ranbir Kapoor’s suitability to play Lord Ram in the upcoming adaptation of <em>Ramayana</em>, emphasizing the importance of embodying the character's virtues.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film is directed by Nitesh Tiwari and will release in two parts, with the first set for Diwali 2026.</li>
  <li>Khanna believes comparisons with Arun Govil, who famously played Ram, are inevitable.</li>
  <li>He stresses that the actor portraying Ram should not just look the part but possess virtuous qualities.</li>
  <li>Khanna raised concerns over Ranbir Kapoor's recent roles affecting his image, specifically citing his character in <em>Animal</em>.</li>
  <li>He warned filmmakers about casting decisions, referencing the backlash against Prabhas in <em>Adipurush</em>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Whoever plays Ram must embody Ram; he shouldn’t look like Raavan.” - Mukesh Khanna</blockquote>
<p>Khanna's reflections underscore the cultural significance of the role and the expectations from the actor to resonate with the audience's perception of Lord Ram.</p>]]></description>

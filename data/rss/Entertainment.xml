            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fateh' Box Office Collection Day 4: Sonu Sood’s Action Drama Sees a Major Drop</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 13, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<p>On its fourth day, Sonu Sood's film 'Fateh' faced a significant decline at the box office, failing to collect even Rs. 1 crore. In contrast, Ram Charan’s movie 'Game Changer' emerged as the leader at the box office.</p>
<ul>
<li>'Fateh' struggled to attract viewers, showing a drastic drop in collections.</li>
<li>Despite strong performances by lead actor Sonu Sood, the film’s box office success was underwhelming.</li>
<li>Competition from Ram Charan’s 'Game Changer', which has been performing well, is a factor in 'Fateh's decline.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Fateh’s collection highlights the volatile nature of box office performance, where competition can heavily influence earnings."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the box office landscape remains competitive, with established stars like Ram Charan drawing significant audiences away from other films, including 'Fateh'.</p>]]></description>

  <li>The dispute reflects broader issues in the K-pop industry regarding artist contracts and independence.</li>
  <li>The band has remained active on social media, asserting control over their identity and future.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Allowing unilateral terminations of exclusive contracts and independent activities without legal procedures could undermine investment in the entertainment industry and destabilise the K-pop sector." - Ador</blockquote>

<figcaption>The world's highest-paid actor has held the record for over 20 years.</figcaption>
<p>Keanu Reeves achieved a remarkable milestone by earning $156 million for his role in the 'Matrix' sequels, setting a record that remains unbroken for over 20 years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reeves earned a $30 million upfront salary plus profit shares for 'The Matrix Reloaded' and 'The Matrix Revolutions'.</li>
  <li>His earnings from the sequels surpassed $156 million, significantly higher than his peers like Tom Cruise and Shah Rukh Khan.</li>
  <li>This pay scale reflects the huge box office success of the films, which grossed $1.2 billion combined.</li>
  <li>Prior to this, Alec Guinness held the record with $94 million for 'Star Wars', considering multiple releases.</li>
  <li>Reeves has not been able to command such high fees since, with later films netting him between $15-30 million each.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The $156 million mark is so high that no actor has come close in the 21 years since.”</blockquote>
<p>Keanu's record signifies a peak in Hollywood salaries that has not been replicated, showcasing both his star power and the unprecedented success of the 'Matrix' franchise.</p>]]></description>

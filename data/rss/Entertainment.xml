<figcaption>Madha Gaja Raja Box Office Day 1 Update!(Photo Credit – YouTube)</figcaption>
<p>Tamil actor Vishal Krishna Reddy returns with his long-awaited sci-fi action comedy, Madha Gaja Raja, which finally released on January 12, 2025, during the Pongal holidays. The film, shot in 2012, faced significant delays but has now made a strong box office debut.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film earned 3.10 crores on its opening day, achieving impressive numbers despite mixed reviews from critics.</li>
  <li>It opened with 244% higher earnings compared to the recent release, Vanangaan, which only made 0.90 crores.</li>
  <li>Last year's Pongal featured major releases like Captain Miller and Ayalaan, earning 8.50 crores and 4 crores respectively.</li>
  <li>Madha Gaja Raja also stars Anjali, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, and Sonu Sood among others.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The film has finally arrived in theatres after a decade of struggles.”</blockquote>
<p>As it stands, while Madha Gaja Raja is not far behind Ayalaan's earnings, it still trails significantly behind Captain Miller's success. There are hopes that positive word-of-mouth will enhance its performance during the festive period.</p>]]></description>

<p>On Sunday, protesters vandalised Allu Arjun's Hyderabad home, demanding compensation for victims of a recent stampede linked to the premiere of his film 'Pushpa 2'.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protesters, identifying as OU JAC, vandalised the property in Jubilee Hills.</li>
<li>They demanded ₹1 crore for the family of a stampede victim.</li>
<li>The protest included pelting stones and breaking flower pots.</li>
<li>Eight individuals were arrested at the scene by police.</li>
<li>The incident stemmed from a previous stampede at a film premiere that resulted in one death.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We demand that Allu Arjun take care of the late Revathi’s family. Why did so many film personalities visit him when he came out of jail after being there for 6 months, but none of them cared when a woman died.” - Protester</blockquote>
<p>The tensions between Allu Arjun's fans and the protesters highlight broader issues surrounding celebrity accountability in tragic events.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The GOAT Movie Poster</figcaption>
<p>Tamil director Venkat Prabhu discusses his original vision for The GOAT with Rajinikanth and details about how the project evolved.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Venkat Prabhu initially envisioned The GOAT with Superstar Rajinikanth.</li>
  <li>The film, featuring Thalapathy Vijay, grossed around Rs. 450 crore globally.</li>
  <li>Rajinikanth liked the story, but the project did not materialize with him.</li>
  <li>A different version of the story was presented to Vijay, including a dual role concept.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I narrated a different version to Rajinikanth, who liked it, but I didn't present the dual role concept at that time." - Venkat Prabhu</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the collaboration led to The GOAT's successful release with Vijay, though fans were left wanting more from the original concept.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Arjun Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar in The Lady Killer.</figcaption>
<p>Actors Arjun Kapoor, Bhumi Pednekar, and Rakul Preet Singh will share the screen in a film titled "Mere Husband Ki Biwi" after their previous collaboration in the poorly received film "The Lady Killer".</p>
<ul>
  <li>The upcoming film is set to be released on February 21, 2025.</li>
  <li>A playful announcement on Instagram describes the film's love story as unique: "Yahaan pyaar ki geometry thodi twisted hai - kyunki ye love triangle nahi, pura circle hai!"</li>
  <li>The film will be directed by Mudassar Aziz, known for his work on films like "Khel Khel Mein" and "Pati Patni Aur Woh".</li>
  <li>The film's producers include Vashu Bhagnani, Jackky Bhagnani, and Deepshikha Deshmukh.</li>
  <li>Arjun and Bhumi's last film, "The Lady Killer," was a commercial failure, earning only ₹60,000 against a budget of ₹45 crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It's lighthearted, relatable, and full of moments that will stay with you long after you leave the theater,” said director Mudassar Aziz.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the reunion of Arjun Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar aims to create a better reception from audiences, following their last film's disappointing performance.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The GOAT Movie Poster</figcaption>
<p>Tamil director Venkat Prabhu discusses his original vision for The GOAT with Rajinikanth and details about how the project evolved.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Venkat Prabhu initially envisioned The GOAT with Superstar Rajinikanth.</li>
  <li>The film, featuring Thalapathy Vijay, grossed around Rs. 450 crore globally.</li>
  <li>Rajinikanth liked the story, but the project did not materialize with him.</li>
  <li>A different version of the story was presented to Vijay, including a dual role concept.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I narrated a different version to Rajinikanth, who liked it, but I didn't present the dual role concept at that time." - Venkat Prabhu</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the collaboration led to The GOAT's successful release with Vijay, though fans were left wanting more from the original concept.</p>]]></description>

<p>Mandira Bedi recalls her challenging early days as a cricket presenter during the 2003 World Cup, emphasizing the scrutiny she faced as a woman in a male-dominated space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mandira started her career in the early 2000s as a cricket presenter.</li>
  <li>Sharing her experience on Kareena Kapoor's show, she discussed the challenges she faced.</li>
  <li>Facing criticism and skepticism from cricket legends, she struggled initially.</li>
  <li>Over time, she gained confidence and demanded respect during her presentations.</li>
  <li>Only Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi showed her respect out of the legends she worked with.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“At the end of every show, I would put my head down and cry. The legends on either side of me, I would ask them questions, and they just stared at me.”</blockquote>
<p>Despite the initial disrespect, Mandira Bedi's journey highlights the evolving role of women in sports broadcasting.</p>]]></description>

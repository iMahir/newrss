<p>As Los Angeles grapples with destructive wildfires, the entertainment industry faces significant setbacks, with many workers losing homes and productions halted.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wildfires have devastated areas in Los Angeles, directly affecting the entertainment sector.</li>

  <li>The industry, which contributes $115 billion to the local economy, is already recovering from the pandemic and labor strikes.</li>
  <li>Numerous productions have been paused, with the air quality severely impacting outdoor filming.</li>
  <li>Upcoming awards and events are delayed or canceled in response to the ongoing crisis.</li>
  <li>Calls for the cancellation of Hollywood's awards season are increasing due to the current state of the city.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For people to walk the red carpet, all glitzy and glamor-y, while Los Angeles is literally and figuratively burning... it would be a little disconcerting.” - Marc Malkin</blockquote>
<p>This situation reflects a broader concern for the livelihood of those in the industry, particularly gig workers who depend on events for income.</p>]]></description>

  <figcaption>NewJeans' members may only be aged 16 to 20, but they have taken a fierce stance against what they see as record industry exploitation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The K-pop band NewJeans faces restrictions on signing advertising deals due to legal action taken by their record label, Ador. The band's dispute with Ador stems from unresolved allegations of exploitation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>NewJeans claims their contracts are invalid due to alleged bullying at Ador.</li>
  <li>Ador has filed an injunction to prevent NewJeans from independent contracts.</li>
  <li>The dispute reflects broader issues in the K-pop industry regarding artist contracts and independence.</li>
  <li>The band has remained active on social media, asserting control over their identity and future.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Allowing unilateral terminations of exclusive contracts and independent activities without legal procedures could undermine investment in the entertainment industry and destabilise the K-pop sector." - Ador</blockquote>
<p>The situation underscores the challenges faced by K-pop artists regarding their contracts and independence within the industry.</p>]]></description>

<p>Angelina Jolie is reportedly struggling with intense emotions stemming from her ongoing legal battles with ex-husband Brad Pitt, leading to negative impacts on her children.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jolie's mood has become volatile, reportedly 'lashing out' at her staff and children.</li>
  <li>She scored a legal win over the sale of her stake in the Château Miraval winery, previously co-owned with Pitt.</li>
  <li>A court ruling requires Pitt to provide documents related to alleged domestic abuse accusations.</li>
  <li>Insiders suggest that while Jolie loves her children, she maintains a strict and demanding parenting style.</li>
  <li>Jolie's children often feel relieved when she is in a better mood.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“She expects her six children to help with chores, stay physically active, and remain diligent in their responsibilities.”</blockquote>
<p>This situation reflects the complexities of Jolie's balancing act between her personal struggles and her role as a mother.</p>]]></description>

<img width="855" height="855" src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-01/1326343769_gc2.jpg" alt="Ram Charan," title="Ram Charan in Game Changer (image courtesy of AA Films)" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high">
<figcaption>Ram Charan in Game Changer (image courtesy of AA Films)</figcaption>
<p>Game Changer witnessed a significant drop at the Indian box office on its second day with collections plummeting to Rs. 24.50 crore, reflecting a 60% decline overall.</p>
<ul>
<li>The two-day cumulative box office gross stands at approximately Rs. 83.50 crore in India.</li>
<li>Telugu states experienced an over 70% drop, accumulating only Rs. 12 crore on the second day.</li>
<li>Tamil Nadu's performance was disappointing, grossing a mere Rs. 4 crore over the two days.</li>
<li>The film's fate was sealed even before release due to its high budget and insufficient pre-release recoveries.</li>
<li>Holiday opportunities in Telugu states may help, but expectations are low.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The drop on the second day has sealed the fate of the film.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, despite the holiday period, the financial prospects for Game Changer appear bleak as it grapples with poor box office performance.</p>

<figcaption>Fateh box office collection day 2: Jacqueline Fernandez and Sonu Sood's film sees a dip in numbers.</figcaption>
<p>The action entertainer Fateh, directed by Sonu Sood, experienced a dip in box office collections on its second day, earning ₹2 crore, which is ₹40 lakhs less than its opening day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fateh earned ₹2 crore on Saturday, down from ₹2.4 crore on Friday.</li>
  <li>The film faces competition from the Hindi dubbed version of S Shankar's Game Changer.</li>
  <li>Ticket prices were initially set at ₹99, which contributed to better opening numbers.</li>
  <li>Sonu Sood aims to donate the entire profit from the film to charity.</li>
  <li>The film tackles themes of courage and cybercrime, based on real-life experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Fateh is a film made for the common man, and I wanted it to reach everyone in the most accessible way across India,” Sonu Sood said.</blockquote>
<p>Despite its promising start, Fateh's performance shows that it might struggle to maintain momentum amidst stiff competition.</p>]]></description>

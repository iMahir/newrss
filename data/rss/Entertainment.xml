<p>Baby John, headlined by Varun Dhawan, is struggling at the box office, particularly in its fourth day of release. Despite the film's strong opening, it has failed to maintain momentum amidst stiff competition.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film, released on December 25, garnered Rs 19.65 crore in its first three days in India.</li>
<li>On Saturday, it earned only Rs 3.57 crore, bringing its total to Rs 23.22 crore over four days.</li>
<li>Critics and audiences have delivered mixed to negative reviews for the film, citing predictability and a lack of originality.</li>
<li>Despite notable performances, the film is considered one of the biggest flops of the year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>‚ÄúWhile a few have hailed Varun's performance, majority of the viewers have criticized the film for its predictability.‚Äù</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Baby John is facing significant challenges at the box office, competing against the successful releases of Pushpa 2 and Mufasa.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Reaction GIF for Rekhachithram</figcaption>
<p>Rekhachithram, directed by Jofin T Chacko, attempts to leverage the alternate history genre to uplift a standard crime thriller but ends up being a passable film with notable compromises.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film centers around a Kerala Police CI, Vivek Gopinath, who investigates a suicide linked to a missing person case from 1985.</li>
<li>It draws on elements from the 1985 film Kathodu Kathoram, which serves as a substantial backdrop.</li>
<li>The narrative lacks originality, delivering predictable twists and unexciting investigation beats.</li>
<li>The alternate history elements shine more than the primary narrative, offering some emotional depth to the female character.</li>
<li>Character performances, including Asif Ali and Anaswara Rajan, are competent but limited by the writing.</li>
<li>The film is filled with references and tributes to 1980s cinema legends, though execution varies in subtlety.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"With the effective inclusion of one or more real-life elements at the correct points, Rekhachithram is a passable thriller with evident compromises."</blockquote>
<p>The movie aspires to blend real historical events with fiction but ultimately results in a standard thriller that may only please those with a keen interest in alternate histories.</p>]]></description>

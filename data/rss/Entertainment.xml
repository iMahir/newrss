<p>The political thriller Game Changer, featuring Ram Charan and Kiara Advani, has crossed the ₹100 crore mark at the box office within its first five days of release, despite receiving mixed reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film collected ₹10 crore on its fifth day, totaling ₹105.44 crore net in India.</li>
<li>Game Changer had a strong opening day, grossing ₹51 crore, but saw a decline over the subsequent days.</li>
<li>It faced stiff competition from Balakrishna's Daaku Maharaaj.</li>
<li>The film's overall occupancy was 34.13 percent on its fifth day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Karthik Subbaraj has penned Game Changer’s story; ... the version you get, while entertaining, feels rehashed from Shankar’s previous works.” - Hindustan Times Review</blockquote>
<p>Despite a lukewarm reception, Game Changer’s box office performance demonstrates its commercial appeal, aided by star power and audience expectations.</p>]]></description>

<p>A scammer impersonating actor Brad Pitt convinced a French woman to send over 800,000 euros under the pretense of helping with medical treatment related to his fake kidney operation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scammer used altered photos and AI-generated videos to convince Anne that she was in a relationship with Brad Pitt.</li>
  <li>Initially contacted by someone impersonating Pitt's mother, things escalated quickly to Anne believing she was in a romantic relationship with the actor.</li>
  <li>Anne sent large sums of money for fictitious medical expenses, lured by promises of gifts and marriage.</li>
  <li>After realizing the truth, Anne suffered from severe depression and reported the scam to the police.</li>
  <li>This is not the first scam, as several others have reported similar incidents involving the fake actor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Anne revealed, "There are so few men who write such things. I liked the man I was talking to and he knew how to talk to women."</blockquote>
<p>The incident highlights the dangers of online scams and the emotional manipulation involved. Authorities are investigating the case as the trend of celebrity impersonation scams rises.</p>]]></description>

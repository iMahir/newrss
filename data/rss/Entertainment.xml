            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Samay Raina's Unique Influence: Profits vs. Brand Guidelines</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2023-10-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Source:</strong> Afaqs</p>
<img alt="Deepti Karthik" loading="lazy" src="https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/filters:format(webp)/afaqs/media/media_files/2024/12/28/tSKF9ylsztJ5E8fcxcph.jpg">
<figcaption>Deepti Karthik, fractional CMO</figcaption>
<p>In a recent commentary, Deepti Karthik reflects on her experience collaborating with comedian Samay Raina, highlighting the paradoxical nature of influencer marketing and its impact on sales despite brand guideline strife.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Karthik describes the influencer collaboration as their most profitable, generating over Rs. 25 lakh in two months despite initial negative sentiments.</li>
    <li>Raina charged Rs. 5 lakh for the post but did not adhere closely to brand guidelines, leading to the post's removal.</li>
    <li>Karthik suggests that Raina's use of dark humor may increase consumer engagement by provoking deeper thoughts about products.</li>
    <li>This paradox demonstrates the complex dynamics of influencer marketing, where sales can occur despite contradictory brand messaging.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Partner with Samay at your own risk concerning brand metrics, but I can assure you it will drive sales.”</blockquote>
<p>This case highlights the ongoing debate among marketers regarding the trade-offs between brand safety and the potential for virality in influencer partnerships.</p>]]></description>

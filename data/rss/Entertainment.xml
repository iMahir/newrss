<figcaption>Ram Charan in Game Changer (image courtesy of AA Films)</figcaption>
<p>Game Changer had a disappointing start at the Indian box office, collecting an approximate of Rs. 60 crore on its first day, which is considered underwhelming given the expectations set by its massive budget.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film grossed Rs. 59.50 crore on its opening day.</li>
  <li>Collections in Telugu states were below expectations, significantly lower than the targeted Rs. 60-65 crore.</li>
  <li>The Hindi version performed the best with Rs. 7 crore NETT.</li>
  <li>Low occupancy rates were observed with less than 50% in regular shows.</li>
  <li>The performance was notably poor in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, traditionally strong markets for director Shankar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A little salt blends well with flour,” but here the salt is probably more than flour.</blockquote>
<p>This lackluster performance raises questions about the film's future at the box office, given the high expectations set by its marketing and budget.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Game Changer and Daaku Maharaaj obstacle faced in premieres.</figcaption>
<p>With the release of Game Changer starring Ram Charan, delays have impacted both Game Changer and the upcoming film Daaku Maharaaj.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Game Changer had several USA premiere shows cancelled due to delays, resulting in a loss of nearly $100K.</li>
  <li>Daaku Maharaaj, starring Balakrishna, is facing similar delivery delays that are affecting premiere shows.</li>
  <li>The ambitious project aims for a 2 million dollar collection, but initial losses are anticipated due to these delays.</li>
  <li>If the film content is well received, it could recover in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Due to this, the premiere collections will be affected to an extent."</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the challenges faced by the Telugu film industry amid logistical issues but also underscores the potential for recovery based on audience reception.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fateh Review: The No-Nonsense, Unabashed And Ultra-Violent Film Is Surprisingly Watchable</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>An ex-special ops agent embarks on a violent rampage to take down cyber criminals behind a fraudulent loan operation. Actor Sonu Sood makes his writing and directing debut with a film that is unapologetically violent and dynamic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film opens with an intense confrontation where the protagonist, Fateh Singh, takes control by resorting to extreme violence.</li>
  <li>Fateh utilizes a variety of weapons in his mission against a network of cyber criminals, showcasing high body counts reminiscent of other action-packed films.</li>
  <li>The narrative includes a social purpose, focusing on the impact of a scam targeting financially vulnerable individuals.</li>
  <li>Despite the relentless violence, the film offers minimal mystery as the antagonist's identity is revealed early on.</li>
  <li>Sonu Sood's performance resonates with the film's gritty tone, although other characters struggle to stand out in the chaos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Fateh is marked by dizzying momentum if not sustained clarity.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while <em>Fateh</em> may be overwhelming with its sheer brutality, it remains a captivating watch for those who appreciate action-packed narratives.</p>]]></description>

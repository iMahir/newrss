<p>The Kochi City police have taken businessman Boby Chemmanur into custody following a complaint by a woman actor alleging sexual harassment. This follows a swift investigation and is part of a broader inquiry into multiple complaints against him.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chemmanur was taken into custody less than 24 hours after a complaint was made.</li>
  <li>A special investigation team (SIT) is overseeing the case, having extracted him from another district.</li>
  <li>He faces non-bailable charges under various sections of law, including sexual harassment and the transmission of obscene material.</li>
  <li>The actor has provided digital evidence to support her claims and has previously lodged a complaint against multiple individuals for similar behavior.</li>
  <li>The police have already arrested one individual linked to the initial complaints.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“His custody is the culmination of our action initiated from the moment we registered the case on Tuesday evening.” - C. Jayakumar, Assistant Commissioner</blockquote>
<p>This case reflects ongoing concerns regarding online harassment and the treatment of women in the industry.</p>]]></description>

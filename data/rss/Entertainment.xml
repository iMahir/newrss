<p>Salman Khan has upgraded security at his residence due to ongoing threats to his life. His balcony is now protected by bullet proof glass following previous gunfire incidents linked to a local gang.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recent threats from Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang have prompted the installation of bullet proof glass at Salman Khan’s Galaxy Apartments.</li>
  <li>In April 2024, gunshots were reported outside his residence, attributed to the Bishnoi gang.</li>
  <li>The gang has allegedly demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore for Khan’s safety.</li>
  <li>Along with the glass installation, Khan has also acquired a bulletproof SUV and increased armed security.</li>
  <li>Salman Khan is set to release a new film titled Sikandar in Eid 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If the demand isn’t met, he would suffer a fate worse than Baba Siddique," highlighting the severity of the threats faced by Khan.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the recent series of threats and violent incidents has led Salman Khan to significantly strengthen his personal security measures, underscoring the risks associated with his celebrity status.</p>]]></description>

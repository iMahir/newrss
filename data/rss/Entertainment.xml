<p>A day after Allu Arjun walked out of the Hyderabad jail, the actor visited his uncle and veteran star Chiranjeevi. This visit comes in the wake of a tragic incident at a film screening that led to Arjun's arrest.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun was arrested on December 13, 2024, regarding the death of a woman at Sandhya Theatre during a screening of Pushpa 2.</li>
    <li>The chaos caused by the crowd led to a stampede, resulting in the death of a 35-year-old woman and injuries to her 9-year-old son.</li>
    <li>Arjun was held for 14 days in judicial custody but received interim bail after a night in jail.</li>
    <li>Upon release, Allu Arjun expressed remorse, calling the incident “very unfortunate” and offering support to the victim's family.</li>
    <li>Despite the incident, Pushpa 2: The Rule has been successful at the box office, crossing Rs 1000 crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I thank everyone, this incident was very unfortunate, we are extremely sorry whatever happened, we are with the family...” - Allu Arjun</blockquote>

<p>The infamous DJ Yesong, whose real name is Ahn Ye Song, has been sentenced to eight years in prison after causing the death of a delivery driver while intoxicated. The incident has drawn significant media attention and legal scrutiny.</p>
<ul>
    <li>DJ Yesong caused the death of a motorcyclist in Seoul's Gangnam district while driving under the influence.</li>
    <li>Her blood alcohol level at the time of the crash was 0.221%, well above the legal limit.</li>
    <li>Initially sentenced to 10 years, her punishment was reduced to 8 years after an appeal considering her confession and agreement with the victim's family.</li>
    <li>The court emphasized her reckless driving, which included running red lights and speeding.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court upheld the eight-year sentence, dismissing further appeals by DJ Yesong.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“She neglected her legal obligations under the Road Traffic Act.”</blockquote>
<p>This tragic event raises discussions around accountability in drunk driving incidents, particularly regarding public figures. DJ Yesong's case serves as a critical reminder of the dangers associated with driving under the influence.]]></description>

<p>The arrest of Telugu actor Allu Arjun has incited a major political debate in Telangana, with various parties reacting differently to the incident tied to a tragic stampede during the premiere of "Pushpa 2: The Rule".</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun was arrested in connection with a woman's death due to a stampede at the Sandhya Theatre during the film's premiere.</li>
    <li>Congress defended the arrest, emphasizing that it is lawful and that the party supports adherence to the legal process.</li>
    <li>Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw criticized Congress, claiming they disrespect the creative industry and misplace blame for poor theater arrangements.</li>
    <li>YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Andhra Pradesh opposition leader, condemned the arrest, suggesting it was unfair to hold Arjun accountable for the stampede.</li>
    <li>Arjun was initially sent to 14-day judicial custody but was later granted interim bail by the Telangana High Court.</li>

<p>Allu Arjun's celebratory return home from prison following a high-profile arrest has sparked outrage online, particularly as a young victim from the associated stampede remains in critical condition.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun was arrested concerning a fan's death during the premiere of his film <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/telugu-cinema/justice-done-allu-arjun-fans-celebrate-after-actor-is-granted-interim-bail-in-pushpa-2-stampede-case-101734093105639.html">Pushpa 2: The Rule</a>.</li>
    <li>After his release, he was celebrated at home with significant industry support, which many deemed inappropriate given the ongoing tragedy.</li>
    <li>Many social media users criticized the celebrations, calling it a PR stunt and questioning the lack of support for the deceased's family by Arjun.</li>
    <li>The incident occurred during a large crowd gathering at Sandhya Theatre, leading to a stampede that resulted in significant casualties.</li>

<blockquote>
    "Today's non-stop celebrity visits and the publicity around it has tilted the scales in favour of Revanth Reddy... It should have been a day of introspection, not celebration."

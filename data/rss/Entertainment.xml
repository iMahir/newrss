<p>NewJeans’ new Instagram account has become a direct communication line with fans since its launch post their departure from ADOR. The account faced controversy over its initial bio which included colors identical to those of Red Velvet, stirring discussions among fans of both groups.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The account is used by NewJeans to share updates and messages with fans.</li>
  <li>The original bio featured colored hearts similar to those associated with Red Velvet.</li>
  <li>Red Velvet fans criticized the choice, suggesting the colors should have been different given the previous association.</li>
  <li>NewJeans quickly updated their bio to reflect the members' representative animals instead of the colored hearts.</li>
  <li>The swift change suggests the group's awareness of and response to the controversy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They saw us fighting back over colours…” — Fan reaction on social media</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the complex dynamics between fan communities in K-Pop and reflects how quickly groups can adapt to fan feedback.</p>]]></description>

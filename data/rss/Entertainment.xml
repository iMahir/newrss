<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> The Indian Express</p>
<p>Malaika Arora addresses her ex-boyfriend Arjun Kapoor's recent public declaration of being single, emphasizing her desire for privacy in her personal life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Malaika and Arjun dated for several years before their reported breakup earlier in 2024.</li>
  <li>Arjun confirmed he is single at a public event, prompting Malaika's response.</li>
  <li>Malaika stated, "I will never choose a public platform to talk about my personal life".</li>
  <li>Rumors of their split had persisted, especially after they deleted photos together from social media.</li>
  <li>Arjun supported Malaika after her stepfather's passing earlier this year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>‚ÄúI will never choose a public platform to talk about my personal life. So, whatever Arjun has said is entirely his prerogative.‚Äù - Malaika Arora</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, both individuals seem to be navigating their breakup privately, with Arjun‚Äôs candid admission juxtaposed against Malaika‚Äôs desire for discretion.</p>]]></description>

<p>Varun Dhawan's new film 'Baby John' struggled at the box office on its opening day, failing to outperform the competition from 'Pushpa 2'.</p>
<ul>
<li>'Baby John' was released on Christmas Day, a strategic date for box office success.</li>
<li>The film's opening collections were significantly lower than those of 'Pushpa 2'.</li>
<li>Analysts note that 'Pushpa 2' continues to dominate in ticket sales and audience reception.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Despite high expectations, 'Baby John' did not manage to capture the audience's interest like 'Pushpa 2' did."</blockquote>

<figcaption>Pushpa 2 worldwide box office collection day 31: Allu Arjun film breaks more records, creates more clubs.</figcaption>
<p>Pushpa 2 continues to perform exceptionally well at the box office, achieving remarkable financial milestones despite facing competition from other films.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pushpa 2 became the fastest film to enter the Rs 1800 crore club, joining only Aamir Khan's Dangal.</li>
<li>The film's collections dipped below Rs 5 crore for the first time on its fifth Friday but bounced back with Rs 5.5 crore on Saturday.</li>
<li>The domestic earnings are projected to surpass Rs 1200 crore by the end of the fifth weekend.</li>
<li>Allu Arjun's film dethroned Baahubali 2, setting a new benchmark in Indian cinema.</li>
<li>Upcoming festive releases may impact the film's box office performance in the coming weeks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The total domestic numbers for Pushpa 2 are at a whopping Rs 1199 crore, and it is safe to assume that a new domestic club of Rs 1200 crore would be formed by the end of the fifth weekend.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Pushpa 2 has established itself as a blockbuster hit, but potential future competition may influence its ongoing success at the box office.</p>]]></description>

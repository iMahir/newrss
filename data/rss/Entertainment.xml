<p>Aamir Khan Productions has issued an official statement following the exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> from the Oscars 2025 shortlist for Best International Feature Film. The Film Federation of India’s decision to bypass the Kiran Rao-directed satire sparked significant backlash among cinephiles and industry figures alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>The film, which critiques the patriarchy in rural India, was critically acclaimed but not shortlisted for the Oscars.</li>
<li>Aamir Khan Productions expressed disappointment but emphasized gratitude for the support received.</li>
<li>The statement highlighted the honor of being considered among the finest films globally, despite the snub.</li>
<li>Critics have raised concerns about the selection criteria of the Film Federation of India.</li>
<li>The situation has drawn attention back to Payal Kapadia’s Cannes-winning film, <i>All We Imagine As Light</i>, viewed as India’s strongest contender.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Laapataa Ladies did not make it to the Academy Awards shortlist this year, and we are of course disappointed, but equally we are immensely grateful for the incredible support and belief we’ve received throughout this journey.”</blockquote>
<p>The exclusion of <i>Laapataa Ladies</i> adds another chapter to India’s contentious history with the Academy Awards.</p>]]></description>

<p>Nikkhil Advani highlighted the pervasive misogyny in Bollywood while discussing the limited roles women are offered in film production crews. His remarks during a panel discussion shed light on the deeply ingrained biases in the industry regarding women's employability in technical roles.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advani revealed that only nine out of approximately 170 roles are considered appropriate for women in film projects.</li>
  <li>He shared a shocking anecdote about the rationale behind gender-specific roles, implying that male stylist touches are viewed through a sexual lens.</li>
  <li>Advani emphasized a cultural shift in the industry as he praised the increased intelligence and creativity in streaming platforms compared to traditional film sectors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“In your line items, there are 169 line items, above the line and below the line. Do you know how many are considered relevant jobs for women? Take a guess. Nine. Nine are relevant jobs for women.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Advani's statements reflect a broader issue within the industry, calling for systematic change and awareness of gender biases in hiring practices.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Game Changer Movie Poster</figcaption>
<p>The grand arrival of Game Changer, a highly anticipated political drama directed by Shankar Shanmugam, is just around the corner, set to release on January 10, 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>The movie has been granted a U/A certificate by the CBFC with a runtime of 2 hours and 45 minutes.</li>
<li>CBFC objections include the requirement for the movie's title to be presented in Telugu and the exclusion of the honorific 'Padmasree' before Brahmanandam's name.</li>
<li>The concerns prompt questions about inconsistencies with previous films like Prabhas’ Kalki 2898 AD.</li>
<li>The objections may relate to past controversies surrounding the misuse of award titles by actors, including a directive from the Andhra Pradesh High Court.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It remains to be seen who will provide clarity on these matters.”</blockquote>
<p>As the film's release approaches, the clarity regarding these objections is eagerly awaited by audiences.</p>]]></description>

<p>It has been 28 days, and Pushpa 2 is still performing exceptionally well at the box office, with estimated earnings of 1208 - 1209 crore! Mounted on a budget of 500 crore, the film has registered a profit of 141.6% at the box office in India.</p>
<h4>Pushpa 2 India Box Office Day 28 Estimates</h4>
<p>On the 28th day, January 1, the fourth Wednesday, Pushpa 2 roared yet again on the New Year holiday with almost a 70% jump from the previous day and brought almost 13 - 13.5 crore collection at the box office, taking the total earnings to more than 1208 crore!</p>
<p>Will Pushpa 3 See The Light Of The Day?</p>
<p>Earlier this year, at the Berlin Film Festival, Allu Arjun has already discussed the idea of Pushpa 3 and turning the film into a franchise. It would be interesting to see if the idea sees the light of the day sooner than planned owing to the magnanimous box office collection delivered by the sequel.</p>

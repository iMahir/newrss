<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Unknown<br><strong>Source:</strong> Times of India</p>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116835955,imgsize-28346,width-400,resizemode-4/116835955.jpg" alt="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle" title="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high">
<figcaption>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</figcaption>
<p>Since stepping down from royal duties in January 2020, Prince Harry's relationship with the UK royals has become increasingly strained. Recent developments have highlighted Harry's connections with his late mother Princess Diana's family.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Harry's relationship with the royal family, particularly with King Charles III and Prince William, has deteriorated after public revelations and interviews.</li>
  <li>The last meeting between Harry and William was at their uncle's funeral in August 2024, where they reportedly did not speak.</li>
  <li>Harry met King Charles III earlier this year when the King was diagnosed with cancer, but their meeting was brief.</li>
  <li>King Charles III did not invite Harry and Meghan to Christmas celebrations this year, further indicating tensions.</li>
  <li>Despite the rift, Prince Harry maintains a close relationship with his mother’s side of the family, notably his uncle Earl Charles Spencer, who attended the Invictus Games anniversary.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It didn't make a whole deal of sense when they only met for half an hour... There is a big rift in the Royal family.” - Richard Fitzwilliams</blockquote>
<p>Prince Harry and Meghan currently reside in California with their children, continuing to navigate the complexities of their royal ties.</p>]]></description>

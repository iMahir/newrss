<p>The arrest of Telugu actor Allu Arjun has incited a major political debate in Telangana, with various parties reacting differently to the incident tied to a tragic stampede during the premiere of "Pushpa 2: The Rule".</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun was arrested in connection with a woman's death due to a stampede at the Sandhya Theatre during the film's premiere.</li>
    <li>Congress defended the arrest, emphasizing that it is lawful and that the party supports adherence to the legal process.</li>
    <li>Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw criticized Congress, claiming they disrespect the creative industry and misplace blame for poor theater arrangements.</li>
    <li>YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Andhra Pradesh opposition leader, condemned the arrest, suggesting it was unfair to hold Arjun accountable for the stampede.</li>
    <li>Arjun was initially sent to 14-day judicial custody but was later granted interim bail by the Telangana High Court.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The cases filed against Arjun are within the purview of law and the court granted him bail." - B Mahesh Kumar Goud, Telangana Congress president
</blockquote>
<p>The incident has highlighted tensions between political factions in Telangana, with stark differences in how they view responsibility for the tragedy and their attitudes toward the film industry.

<p>Allu Arjun's celebratory return home from prison following a high-profile arrest has sparked outrage online, particularly as a young victim from the associated stampede remains in critical condition.</p>

    <li>Allu Arjun was arrested concerning a fan's death during the premiere of his film <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/telugu-cinema/justice-done-allu-arjun-fans-celebrate-after-actor-is-granted-interim-bail-in-pushpa-2-stampede-case-101734093105639.html">Pushpa 2: The Rule</a>.</li>
    <li>After his release, he was celebrated at home with significant industry support, which many deemed inappropriate given the ongoing tragedy.</li>
    <li>Many social media users criticized the celebrations, calling it a PR stunt and questioning the lack of support for the deceased's family by Arjun.</li>
    <li>The incident occurred during a large crowd gathering at Sandhya Theatre, leading to a stampede that resulted in significant casualties.</li>

<blockquote>
    "Today's non-stop celebrity visits and the publicity around it has tilted the scales in favour of Revanth Reddy... It should have been a day of introspection, not celebration."

<p>Actor Allu Arjun, who was jailed following an incident at a film premiere, spent a normal night in prison and had rice and vegetable curry for dinner, according to an official from Telangana's prisons department.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun spent a night in Chanchalguda Central Prison after being arrested in the 'Pushpa 2' stampede case.</li>
    <li>The actor was granted a four-week interim bail on the day of his arrest but was not released until the following morning.</li>
    <li>During his time in jail, he did not request any special privileges and was treated as a special prisoner as per court order.</li>
    <li>The delay in his release was due to procedural issues, as inmates are not typically released after 7 PM.</li>
    <li>The incident at the movie premiere resulted in the death of a woman, leading to charges against Arjun and his security team.</li>

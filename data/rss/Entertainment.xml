<figcaption>Ram Charan in Game Changer (image courtesy of AA Films)</figcaption>
<p>Game Changer had a disappointing start at the Indian box office, collecting an approximate of Rs. 60 crore on its first day, which is considered underwhelming given the expectations set by its massive budget.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The film grossed Rs. 59.50 crore on its opening day.</li>
  <li>Collections in Telugu states were below expectations, significantly lower than the targeted Rs. 60-65 crore.</li>
  <li>The Hindi version performed the best with Rs. 7 crore NETT.</li>
  <li>Low occupancy rates were observed with less than 50% in regular shows.</li>
  <li>The performance was notably poor in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, traditionally strong markets for director Shankar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A little salt blends well with flour,” but here the salt is probably more than flour.</blockquote>
<p>This lackluster performance raises questions about the film's future at the box office, given the high expectations set by its marketing and budget.</p>]]></description>

<li>Shikhar Dhawan finalized his divorce from Ayesha Mukherjee in 2023 after living separately since 2020.</li>
<li>Huma Qureshi recently ended her relationship with director Mudassar Aziz in 2022.</li>
<li>There are no confirmed reports of a romantic relationship between Dhawan and Qureshi.</li>
<li>Photos and stories circulating about their relationship have been debunked as manipulated or fabricated.</li>
<li>The two are from Delhi and share a professional connection, but no personal relationship has been established.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>No, they are not dating. The reason for the rumors stems from their professional collaboration.</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Keerthy Suresh Explains Why She's Still Wearing Turmeric Thread Instead of Gold Mangalsutra After Marriage</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source: Jan 01, 2025 - Hindustan Times</strong></p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/01/550x309/k_1734590405530_1735741114354.jpg" alt="Keerthy Suresh flaunted a turmeric thread in first public appearance after marriage." title="Keerthy Suresh flaunted a turmeric thread in first public appearance after marriage."><figcaption>Keerthy Suresh flaunted a turmeric thread in first public appearance after marriage.</figcaption>
<p>Keerthy Suresh, the Tamil film actor, has been spotted wearing a turmeric thread around her neck instead of a gold mangalsutra since her marriage to long-time boyfriend Antony Thattil on December 12, 2024. In several public appearances post-wedding, including promotions for her film 'Baby John', Keerthy has been seen wearing the sacred thread. In a recent interview with Galatta India, Keerthy revealed the reason behind this choice.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Keerthy is wearing the turmeric thread as per tradition, which should not be removed until a certain date after marriage.</li>
  <li>She plans to change it to a gold chain on an auspicious date later in January.</li>
  <li>Keerthy chose to wear the thread openly as it is considered sacred and powerful, and she liked how it looked with her promotional outfits.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"There's a reason behind why I am wearing it to every promotion... I will be wearing till then. Somebody even told me that if you don't want to wear it with your promotional clothes... the reason why it is tied here is also because it should touch your chest. It is sacred and also supposed to be very powerful. Once you change it to the golden chain, it is going to look normal. Some said that I can even put it inside but I thought it looked hot! I am happy that I am flaunting it."</blockquote>
<p>After her wedding, Keerthy shared pictures from her D-Day on Instagram, captioned '#ForTheLoveOfNyke'.</p>
<p><em>Baby John</em>, directed by Kalees and presented by Atlee, released in cinemas on Christmas. The film also stars Wamiqa Gabbi, Jackie Shroff, Rajpal Yadav, and Salman Khan in a cameo.</p>]]></description>

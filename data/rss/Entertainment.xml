            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Fateh movie review: Sonu Sood tries his best to bring international action to desi screens.</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 10, 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/10/550x309/Fateh-review_1736504255240_1736504255673.webp" alt="Fateh review: Sonu Sood channels John Wick in this thriller." title="Fateh review: Sonu Sood channels John Wick in this thriller.">
<figcaption>Fateh review: Sonu Sood channels John Wick in this thriller.</figcaption>
<p>Sonu Sood’s directorial debut offers a high-octane blend of action and a narrative focused on cyber crime. While it showcases impressive action sequences, the film struggles with its screenplay and depth of storytelling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sonu Sood plays Fateh Singh, a former secret agent turned contract killer.</li>
<li>The plot centers around fake loan apps and a missing girl entangled in a global scam.</li>
<li>The film features excessive violence that overshadows the intended theme of cyber crime.</li>
<li>Jacqueliene Fernandez portrays an ethical hacker but has a limited role.</li>
<li>The action sequences aim for international standards but lack substantive storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The slick action stops evoking shock after a point, and the digital scam gets amateur treatment.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while Fateh attempts to bring a captivating visual experience, it ultimately falls short in delivering a meaningful narrative.</p>]]></description>

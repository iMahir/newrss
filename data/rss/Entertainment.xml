<figcaption>Mandira Bedi also worked on reality show, Cricket Ka Ticket.</figcaption>
<p>Mandira Bedi recalls her challenging early days as a cricket presenter during the 2003 World Cup, emphasizing the scrutiny she faced as a woman in a male-dominated space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mandira started her career in the early 2000s as a cricket presenter.</li>
  <li>Sharing her experience on Kareena Kapoor's show, she discussed the challenges she faced.</li>
  <li>Facing criticism and skepticism from cricket legends, she struggled initially.</li>
  <li>Over time, she gained confidence and demanded respect during her presentations.</li>
  <li>Only Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi showed her respect out of the legends she worked with.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“At the end of every show, I would put my head down and cry. The legends on either side of me, I would ask them questions, and they just stared at me.”</blockquote>
<p>Despite the initial disrespect, Mandira Bedi's journey highlights the evolving role of women in sports broadcasting.</p>]]></description>

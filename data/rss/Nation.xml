<p>The latest report by the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+) reveals alarming gaps in infrastructure across Indian schools, with many lacking essential facilities like electricity, functional toilets, and access to computers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of 14.71 lakh schools in India, 1.52 lakh have no functional electricity.</li>
<li>Only 67,000 schools operate without functional toilets, mainly affecting government schools.</li>
<li>Only 33.2% of government schools have disabled-friendly toilets, with fewer being functional.</li>
<li>50% of all schools lack access to computers for educational purposes.</li>
<li>Only 10.5% of schools have implemented solar panel facilities.</li>
<li>Only 17.5% of schools have co-curricular activity rooms or arts and crafts facilities.</li>
<li>In government secondary schools, 50.2% have science laboratory facilities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The condition is much worse when it comes to providing disabled-friendly facilities, with only 33.2% of schools having disabled-friendly toilets."</blockquote>
<p>This report underscores a significant need for improvement in the infrastructure of schools in India, especially for the government-run institutions.</p>]]></description>

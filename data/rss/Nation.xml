            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Assam Reports First Case of HMPV Infection This Season</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 11, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>

<p>Assam has reported its first case of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection this season, with a 10-month-old child testing positive. The infant is currently undergoing treatment at Assam Medical College and Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh and is said to be stable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ten-month-old child tests positive for HMPV in Dibrugarh, Assam.</li>
  <li>Child admitted to AMCH with cold-related symptoms four days ago.</li>
  <li>HMPV infection confirmed by ICMR-RMRC Lahowal after routine tests.</li>
  <li>HMPV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms.</li>
  <li>Similar HMPV cases reported in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The HMPV infection was confirmed yesterday after we got test results from Lahowal-based ICMR-RMRC. The child is stable now. It is a common virus, and there is nothing to worry about.” - Dr. Dhrubajyoti Bhuyan, AMCH superintendent</blockquote>
<p>The detection of HMPV is not unusual, as the virus circulates seasonally and typically impacts infants and individuals with weaker immune systems more severely.</p>]]></description>

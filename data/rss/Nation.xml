<p>The Winter Session of Parliament is nearing its end amid escalating tensions, particularly surrounding Home Minister Amit Shah's remarks about Dr. BR Ambedkar. This includes a recently filed FIR against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, where the serious charge of 'attempt to murder' has been removed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>High tension in Parliament with opposition MPs protesting Amit Shah's comments on BR Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi accused of pushing a BJP MP, Pratap Sarangi, during the protest, leading to injuries.</li>
  <li>JPC on 'One Nation, One Election' bills may be formally initiated; committee members include leaders from major parties.</li>
  <li>Nationwide protests planned by Congress against Amit Shah's remarks, calling for his resignation and apology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“BJP MPs blocked our path and instigated the violence,” claimed Rahul Gandhi during a press briefing.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the political landscape in India remains turbulent with ongoing protests and significant allegations, casting a shadow over the Winter Session of Parliament.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>People revolting against Naidu, says Jagan</figcaption>
<p>YSR Congress party president Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy states that public discontent is rising against the Chandrababu Naidu-led government in Andhra Pradesh and calls for protests to channel this dissent.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jagan claims that dissatisfaction with Naidu’s government has escalated significantly over the past six months.</li>
  <li>Protests are planned focusing on specific issues, including rising electricity charges and pending student grants.</li>
  <li>He highlights the negative impact of the TDP regime on farmers and essential agricultural initiatives.</li>
  <li>Jagan emphasizes the need for collective action and resilience among party workers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“These protests are not about politics; they are about standing by the people and amplifying their voices,” Jagan Mohan Reddy.</blockquote>

<p>Junior medics at the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital began an indefinite complete cease work following the suspension of six colleagues by the West Bengal government, allegedly for their role in a tragic incident involving a woman’s death after childbirth.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Doctors argue that the suspension aims to distract from ongoing corruption in the health department.</li>
  <li>The junior medics stated their protest began in solidarity with suspended colleagues.</li>
  <li>The government has suspended 12 doctors overall due to negligence related to administering 'expired' intravenous fluids.</li>
  <li>Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced actions to prevent further use of the disputed intravenous fluid in state-run hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"All junior doctors of the MMCH stand in solidarity with our fellow colleagues in this state of moral crisis, and announce complete cease work from today morning (8 AM)." - Junior medic</blockquote>
<p>This protest underlines the ongoing tensions within the healthcare system in West Bengal and raises questions about accountability and systemic issues.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India Scraps No-Detention Policy for Classes 5 and 8: What This Means for Students</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Dec 24, 2024<br><strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/24/550x309/no_detention_policy_1735016417039_1735016417555.jpg" alt="Severeal states and UTs have already scrapped the no-detention policy.(HT_PRINT/File image)" title="Severeal states and UTs have already scrapped the no-detention policy.(HT_PRINT/File image)">
<figcaption>Severeal states and UTs have already scrapped the no-detention policy.(HT_PRINT/File image)</figcaption>
<p>The Centre has ended the no-detention policy for students in Classes 5 and 8, meaning students who fail their year-end exams will no longer be automatically promoted. The policy revision allows for re-examination opportunities for those who do not meet promotion criteria.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The no-detention policy has been scrapped as part of the amendments to the Right to Education Act.</li>
  <li>18 states and Union Territories previously discontinued the no-detention policy.</li>
  <li>Students failing their exams will receive additional instruction and a chance for re-examination within two months.</li>
  <li>Teachers will assist students in identifying learning gaps during the holding period.</li>
  <li>No student can be expelled from school before completing elementary education.</li>
  <li>This change affects over 3,000 schools run by the central government, including Kendriya Vidyalayas.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If the child appearing in the re-examination fails to fulfil the promotion criteria again, he shall be held back in fifth class or eighth class, as the case may be."</blockquote>
<p>This significant educational policy shift focuses on improving student performance and understanding rather than rote memorization.</p>]]></description>

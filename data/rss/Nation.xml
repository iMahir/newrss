<p>A Kuki village chief dismissed claims that a woman was assaulted over a land-building issue in Manipur, urging the public not to be misled by what he describes as unfounded allegations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The woman and her brother alleged they were assaulted by Kuki tribesmen while attempting to build a house in K Lungwiram Naga village.</li>
  <li>Haopu Vaiphei, the village chief, stated that police intervened to prevent misunderstandings at the site.</li>
  <li>He suggested the incident escalated emotions in the community due to the woman's claims.</li>
  <li>A hearing regarding the land dispute has been scheduled for January 10, as investigations continue.</li>
  <li>The civil society group WKZIC condemned the “quit notice” era to Kukis issued by local authorities amid the dispute.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It was unfortunate that the said lady... made a video clip alleging physical assault which was totally baseless.” — Haopu Vaiphei</blockquote>
<p>This situation underlines rising tensions in Manipur over land ownership issues and reflects the complexities within tribal claims and local governance in the region.</p>]]></description>

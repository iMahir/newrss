<p>The Lok Sabha witnessed the introduction of bills aimed at holding simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, which garnered substantial support but faced sharp criticism from opposition parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal introduced two constitutional amendment bills for simultaneous elections.</li>
<li>A total of 269 MPs voted in favor of the bills while 198 opposed them.</li>
<li>The opposition, including Congress, Samajwadi Party, and Trinamool Congress, raised concerns about the constitutionality and potential threats to democratic processes.</li>
<li>Opposition MPs argued the bills undermine the Constitution's basic structure and are a step towards 'dictatorship.'</li>
<li>The bills propose amendments to hold mid-term elections only for the legislatures affected, delaying simultaneous elections until 2034.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Introduction, consideration of one nation, one election bills beyond the legislative competence of this House, urge govt to withdraw it,” said Congress MP Manish Tewari.</blockquote>
<p>The proposed changes have sparked widespread debate about their implications for democratic accountability and governance in India.</p>]]></description>

<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah accused the Congress party of twisting his remarks regarding B.R. Ambedkar, claiming they misrepresent his views on the Constitution. He proposed exploring legal actions against the party for these distortions.</p>

  <li>Shah argues that Congress has a history of distorting facts and misleading the public.</li>
  <li>Prime Minister Modi defended Shah's remarks and criticized Congress's narrative.</li>

  <li>The controversy is significant in the context of the recent Lok Sabha election results.</li>

<figcaption>Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray(PTI file photo)</figcaption>
<p>Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray condemned union minister Amit Shah's remarks about Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, labeling them as 'insolent' and questioned the NDA's response to the controversy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thackeray criticized Shah for saying that taking Ambedkar's name had become fashionable.</li>
<li>He demanded action from Prime Minister Modi against Shah for his comments.</li>
<li>The remarks led to protests by several MPs from the opposition INDIA bloc in Parliament.</li>
<li>Kiren Rijiju, minister for parliamentary affairs, defended Shah, accusing the Congress of insulting Ambedkar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The manner in which Amit Shah spoke in the Parliament yesterday, he displayed insolence... Who are you? Ambedkar ji is a personality not bound by any side." - Uddhav Thackeray</blockquote>
<p>This controversy highlights ongoing tensions between the BJP and opposition parties over representation and respect for historical figures like Dr. Ambedkar.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Umar Khalid. (HT Archive)(HT_PRINT)</figcaption>
<p>Umar Khalid, a former JNU student leader, has been granted seven days of interim bail by a Delhi court to attend a family wedding, marking a significant moment in his ongoing legal battle.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khalid was granted bail from December 28 to January 3, 2025.</li>
  <li>He has been in custody since September 2020 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).</li>
  <li>This is his first grant of bail after multiple applications over four years.</li>
  <li>Khalid's most recent bail request was previously denied on December 6.</li>
  <li>His lawyer argues that he should be treated equally to other co-accused who were granted bail.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Khalid has claimed there is no physical evidence linking him to the 2020 Delhi riots.</p></blockquote>
<p>This interim bail order is a notable development in the case that has caused significant public and media attention since the riots and Khalid's subsequent arrest.</p>]]></description>

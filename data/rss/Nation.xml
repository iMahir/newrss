<p>The Tamil Nadu Transport Minister S.S. Sivasankar has called for an apology from Governor R.N. Ravi after he walked out of the State Assembly without delivering his customary address, citing that the national anthem was not played after the Tamil Thai Vazhthu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Governor R.N. Ravi left the Assembly without addressing it, claiming an insult due to the anthem not being played.</li>
<li>Sivasankar criticized the Governor for continuing in office even after his tenure ended and for not respecting governmental traditions.</li>
<li>The Minister emphasized that the DMK has a strong record of patriotism and criticized the Governor's conduct.</li>
<li>Calls for the Governor’s resignation have arisen, reflecting public sentiment against his actions.</li>
<li>The traditional practice of playing Tamil Thai Vazhthu at the beginning and the national anthem at the end was reaffirmed by Sivasankar.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Governor behaves as though he is a great patriot. The DMK is not inferior to anyone when it comes to patriotism.”</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the incident has heightened tensions between the Tamil Nadu government and the Governor, with significant public backing for the Minister's claims against the Governor.</p>]]></description>

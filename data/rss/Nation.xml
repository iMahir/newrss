<p>The Supreme Court was informed about the location of a four-year-old boy in a custody battle after the suicide of his father, Atul Subhash. His mother, Nikita Singhania, revealed he is at a boarding school in Faridabad, Haryana.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The child is currently at a boarding school in Faridabad, Haryana.</li>
  <li>The Supreme Court is hearing a custody petition filed by Atul’s mother.</li>
  <li>Atul Subhash died by suicide on December 9, 2024, leaving behind a note accusing his wife’s family of harassment.</li>
  <li>Nikita Singhania was granted bail and assured the court of the child's well-being.</li>
  <li>The Karnataka High Court declined to quash a criminal complaint against Nikita regarding abetting Atul's suicide.</li>
</ul>

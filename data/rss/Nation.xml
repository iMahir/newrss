<p>The Councillor of Chushul in Ladakh has raised concerns over the installation of a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji by the Indian Army on Pangong Tso's banks, questioning its relevance to the region.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The statue, inaugurated on December 26, 2024, was built with contributions from serving and retired personnel of a Maratha unit.</li>
  <li>Local residents and veterans criticized the lack of consultation with the community regarding the statue's installation.</li>
  <li>Some veterans suggested that Zorawar Singh, a historical figure significant to Ladakh, would have been a more appropriate choice for the statue.</li>
  <li>The decision comes amidst a backdrop of recent controversies regarding military symbols and representations in the region.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As a local resident, I must voice my concerns about the Shivaji statue at Pangong. It was erected without local input, and I question its relevance to our unique environment and wildlife.” - Konchok Stanzin, Councillor of Chushul</blockquote>
<p>The installation has sparked a debate about cultural representation and the importance of preserving local history in context.</p>]]></description>

<p>Arvind Kejriwal has announced the Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana, promising ₹18,000 per month to priests and granthis if AAP wins the upcoming elections. This initiative is part of his broader Revdi Par Charcha campaign aimed at securing voter support.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scheme aims to honor temple priests and granthis in Delhi.</li>
  <li>Kejriwal described the payment as a token of respect rather than a salary.</li>
  <li>Registration for the scheme starts on December 31 at Hanuman Temple, Connaught Place.</li>
  <li>Other promised initiatives include enhancements in welfare schemes, healthcare improvements, and assistance for the middle class.</li>
  <li>Kejriwal has announced free healthcare for seniors, increased financial aid for women, and various guarantees for rickshaw drivers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Kejriwal stated, "A priest is a part of all of our family occasions... happy or sad; they are the ones who have carried forward the rituals from generation to generation. However, they have never paid attention to their families... and neither have we."</blockquote>
<p>This announcement is part of AAP's strategy to maintain power in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, focusing on fulfilling basic needs of citizens.</p>]]></description>

<li>Students accused Kishor of being absent when police used water cannons and batons against them.</li>
<li>Kishor arrived at the scene and faced angry protesters who demanded he step away.</li>
<li>Kishor's remark, "You take blankets from us and then show us attitude," escalated tensions.</li>
<li>The protest began on Dec 13, gaining support from politicians, educationists, and activists.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Protesters asked, "Where was Prashant Kishor during the lathicharge?"</blockquote>

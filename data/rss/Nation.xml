<p>The Congress has initiated a campaign demanding the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah over his comments deemed insulting to B.R. Ambedkar. The campaign, titled ‘Jai Bapu, Jai Bhim, Jai Samvidhan,’ spans from January 3 to January 26, culminating in a rally in Mhow, Ambedkar's birthplace.</p>
<ul>
<li>The campaign encourages village-level meetings to educate the public about alleged insults toward Ambedkar and the Constitution.</li>
<li>The initial rally was postponed due to national mourning for former PM Manmohan Singh.</li>
<li>Demands include Shah's resignation for derogatory remarks made about Ambedkar.</li>
<li>Accusations include the BJP’s attempts to demonize national leaders and undermine democracy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We reiterate our demand to sack Home Minister Amit Shah for his derogatory remarks against Dr. Ambedkar.” - Pawan Khera</blockquote>
<p>This campaign underscores growing tensions between the Congress and BJP regarding the legacy of Dr. Ambedkar and other national leaders.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why is Garmin banned in India? Athletes tracking sports activity with these popular devices may land in jail</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>Garmin devices are not entirely banned in India, but certain models that feature satellite communication can lead to legal trouble for users. Recent incidents involving foreigners have highlighted the risks associated with these gadgets.</p>
<h2>Key Points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Garmin devices using satellite communication, such as the Garmin inReach, are illegal in India without permission.</li>
<li>A Scottish hiker was detained at Delhi Airport for carrying a Garmin inReach.</li>
<li>Another foreign national faced similar issues with a Garmin Edge 540 GPS device.</li>
<li>The Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933 makes the use of such devices without licensing illegal.</li>
<li>Travelers are warned not to bring satellite phones or devices to India without prior approval.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Garmin was illegal here and that they were handing me over to the Police.” - Scottish hiker</blockquote>
<p>This highlights the importance for travelers to understand local regulations regarding technology and devices. The consequences of ignoring these laws can lead to serious legal action.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>UAPA Tribunal Upholds Five-Year Ban on Sikhs for Justice (SFJ)</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> <time datetime="2025-01-04T02:21:50.095Z" title="2025-01-04 02:21">04 Jan 2025, 2:21 am</time></p>

<p>The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal has upheld the Central government’s decision to impose a five-year ban on Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) as an unlawful association.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ban was initially declared in July 2024 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).</li>
<li>The tribunal noted SFJ's connections with Khalistani terror groups and collaboration with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).</li>
<li>Evidence presented included testimonies from 52 witnesses and substantial documentation of unlawful activities.</li>
<li>SFJ was implicated in a significant rise in unlawful activities, with FIRs increasing from 11 in 2019 to 122 by 2024.</li>
<li>The organization engaged in recruiting youth, financing terror operations, and issuing threats to Indian leaders.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“SFJ's activities posed direct threats to India’s national security.”</blockquote>
<p>The tribunal concluded that SFJ’s activities are a violation of UAPA and the Indian Constitution, thereby upholding the government's ban.</p>]]></description>

<p>The once-popular 'IIT Baba', Abhey Singh, abruptly exited the Maha Kumbh Mela, generating significant concern among his followers. His disappearance follows a series of media interactions that contributed to growing mental stress.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abhey Singh, known for his transition from aerospace engineering to spirituality, left the Maha Kumbh and Juna Akhada.</li>
  <li>His family and ashram sadhus are worried as he has been unreachable and cut off contact.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest mental stress and drug use contributed to his decision to leave.</li>
  <li>The Juna Akhada's strict media protocols may have led to friction over Singh's rising popularity.</li>
  <li>Singh has previously expressed his journey from engineering to seeking deeper spiritual meaning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You will keep searching for the meaning of life. I used to find that in engineering but never found my answers,” said Singh.</blockquote>
<p>Abhey Singh's sudden decision raises questions about the pressures faced by public figures in spiritual communities, warranting a call for more support and understanding.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The remarks by the bench came while discharging a bank manager of charge of abetting the suicide of a man who allegedly took his own life after being unable to repay the loan that he had availed from the bank. (Express File/Amit Mehra)</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that invoking abetment of suicide charges must not be done mechanically to comfort the deceased’s family. This judgment emphasizes the necessity of a higher legal threshold before such charges are applied.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The court discharged a bank manager accused of abetting a suicide linked to loan repayment issues.</li>
  <li>It criticized the casual application of Section 306 IPC by police, advocating for stricter adherence to legal standards.</li>
  <li>Justice Viswanathan emphasized genuine cases must not be overlooked while cautioning against procedural abuses.</li>
  <li>The court stated that emotional outbursts should not be interpreted as instigation to suicide.</li>
  <li>The decision sets a precedent for how law enforcement and courts should approach suicides connected to debt disputes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To attract the ingredient of Section 306, the accused should have abetted the commission of a suicide.”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling seeks to prevent the misuse of suicide abetment charges and ensure that only those responsible for instigating suicide face legal consequences.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a significant letter, 13 senior advocates of the Supreme Court have requested Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna to take action against Justice Shekhar Yadav of the Allahabad High Court for remarks made in a speech that they classify as hate speech, demanding a CBI investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The letter claims Justice Yadav's speech undermines judicial impartiality and constitutional values.</li>
<li>Advocates cite Yadav's inflammatory comments made at a public gathering organized by the VHP.</li>
<li>Concerns are raised about Justice Yadav's past, including opposition to his appointment by former Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud due to extremist links.</li>
<li>Yadav reportedly made divisive statements regarding religious communities, promoting a majoritarian view.</li>
<li>Advocates demand that the CBI file an FIR against him following a Supreme Court ruling regarding judicial conduct.</li>

<blockquote>“His use of the derogatory ‘kathmulla’ to refer to a section of Muslims is deeply disturbing,” the advocates stated.</blockquote>

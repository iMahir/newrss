            <title><![CDATA[Congress cries foul over NHRC appointments: Read who are Justices Rohinton, Joseph, Muralidhar and Qureshi, whose names were recommended by Rahul and Kharge - OpIndia]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Congress Criticizes NHRC Appointments Amid Controversy</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 24, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Various</p>
<p>On December 23, 2024, President Droupadi Murmu appointed retired Justice V Ramasubramanian as the Chairperson of the NHRC, along with two members. The Congress party has raised concerns over the selection process, calling it predetermined.</p>
<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Justice V Ramasubramanian appointed as NHRC Chairperson with Priyank Kanoongo and Bidyut Ranjan Sarangi as members.</li>
<li>Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge criticized the selection process as flawed.</li>
<li>The dissent letter cites a lack of consultation and claims the process ignored diversity concerns.</li>
<li>Gandhi and Kharge recommended Justices Rohinton Nariman and K M Joseph, citing their qualifications and representation of marginalized communities.</li>
<li>They argue that the NHRC's credibility relies on representing India's diversity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The selection process was fundamentally flawed. This departure undermines the principles of fairness and impartiality.” - excerpt from dissent letter by Gandhi and Kharge</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Congress's proposal of controversial figures brings into question their commitment to judicial impartiality and the strengthening of institutions.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong>December 19, 2023 | <strong>Source: </strong>Indian Express</p>
<p>In response to the Opposition's notice for his removal, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar emphasized that individuals in constitutional roles should not engage in settling scores and expressed concerns about actions that threaten national interests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dhankhar accused the Rajya Sabha Chairman of being “explicitly partisan” and criticized the opposition's motion as flawed.</li>
  <li>He quoted Chandra Shekhar, stating the notice against him was inadequate and hastily prepared.</li>
  <li>The Vice President highlighted the importance of expression and dialogue in a democracy.</li>
  <li>Dhankhar cautioned against orchestrated efforts that may harm national interests.</li>
  <li>The motion is viewed as a significant yet largely symbolic exercise by the opposition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If expression is qualified, compromised, or made subject to coercion, democratic values are flawed.” - Jagdeep Dhankhar</blockquote>
<p>This situation marks the first instance in India's parliamentary history where a no-confidence motion has been filed against a sitting Vice President, symbolizing ongoing tensions in political discourse.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Commission for Air Quality Management has revoked Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi-NCR as pollution levels continue to improve.</p>
<ul>
  <li>GRAP Stage 4 restrictions, which included a complete ban on construction activities and entry of certain vehicles, were implemented starting December 16.</li>
  <li>Current measures under stages 1, 2, and 3 will remain in effect to manage air quality.</li>
  <li>Delhi's air quality index (AQI) improved to a 'very poor' category level of 369 from severe levels early in the morning.</li>
  <li>Various areas recorded AQI levels still in the severe category, such as Anand Vihar at 439.</li>
<!-- More points can be added if needed -->
</ul>
<blockquote>"The air quality index of Delhi-NCR is continuously improving," said a sub-committee report.</blockquote>
<p>While restrictions have been lifted for stage 4, continual monitoring is underway to ensure air quality improvements are sustained.</p>]]></description>

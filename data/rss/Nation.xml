            <title><![CDATA[Congress cries foul over NHRC appointments: Read who are Justices Rohinton, Joseph, Muralidhar and Qureshi, whose names were recommended by Rahul and Kharge - OpIndia]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Congress Criticizes NHRC Appointments Amid Controversy</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 24, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Various</p>
<p>On December 23, 2024, President Droupadi Murmu appointed retired Justice V Ramasubramanian as the Chairperson of the NHRC, along with two members. The Congress party has raised concerns over the selection process, calling it predetermined.</p>
<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Justice V Ramasubramanian appointed as NHRC Chairperson with Priyank Kanoongo and Bidyut Ranjan Sarangi as members.</li>
<li>Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge criticized the selection process as flawed.</li>
<li>The dissent letter cites a lack of consultation and claims the process ignored diversity concerns.</li>
<li>Gandhi and Kharge recommended Justices Rohinton Nariman and K M Joseph, citing their qualifications and representation of marginalized communities.</li>
<li>They argue that the NHRC's credibility relies on representing India's diversity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The selection process was fundamentally flawed. This departure undermines the principles of fairness and impartiality.” - excerpt from dissent letter by Gandhi and Kharge</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Congress's proposal of controversial figures brings into question their commitment to judicial impartiality and the strengthening of institutions.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The Chhattisgarh High Court has ruled that raping a dead body does not constitute rape under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), rejecting an appeal by the mother of a 9-year-old Dalit girl who was raped and killed by two men in 2018.</p>
<ol><li>The high court upheld the trial court’s decision to acquit Neelkanth of rape charges since the prime accused Nitin Yadav had already killed the girl.</li><li>The court acknowledged the horrendous nature of necrophilia but stated that the law does not currently recognize it as rape.</li><li>The girl's mother had appealed against Neelkanth’s acquittal on charges of rape.</li></ol>
<blockquote>The court said, "There can be no disagreement on the issue that dignity and fair treatment is not only available to a living man but also to his dead body... but the law as on date has to be applied to the facts of the case and none of the offences... can be imposed upon the appellant-Neelkanth Nagesh."</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The high court dismissed the appeal, stating that the current law does not recognize raping a dead body as a punishable offense.</p>]]></description>

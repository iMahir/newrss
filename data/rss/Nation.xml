<p>The case revolves around the tragic death of Sachin Panchal, a contractor from Bidar, who allegedly ended his life by lying in front of a train. He left a suicide note accusing Minister Priyank Kharge’s aide and others of making death threats against him.</p>

  <li>Panchal's suicide note implicated Kapanur, alleging death threats and a plot to harm BJP leaders.</li>
  <li>Minister Eshwar Khandre visited Panchal's family, promising justice and compensation of ₹10 lakh.</li>
  <li>BJP has called for a CBI investigation, citing serious allegations from the suicide note.</li>
  <li>Priyank Kharge defended himself against accusations, stating his name was not mentioned in the note.</li>

<p>A tragic incident occurred in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district where a 10-year-old boy, Sumit Meena, lost his life after falling into a 140-feet borewell. Despite extensive rescue efforts lasting 16 hours, he was declared unresponsive upon retrieval.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sumit fell into the borewell around 5 p.m. on December 28, 2024, in Pipliya village.</li>
  <li>Rescue operations included the National Disaster Response Force and involved digging a parallel pit.</li>
  <li>Sumit was trapped at a depth of 39 feet for the entire night before being retrieved.</li>
  <li>Medical examination indicated he had endured hypothermia and was unresponsive upon being brought out.</li>
  <li>The borewell had not been properly secured as it did not strike water.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Sorry to say, he is no more,” Guna district chief medical and health officer Dr. Rajkumar Rishishwar told reporters.</blockquote>
<p>This tragic accident raises concerns regarding child safety and the need for better securing of borewells to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>]]></description>

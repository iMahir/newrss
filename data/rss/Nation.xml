            <description><![CDATA[<h1>‘Constitutional posts not to settle scores’: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar reacts to Opposition’s no-trust motion against him</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong>December 19, 2023 | <strong>Source: </strong>Indian Express</p>
<p>In response to the Opposition's notice for his removal, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar emphasized that individuals in constitutional roles should not engage in settling scores and expressed concerns about actions that threaten national interests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dhankhar accused the Rajya Sabha Chairman of being “explicitly partisan” and criticized the opposition's motion as flawed.</li>
  <li>He quoted Chandra Shekhar, stating the notice against him was inadequate and hastily prepared.</li>
  <li>The Vice President highlighted the importance of expression and dialogue in a democracy.</li>
  <li>Dhankhar cautioned against orchestrated efforts that may harm national interests.</li>
  <li>The motion is viewed as a significant yet largely symbolic exercise by the opposition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If expression is qualified, compromised, or made subject to coercion, democratic values are flawed.” - Jagdeep Dhankhar</blockquote>
<p>This situation marks the first instance in India's parliamentary history where a no-confidence motion has been filed against a sitting Vice President, symbolizing ongoing tensions in political discourse.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A Municipal body meeting in Chandigarh turned into a scuffle.(PTI screengrab)</figcaption>
<p>The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation meeting escalated into a physical scuffle between Congress and BJP councillors following remarks made by Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incident was triggered by a motion from Congress and AAP councillors demanding Amit Shah's resignation.</li>
    <li>A video of the altercation was shared on social media, showing councillors engaging in a physical fight captured by CCTV.</li>
    <li>Opposition parties accused Amit Shah of disrespecting Dr. BR Ambedkar, which he denied.</li>
    <li>Previous protests in Parliament have led to confrontations between BJP and Congress members regarding Shah's remarks.</li>
    <li>Prominent political figures, including Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge and BSP leader Mayawati, commented on the tensions between the parties.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BJP and the Congress are two sides of the same coin.” - Mayawati</blockquote>
<p>This scuffle illustrates the rising tensions within Indian politics, especially regarding sensitive historical figures such as Dr. Ambedkar and the ongoing disputes between political parties.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, a gym trainer from Agra, Sahil Sharma, posed as a RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) agent on the dating app Tinder, met a Canadian woman, and then allegedly raped her multiple times. The woman, a Canadian national of Indian origin, has filed a police complaint accusing Sharma and his friend of the crimes.</p>
<ul><li>Sharma met the woman on Tinder in March 2024 and allegedly drugged and raped her at an Agra hotel.</li>
<li>He later invited her back to India, and she alleged that he raped her several times in Agra and Delhi.</li>
<li>The woman also claimed that Sharma's friend, Arif Ali, raped her in a hotel bathroom.</li>
<li>The woman recently found out she was pregnant and reached out to Sharma, who then threatened her and posted her private photos online.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Notable Quote:</strong> "The accused, Sahil Sharma, has been booked by Uttar Pradesh police for 'rape' and 'criminal intimidation'," said Agra DCP city Suraj Rai.</p>
<p>Police have registered an FIR against the accused under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the IT Act. Efforts are on to arrest the accused men who are currently absconding.</p>]]></description>

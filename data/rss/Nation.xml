<h1>Chilling Murder-Suicide: UP Man Kills Family, Blames Land Mafia and Neighbors</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> Last Updated: January 01, 2025, 20:11 IST</p>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, a 24-year-old man from Uttar Pradesh named Arshad murdered his mother and four sisters before sharing a video of the crime online. Arshad was later arrested at the crime scene in Lucknow.</p>
<p>The chilling video, which emerged hours after the murders, shows Arshad alleging that neighbors and land mafia in their hometown of Budaun had captured their house and planned to traffic his sisters. He claimed that he killed his family members to prevent this from happening.</p>
<ol>
<li>Arshad choked and slit the wrists of his mother and sisters.</li>
<li>He blamed local land mafia and neighbors for harassing his family and capturing their house.</li>
<li>Arshad requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for justice.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have killed my mother and sisters. When police get this video, they must know that the locals are responsible. They harassed us to capture our house. We raised our voice, but no one heard. It has been 15 days that we have been sleeping on the footpath, wandering in the cold. We don’t want the children to wander in the cold. They have captured our house. The documents are with us."<br>
- Arshad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arshad also claimed that his family wanted to live peacefully and had approached many people for help, but no one assisted them. He expressed fear that his sisters were dying and that he himself would not live much longer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Delhi Bakery Owner Dies By Suicide Amid Divorce Dispute, Family Says 'Wife Mentally Tortured Him'</h1>

<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> <time>January 01, 2025, 19:50 IST</time> - <a href="/">News18</a></p>

<img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/07/1627283897_news18_logo-1200x800.jpg?impolicy=website&width=360&height=270" alt="Puneet Khurana" title="Puneet Khurana" width="360" height="270">
<p><figcaption>Puneet Khurana, owner of For God’s Cake bakery, was found hanging in his house in Model Town's Kalyan Vihar area. (Image: Twitter)</figcaption></p>

<p>Puneet Khurana, owner of For God’s Cake bakery, allegedly died by suicide amid an ongoing divorce dispute with his wife. He was found hanging in his house in Model Town’s Kalyan Vihar area. His family claimed that Puneet was "upset with his wife" and had been facing mental torture and harassment from her and her family.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The couple got married in 2016 and co-owned the bakery and another eatery called Woodbox Cafe.</li>
  <li>Puneet's last conversation was with his wife, discussing their bakery business. His family claims the wife recorded the conversation and sent it to her relatives.</li>
  <li>Puneet's sister accused his wife and her family of mental torture and harassment, with a 59-minute video recording as evidence.</li>
  <li>The case comes weeks after a similar incident involving a Bengaluru-based techie.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notable Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
"You are calling me at 3 am, can’t you sleep? You disrespected me and my family."
- Puneet Khurana's wife, as per India Today
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion: The incident has once again highlighted the issue of mental harassment and torture within marriages, with calls for stricter laws and better support systems for victims.</p>

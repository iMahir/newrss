            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why is Garmin banned in India? Athletes tracking sports activity with these popular devices may land in jail</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>Garmin devices are not entirely banned in India, but certain models that feature satellite communication can lead to legal trouble for users. Recent incidents involving foreigners have highlighted the risks associated with these gadgets.</p>
<h2>Key Points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Garmin devices using satellite communication, such as the Garmin inReach, are illegal in India without permission.</li>
<li>A Scottish hiker was detained at Delhi Airport for carrying a Garmin inReach.</li>
<li>Another foreign national faced similar issues with a Garmin Edge 540 GPS device.</li>
<li>The Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933 makes the use of such devices without licensing illegal.</li>
<li>Travelers are warned not to bring satellite phones or devices to India without prior approval.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Garmin was illegal here and that they were handing me over to the Police.” - Scottish hiker</blockquote>
<p>This highlights the importance for travelers to understand local regulations regarding technology and devices. The consequences of ignoring these laws can lead to serious legal action.</p>]]></description>

<p>A 66-year-old father has approached the Bombay High Court seeking permission to terminate the pregnancy of his 27-year-old daughter, who has below-average intelligence and refuses to consent to the procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>The daughter is over 20 weeks pregnant and has not revealed the identity of the child's father.</li>
<li>The court criticized the father's parenting choices and referred the case to a medical board for evaluation.</li>
<li>The father claims financial constraints and old age are reasons for seeking termination, but the court rejected these claims.</li>
<li>The court emphasized parental responsibility and questioned the parent's actions regarding their daughter's wellbeing.</li>
<li>The case is set to be reviewed further after the medical board’s assessment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What kind of parenting is this?” - Bombay High Court</blockquote>
<p>The court's decision will reflect on parental responsibilities and the implications of consent in sensitive matters like termination of pregnancy.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India condemned the recent Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan that resulted in the deaths of over 40 individuals, calling it an "old habit" of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its failures.</p>
<ul>
<li>India's MEA noted the media reports on the airstrikes affecting civilians in Afghanistan.</li>
<li>The Pakistani airstrikes occurred in the Barmal district of Paktika province.</li>
<li>At least 46 people, including women and children, were reported dead.</li>
<li>Major casualties were reported in Laman, including five members of a single family.</li>
<li>The airstrikes led to cross-border clashes between Afghan forces and Pakistani paramilitary soldiers.</li>
<li>India condemned the attack on innocent civilians.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We unequivocally condemn any attack on innocent civilians. It is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures.” - Randhir Jaiswal</blockquote>
<p>This incident has raised tensions at the border, with violent clashes following the attacks.</p>]]></description>

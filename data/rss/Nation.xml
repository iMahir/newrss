<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 28, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Law</p>

<img src='image_url_here' alt='Supreme Court in session' />
<figcaption>The Supreme Court is concerned about the health of farmers' leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal.</figcaption>
<p>Dallewal, who is battling cancer, has been on a fast-unto-death since November 26, demanding the government provide statutory guarantees for Minimum Support Prices. The court will further review the situation on December 31.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court has recorded dissatisfaction with Punjab's report on Dallewal's health.</li>
  <li>Dallewal's health is reportedly deteriorating as he remains on a hunger strike.</li>
  <li>The state claims there could be 'collateral damage' if Dallewal is forcibly removed for medical treatment.</li>
  <li>Justice Kant criticized the current situation, questioning the motives of farmers' leaders.</li>
  <li>The Punjab government and police are under scrutiny for their handling of the protests surrounding Dallewal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is actually abetment to suicide... You first create a problem and then take a plea.” - Justice Dhulia</blockquote>
<p>The situation is critical and highlights broader discussions about farmers' rights and governmental responsibilities in health emergencies.</p>]]></description>

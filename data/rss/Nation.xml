<figcaption>Farmers have been protesting for months over several demands, including a legal guarantee of MSP, on the borders of Delhi. (PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Farmers, led by Jagjit Singh Dallewal, are calling on the Supreme Court to enforce the parliamentary committee's recommendation for a legally guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) for farm produce.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dallewal is on a fast-unto-death to push for the implementation of the MSP law.</li>
  <li>The parliamentary standing committee has emphasized the need for legally guaranteed MSPs for farmers.</li>
  <li>The report suggests the agriculture ministry should create a roadmap for implementing MSP.</li>
  <li>MSPs are intended to provide a minimum price to prevent distress sales among farmers.</li>
  <li>The committee's report discusses the advantages of implementing MSP as a legal guarantee to enhance rural economic growth.</li>
  <li>If not implemented, the government must provide a formal explanation to the committee.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Implementing a legally binding MSP in India is essential not only for safeguarding farmers’ livelihoods but also for promoting rural economic growth.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the farmers' plea, supported by the parliamentary committee, highlights the critical need for legal guarantees to ensure fair compensation for farmers’ produce, which could lead to sustainable farming practices.</p>]]></description>

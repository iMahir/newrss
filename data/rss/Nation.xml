<p>The Hyderabad Police have booked Telugu actor Venkatesh Daggubati and three family members for the illegal demolition of Deccan Kitchen Hotel in January 2024, despite a court injunction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The booking follows a local court's directive to file a case against the Daggubati family.</li>
<li>Venkatesh’s nephew, Rana Daggubati, and his father and brother were also implicated.</li>
<li>Nanda Kumar, the leased property's tenant, claims a loss of ₹20 crore due to the demolition.</li>
<li>The property was previously partially demolished by GHMC for being unauthorized.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Despite an injunction pending from the City Civil Court and against orders from the Telangana high court, the hotel was razed.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident raises significant legal and ethical questions about property rights and the implications of celebrity influence in local governance.</p>]]></description>

<p>BJP MLA Mohan Singh Bisht has criticized his party for its decision to grant a ticket to former AAP leader Kapil Mishra for the upcoming assembly elections in Karawal Nagar.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bisht describes the decision as a “big mistake.”</li>
  <li>He expresses concern over the BJP’s belief that any candidate can win.</li>
  <li>Bisht will run for re-election from Karawal Nagar, stating he won’t contest from any other seat.</li>
  <li>There is growing resentment within the BJP regarding ticket distribution, evidenced by protests outside the party office.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BJP thinks they will field anyone and he will win. This is a big mistake. Only time will tell what will happen...” - Mohan Singh Bisht</blockquote>
<p>Bisht's critiques point to a broader dissatisfaction with the party's candidate selection process, which he claims favors flatterers over hardworking grassroots members. The situation may have further implications as the election approaches.</p>]]></description>

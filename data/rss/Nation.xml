<p>Veterans have expressed concerns over the introduction of religious themes in military symbols following the controversial removal of a historic painting commemorating the 1971 India-Pakistan war from the Army chief's lounge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brigadier Inder Mohan Singh from the IESL questioned the relevance of introducing religion in the armed forces.</li>
<li>The painting was replaced with a new artwork that included cultural symbols like Garuda and Krishna's chariot.</li>
<li>Mohan emphasized that the removal was seen as an attack on historical military heritage.</li>
<li>The new painting, 'Karam Kshetra - Field of Deeds', features modern military equipment along with historically significant imagery.</li>
<li>Mohan called to gift the historical painting to the IESL for preservation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To finish photos which reflect history is an unpardonable act.” – Brigadier Inder Mohan Singh</blockquote>
<p>The discussion continues as veterans seek clarity on how these changes reflect the values and traditions of the armed forces.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
<li>The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill have been directed to the Joint Parliamentary Committee for further discussion.</li>

<li>Congress and Shiv Sena issued whips to ensure their members' attendance in discussions about the bill.</li>
<li>The Rajya Sabha is conducting a two-day debate commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Constitution.</li>

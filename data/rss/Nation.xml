<p><strong>Published on:</strong> <time datetime="2024-12-27T07:34:22.142Z">27 Dec 2024, 7:34 am</time></p>
<p>The Supreme Court has raised concerns regarding farmers obstructing medical assistance to Jagjit Singh Dallewal, who is on a fast unto death. The court has ordered the Punjab government to ensure medical care for him.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court questioned farmers for obstructing medical aid to Dallewal.</li>
  <li>Justices Surya Kant and Sudhanshu Dhulia expressed serious doubts about the protests.</li>
  <li>The court emphasized the urgency of providing medical aid, stating a life is at stake.</li>
  <li>Punjab government faced scrutiny for not complying with prior orders to hospitalize Dallewal.</li>
  <li>Dallewal is on an indefinite fast demanding a legal guarantee of minimum support price for crops.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Justice Kant stated, "Somebody's life at stake. You need to take it seriously. Medical aid has to be given and the impression is that you are not following it.".</blockquote>
<p>The court has ordered compliance from the Punjab officials by tomorrow and expressed its primary concern for Dallewal's health and safety.</p>]]></description>

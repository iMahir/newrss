  <li>The UK Ministry of Defence stated that there is no record of a soldier by that name currently serving in the British Army.</li>
  <li>Punjab Police claimed Singh was part of a terror module under the Khalistan Zindabad Force, targeting religious leaders.</li>
  <li>Singh’s name appeared in multiple investigations related to terrorism dating back to 2011.</li>

<p>The interim government of Bangladesh, led by Muhammad Yunus, has requested India's extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, stating they will wait for a formal response before escalating the request.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bangladesh sent a diplomatic note to India seeking Hasina's extradition for judicial proceedings.</li>
  <li>Under the 2013 extradition treaty, Bangladesh argues for her return, citing various charges against her.</li>
  <li>If India does not respond within what Bangladesh calls ‘natural time’, they will follow up with a note of urgency.</li>
  <li>Hasina is accused of serious charges, including murder and crimes against humanity related to protests earlier this year.</li>
  <li>Yunus’ interim government has been proactive in seeking Hasina's return since taking office in August.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We informed the Indian government through a Note Verbale that we want her (Hasina) back for the judicial process.” - Touhid Hossain, advisor on foreign affairs</blockquote>
<p>The Yunus administration stresses the importance of timely communication with India regarding this sensitive diplomatic matter.</p>]]></description>

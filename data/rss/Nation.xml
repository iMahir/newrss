<p>The death sentence imposed on Indian nurse Nimisha Priya by a Yemeni court is controlled by the Houthi militia and has not been ratified by President Rashad al-Alimi, according to Yemen's embassy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nimisha Priya is currently in jail in Sana'a, Yemen, which is under Houthi control.</li>
<li>She was sentenced to death for the murder of a Yemeni citizen in 2017.</li>
<li>The Yemeni embassy clarified the case did not receive presidential approval.</li>
<li>India is offering all possible help to assist Nimisha Priya.</li>
<li>Priya’s mother has been fundraising to pay “blood money” to secure her release.</li>

<blockquote>This is my final plea. She has only a few days left. I beg the Centre and the council to do everything possible to save her life.</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nehru's 1954 Kumbh Visit and the Tragic Stampede</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> OP India</p>

<p>The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 is slated to begin in Prayagraj on January 13, with expectations to host over 40-45 crore people globally. However, it recalls a tragic past during Nehru's visit in 1954, when a stampede claimed the lives of thousands of devotees due to ineffective crowd management.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Kumbh Mela is one of the world’s largest religious gatherings and is expected to take place from January 13 to February 26 in Prayagraj.</li>
  <li>The preparations include massive infrastructure and security measures to prevent past issues such as overcrowding and mismanagement.</li>
  <li>During the 1954 Kumbh Mela, a stampede occurred on Mauni Amavasya, resulting in the deaths of around 2000 individuals.</li>
  <li>Inadequate arrangements and miscommunication led to chaos when Prime Minister Nehru visited, as security measures blocked devotees while officials enjoyed refreshments.</li>
  <li>The previous government attempted to suppress information about the stampede, leading to public outrage.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“When Nehru visited the Kumbh, thousands died due to mismanagement, but this was hidden to protect his legacy.” - PM Modi</blockquote>
<p>The 1954 incident underscores the importance of adequate planning in managing large-scale religious events. The current government claims significant improvements have been made for the upcoming Kumbh Mela 2025.</p>]]></description>

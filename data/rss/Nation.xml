<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong>December 19, 2023 | <strong>Source: </strong>Indian Express</p>
<p>In response to the Opposition's notice for his removal, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar emphasized that individuals in constitutional roles should not engage in settling scores and expressed concerns about actions that threaten national interests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dhankhar accused the Rajya Sabha Chairman of being “explicitly partisan” and criticized the opposition's motion as flawed.</li>
  <li>He quoted Chandra Shekhar, stating the notice against him was inadequate and hastily prepared.</li>
  <li>The Vice President highlighted the importance of expression and dialogue in a democracy.</li>
  <li>Dhankhar cautioned against orchestrated efforts that may harm national interests.</li>
  <li>The motion is viewed as a significant yet largely symbolic exercise by the opposition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If expression is qualified, compromised, or made subject to coercion, democratic values are flawed.” - Jagdeep Dhankhar</blockquote>
<p>This situation marks the first instance in India's parliamentary history where a no-confidence motion has been filed against a sitting Vice President, symbolizing ongoing tensions in political discourse.</p>]]></description>

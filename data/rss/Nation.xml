<p>The once-popular 'IIT Baba', Abhey Singh, abruptly exited the Maha Kumbh Mela, generating significant concern among his followers. His disappearance follows a series of media interactions that contributed to growing mental stress.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abhey Singh, known for his transition from aerospace engineering to spirituality, left the Maha Kumbh and Juna Akhada.</li>
  <li>His family and ashram sadhus are worried as he has been unreachable and cut off contact.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest mental stress and drug use contributed to his decision to leave.</li>
  <li>The Juna Akhada's strict media protocols may have led to friction over Singh's rising popularity.</li>
  <li>Singh has previously expressed his journey from engineering to seeking deeper spiritual meaning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You will keep searching for the meaning of life. I used to find that in engineering but never found my answers,” said Singh.</blockquote>
<p>Abhey Singh's sudden decision raises questions about the pressures faced by public figures in spiritual communities, warranting a call for more support and understanding.</p>]]></description>

<p>The BJP has filed a complaint challenging the nomination of Arvind Kejriwal for the New Delhi Assembly seat, citing income discrepancies, failure to disclose criminal cases, and voter registration issues.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The complaint was filed by BJP candidate Parvesh Verma.</li>
    <li>Allegations include incorrect income figures reported in Kejriwal's affidavits for the years 2019-2023.</li>
    <li>Concerns were raised regarding Kejriwal’s voter registration, which reportedly appears in multiple locations.</li>
    <li>The complaint also highlights four FIRs against Kejriwal that were not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Delhi Assembly elections for all 70 constituencies are scheduled for February 5, with results on February 8.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I have filed the nomination. I would like to tell the people of Delhi that please vote for work...” - Arvind Kejriwal</blockquote>

<figcaption>Bangladesh’s latest demand for Sheikh Hasina’s extradition has illustrated how the country’s political crisis has cemented itself as one of the most pressing quandaries in the complex tapestry of India’s neighbourhood policy.</figcaption>
<p>Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has claimed there were several conspiracies to assassinate her throughout her life, highlighting her narrow escape from an alleged attempt last year. She emphasized that her survival is due to a will of Allah.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hasina alleges multiple assassination attempts, with the latest occurring on August 5, 2024.</li>
<li>Over 600 casualties were reported during protests against her government.</li>
<li>She currently resides in India after fleeing her country due to the political crisis.</li>
<li>Hasina faces arrest warrants in Bangladesh related to crimes during her premiership.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Surviving the killings on August 21, or surviving the huge bomb in Kotalipara, there must be a will of Allah.”</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the ongoing political instability in Bangladesh and the contentious allegations against Hasina, now in exile.</p>]]></description>

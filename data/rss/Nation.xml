            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Air Quality Deteriorates in Delhi: GRAP III Restrictions Implemented and Schools Transition to Hybrid Learning</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 16, 2024 - <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>

<p>The Central air quality panel has enacted Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) due to a significant decline in air quality in Delhi-NCR. As part of this, schools will transition to hybrid learning for students up to Class V.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reached 367, marking a severe drop.</li>
<li>Stage III mandates that students learn in a hybrid format, balancing online and in-person classes.</li>
<li>The rules include a ban on non-essential diesel-operated vehicles of older standards within Delhi.</li>
<li>Exemptions apply for persons with disabilities regarding certain vehicle restrictions.</li>
<li>Digression of timings for public offices may also be implemented to manage traffic and air quality.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Considering the highly unfavourable meteorological conditions… the panel’s sub-committee on Graded Response Action Plan decides to impose stage 3 of the revised GRAP schedule… with immediate effect,”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, these measures aim to mitigate the effects of poor air quality in Delhi and its neighboring regions during the winter months.</p>]]></description>

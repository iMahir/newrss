<p>A tragic incident occurred in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district where a 10-year-old boy, Sumit Meena, lost his life after falling into a 140-feet borewell. Despite extensive rescue efforts lasting 16 hours, he was declared unresponsive upon retrieval.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sumit fell into the borewell around 5 p.m. on December 28, 2024, in Pipliya village.</li>
  <li>Rescue operations included the National Disaster Response Force and involved digging a parallel pit.</li>
  <li>Sumit was trapped at a depth of 39 feet for the entire night before being retrieved.</li>
  <li>Medical examination indicated he had endured hypothermia and was unresponsive upon being brought out.</li>
  <li>The borewell had not been properly secured as it did not strike water.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Sorry to say, he is no more,” Guna district chief medical and health officer Dr. Rajkumar Rishishwar told reporters.</blockquote>
<p>This tragic accident raises concerns regarding child safety and the need for better securing of borewells to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) announced it will not conduct a re-examination for the 70th Combined Competitive Preliminary Examination (CCE Prelims) statewide, citing no basis or evidence for such a decision.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BPSC stated that decisions about re-tests are made based on reports from district officers.</li>
  <li>No reports or evidence have been submitted to justify a re-examination, according to BPSC's exam controller.</li>
  <li>Only one exam centre (Bapu exam centre in Patna) faced issues that warranted attention.</li>
  <li>The commission faces protests demanding a revocation of the CCE Preliminary exam results due to alleged irregularities.</li>
  <li>Political figures express support for the protesters who have been demonstrating for over a week.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As far as the question of conducting re-examination…it is clarified that neither any report has been made available before the commission by any district officer nor any evidence/proof has been received.” - Rajesh Kumar, BPSC's exam controller</blockquote>
<p>This decision comes amidst ongoing protests and concerns regarding the integrity of the examination process.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rahul Gandhi Criticizes Government for Denying Burial Site to Manmohan Singh</h1>

<figcaption>Rahul Gandhi pays last respects to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</figcaption>
<p>The political dispute regarding the memorial for former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh intensified after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi condemned the government for performing his last rites at Nigambodh Ghat instead of an authorized burial site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi labels the government's actions as a "total insult" to Singh.</li>
  <li>He urges that Singh deserved a memorial that reflects his stature and contributions.</li>
  <li>The Aam Aadmi Party demands an apology from the government for the treatment of Singh's last rites.</li>
  <li>Critics highlight the disparity in memorial treatment compared to other former prime ministers.</li>
  <li>Union Home Minister Amit Shah states that space for a memorial will be allocated later.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To date, respecting the dignity of all former Prime Ministers, their last rites were performed at authorized burial sites…”</blockquote>
<p>This controversy raises questions about the respect given to former leaders and the implications of political actions in times of national mourning.</p>]]></description>

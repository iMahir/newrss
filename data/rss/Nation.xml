            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Objectionable That Arvind Kejriwal Called Atishi Temporary: Lt Governor</h1>
<p><strong>Date: </strong> Not specified | <strong>Source: </strong> Not specified</p>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong> Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena expressed his discontent over Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's reference to Atishi as a 'temporary Chief Minister', stating it undermines democratic principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saxena stated he was 'hurt' by Kejriwal's comment.</li>
<li>He emphasized that the term 'temporary Chief Minister' does not exist in the Constitution.</li>
<li>The LG praised Atishi for her governance efforts, contrasting her work with that of her predecessor, Kejriwal.</li>
<li>He listed areas where he believes the government has failed, while acknowledging Kejriwal's admissions of shortcomings.</li>
<li>Assembly elections in Delhi are scheduled for February next year.</li>
<li>Saxena had previously referred to Atishi as 'a thousand times better' than Kejriwal.</li>
<li>Atishi has yet to respond to the criticisms made by Saxena.</li>
<li>There was a prior incident in which Saxena overruled Atishi's request to hoist the national flag on Independence Day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This is the first time in my two-and-a-half-year tenure that I am seeing a Chief Minister discharge the duties of a Chief Minister." - Lt Governor VK Saxena</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong> The ongoing tensions between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister highlight the political dynamics in Delhi ahead of the upcoming elections.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Councillor of Chushul in Ladakh has raised concerns over the installation of a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji by the Indian Army on Pangong Tso's banks, questioning its relevance to the region.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The statue, inaugurated on December 26, 2024, was built with contributions from serving and retired personnel of a Maratha unit.</li>
  <li>Local residents and veterans criticized the lack of consultation with the community regarding the statue's installation.</li>
  <li>Some veterans suggested that Zorawar Singh, a historical figure significant to Ladakh, would have been a more appropriate choice for the statue.</li>
  <li>The decision comes amidst a backdrop of recent controversies regarding military symbols and representations in the region.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As a local resident, I must voice my concerns about the Shivaji statue at Pangong. It was erected without local input, and I question its relevance to our unique environment and wildlife.” - Konchok Stanzin, Councillor of Chushul</blockquote>
<p>The installation has sparked a debate about cultural representation and the importance of preserving local history in context.</p>]]></description>

<p>Arvind Kejriwal has announced the Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana, promising ₹18,000 per month to priests and granthis if AAP wins the upcoming elections. This initiative is part of his broader Revdi Par Charcha campaign aimed at securing voter support.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scheme aims to honor temple priests and granthis in Delhi.</li>
  <li>Kejriwal described the payment as a token of respect rather than a salary.</li>
  <li>Registration for the scheme starts on December 31 at Hanuman Temple, Connaught Place.</li>
  <li>Other promised initiatives include enhancements in welfare schemes, healthcare improvements, and assistance for the middle class.</li>
  <li>Kejriwal has announced free healthcare for seniors, increased financial aid for women, and various guarantees for rickshaw drivers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Kejriwal stated, "A priest is a part of all of our family occasions... happy or sad; they are the ones who have carried forward the rituals from generation to generation. However, they have never paid attention to their families... and neither have we."</blockquote>
<p>This announcement is part of AAP's strategy to maintain power in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, focusing on fulfilling basic needs of citizens.</p>]]></description>

<p>BPSC aspirants protested at Gandhi Maidan, demanding a re-examination of the 70th BPSC preliminary exam and a meeting with Nitish Kumar. A heated exchange occurred between students and Prashant Kishor when aspirants accused him of being absent during police action against the protesters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Students accused Kishor of being absent when police used water cannons and batons against them.</li>
<li>Kishor arrived at the scene and faced angry protesters who demanded he step away.</li>
<li>Kishor's remark, "You take blankets from us and then show us attitude," escalated tensions.</li>
<li>The protest began on Dec 13, gaining support from politicians, educationists, and activists.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Protesters asked, "Where was Prashant Kishor during the lathicharge?"</blockquote>
<p>After his eviction, Kishor addressed a press conference, refuting allegations, reaffirming support for the students' cause, and condemning police action. He plans to file an FIR against Patna Police and join the protest if no resolution is reached.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Vijay Mallya’s extradition was cleared by the UK high court in April 2020 but has been held up for two-and-half years now.(Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>Vijay Mallya, a fugitive businessman, claims that he has paid off more than double the amount owed on his Kingfisher Airlines debt. He asserts that banks have recovered over ₹14,131 crore from him, while the Debt Recovery Tribunal stated the debt was ₹6,203 crore.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mallya claims bank recoveries exceed twice the debt he was adjudged to owe.</li>
<li>He argues that he is entitled to relief unless excess recovery is legally justified.</li>
<li>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman confirmed the recovery of properties worth ₹14,131 crore belonging to Mallya.</li>
<li>Mallya asserts his innocence, claiming he neither borrowed unlawfully nor stole funds.</li>
<li>He has been seeking extradition to India but faces ongoing resistance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Unless the ED and Banks can legally justify how they have taken more than two times the debt, I am entitled to relief which I will pursue," Mallya stated.</blockquote>
<p>This controversy highlights ongoing disputes about Mallya's financial dealings and the broader implications for financial accountability in India.</p>]]></description>

<p>On December 19, 2024, Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of B.R. Ambedkar, asserted that Union Home Minister Amit Shah's comments regarding the father of the Constitution showed the BJP's outdated mindset. His remarks prompted protests from the INDIA bloc in Parliament.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ambedkar accused Shah of disrespecting B.R. Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>He emphasized that the BJP's previous incarnations had opposed Ambedkar during the Constitution's adoption.</li>
  <li>Congress members also called for Shah to apologize publicly.</li>
  <li>Ambedkar demanded compensation for the family of Somnath Suryawanshi who died in judicial custody during related protests.</li>
  <li>He warned that the passage of new election bills could threaten the future of political parties.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"HM @AmitShah, in case you didn't know - Babasaheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar is equivalent to God and the Constitution he drafted is a Holy Book for crores of people across the world. How dare you speak about Dr. Ambedkar with such disdain?" — K C Venugopal</blockquote>
<p>Ambedkar's statements reflect ongoing tensions regarding the political portrayal of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in contemporary discourse.</p>]]></description>

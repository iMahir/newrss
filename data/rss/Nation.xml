(Representational photo)(HT File)</figcaption>
<p>An engineering student in Maharashtra's Nagpur allegedly killed his parents over differences regarding his academic record and career, news agency PTI reported. The 25-year-old accused, Utkarsh Dhakhole, killed his parents at their residence in Kapil Nagar area on December 26. He also hid their bodies and told his relatives that his parents had gone to Bengaluru to take part in a meditation programme. Days later, Dhakole's neighbours complained to the police of a foul smell in the neighbourhood, leading to the discovery of the bodies and his arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The victim's parents wanted him to quit engineering due to his poor academic record.</li>
<li>Utkarsh allegedly strangled his mother and stabbed his father to death.</li>
<li>He confessed to the crime during police investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notable Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>“Utkarsh failed to clear several subjects during his engineering course. His parents, therefore, wanted him to quit engineering and choose something else. However, he was against their suggestion,” the official added.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The incident serves as a grim reminder of the pressure students face regarding academic expectations and career choices, often leading to tragic consequences.</p>]]></description>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, a 24-year-old man from Uttar Pradesh named Arshad murdered his mother and four sisters before sharing a video of the crime online. Arshad was later arrested at the crime scene in Lucknow.</p>
<p>The chilling video, which emerged hours after the murders, shows Arshad alleging that neighbors and land mafia in their hometown of Budaun had captured their house and planned to traffic his sisters. He claimed that he killed his family members to prevent this from happening.</p>
<ol>
<li>Arshad choked and slit the wrists of his mother and sisters.</li>
<li>He blamed local land mafia and neighbors for harassing his family and capturing their house.</li>
<li>Arshad requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for justice.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have killed my mother and sisters. When police get this video, they must know that the locals are responsible. They harassed us to capture our house. We raised our voice, but no one heard. It has been 15 days that we have been sleeping on the footpath, wandering in the cold. We don’t want the children to wander in the cold. They have captured our house. The documents are with us."<br>
- Arshad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arshad also claimed that his family wanted to live peacefully and had approached many people for help, but no one assisted them. He expressed fear that his sisters were dying and that he himself would not live much longer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Student Murders Parents over Disagreement on Career Path</h1>
<p><strong>Published on 01 January 2025, 14:31 IST</strong></p>
<img src='' alt=''>
<p>A 25-year-old engineering student in Nagpur, Maharashtra, allegedly killed his parents due to disagreements over his education and career, with police arresting him on Wednesday. Utkarsh Dhakhole, the accused, confessed to strangling his mother, a teacher, and stabbing his father, a power plant technician and social worker, to death.</p>
<ul>
<li>The motive appears to be a dispute over Utkarsh's struggling academic record and career.</li>
<li>Utkarsh's parents wanted him to quit engineering, but he was against their suggestion.</li>
<li>After the murder, Utkarsh took his sister to their uncle's residence and claimed that their parents had gone to Bengaluru for a meditation program.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The decomposed bodies of the parents were recovered on Wednesday morning after neighbors complained of a foul smell.</blockquote>
<p>The deceased were identified as Liladhar Dhakhole (55) and his 50-year-old wife Aruna.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Congress MP and LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and party president Mallikarjun Kharge attend the extended two-day Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, ‘Nav Satyagrah Baithak’, in Belagavi on December 26, 2024.</figcaption>
<p>The Congress party is set to combine the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar into a coherent narrative of social justice, launching a campaign that will commence on January 3, 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>The campaign follows a pause due to the passing of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.</li>
<li>The CWC endorsed a month-long program culminating on January 26, 2025, at Mhow, the birthplace of Dr. Ambedkar.</li>
<li>The initiative emphasizes the need to protect the Constitution and the ideals of the Indian Independence Movement.</li>
<li>The Congress aims to reconnect its politics of social justice with the legacies of both leaders.</li>
<li>The movement will extend into a nationwide public outreach program from January 26, 2025, to January 26, 2026.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The CWC and the Indian National Congress are fiercely committed to protecting the Indian Constitution and the ideals of the Indian Independence Movement.”</blockquote>
<p>This effort represents an ambitious attempt to address complex historical narratives and the differences between Gandhi and Ambedkar regarding caste and social reform.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> The Tribune</p>
<p>The government has initiated the process to identify a site for a memorial dedicated to former prime minister Manmohan Singh and is actively consulting with his family to determine the location.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has surveyed sites near the Sanjay Gandhi memorial and has identified potential spots for the memorial.</li>
  <li>Consultations with Singh's family are ongoing, discussing three to four location options.</li>
  <li>No definitive site has been chosen yet; everything will be finalized in collaboration with Singh's family.</li>
  <li>A trust will be established before the selected land is allocated for the memorial.</li>
  <li>Singh, known as the architect of India’s economic reforms, passed away on December 26 at the age of 92.</li>
  <li>The cremation and subsequent memorial plans have sparked a political debate between BJP and Congress parties.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Congress criticised the government for holding his last rites at Nigambodh Ghat.”</blockquote>
<p>The establishment of a memorial for Manmohan Singh reflects the government's acknowledgment of his contributions to India's economic landscape, though the process has been marked by political contention.</p>]]></description>

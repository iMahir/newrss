<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully brought its SpaDeX satellites, Chaser and Target, within 3 meters of each other in a recent trial aimed at demonstrating in-space docking technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mission, launched on December 30, aims to showcase in-space docking using small spacecraft.</li>
<li>If successful, India will join the ranks of the US, Russia, and China in mastering significant space docking technologies.</li>
<li>ISRO is being cautious with the docking process, focusing on accuracy over speed due to the mission's complexity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Getting it right is more important than getting it done on schedule.” - ISRO representative</blockquote>
<p>This trial demonstrates significant progress in ISRO's ambition to enhance its space exploration capabilities, including future missions to the Moon and the establishment of a space station by 2035.</p>]]></description>

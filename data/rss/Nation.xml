<p>In a recent statement, Alka Lamba, Congress candidate in Kalkaji, criticized Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's leadership, claiming he is losing public support ahead of the upcoming Delhi elections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lamba questions Kejriwal's abandonment of the symbolic 'white cap'.</li>
  <li>Claims that Kejriwal is soliciting support from chief ministers of other states.</li>
  <li>Accuses AAP of acting as the 'B team' of BJP in Delhi.</li>
  <li>Forecasts that Kejriwal could face legal troubles soon.</li>
  <li>Highlights that the Delhi assembly election is scheduled for December 5.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Today, the former CM (Arvind Kejriwal) is seeking support from the Chief Ministers of other states to save his ship instead of asking for votes based on his work.”</blockquote>
<p>As the election approaches, Lamba asserts that the Congress party is gaining trust among the people of Delhi.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>CAQM requested citizens to strictly adhere to the restrictions under GRAP-3.(Sunil Ghosh / Hindustan Times)</figcaption>
<p>The Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) has invoked Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR due to increased pollution and a rising Air Quality Index (AQI).</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage III restrictions include a ban on private construction activities and ensuring schools up to Class 5 adopt hybrid learning.</li>
<li>Prohibitions on the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles.</li>
<li>Authorities are monitoring AQI levels closely in Delhi and NCR.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Citizens are requested to strictly adhere to the citizen charter under GRAP Stage-III,” CAQM stated.</blockquote>
<p>This plan aims to combat the hazardous pollution levels that have recently escalated due to weather conditions such as fog and calm winds.</p>]]></description>

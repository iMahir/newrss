            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Kerala High Court Grants Bail to Boby Chemmanur in Sexual Harassment Case</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 14 Jan 2025, 6:17 am</p>
<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="Justice PV Kunhikrishnan" width="100%" height="100%">
<figcaption>Justice PV Kunhikrishnan</figcaption>
<p>The Kerala High Court has granted bail to businessman Boby Chemmanur, who faced allegations of making sexual remarks towards a Malayalam actress during a public event.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bail was granted by Justice PV Kunhikrishnan, subject to certain conditions.</li>
  <li>The judge remarked on the inappropriateness of Chemmanur's comments, noting they had a double meaning.</li>
  <li>The actress's complaint alleged Chemmanur's remarks triggered further inappropriate comments about her on social media.</li>
  <li>Chemmanur was previously denied bail, with the first Magistrate finding his comments prima facie inappropriate.</li>
  <li>He claims the allegations are fabricated and a result of a publicity stunt.</li>
  <li>The State argued that Chemmanur's comments normalize unacceptable behavior in society.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This is the kind of message that goes out to the society and his acts are being acceptable to the public also…”</blockquote>
<p>The court's decision reflects its ongoing evaluation of the balance between personal liberties and societal norms regarding harassment.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Indian National Congress has moved the Supreme Court to defend the Places of Worship Act of 1991, emphasizing its significance for secularism and communal harmony in India.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Act preserves the character of religious places as of August 15, 1947.</li>
  <li>The Congress argues the Act reflects the mandate of the Indian populace.</li>
  <li>Concerns raised about the implications of altering the Act on national integrity.</li>
  <li>The INC was a principal architect when the Act was passed in the 10th Lok Sabha.</li>
  <li>The Act protects the rights to freedom of religion and ensures the secular state’s obligations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The POWA is essential to safeguard secularism in India and the present challenge appears to be a motivated and malicious attempt to undermine established principles of secularism.” - INC</blockquote>
<p>The Congress seeks to emphasize the law's constitutional significance and prevent potential disruptions to India's secular framework.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>BRS moves SC to push Revanth to corner</figcaption>
<p>The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) is attempting to divert media attention away from the impending arrest of K T Rama Rao by challenging the Speaker's inaction on defection complaints against Congress MLAs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BRS filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court regarding the defection of MLAs.</li>
  <li>Accused the Speaker of delays in addressing disqualification complaints for nine months.</li>
  <li>The petition cites a previous Supreme Court ruling mandating timely decisions on such complaints.</li>
  <li>BRS seeks a directive for the Speaker to decide on these issues within four weeks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The BRS argues that the Speaker's delay is in contradiction to the Supreme Court's previous judgment.</blockquote>
<p>This move by the BRS aims to put pressure on the Congress party while bringing attention to internal party conflicts.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Supreme Court today announced that it will no longer adjourn the criminal appeals related to the 2002 Godhra train burning, scheduling them for final hearing on February 13.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The bench, consisting of Justices J.K. Maheshwari and Aravind Kumar, expressed dissatisfaction with repeated requests for adjournments.</li>
  <li>Lawyers argued that the remission applications of convicted individuals are pending and should be resolved first.</li>
  <li>Justice Maheshwari emphasized the necessity of confirming convictions before addressing sentencing, particularly regarding the death penalty.</li>
  <li>The court clarified that remission and criminal appeals do not need to be heard together.</li>
  <li>Parties are required to translate court records from Gujarati to English for accessibility.</li>
  <li>The events of February 27, 2002, resulted in the deaths of 58 people in the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We have granted adjournment for 5-6 times. From last one year, I have been adjourning the matter." - Justice J.K. Maheshwari</blockquote>
<p>The court remains committed to resolving this long-standing issue, with implications for those affected by the tragic events of the Godhra incident.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
  <li>The victim, a 31-year-old trainee doctor, was found dead in the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College on August 9, 2024.</li>
  <li>Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer with the Kolkata Police, was arrested following the discovery of the victim's body, with evidence linking him to the crime.</li>

<figcaption>Bangladesh’s latest demand for Sheikh Hasina’s extradition has illustrated how the country’s political crisis has cemented itself as one of the most pressing quandaries in the complex tapestry of India’s neighbourhood policy.</figcaption>
<p>Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has claimed there were several conspiracies to assassinate her throughout her life, highlighting her narrow escape from an alleged attempt last year. She emphasized that her survival is due to a will of Allah.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hasina alleges multiple assassination attempts, with the latest occurring on August 5, 2024.</li>
<li>Over 600 casualties were reported during protests against her government.</li>
<li>She currently resides in India after fleeing her country due to the political crisis.</li>
<li>Hasina faces arrest warrants in Bangladesh related to crimes during her premiership.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Surviving the killings on August 21, or surviving the huge bomb in Kotalipara, there must be a will of Allah.”</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the ongoing political instability in Bangladesh and the contentious allegations against Hasina, now in exile.</p>]]></description>

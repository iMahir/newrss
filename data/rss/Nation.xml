<figcaption>Karnataka BJP chief BY Vijayendra said that Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah is misusing his post.</figcaption>
<p>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Karnataka chief BY Vijayendra has responded to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who alleged Vijayendra's involvement in a corruption case and called for a CBI investigation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Siddaramaiah accused Vijayendra of attempting to bribe Anwar Manippady with ₹150 crore to suppress investigations.</li>
    <li>The CM demanded a CBI inquiry into the allegations against the BJP leader.</li>
    <li>Vijayendra questioned Siddaramaiah's moral authority to demand an investigation given his own corruption allegations.</li>
    <li>The BJP leader criticized Siddaramaiah for his handling of previous CBI and ED investigations.</li>
    <li>Siddaramaiah claimed that BJP has turned Karnataka into its "ATM."</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"What morality do you have to order a CBI investigation into someone else, humiliated by the High Court verdict?" - BY Vijayendra</blockquote>
<p>This heated exchange highlights the ongoing political tussle in Karnataka, with both parties hurling allegations of corruption at each other as the call for an independent investigation gains momentum.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The bill is expected to be introduced in the Lok Sabha on Monday (HT photo)</figcaption>
<p>The Constitutional Amendment Bill for "One Nation, One Election" aims to synchronize the terms of the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, but actual simultaneous voting will not begin until 2034.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The bill proposes new articles to allow synchronization of terms for both Lok Sabha and state assemblies.</li>
    <li>Should a legislature dissolve early, mid-term elections will only be for the remaining term of that specific legislature.</li>
    <li>The amendments include adding Article 82(A) and modifying Articles 83, 172, and 327.</li>
    <li>The provisions will take effect from an "appointed date" as determined by the President after the next general election in 2029.</li>
    <li>It establishes that legislative assemblies elected after the appointed date will end with the tenure of the Lok Sabha.</li>
    <li>A second bill will align elections in Union Territories with the synchronizations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Notwithstanding anything in Article 83 and Article 172, the term of all legislative assemblies constituted in any general election held after the appointed date and before the expiry of the full term of the House of the People shall come to an end on the expiry of the full term of the House of the People.”</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of this bill marks a significant move towards potential electoral reform in India, with critics raising concerns about its implications for democracy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar addresses the launch of 'The Nehru Development Model'.</figcaption>
<p>In a recent address, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar discussed the failures of the 'Nehru development model' and the ongoing efforts to correct its consequences since 2014.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jaishankar stated that both Russia and China reject the economic assumptions of the Nehru era.</li>
    <li>The 'Nehru development model' has influenced India's politics, bureaucracy, and education.</li>
    <li>He emphasized a strong need for a course correction post-2014, but acknowledged this task remains challenging.</li>
    <li>Jaishankar quoted John Foster Dulles on India's independence to highlight past geopolitical misconceptions.</li>
    <li>He pointed out a national consensus on the model's failure but noted a reluctance to explore alternatives.</li>
    <li>The current environment requires more focus on resiliency, reliability, and trust rather than just openness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"As a result, we end up doing the reforms we must, rarely the reforms we should." - S. Jaishankar</blockquote>
<p>Jaishankar concluded that the idea of 'Atmanirbharta' should be about self-reliance without equating to protectionism, emphasizing the importance of national security and thoughtful action.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Published:</strong> 14 December 2024, <strong>Source:</strong> News Daily</p>
<!-- Image with Caption: Excluded as no image is available -->
<p>The Congress party criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent Lok Sabha speech, calling his resolutions "hollow" and likening him to a "distorian" who fails to address significant issues facing the country.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Congress labeled Modi's 11 resolutions as insubstantial and criticized his lengthy speech for lacking new insights.</li>
    <li>Congress leaders questioned the absence of senior ministers during opposition speeches, suggesting they were avoiding engagement with opposing views.</li>
    <li>Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticized Modi's 110-minute speech, comparing it to a boring school class, and called for transparency regarding the Adani issue.</li>
    <li>Jairam Ramesh claimed Modi is adept at distorting facts for self-interest, referencing a "MA in Entire Political Science".</li>
    <li>K C Venugopal and Gaurav Gogoi pointed out Modi's focus on Congress in a debate about the Constitution instead of addressing urgent societal inequalities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Mr. Narendra Modi has a MA in Entire Political Science - whatever that means. Today in the Lok Sabha he showed that he is also a Distorian par excellence. — Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh)</blockquote>
<blockquote>On a debate about India’s Constitution, the PM once again decided to bring out his tired old speech about the Congress instead. — K C Venugopal (@kcvenugopalmp)</blockquote>
<p>The Congress party maintains that Modi’s addresses do not answer critical questions about corruption and societal divisions, insisting that rhetoric alone will not satisfy public concerns.</p>]]></description>

</figure>
<p>Launching a piercing attack on the Congress in Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the party of undermining the Constitution under successive governments led by members of the Gandhi family.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Modi criticized the Congress for bringing a series of amendments to the Constitution, starting from Jawaharlal Nehru's tenure.</li>
    <li>He highlighted the imposition of Emergency under Indira Gandhi as a significant misstep.</li>
    <li>The PM accused Rajiv Gandhi of sacrificing constitutional principles for votebank politics.</li>
    <li>Modi also mentioned Rahul Gandhi's actions, such as tearing up an ordinance, as examples of the Congress's disregard for constitutional norms.</li>
    <li>He defended his government's amendments, including the abrogation of Article 370 and the amendment of the Citizenship Act, as corrections to past mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>“One family of the Congress did not leave any stone unturned to undermine the Constitution. And I mention one family because out of the last 75 years, it controlled the country for 55 years. This family harboured harmful ideas, activities, policies and this tradition continues to this date. At every possible level, this family has challenged the constitutional principles and values,” Modi said.</blockquote>
<p>Modi concluded by appealing to the country to guard against the Congress's attempts to introduce religion-based reservation and reiterated his commitment to implement a “Secular Civil Code.”</p>

<figcaption>Firhad Hakim, Kolkata Mayor</figcaption>
<p>A fresh controversy has erupted over remarks made by West Bengal Minister and Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim, claiming that Muslims will soon become the majority in India. His remarks have drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hakim stated that by the “grace of Allah we will soon become majority.”</li>
    <li>He mentioned that Muslims make up 33% of West Bengal’s population but only 17% across India.</li>
    <li>The BJP accused him of inciting communal hatred and promoting a dangerous agenda.</li>
    <li>West Bengal State BJP president Sukanta Majumdar described Hakim's comments as a blueprint for creating a Bangladesh-type situation in India.</li>
    <li>This is not the first controversial statement made by Hakim; he previously said on July 3 that those not born in Islam are "unfortunate."</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Pure venom from the Kolkata Mayor, Trinamool’s Firhad Hakim openly inciting communal hatred and pushing a dangerous agenda.” - Sukanta Majumdar</blockquote>
<p>The backlash against Hakim highlights the sensitive nature of religious demographics in Indian politics and the potential implications of such statements in the current political climate.</p>]]></description>

<p>Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent speech in Parliament, describing it as unoriginal and boring, likening the experience to a tedious double mathematics class.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Priyanka Gandhi Vadra called PM Modi's address “double period of mathematics” and “boring”.</li>
    <li>She expressed disappointment, stating there was nothing new in his remarks.</li>
    <li>During the speech, PM Modi accused the Nehru-Gandhi family of undermining the Constitution throughout their rule.</li>
    <li>Modi emphasized that the Congress family's actions during their governance have had lasting negative impacts on Indian democracy.</li>
    <li>The Prime Minister recalled serious events, such as the Emergency, to highlight Congress's historical failures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“(JP) Nadda ji was also rubbing hands but as soon as Modi ji looked at him, he started acting as if he is listening attentively. Amit Shah also had his hand on head, (Piyush) Goyal ji was going off to sleep... I had thought that the PM will say something new, something nice.” - Priyanka Gandhi Vadra</blockquote>
<p>The exchanges in Parliament highlight ongoing tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, reflecting broader debates about governance and historical accountability in India.</p>]]></description>

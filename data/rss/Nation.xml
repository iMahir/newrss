            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Government ends no-detention policy in KVs and JNVs, five years after diluting RTE Act</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>The Centre has scrapped the no-detention policy in Kendriya Vidyalayas and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, allowing students in Classes 5 and 8 to be held back from the current academic session.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The decision affects about 3,000 Central schools, including Sainik Schools and Eklavya Model Residential Schools.</li>
    <li>Changes to the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules now permit holding students back who do not meet promotion criteria after a re-examination.</li>
    <li>A total of 18 states and Union Territories have already abolished the no-detention policy since a 2019 amendment to the RTE Act.</li>
    <li>Schools are required to provide additional instructions and monitor progress for detained students.</li>
    <li>The decision aims to enhance accountability within the education system.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is a very important legislation and a majority of state governments supported this proposal. It brings accountability in our elementary education.” - Former HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar</blockquote>
<p>This policy shift has been met with mixed reactions as it seeks to balance the need for accountability in education against ensuring equal educational opportunities for all children.</p>]]></description>

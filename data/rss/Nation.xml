<figcaption>Vijay Mallya’s extradition was cleared by the UK high court in April 2020 but has been held up for two-and-half years now.(Reuters)</figcaption>
<p>Vijay Mallya, a fugitive businessman, claims that he has paid off more than double the amount owed on his Kingfisher Airlines debt. He asserts that banks have recovered over ₹14,131 crore from him, while the Debt Recovery Tribunal stated the debt was ₹6,203 crore.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mallya claims bank recoveries exceed twice the debt he was adjudged to owe.</li>
<li>He argues that he is entitled to relief unless excess recovery is legally justified.</li>
<li>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman confirmed the recovery of properties worth ₹14,131 crore belonging to Mallya.</li>
<li>Mallya asserts his innocence, claiming he neither borrowed unlawfully nor stole funds.</li>
<li>He has been seeking extradition to India but faces ongoing resistance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Unless the ED and Banks can legally justify how they have taken more than two times the debt, I am entitled to relief which I will pursue," Mallya stated.</blockquote>
<p>This controversy highlights ongoing disputes about Mallya's financial dealings and the broader implications for financial accountability in India.</p>]]></description>

<p>Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi left the Assembly without delivering his customary address due to a conflict regarding the playing of the national anthem.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Governor insisted that the national anthem should be played after the state anthem, which did not happen.</li>
  <li>Raj Bhavan criticized the Assembly for not respecting the national anthem, describing the incident as an insult to the Constitution.</li>
  <li>The Governor remained in the House for only three minutes before leaving in protest.</li>
  <li>After his departure, the main opposition party protested, demanding justice for a recent sexual assault incident at a university.</li>
  <li>This incident marks the second consecutive Assembly session where the Governor has walked out.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Constitution of Bharat and the National Anthem were once again insulted in the Tamil Nadu Assembly today.” - Raj Bhavan Statement</blockquote>
<p>The controversy surrounding the Governor's exit reinforces tensions between state officials and the Governor's office on ceremonial matters.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the Indian government's reluctance to engage with protesting farmers who have been calling for a legal guarantee for minimum support prices and other reforms. The Union Agriculture Minister has indicated the government is waiting for Supreme Court directives before initiating talks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The protests are led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha.</li>
<li>Farmers have been protesting at the Punjab-Haryana borders since February last year.</li>
<li>The current government is taking a more hands-off approach compared to previous administrations.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The implications of China’s mega-dam project | Explained</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> January 06, 2025 08:30 am IST</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> [Your Source Here]</p>
<p>The ambitious plan to construct a mega-hydropower dam across the Brahmaputra in China's Tibetan Autonomous Region poses significant downstream consequences for India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This project was included in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan and approved in December 2024.</li>
  <li>The Brahmaputra river is crucial for transboundary water management among China, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.</li>
  <li>Concerns arise over potential 'water wars' as states prioritize national sovereignty over water resources.</li>
  <li>Upstream hydropower dams may drastically alter the flow of the river, affecting communities and ecosystems downstream.</li>
  <li>China's mega-project has intensified hydropower competition in the region, especially between China and India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A dam for a dam will make the entire Himalayan riparian/climatic systems run dry and turn it into a disaster-scape for its communities.”</blockquote>
<p>This mega-dam project underscores the complexities and risks associated with transboundary river management in a changing climate, signaling a need for cooperative governance among riparian nations.</p>]]></description>

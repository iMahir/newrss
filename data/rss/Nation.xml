<p>Bangladesh's interim government has requested the extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, where she has been living in exile since fleeing the country amid protests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sheikh Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, amid student-led protests that deposed her.</li>
  <li>Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal has issued arrest warrants against Hasina for crimes against humanity.</li>
  <li>The interim government has sent a diplomatic note to India requesting her return for judicial proceedings.</li>
  <li>An existing extradition treaty between Bangladesh and India could facilitate the process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Bangladesh wants her back here for the judicial process,” Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain said.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bangladesh is actively pursuing the legal return of Sheikh Hasina to face serious charges stemming from her time in office.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Uttar Pradesh and Punjab police eliminated three suspected Khalistani terrorists in a collaborative operation. These individuals were reportedly backed by Pakistan's ISI.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The terrorists were connected to the Khalistan Zindabad Force and were implicated in a grenade attack in Gurdaspur.</li>
  <li>The operation was praised by Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav as a “major breakthrough” against ISI-sponsored terrorism.</li>
  <li>Investigations revealed involvement from a UK-based mastermind with ties to the British Army.</li>
  <li>Authorities are continuing to investigate the module to uncover additional members and connections.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Jagjit Singh is reported to be working in the British Army as well." - DGP Gaurav Yadav</blockquote>
<p>The joint operation signifies the effectiveness of interstate collaboration in combatting terrorism.</p>]]></description>

<p>A man in Chhattisgarh has fraudulently opened an account in the name of actress Sunny Leone to illegally receive monthly government grants designated for women.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chhattisgarh government provides ₹1,000 every month to married women through the 'Mahtari Vandan Yojana'.</li>
<li>Virendra Joshi allegedly opened the account under Sunny Leone's name and has been receiving money illegally.</li>
<li>Authorities are investigating the case and have frozen the fraudulent account.</li>
<li>The discovery has led to political tensions between the BJP and Congress parties regarding the effectiveness of the scheme.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Deepak Baij of Congress claims that over 50% of beneficiaries of the Mahtari Vandan Yojana are fake.</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights issues of fraud and portrayal of social welfare programs while raising questions about beneficiary verification processes.</p>]]></description>

<p>The chief ministers of the Telugu states, Chandrababu Naidu and Revanth Reddy, are set to attend the upcoming World Economic Forum Summit in Davos, which begins on January 20. While this may be an opportunity for them to meet, their attendance will be in an individual capacity rather than a bilateral meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both leaders have previously met to discuss post-bifurcation issues.</li>
<li>This will be Naidu’s first trip to Davos during his second tenure as a chief minister.</li>
<li>Revanth Reddy continues the tradition of attending the summit.</li>
<li>Maharashtra's chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will also be at Davos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It has to be seen if they will orchestrate a meeting here to discuss political affairs of Telugu states.”</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming summit presents a significant platform for political discussions among the Telugu CMs, which could influence the region's governance.</p>]]></description>

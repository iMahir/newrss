<p>A Delhi-based tutor was arrested for allegedly instigating civil service aspirants to protest against a recent Bihar Public Service Commission examination. Protests escalated outside the BPSC office in Patna when aspirants demanded its cancellation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The tutor, identified as Rohit, mobilized protesters who attempted to enter the BPSC office.</li>
  <li>Authorities are investigating a larger conspiracy and the source of funding for the protests.</li>
  <li>The police faced criticism for their handling of the protests, with reports of injuries among aspirants.</li>
  <li>Prominent figures condemned the police action, calling it excessive and unjustified.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Police action against BPSC aspirants was highly condemnable. Protesting BPSC aspirants should not have been treated like this. My support is always with the students.” - Motiur Rahman Khan, vlogger.</blockquote>
<p>The arrests and protests highlight ongoing tensions surrounding the BPSC examinations and the broader issues of public protest rights in Bihar.</p>]]></description>

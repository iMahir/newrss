<p>The ongoing feud within the Manchu family has escalated, with Manoj Manchu accusing his elder brother Vishnu of endangering his family by tampering with home generators.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manoj alleges that Vishnu and his associates broke into his home while he was away and sabotaged the generators.</li>
  <li>They purportedly posed as cake delivery personnel to gain access to the house.</li>
  <li>Manoj claimed that they mixed diesel and sugar in the generators, causing significant damage.</li>
  <li>The tampering resulted in a power failure and dangerous electrical fluctuations.</li>
  <li>He expressed concern for his family's safety, particularly for his mother and nine-month-old daughter.</li>
  <li>Manoj stated that the incident is part of a troubling pattern of threats and hostility from Vishnu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This incident is not an isolated one but part of a growing pattern of threats and hostility,” Manoj said.</blockquote>
<p>In light of these events, Manoj is calling for immediate action from authorities to prevent further incidents and ensure his family's safety.</p>]]></description>

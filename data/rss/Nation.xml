<p>Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent speech in Parliament, describing it as unoriginal and boring, likening the experience to a tedious double mathematics class.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Priyanka Gandhi Vadra called PM Modi's address “double period of mathematics” and “boring”.</li>
    <li>She expressed disappointment, stating there was nothing new in his remarks.</li>
    <li>During the speech, PM Modi accused the Nehru-Gandhi family of undermining the Constitution throughout their rule.</li>
    <li>Modi emphasized that the Congress family's actions during their governance have had lasting negative impacts on Indian democracy.</li>
    <li>The Prime Minister recalled serious events, such as the Emergency, to highlight Congress's historical failures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“(JP) Nadda ji was also rubbing hands but as soon as Modi ji looked at him, he started acting as if he is listening attentively. Amit Shah also had his hand on head, (Piyush) Goyal ji was going off to sleep... I had thought that the PM will say something new, something nice.” - Priyanka Gandhi Vadra</blockquote>
<p>The exchanges in Parliament highlight ongoing tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, reflecting broader debates about governance and historical accountability in India.</p>]]></description>

    <li>The UCC aims to standardize personal laws across all religions, covering issues like marriage and inheritance.</li>
    <li>The BJP and its affiliates have consistently advocated for the UCC's implementation as a common civil framework.</li>
    <li>Modi's remarks came during the celebration of 75 years since the adoption of the Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“...Uniform Civil Code - this topic was not beyond the attention of the Constituent Assembly. The Constituent Assembly discussed UCC at length…” - PM Modi</blockquote>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized the Congress party over the imposition of Emergency in 1975, stating that it severely damaged the Constitution and civil liberties in India.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Modi referred to the Emergency as a time when "the Constitution was torn apart" and civil rights were suppressed.</li>

    <li>The Prime Minister specifically targeted the Gandhi family for their role in undermining the Constitution.</li>
    <li>He praised India's journey since the adoption of the Constitution, calling it "extraordinary" and emphasizing India as the "Mother of Democracy."</li>

    “The Constitution was torn apart when it was completing 25 years; the Emergency was imposed (in 1975), all constitutional rights were snatched and the country was turned into a jail.” - PM Narendra Modi
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Modi's statements reinforce the narrative of the Congress party's failures during the Emergency, while also celebrating the values and journey of Indian democracy since the Constitution's adoption.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Dec 14, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Greater Kashmir</p>
<p>Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has criticized the dual governance model in the region, claiming it is a “recipe for disaster” and urging the restoration of statehood.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah voiced concerns over the current governance structure, sharing power with the lieutenant governor.</li>
    <li>He highlighted the need for a unified leadership in Jammu and Kashmir, drawing parallels with successful organizational structures.</li>
    <li>The Chief Minister mentioned that there have been no benefits to governance since the region became a Union Territory.</li>
    <li>He cited past promises made by the Prime Minister and Home Minister regarding the restoration of statehood, urging the Centre to fulfill these commitments.</li>
    <li>Abdullah indicated that the decision to restore statehood lies with the Prime Minister and Home Minister.</li>
    <li>The Chief Minister noted that the Supreme Court's intervention enabled elections in Jammu and Kashmir but was less definitive about the timeline for statehood restoration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “Let me just say this, having two power centres anywhere is a recipe for disaster… No organisation works well if there are multiple power centres.” 
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Abdullah’s remarks reflect a call for a more straightforward governance model and a reminder of political promises made to the people of Jammu and Kashmir regarding their status and rights.]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 14, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p>
<p>In a heated parliamentary debate, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi referenced Veer Savarkar, prompting a strong rebuttal from BJP leaders, who cited historical praise from Indira Gandhi to support their arguments.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rahul Gandhi invoked the story of 'Eklavya' to illustrate his point during the debate.</li>
    <li>Kiren Rijiju shared a document on social media where Indira Gandhi referred to Savarkar as a "remarkable son of India."</li>
    <li>BJP leaders challenged the opposition's knowledge of the Constitution, with Anurag Thakur asking them to identify how many pages it contains.</li>
    <li>Jagdambika Pal criticized Rahul Gandhi for previously tearing up a bill during his own government's tenure.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This document is for Rahul Gandhi Ji as he made an incorrect statement in Lok Sabha about Veer Savarkar. Indira Gandhi. — Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirenRijiju/status/1867871422254924207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Switzerland's recent suspension of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status for India poses challenges for Indian companies, particularly in finance, pharmaceuticals, and IT sectors, affecting trade dynamics between the two nations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The MFN suspension disrupts the preferential trade framework under WTO rules for Indian firms.</li>
    <li>Indian companies will now incur a 10% tax on dividends and incomes in Switzerland, up from 5%, effective January 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The change may lead to higher tariffs and reduced market access for Indian goods in Switzerland.</li>
    <li>The Indian government anticipates renegotiating its double taxation treaty with Switzerland due to changes in trade agreements.</li>
    <li>In FY 2023-24, bilateral trade reached approximately $23.76 billion, with a significant portion being imports from Switzerland.</li>
</ul>

<p>The suspension of MFN status necessitates adaptability among Indian investors and firms, as they navigate new tax implications and trade barriers in the Swiss market.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>In a Fiery Lok Sabha Moment, Rahul Gandhi's 'Yuva' Slip-Up ministers Chuckling</figcaption>
<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's recent speech in Lok Sabha sparked laughter among ministers when he mistakenly referred to a seven-year-old child as "Yuva" while discussing Eklavya from the Mahabharata.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rahul Gandhi made a gaffe while referencing the story of Dronacharya and Eklavya.</li>
    <li>The term "Yuva" caused amusement among BJP ministers, including Union Ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Kirren Rijiju.</li>
    <li>He drew parallels between Eklavya's plight and the challenges faced by today's youth, particularly regarding exam preparations and paper leaks.</li>
    <li>Gandhi criticized the government for privatizing key national assets, claiming it harms entrepreneurs and fair business practices.</li>
    <li>He also referenced comments by VD Savarkar regarding India's Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The manner in which Dronacharya cut off the thumb of Eklavya, you are busy cutting off the thumb of the entire nation... When you hand over Dharavi to Adani, you cut off the thumb of entrepreneurs."
</blockquote>
<p>Rahul Gandhi's speech not only highlighted his concerns for the youth but also criticized the government's economic policies, drawing attention to historical and contemporary issues.</p>]]></description>

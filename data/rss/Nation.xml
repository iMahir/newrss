<p>BJP leader Parvesh Verma has refuted claims made by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) regarding an attack on Arvind Kejriwal's vehicle during a campaign. He instead alleges that Kejriwal ordered his driver to run over three youths who were protesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Verma claims the vehicle hit three unemployed youths protesting against Kejriwal.</li>
<li>AAP stated that Kejriwal was attacked by BJP supporters during his campaigning.</li>
<li>Verma plans to file a police report for attempted murder over the incident.</li>
<li>The AAP is urging the Election Commission to take action against the BJP for alleged violence.</li>
<li>The Delhi assembly election is scheduled for February 5, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Arvind Kejriwal signalled the driver to crush them... This is an attempt to murder.” - Parvesh Verma</blockquote>
<p>The conflict illustrates rising tensions in the lead-up to the Delhi elections, with both parties making serious allegations against each other.</p>]]></description>

<p>The once-popular 'IIT Baba', Abhey Singh, abruptly exited the Maha Kumbh Mela, generating significant concern among his followers. His disappearance follows a series of media interactions that contributed to growing mental stress.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abhey Singh, known for his transition from aerospace engineering to spirituality, left the Maha Kumbh and Juna Akhada.</li>
  <li>His family and ashram sadhus are worried as he has been unreachable and cut off contact.</li>
  <li>Reports suggest mental stress and drug use contributed to his decision to leave.</li>
  <li>The Juna Akhada's strict media protocols may have led to friction over Singh's rising popularity.</li>
  <li>Singh has previously expressed his journey from engineering to seeking deeper spiritual meaning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“You will keep searching for the meaning of life. I used to find that in engineering but never found my answers,” said Singh.</blockquote>
<p>Abhey Singh's sudden decision raises questions about the pressures faced by public figures in spiritual communities, warranting a call for more support and understanding.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi addresses the gathering during 'Karyakarta Sammelan', in Patna, Saturday, Jan. 18, 2025.(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, has alleged that the caste survey conducted by the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar was simply aimed at misleading the populace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gandhi asserts that a nationwide caste census is crucial for understanding the participation of OBCs, Dalits, and other communities in various sectors.</li>
<li>He criticized the Bihar government's caste survey as inadequate and merely a tool to fool the people.</li>
<li>During his address, Gandhi highlighted issues regarding wealth distribution and power dynamics, suggesting that while representation has been given, power remains concentrated in the hands of a few.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“When I meet the BJP MPs who belong to the backward community, Dalits, tribals, they say that we have been put in a cage.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Gandhi's remarks underscore the ongoing debate over caste representation and governance in India, calling for transparency and accountability in the political process.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Kerala High Court has ruled that magic mushrooms are not scheduled narcotic substances under the NDPS Act, impacting the legal standing of a man accused of possession.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The court observed that magic mushrooms, while containing psilocybin, do not qualify as narcotics.</li>
    <li>This ruling influences how quantities of drugs are assessed for bail eligibility.</li>
    <li>The judgment aligns with previous High Court decisions from Karnataka and Madras.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Magic mushrooms cannot be treated as a mixture. Therefore, Note 4 of the Table dealing with small quantity and commercial quantity is not applicable." - Justice Kunhikrishnan</blockquote>
<p>The court noted that the substance found in the accused's possession did not constitute a commercial quantity, leading to a grant of bail.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Kumbh Mela, taking place in Prayagraj, is the largest religious gathering in the world, with over 40 crore people expected to attend this year due to a rare celestial alignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Triveni Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati, is a sacred dip site for pilgrims.</li>
<li>This year's Mahakumbh is particularly special as it occurs only once every 144 years.</li>
<li>Sadhus from various parts of India gather for the event, staying in tents along the riverbanks.</li>
<li>Economic boost for Prayagraj with accommodations and facilities for the surge in attendees.</li>
<li>Experts note the dual nature of attendees - spiritual seekers and those attending as spectators.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Now it’s more of a show than a <i>kumbh</i>,” says Mahamandeshwar Ji Maharaj of the Juna Akhada.</blockquote>
<p>Prayagraj is prepared for the influx, with transportation, security, and health services being enhanced for the event.</p>]]></description>

<p>Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Arvind Kejriwal has once again called for the inclusion of Delhi's Jat community in the Centre's Other Backward Classes (OBC) list, after meeting with a delegation of Jat leaders who expressed grievances over unfulfilled promises from the government.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kejriwal met with Jat leaders and highlighted their voting power in Delhi.</li>
  <li>He emphasized that while Jats in Rajasthan benefit from OBC status, Delhi's Jats do not receive similar privileges.</li>
  <li>Kejriwal questioned Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah regarding the delay in including Delhi's Jats in the OBC list.</li>
  <li>The BJP criticized Kejriwal's call as an election gimmick and claimed he had not previously raised the issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The top two leaders of the country -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah -- had promised the Jat community of Delhi that they will be given OBC reservation at the central level but the promise remains unfulfilled.” - Arvind Kejriwal</blockquote>
<p>This development highlights ongoing tensions between the AAP and the BJP regarding promises made to the Jat community and the political implications as elections approach.</p>]]></description>

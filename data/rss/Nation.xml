<p>Delhi Chief Minister Atishi alleged that the central government cancelled her allotment of the CM residence just before the assembly elections. Her accusations were met with a rebuttal from the BJP, asserting she was lying.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atishi claimed eviction by the BJP-led Central government from her official residence.</li>
  <li>This incident occurred a day before the announcement of the Delhi assembly election schedule.</li>
  <li>Atishi accused the BJP of undermining her position and efforts as CM.</li>
  <li>BJP's Amit Malviya claimed Atishi hasn’t taken possession of her allotted residence, resulting in its retraction.</li>
  <li>The Delhi assembly elections will take place on February 5, with results announced on February 8.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“But, I want to tell people of Delhi that the work won't stop even if they take away our home.” - Atishi</blockquote>
<p>The recent conflict highlights the ongoing political tensions between the AAP and BJP, with implications for the upcoming elections.</p>]]></description>

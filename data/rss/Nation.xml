<p>A hotel located close to the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Chandigarh’s Sector 17 collapsed early on Monday. The building was declared unsafe and had been evacuated days prior, with no injuries reported.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hotel, named Hotel Mehfil, had been closed for some years.</li>
<li>Three pillars of the hotel developed cracks a week ago due to ongoing renovation work.</li>
<li>The Chandigarh administration evacuated the building following the detection of the cracks.</li>
<li>Area was cordoned off by police as a precaution before the collapse.</li>
<li>Chandigarh Deputy Commissioner Nishant Yadav confirmed the evacuation and investigation into the incident.</li>
<li>Previously, a building in Mohali collapsed, resulting in fatalities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Separately, the estate office has issued a notice to the owner as the revised building plan was not approved and the renovation was being done without nod,” said DC Nishant Yadav.</blockquote>
<p>The hotel, built in the 1960s, was formerly owned by minister Harmohan Dhawan.</p>
<p>The incident highlights ongoing construction safety concerns in the region.</p>]]></description>

<p>Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi left the Assembly without delivering his customary address due to a conflict regarding the playing of the national anthem.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Governor insisted that the national anthem should be played after the state anthem, which did not happen.</li>
  <li>Raj Bhavan criticized the Assembly for not respecting the national anthem, describing the incident as an insult to the Constitution.</li>
  <li>The Governor remained in the House for only three minutes before leaving in protest.</li>
  <li>After his departure, the main opposition party protested, demanding justice for a recent sexual assault incident at a university.</li>
  <li>This incident marks the second consecutive Assembly session where the Governor has walked out.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Constitution of Bharat and the National Anthem were once again insulted in the Tamil Nadu Assembly today.” - Raj Bhavan Statement</blockquote>
<p>The controversy surrounding the Governor's exit reinforces tensions between state officials and the Governor's office on ceremonial matters.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the Indian government's reluctance to engage with protesting farmers who have been calling for a legal guarantee for minimum support prices and other reforms. The Union Agriculture Minister has indicated the government is waiting for Supreme Court directives before initiating talks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The protests are led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha.</li>
<li>Farmers have been protesting at the Punjab-Haryana borders since February last year.</li>
<li>The current government is taking a more hands-off approach compared to previous administrations.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The implications of China’s mega-dam project | Explained</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> January 06, 2025 08:30 am IST</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> [Your Source Here]</p>
<p>The ambitious plan to construct a mega-hydropower dam across the Brahmaputra in China's Tibetan Autonomous Region poses significant downstream consequences for India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This project was included in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan and approved in December 2024.</li>
  <li>The Brahmaputra river is crucial for transboundary water management among China, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.</li>
  <li>Concerns arise over potential 'water wars' as states prioritize national sovereignty over water resources.</li>
  <li>Upstream hydropower dams may drastically alter the flow of the river, affecting communities and ecosystems downstream.</li>
  <li>China's mega-project has intensified hydropower competition in the region, especially between China and India.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A dam for a dam will make the entire Himalayan riparian/climatic systems run dry and turn it into a disaster-scape for its communities.”</blockquote>
<p>This mega-dam project underscores the complexities and risks associated with transboundary river management in a changing climate, signaling a need for cooperative governance among riparian nations.</p>]]></description>

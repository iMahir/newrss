<p>The Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) has invoked Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR due to increased pollution and a rising Air Quality Index (AQI).</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage III restrictions include a ban on private construction activities and ensuring schools up to Class 5 adopt hybrid learning.</li>
<li>Prohibitions on the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles.</li>
<li>Authorities are monitoring AQI levels closely in Delhi and NCR.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Citizens are requested to strictly adhere to the citizen charter under GRAP Stage-III,” CAQM stated.</blockquote>
<p>This plan aims to combat the hazardous pollution levels that have recently escalated due to weather conditions such as fog and calm winds.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Supreme Court ruling on the transfer of government employees.</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court has clarified that transfers based on employee requests cannot be classified as transfers in public interest, as they are not made in the interest of public administration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Court stated that the government is the best judge of employee service utilization.</li>
  <li>Transfers on request are not based on public interest or administrative needs.</li>
  <li>The ruling impacts seniority claims within the Kerala Government service.</li>
  <li>Employees transferred via absorption retain their seniority in the previous department.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It cannot be disputed that the Government is the best judge to decide how to distribute and utilise the services of an employee...such transfer cannot be termed as transfer in public interest because it is on the request of the employee and not in the exigencies of the public administration.”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling emphasizes the distinction between voluntary transfers at an employee's request and those made in the public's interest.</p>]]></description>

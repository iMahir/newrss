<p>Prashant Kishor, the chief of Jan Suraaj, was arrested by Bihar Police while on an indefinite hunger strike in Patna to demand the cancellation of the BPSC examination amid allegations of irregularities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kishor began the hunger strike on Thursday to support students protesting against the BPSC examination held on December 13.</li>
<li>His arrest occurred as he and supporters were removed from Gandhi Maidan by police.</li>
<li>The government recently announced a re-examination, leading Kishor to claim it acknowledged errors in the original test.</li>
<li>Kishor called for swift action from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to address student concerns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>‚ÄúBy conducting the re-examination, the government has legally accepted that irregularities have happened with certain students in the examination.‚Äù ‚Äì Prashant Kishor</blockquote>
<p>This incident underscores the ongoing tensions surrounding the BPSC exam and student protests in Bihar, with calls for further support from political leaders.</p>]]></description>

<p>On January 5th, 2025, major media outlets inaccurately reported that OYO Hotels & Homes had implemented a ban on unmarried couples from staying at its hotels, stirring outrage among patrons. However, the revised policy allows partner hotels to make their own decisions on this matter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Several headlines suggested a blanket ban on unmarried couples at OYO Hotels.</li>
  <li>The actual policy allows individual partner hotels discretion to accept or decline bookings from unmarried couples.</li>
  <li>The change was reportedly made in response to feedback from civil society groups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Pawan Sharma, Region Head of OYO North India, stated, ‚ÄúOYO is committed to upholding safe and responsible hospitality practices...‚Äù</blockquote>
<p>The uproar stems from misunderstandings generated by misleading headlines rather than a decisive policy reversal by OYO.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The Commission noted that IMD forecast indicates that AQI levels will improve in Delhi-NCR in the coming days. (Arvind Yadav/HT Photo)</figcaption>
<p>The Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR due to improving air quality index (AQI) levels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage III restrictions lifted due to favorable AQI trends.</li>
  <li>Stage I and II measures still in effect, including a ban on non-essential construction work.</li>
  <li>Classes up to grade 5 were previously shifted to a hybrid mode.</li>
  <li>Restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in effect, with exceptions for persons with disabilities.</li>
  <li>Strong advice remains to follow GRAP-II restrictions due to potential changing weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Owing to the favourable meteorological conditions and better wind speed, the AQI of Delhi has been continuously improving" - CAQM's order citing the India Meteorological Department.</blockquote>
<p>This decision comes as the sub-committee will continue to monitor the air quality situation closely.</p>]]></description>

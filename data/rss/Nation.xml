<figcaption>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the convention which aims at showcasing Odisha’s culture and heritage in front of the NRIs (non-resident Indians) who are coming to India from 50 countries(ANI file)</figcaption>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will flag off the Pravasi Bharatiya Express, a special tourist train for the Indian diaspora, from New Delhi’s Safdarjung railway station. This launch coincides with the 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.</p>

<li>The Pravasi Bharatiya Express is designed for the Indian diaspora aged 45 to 65 years.</li>
<li>The train will travel for three weeks to multiple destinations including Ayodhya, Patna, Gaya, Varanasi, and more.</li>
<li>The launch date, January 9, commemorates Mahatma Gandhi's return to India from South Africa in 1915.</li>
<li>Accommodating 156 passengers, the tour aims to connect the Indian diaspora with their roots.</li>
<li>Organized under the 'Pravasi Teerth Darshan Yojana', it collaborates with IRCTC.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>BJP Braces for Redemption in Ayodhya with Milkipur Bypoll Announcement</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>The Election Commission has set the bypoll date for the Milkipur assembly seat in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya district, providing the BJP a chance to recover from its previous loss in the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Milkipur bypoll is scheduled for 5 February, with results announced on 8 February.</li>
<li>The previous elections were postponed due to a pending court case.</li>
<li>Awadhesh Prasad of the Samajwadi Party vacated the seat after winning the June 2024 parliamentary poll.</li>
<li>BJP's confidence is bolstered by its seven wins out of nine assembly seats in the last bypolls.</li>
<li>Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's frequent visits to Milkipur aim to enhance campaign efforts.</li>
<li>SP has named Ajit Prasad, the son of the former MLA, as its candidate.</li>
<li>Caste dynamics are crucial, with Dalit, Yadav, and Muslim votes making up nearly 50% of the electorate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We are fully confident for Milkipur now, as the last bypolls went in our favour.” - UP BJP Chief Bhupendra Chaudhary</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming bypoll is not only vital for the BJP's local strategy but also for broader narratives leading into the 2027 elections. The competition between BJP and SP is expected to be fierce, with both parties prepared for a closely contested election.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Collegium Recommends Justice K Vinod Chandran for Supreme Court Appointment</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Tuesday<br><strong>Source:</strong> Bar and Bench</p>
<p>The Supreme Court Collegium has recommended the appointment of K Vinod Chandran, Chief Justice of Patna High Court, as a judge of the Supreme Court.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The recommendation was made by the Collegium led by Chief Justice of India, Sanjiv Khanna.</li>
  <li>Justice Chandran has over 11 years of experience as a High Court judge and has been the Chief Justice of Patna since March 2023.</li>
  <li>The Collegium noted the lack of representation from the Kerala High Court in the Supreme Court.</li>
  <li>Justice Chandran ranks 13th in the combined all-India seniority of High Court judges, and 1st among judges from the Kerala High Court.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"He has served as a Judge of the High Court for more than 11 years and as a Chief Justice of a big High Court for more than a year. During his long tenure as a Judge and Chief Justice of the High Court, Justice Chandran has acquired significant experience in diverse fields of law."</blockquote>
<p>His appointment helps to fill the current void of Kerala High Court representation in the Supreme Court.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Supreme Court has rejected a petition alleging irregularities in the Bihar Public Service Commission’s 70th Preliminary Examination and police actions against protesting candidates. The court advised that the petitioners approach the High Court instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court dismissed the petition concerning irregularities in the BPSC exam.</li>
  <li>The Court advised petitioners to seek resolution through the High Court under Article 226.</li>
  <li>Protests arose following allegations of a question paper leak in the Combined Competitive Examination, held on December 13.</li>
  <li>Over 10,000 candidates are set to undergo fresh examinations due to the protests.</li>
  <li>The BPSC dismissed allegations of a leak as a conspiracy to disrupt the examination process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We believe it would be appropriate for the petitioner to approach the concerned High Court under Article 226,” the Bench remarked.</blockquote>
<p>This decision emphasizes the judicial process regarding examination disputes and highlights ongoing tensions in Bihar regarding the conduct of public service examinations.</p>]]></description>

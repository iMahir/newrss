<p>The latest report by the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+) reveals alarming gaps in infrastructure across Indian schools, with many lacking essential facilities like electricity, functional toilets, and access to computers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of 14.71 lakh schools in India, 1.52 lakh have no functional electricity.</li>
<li>Only 67,000 schools operate without functional toilets, mainly affecting government schools.</li>
<li>Only 33.2% of government schools have disabled-friendly toilets, with fewer being functional.</li>
<li>50% of all schools lack access to computers for educational purposes.</li>
<li>Only 10.5% of schools have implemented solar panel facilities.</li>
<li>Only 17.5% of schools have co-curricular activity rooms or arts and crafts facilities.</li>
<li>In government secondary schools, 50.2% have science laboratory facilities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The condition is much worse when it comes to providing disabled-friendly facilities, with only 33.2% of schools having disabled-friendly toilets."</blockquote>
<p>This report underscores a significant need for improvement in the infrastructure of schools in India, especially for the government-run institutions.</p>]]></description>

<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah claims that Article 370 has played a critical role in fostering terrorism in Kashmir, attributing it to the notion of temporary relations between Kashmir and India.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 370 fostered separatism among Kashmiri youth, leading to terrorism.</li>
<li>Other Muslim-majority regions in India did not experience similar terrorism despite sharing borders with Pakistan.</li>
<li>Mr. Shah stated that the misconception of Kashmir's relationship with India promoted extremism.</li>
<li>The revocation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, must be understood in the larger historical context.</li>
</ul>
<p><blockquote>“Why did terrorism not spread in other Muslim areas of the country? ... It is unfortunate that 40,000 people lost their lives,” Mr. Shah said.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Home Minister further emphasized the importance of re-evaluating Kashmir's history and offered perspectives that could reshape national narratives.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Former PM Manmohan Singh. (Express Archive)</figcaption>
<p>Top officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs met to identify potential sites for a memorial for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two sites shortlisted: Ekta Sthal and Vijay Ghat.</li>
  <li>Ekta Sthal is near Jawaharlal Nehru’s samadhi, while Vijay Ghat is near Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial.</li>
  <li>The selection comes after the Congress party's request for a memorial following Singh's death on December 26.</li>
  <li>Urban Development Secretary will inform Singh’s family about the proposed sites and establish a Trust for land allocation.</li>
  <li>Former Congress leaders criticized the government's choice of location for Singh's last rites.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The government’s choice of location had disrespected the former Prime Minister’s legacy.”</blockquote>
<p>The announcement of the final memorial site is awaited, as public discourse continues regarding the appropriateness of the chosen locations.</p>]]></description>

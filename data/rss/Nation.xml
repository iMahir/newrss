            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India: Why a nation of 1.45 billion wants more children</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> BBC</p>
<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0718/live/0e980850-b933-11ef-9325-0fd728530b68.jpg.webp" alt="AFP Indian Hindu devotees gesture before attempting to form a human pyramid" />
<figcaption>Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country.</figcaption>
<p>India's population has surpassed China's, leading to a renewed call for having more children, particularly from southern states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which face low fertility rates and ageing populations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India became the world's most populous country with 1.45 billion people.</li>
  <li>Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are advocating for higher birth rates due to declining fertility.</li>
  <li>The country's fertility rate has dropped significantly from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to 2 currently.</li>
  <li>Some southern states maintain fertility rates below the replacement level, raising concerns about political representation.</li>
  <li>The impending delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 could disadvantage economically prosperous southern states.</li>
  <li>Demographers warn India's rapid ageing due to declining fertility rates may have economic and social implications.</li>
  <li>Leaders, including Modi, suggest any changes to fiscal allocations will be considered carefully.</li>
  <li>Experts stress the need for policies that enhance productivity and support a growing elderly population.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"India is getting old before getting rich." - Srinivas Goli</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as India's demographics shift dramatically, the focus on increasing birth rates comes amid fears of economic strains and reduced political influence for certain regions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>BJP's Outreach to Christian Community in Kerala Faces Backlash</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 24, 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>
<img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/g4xnb0/article69022018.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_LS_Polls__Counting_o_2_1_0SDML435.jpg" alt="The bishop’s post came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed Church leaders and participated in Christmas celebrations hosted by the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of India in New Delhi." title="The bishop’s post came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed Church leaders and participated in Christmas celebrations hosted by the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of India in New Delhi."/> 
<figcaption>The bishop’s post came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed Church leaders and participated in Christmas celebrations hosted by the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of India in New Delhi.</figcaption>
<p>The BJP's outreach efforts to the Christian community in Kerala are generating significant socio-political backlash, particularly following a controversial incident during Christmas celebrations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The BJP has been actively engaging with Kerala's Christian community but faces opposition due to recent events.</li>
  <li>A sarcastic post by a bishop highlighted the contradictions in BJP's outreach amidst incidents of vandalism against Christmas decorations.</li>
  <li>The CPI(M) and Congress criticized the BJP following a disruption of Christmas festivities at a government school.</li>
  <li>Protests against the BJP's tactics have been organized by youth groups, promoting a festive spirit that contrasts with the political tensions.</li>
  <li>BJP leaders are attempting to distance the party from negative incidents, denouncing anti-Christian remarks made by their own party members.</li>
  <li>VHP representatives have defended their actions, stating that their grievances against the school activities were based on juvenile justice considerations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan stated that the BJP's overtures were reminiscent of a "wolf in sheep’s clothing," signaling the party's anti-minority stance.</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing situation represents a complex interplay of political strategy and community relations, with potential long-term consequences for the BJP's engagements in Kerala.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Centre has ended the no-detention policy for students in Classes 5 and 8, meaning students who fail their year-end exams will no longer be automatically promoted. The policy revision allows for re-examination opportunities for those who do not meet promotion criteria.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The no-detention policy has been scrapped as part of the amendments to the Right to Education Act.</li>
  <li>18 states and Union Territories previously discontinued the no-detention policy.</li>
  <li>Students failing their exams will receive additional instruction and a chance for re-examination within two months.</li>
  <li>Teachers will assist students in identifying learning gaps during the holding period.</li>
  <li>No student can be expelled from school before completing elementary education.</li>
  <li>This change affects over 3,000 schools run by the central government, including Kendriya Vidyalayas.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If the child appearing in the re-examination fails to fulfil the promotion criteria again, he shall be held back in fifth class or eighth class, as the case may be."</blockquote>
<p>This significant educational policy shift focuses on improving student performance and understanding rather than rote memorization.</p>]]></description>

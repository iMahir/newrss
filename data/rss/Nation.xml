<p>The Supreme Court ruled that constitutional courts cannot dictate the format of bail orders, affirming that trial courts have the discretion to determine how to write such orders.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Court was reviewing an appeal from a District and Sessions Judge regarding adverse remarks made by the Rajasthan High Court on a bail order.</li>
<li>The High Court had criticized the judge for failing to present details in a specific format, suggesting potential indiscipline.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court clarified that directions from the High Court were merely suggestions, not mandatory requirements for trial courts.</li>
<li>It concluded that High Courts should not jeopardize the careers of judicial officers through adverse remarks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The adverse remarks and observations made against the appellant in the aforesaid orders cannot be the basis for taking any action against the appellant on the administrative side,” the Supreme Court clarified.</blockquote>
<p>This ruling emphasizes the independence of trial courts in managing their procedures regarding bail applications.</p>]]></description>

<p>China is prepared to work with India to restore bilateral relations ahead of upcoming talks between India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, marking the first meeting of Special Representatives in five years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Doval-Wang meeting since December 2019 will take place in Beijing.</li>
  <li>China's foreign ministry emphasizes readiness to strengthen mutual trust and settle differences.</li>
  <li>The two leaders will discuss border management and explore solutions to the boundary dispute.</li>
  <li>Recent agreements were reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control.</li>
  <li>The military standoff, starting in May 2020, has strained India-China relations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“China is ready to work with India to implement the important common understandings between our leaders... and bring bilateral relations back to the track of stable and healthy development as soon as possible.”</blockquote>
<p>This structured dialogue represents a critical step in rebuilding relationships strained by previous military clashes and ongoing tensions along the Indo-China border.</p>]]></description>

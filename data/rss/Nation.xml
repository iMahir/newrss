<p>Bangladesh's interim government has requested the extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, where she has been living in exile since fleeing the country amid protests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sheikh Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, amid student-led protests that deposed her.</li>
  <li>Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal has issued arrest warrants against Hasina for crimes against humanity.</li>
  <li>The interim government has sent a diplomatic note to India requesting her return for judicial proceedings.</li>
  <li>An existing extradition treaty between Bangladesh and India could facilitate the process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Bangladesh wants her back here for the judicial process,” Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain said.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bangladesh is actively pursuing the legal return of Sheikh Hasina to face serious charges stemming from her time in office.</p>]]></description>

<p>A man in Chhattisgarh has fraudulently opened an account in the name of actress Sunny Leone to illegally receive monthly government grants designated for women.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chhattisgarh government provides ₹1,000 every month to married women through the 'Mahtari Vandan Yojana'.</li>
<li>Virendra Joshi allegedly opened the account under Sunny Leone's name and has been receiving money illegally.</li>
<li>Authorities are investigating the case and have frozen the fraudulent account.</li>
<li>The discovery has led to political tensions between the BJP and Congress parties regarding the effectiveness of the scheme.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Deepak Baij of Congress claims that over 50% of beneficiaries of the Mahtari Vandan Yojana are fake.</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights issues of fraud and portrayal of social welfare programs while raising questions about beneficiary verification processes.</p>]]></description>

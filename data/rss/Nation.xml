<p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) council deferred the decision to cut tax on insurance premiums as many inputs including IRDAI comments are awaited. Additionally, the council clarified taxi regulations on popcorn taxation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The GST council did not approve a tax cut on insurance premiums pending IRDAI feedback.</li>
  <li>Clarification issued that pre-packed ready-to-eat snacks will face a 12% tax.</li>
  <li>Tax on caramelised popcorn is set at 18% without changing the existing popcorn tax rate.</li>
  <li>A group of ministers (GoM) will be formed to address Andhra Pradesh’s demand for a calamity cess on luxury goods.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The cess will be on luxury items and state-specific levy," said Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav.</blockquote>
<p>This decision reflects ongoing considerations in adapting taxation to address current needs while awaiting further input from key stakeholders.</p>]]></description>

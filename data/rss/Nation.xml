<p>A 66-year-old father has approached the Bombay High Court seeking permission to terminate the pregnancy of his 27-year-old daughter, who has below-average intelligence and refuses to consent to the procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>The daughter is over 20 weeks pregnant and has not revealed the identity of the child's father.</li>
<li>The court criticized the father's parenting choices and referred the case to a medical board for evaluation.</li>
<li>The father claims financial constraints and old age are reasons for seeking termination, but the court rejected these claims.</li>
<li>The court emphasized parental responsibility and questioned the parent's actions regarding their daughter's wellbeing.</li>
<li>The case is set to be reviewed further after the medical board’s assessment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What kind of parenting is this?” - Bombay High Court</blockquote>
<p>The court's decision will reflect on parental responsibilities and the implications of consent in sensitive matters like termination of pregnancy.</p>]]></description>

<li>At least 46 people, including women and children, were reported dead.</li>

<li>Non-adherence to the draft may bar institutions from UGC programs or degree offerings.</li>
<li>Up to 30 days are provided for public feedback on the draft.</li>
<li>Conflicts have emerged in states like Tamil Nadu and West Bengal regarding Vice-Chancellor appointments.</li>
<li>A public advertisement is required for Vice-Chancellor applications.</li>
<li>Flexibility in faculty qualifications aims to promote a multi-disciplinary environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bangladesh has announced that it is waiting for a response from India regarding the extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The foreign ministry has issued a formal request and stated that they will take further action if India does not reply soon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bangladesh sent a diplomatic note to India on December 23 but has not yet received a response.</li>
  <li>A 'note of urgency' will be issued if India fails to respond within a certain period.</li>
  <li>No specific timeline exists for the extradition process between the two countries.</li>
  <li>The spokesperson for Bangladesh stressed that the country is willing to wait but will not hesitate to act further.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If India does not respond on the issue in an appropriate period of time, Bangladesh will take further steps to ensure Hasina’s extradition." - Mohammed Rafiqul Alam</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bangladesh's threats of diplomatic action highlight the tension surrounding the extradition request of Sheikh Hasina and could escalate if responses from India remain pending.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date: January 11, 2025</strong> | <strong>Source: Hindustan Times</strong></p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/11/550x309/MK_Stalin_1736597919258_1736597919554.jpg" alt="Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin speaks during a session of the state Legislative Assembly, in Chennai, Friday, Jan. 10, 2025.(PTI)">
<figcaption>Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin speaks during a session of the state Legislative Assembly, in Chennai, Friday, Jan. 10, 2025.(PTI)</figcaption>
<p>The Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin criticized Governor RN Ravi for failing to address the state assembly and called his behavior 'childish'.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stalin stated that RN Ravi seemed unable to accept the state's development.</li>
  <li>The governor left the assembly without delivering a customary address due to the Tamil anthem not being played.</li>
  <li>According to Stalin, Ravi’s actions disrespect the assembly and the people of Tamil Nadu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This House cannot bear to see the governor doing something with political motives that drags the position and responsibility he held by not respecting the dignity of this Assembly.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, CM Stalin's remarks reflect ongoing tensions between the Tamil Nadu government and the governor's office, highlighting issues of political integrity and respect in legislative procedures.</p>]]></description>

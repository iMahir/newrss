            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court to Hear Plea by Asaduddin Owaisi to Implement Places of Worship Act</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 02 Jan 2025, 8:14 am</p>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear a plea by AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi regarding the implementation of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Owaisi's petition seeks the enforcement of the Act, which protects the religious character of places of worship as of August 15, 1947.</li>
  <li>The plea has been tagged with another petition by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.</li>
  <li>The matter is expected to be heard in February.</li>
  <li>In December 2024, the Supreme Court ordered trial courts to avoid issuing orders or conducting surveys about existing religious structures in related cases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Act explicitly prohibits the filing of such suits.”</blockquote>
<p>This development emphasizes ongoing legal debates concerning the religious and historical status of places of worship in India, potentially affecting numerous cases across the nation.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Published on:</strong> <time datetime="2025-01-02T05:53:19.365Z" title="2025-01-02 05:53">02 Jan 2025, 5:53 am</time></p>

<figcaption>The amendment suggested by the BCI to the Advocates Act</figcaption>
<p>The Bar Council of India (BCI) has approached the Supreme Court to request an increase in enrolment fees for lawyers due to financial difficulties faced by State Bar Councils.</p>
<ul>
<li>The BCI filed an application to amend the Advocates Act, 1961.</li>
<li>Current enrolment fees are limited to ₹750 for general candidates and ₹125 for SC/ST candidates.</li>
<li>The last fee revision occurred in 1993; BCI cites inflation as a significant issue.</li>
<li>BCI argues that without increased fees, Bar Councils may struggle to maintain operations and pay staff.</li>
<li>The proposed fees include ₹25,000 for general candidates and ₹10,000 for SC/ST candidates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It is also an admitted fact that if the State Bar Councils are restrained from charging anything more than Rs.600/- today; naturally the Bar Councils and the Bar Council of India would die their own death; their survival would not only be difficult rather impossible.”</blockquote>
<p>The BCI emphasizes the need for fee adjustments reflective of current economic conditions to ensure the viability of legal support institutions.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea from AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi regarding the implementation of the 1991 places of worship law, which aims to maintain the religious status of places of worship as they existed on August 15, 1947. The case is set to be discussed on February 17.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court agreed to tag Owaisi's plea with other pending cases regarding the 1991 law.</li>
<li>The law prohibits changing the religious character of places of worship established before August 15, 1947.</li>
<li>Owaisi's petition seeks to compel the Centre to ensure effective implementation of the law.</li>
<li>Challenges to the law include a batch of petitions that have previously been filed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We will tag this,” said Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna.</blockquote>
<p>This development indicates ongoing legal discourse surrounding the protection of religious sites in India and the implications of the 1991 law.</p>]]></description>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to send a ceremonial ‘chadar’ to the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, continuing his tradition amid the ongoing Shiva temple controversy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This year marks Modi's 11th participation in offering the 'chadar'.</li>
  <li>The ‘chadar’ will be presented at the Urs of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.</li>
  <li>Refresh of controversy: A court case is ongoing regarding claims that there is a Shiva temple within the Dargah.</li>
  <li>The Dargah is one of the most revered Sufi shrines, celebrating millions of devotees annually during the Urs festival.</li>
  <li>Prior offerings included representation by other officials during last year's event.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“During the Urs festival, offering the chadar is regarded as a powerful form of worship, believed to bring blessings and fulfill vows.”</blockquote>
<p>This ongoing gesture underscores Modi's commitment to interfaith relations, despite the contrasting Shiv temple claims surrounding the historic Dargah.</p>]]></description>

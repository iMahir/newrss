<p>A man in Chhattisgarh has fraudulently opened an account in the name of actress Sunny Leone to illegally receive monthly government grants designated for women.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chhattisgarh government provides ₹1,000 every month to married women through the 'Mahtari Vandan Yojana'.</li>
<li>Virendra Joshi allegedly opened the account under Sunny Leone's name and has been receiving money illegally.</li>
<li>Authorities are investigating the case and have frozen the fraudulent account.</li>
<li>The discovery has led to political tensions between the BJP and Congress parties regarding the effectiveness of the scheme.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Deepak Baij of Congress claims that over 50% of beneficiaries of the Mahtari Vandan Yojana are fake.</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights issues of fraud and portrayal of social welfare programs while raising questions about beneficiary verification processes.</p>]]></description>

<p>The chief ministers of the Telugu states, Chandrababu Naidu and Revanth Reddy, are set to attend the upcoming World Economic Forum Summit in Davos, which begins on January 20. While this may be an opportunity for them to meet, their attendance will be in an individual capacity rather than a bilateral meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both leaders have previously met to discuss post-bifurcation issues.</li>
<li>This will be Naidu’s first trip to Davos during his second tenure as a chief minister.</li>
<li>Revanth Reddy continues the tradition of attending the summit.</li>
<li>Maharashtra's chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will also be at Davos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“It has to be seen if they will orchestrate a meeting here to discuss political affairs of Telugu states.”</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming summit presents a significant platform for political discussions among the Telugu CMs, which could influence the region's governance.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Narayana Murthy emphasizes the risks of climate change.</figcaption>
<p>Narayana Murthy, Infosys co-founder, emphasizes the urgent need for climate action, warning that climate change could lead to mass migration towards urban areas like Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad due to uninhabitable rural regions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Murthy warns of the significant risks posed by climate change, specifically related to mass migration.</li>
  <li>He predicts that certain rural areas in India may become uninhabitable within 20-25 years.</li>
  <li>Urban centers are already facing issues, including pollution and traffic congestion.</li>
  <li>Urgent cooperation among corporate, political, and bureaucratic sectors is essential to tackle these challenges.</li>
  <li>Murthy expresses optimism about achieving climate targets by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What is likely to happen is that there will be a mass migration from rural parts of states... into habitable places like Bangalore, maybe Pune, maybe Hyderabad.” - Narayana Murthy</blockquote>
<p>Given India's rapid urbanization, the anticipated influx of migrants due to climate change could worsen the already strained infrastructure and resources of urban centers.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Atul Subhash's suicide has galvanised men's rights activists and started a wider debate around India's tough dowry law</figcaption>
<p>On December 9, Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old software engineer, took his own life, leaving behind a note that accused his estranged wife and her family of harassment. His death has ignited discussions surrounding India's controversial dowry law and its implications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subhash left a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video detailing his struggles.</li>
<li>He accused his estranged wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family of harassment, which they denied.</li>
<li>His suicide has led to protests demanding justice and calls for changes to the dowry law.</li>
<li>The law has been criticized for being misused by women, yet women's rights activists point to the ongoing issues of dowry-related violence.</li>
<li>India's Supreme Court has noted the potential misuse of the law, calling for caution in its application.</li>

<figcaption>Narayana Murthy emphasizes the risks of climate change.</figcaption>
<p>Narayana Murthy, Infosys co-founder, emphasizes the urgent need for climate action, warning that climate change could lead to mass migration towards urban areas like Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad due to uninhabitable rural regions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Murthy warns of the significant risks posed by climate change, specifically related to mass migration.</li>
  <li>He predicts that certain rural areas in India may become uninhabitable within 20-25 years.</li>
  <li>Urban centers are already facing issues, including pollution and traffic congestion.</li>
  <li>Urgent cooperation among corporate, political, and bureaucratic sectors is essential to tackle these challenges.</li>
  <li>Murthy expresses optimism about achieving climate targets by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“What is likely to happen is that there will be a mass migration from rural parts of states... into habitable places like Bangalore, maybe Pune, maybe Hyderabad.” - Narayana Murthy</blockquote>
<p>Given India's rapid urbanization, the anticipated influx of migrants due to climate change could worsen the already strained infrastructure and resources of urban centers.</p>]]></description>

<p>On December 9, Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old software engineer, took his own life, leaving behind a note that accused his estranged wife and her family of harassment. His death has ignited discussions surrounding India's controversial dowry law and its implications.</p>
<ul>

<li>He accused his estranged wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family of harassment, which they denied.</li>
<li>His suicide has led to protests demanding justice and calls for changes to the dowry law.</li>

<figcaption>Farmers have been protesting for months over several demands, including a legal guarantee of MSP, on the borders of Delhi. (PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Farmers, led by Jagjit Singh Dallewal, are calling on the Supreme Court to enforce the parliamentary committee's recommendation for a legally guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) for farm produce.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dallewal is on a fast-unto-death to push for the implementation of the MSP law.</li>
  <li>The parliamentary standing committee has emphasized the need for legally guaranteed MSPs for farmers.</li>
  <li>The report suggests the agriculture ministry should create a roadmap for implementing MSP.</li>
  <li>MSPs are intended to provide a minimum price to prevent distress sales among farmers.</li>
  <li>The committee's report discusses the advantages of implementing MSP as a legal guarantee to enhance rural economic growth.</li>
  <li>If not implemented, the government must provide a formal explanation to the committee.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Implementing a legally binding MSP in India is essential not only for safeguarding farmers’ livelihoods but also for promoting rural economic growth.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the farmers' plea, supported by the parliamentary committee, highlights the critical need for legal guarantees to ensure fair compensation for farmers’ produce, which could lead to sustainable farming practices.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Relations between Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena and Arvind Kejriwal have been strained for a long time now. (File Photo)</figcaption>
<p>Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena has approved the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to prosecute Arvind Kejriwal in a case related to an excise policy scam, a move AAP describes as harassment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ED sought permission to prosecute Kejriwal regarding irregularities in the excise policy for the year 2021-22.</li>
  <li>Several AAP leaders have been jailed amid the ongoing investigation.</li>
  <li>AAP claims the prosecution sanction is a political tool used against them.</li>
  <li>The investigation has led to extensive raids and document filings without any financial recovery.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The so-called liquor scam investigation has dragged on for two years... not a single penny has been recovered,” AAP alleged.</blockquote>
<p>The decision has further intensified the political conflict between the AAP government and the Lieutenant Governor's office, highlighting ongoing tensions in Delhi's governance.</p>]]></description>

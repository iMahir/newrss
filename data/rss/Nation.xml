<p>On January 5th, 2025, major media outlets inaccurately reported that OYO Hotels & Homes had implemented a ban on unmarried couples from staying at its hotels, stirring outrage among patrons. However, the revised policy allows partner hotels to make their own decisions on this matter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Several headlines suggested a blanket ban on unmarried couples at OYO Hotels.</li>
  <li>The actual policy allows individual partner hotels discretion to accept or decline bookings from unmarried couples.</li>
  <li>The change was reportedly made in response to feedback from civil society groups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Pawan Sharma, Region Head of OYO North India, stated, “OYO is committed to upholding safe and responsible hospitality practices...”</blockquote>
<p>The uproar stems from misunderstandings generated by misleading headlines rather than a decisive policy reversal by OYO.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR due to improving air quality index (AQI) levels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage III restrictions lifted due to favorable AQI trends.</li>
  <li>Stage I and II measures still in effect, including a ban on non-essential construction work.</li>
  <li>Classes up to grade 5 were previously shifted to a hybrid mode.</li>
  <li>Restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in effect, with exceptions for persons with disabilities.</li>
  <li>Strong advice remains to follow GRAP-II restrictions due to potential changing weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Owing to the favourable meteorological conditions and better wind speed, the AQI of Delhi has been continuously improving" - CAQM's order citing the India Meteorological Department.</blockquote>
<p>This decision comes as the sub-committee will continue to monitor the air quality situation closely.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 05, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/05/550x309/ANI-20250102158-0_1736082763143_1736082794082.jpg" alt="Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh (ANI file photo)">
<figcaption>Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh (ANI file photo)</figcaption>
<p>AAP MP Sanjay Singh criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a rally in Rohini, taking aim at the BJP's failure to declare a chief ministerial candidate ahead of Delhi's assembly elections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Singh mocked Modi's rally comments, stating that nothing would change due to PM's words and highlighting Delhi's pride in Arvind Kejriwal.</li>
<li>He claimed the BJP was 'walking ahead with a marriage procession without the groom', referring to their election strategy.</li>
<li>Modi had earlier urged Delhi voters to elect a BJP-led government, blaming the AAP for development failures in the capital.</li>
<li>Kejriwal reacted by asserting that central government projects wouldn't have happened without AAP's cooperation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Nothing will happen because of what PM Modi says in his speech. Delhi takes pride in Arvind Kejriwal and his work... wo bina dulhe ke baraat lekar nikle hain." - Sanjay Singh</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing exchanges between AAP and BJP leaders indicate a heightened political rivalry as the Delhi assembly elections approach.</p>]]></description>

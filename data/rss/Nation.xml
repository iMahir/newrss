<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>

<figcaption>BJP MPs stage a protest alleging insult of Dr B R Ambedkar by the Congress party, at Parliament complex in New Delhi on Thursday. (Photo: PTI)</figcaption>
<p>The ongoing political dynamics in India have spotlighted the BJP's shifting stance towards Dr. B R Ambedkar, especially amidst recent tensions in Parliament regarding remarks made by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The recent showdown in Parliament highlights the BJP's evolving stance on Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>The BJP seeks to attract all Hindu castes, including Dalits, into its political fold.</li>
  <li>The party’s engagement with Ambedkar is described as politically expedient, especially in competition with the weakened Congress.</li>
  <li>Ambedkar's history as a critic of the caste system complicates his place within Hindu nationalist politics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BJP has attempted to bring all Hindu castes, including Dalits, under the fold of Hindutva — constantly redefining its position on Ambedkar.”</blockquote>
<p>This transformation in the BJP's approach to Ambedkar reflects broader changes in India's political landscape and the party’s strategy to unify diverse groups under its ideology.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Congress party has labeled the FIR against Rahul Gandhi, related to a scuffle in Parliament, as a diversionary tactic from the BJP following his protests against Amit Shah's comments on BR Ambedkar.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Congress claims the FIR is a reaction to Gandhi's firm stance on Ambedkar's legacy.</li>
  <li>KC Venugopal described the FIR as a “badge of honour”.</li>
  <li>Two BJP MPs were injured during the Parliament incident, leading to the complaint against Gandhi.</li>
  <li>Congress is demanding action against BJP MPs for their conduct during the scuffle.</li>
  <li>The controversy occurred during protests over Amit Shah's remarks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A case against him for defending Babasaheb’s legacy is a badge of honour.” - KC Venugopal</blockquote>
<p>This situation underscores ongoing tensions between Congress and the BJP, particularly regarding how Parliament is being managed and the protection of civil rights within it.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 19, 2024</p>

<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/19/550x309/The-Supreme-Court---File-_1734630362796.jpg" alt="The Supreme Court. (File)" title="The Supreme Court. (File)">
<figcaption>The Supreme Court. (File)</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court has described as “shameful” the fact that nearly 3,000 tonnes of solid waste generated daily in Delhi remains untreated, highlighting serious issues with the government’s waste management compliance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court criticized the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) for failing to manage solid waste properly.</li>
  <li>Approximately 11,000 tonnes of solid waste is generated daily in Delhi, with 3,000 tonnes remaining untreated.</li>
  <li>The court summoned the Delhi chief secretary for clarification on compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.</li>
  <li>Concerns were raised regarding the lack of accurate data and inadequate responses regarding waste processing capacity.</li>
  <li>Illegally dumped waste in sites like Ghazipur and Bhalswa poses serious environmental and health risks.</li>
  <li>The court warned that failure to improve waste management may lead to halting developmental activities in the future.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“With some degree of sadness, we record that more than 3000 tonnes of solid waste remains untreated every day.”</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court's criticism reflects deep concerns over pollution and public health in Delhi, urging immediate government action to resolve the solid waste crisis.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Winter Session of Parliament is nearing its end amid escalating tensions, particularly surrounding Home Minister Amit Shah's remarks about Dr. BR Ambedkar. This includes a recently filed FIR against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, where the serious charge of 'attempt to murder' has been removed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>High tension in Parliament with opposition MPs protesting Amit Shah's comments on BR Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi accused of pushing a BJP MP, Pratap Sarangi, during the protest, leading to injuries.</li>
  <li>JPC on 'One Nation, One Election' bills may be formally initiated; committee members include leaders from major parties.</li>
  <li>Nationwide protests planned by Congress against Amit Shah's remarks, calling for his resignation and apology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“BJP MPs blocked our path and instigated the violence,” claimed Rahul Gandhi during a press briefing.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the political landscape in India remains turbulent with ongoing protests and significant allegations, casting a shadow over the Winter Session of Parliament.</p>]]></description>

<p>YSR Congress party president Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy states that public discontent is rising against the Chandrababu Naidu-led government in Andhra Pradesh and calls for protests to channel this dissent.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jagan claims that dissatisfaction with Naidu’s government has escalated significantly over the past six months.</li>
  <li>Protests are planned focusing on specific issues, including rising electricity charges and pending student grants.</li>
  <li>He highlights the negative impact of the TDP regime on farmers and essential agricultural initiatives.</li>

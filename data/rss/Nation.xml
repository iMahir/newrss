<figcaption>The full text of the verdict is expected to be out later on Monday. (Representative file photo)</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court has expressed deep concern over the rise of drug abuse among India’s youth, labeling it a significant societal issue that requires immediate action.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drug abuse is increasingly seen as a symbol of being “cool”.</li>
  <li>Justice BV Nagarathna warned of severe socio-economic and psychological effects of drug abuse.</li>
  <li>The court urged collective action from parents, society, and state authorities.</li>
  <li>It highlighted that drug trade funds violence and terrorism, destabilizing society.</li>
  <li>The judgment emphasized the importance of providing a nurturing environment for youths.</li>
  <li>Parents are urged to counteract substance abuse with love and affection.</li>
  <li>The court called for destigmatizing addiction and supporting rehabilitation initiatives.</li>
  <li>Educational initiatives and community interventions are crucial to combat this issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Drug abuse cannot be treated as a taboo,” the court stated, urging for open dialogue and preventive measures.</blockquote>
<p>The court’s ruling not only addresses the specific case concerning Ankush Vipan Kapoor but also emphasizes the broader implications of substance abuse on society.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India can't see ‘One Nation, One Election’ before 2034. Here’s what Modi govt is proposing</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Insert Date] <strong>Source:</strong> ThePrint</p>
<p>The BJP-led NDA government is set to introduce two significant bills aimed at achieving simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and state assemblies. This move represents a critical step towards fulfilling a major electoral promise by the ruling party.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment Bill) and the Union Territories Law (Amendment) Bill are expected to be introduced in Lok Sabha soon.</li>
  <li>These bills propose amendments to existing articles in the Constitution, enabling simultaneous elections.</li>
  <li>The anticipated implementation date for 'One Nation, One Election' is projected to be 2034.</li>
  <li>The bills will not require ratification by half of the state assemblies due to their constitutionality.</li>
  <li>The government asserts that simultaneous elections will save costs and reduce disruptions caused by prolonged electoral cycles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The ECI has pegged the cost of holding simultaneous elections at Rs 4,500 crore.</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of these bills is part of a broader effort to streamline election processes across India, though the timeline for actual implementation remains several years away.</p>]]></description>

<p>Farmers are intensifying their protests at the Shambhu border as they prepare for a tractor march scheduled outside Punjab, following police restrictions on their movements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A tractor march is planned for December 16, followed by a 'Rail Roko' on December 18 in Punjab.</li>
  <li>Farmers were blocked by police at the Shambhu border, leading to tensions and calls for action.</li>
  <li>Seventeen farmers were reportedly injured during clashes with police when dispersing the initial group attempting to march to Delhi.</li>
  <li>Farmer leader Sarwan Singh Pandher criticized the government's heavy-handed approach and lack of medical assistance for injured farmers.</li>
  <li>Police cited security concerns while blocking the farmers' entry into Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The Indian government, the fifth-largest economy in the world, used force against 101 farmers. Chemical water was thrown at us using cannons, bombs were hurled, and tear gas shells were fired." - Sarwan Singh Pandher</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>India: Why a nation of 1.45 billion wants more children</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023</p>

<figcaption>Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country.</figcaption>
<p>India's population has surpassed China's, leading to a renewed call for having more children, particularly from southern states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which face low fertility rates and ageing populations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>India became the world's most populous country with 1.45 billion people.</li>
  <li>Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are advocating for higher birth rates due to declining fertility.</li>
  <li>The country's fertility rate has dropped significantly from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to 2 currently.</li>
  <li>Some southern states maintain fertility rates below the replacement level, raising concerns about political representation.</li>
  <li>The impending delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 could disadvantage economically prosperous southern states.</li>
  <li>Demographers warn India's rapid ageing due to declining fertility rates may have economic and social implications.</li>
  <li>Leaders, including Modi, suggest any changes to fiscal allocations will be considered carefully.</li>
  <li>Experts stress the need for policies that enhance productivity and support a growing elderly population.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"India is getting old before getting rich." - Srinivas Goli</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as India's demographics shift dramatically, the focus on increasing birth rates comes amid fears of economic strains and reduced political influence for certain regions.</p>]]></description>

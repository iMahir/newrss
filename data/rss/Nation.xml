<p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted a Delhi High Court order that compelled the Delhi government to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Centre for the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme. AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal criticized the scheme, calling it a 'scam' and expressed relief that the Supreme Court acknowledged its flaws.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supreme Court stayed a High Court order demanding the Delhi government to sign an MoU for Ayushman Bharat.</li>
<li>Kejriwal referred to Ayushman Bharat as the 'biggest scam' in the country during a press conference.</li>
<li>The Delhi High Court previously directed the government to ensure the scheme's full implementation.</li>
<li>Kejriwal's comments arose after a Supreme Court notice to the Centre regarding the Delhi government's plea against the High Court's order.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Ayushman Bharat is the biggest scam in the country. When the central government changes and an inquiry is conducted into these scams, people will realize how big a scam Ayushman Bharat truly was.” - Arvind Kejriwal</blockquote>
<p>This ruling could have significant implications for the implementation of health infrastructure in Delhi and sheds light on the ongoing political tensions surrounding healthcare policies in the capital.</p>]]></description>

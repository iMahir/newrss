<figcaption>The full text of the verdict is expected to be out later on Monday. (Representative file photo)</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court has expressed deep concern over the rise of drug abuse among India’s youth, labeling it a significant societal issue that requires immediate action.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drug abuse is increasingly seen as a symbol of being “cool”.</li>
  <li>Justice BV Nagarathna warned of severe socio-economic and psychological effects of drug abuse.</li>
  <li>The court urged collective action from parents, society, and state authorities.</li>
  <li>It highlighted that drug trade funds violence and terrorism, destabilizing society.</li>
  <li>The judgment emphasized the importance of providing a nurturing environment for youths.</li>
  <li>Parents are urged to counteract substance abuse with love and affection.</li>
  <li>The court called for destigmatizing addiction and supporting rehabilitation initiatives.</li>
  <li>Educational initiatives and community interventions are crucial to combat this issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Drug abuse cannot be treated as a taboo,” the court stated, urging for open dialogue and preventive measures.</blockquote>
<p>The court’s ruling not only addresses the specific case concerning Ankush Vipan Kapoor but also emphasizes the broader implications of substance abuse on society.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court To Hear West Bengal Govt's Plea Against Cancellations Of OBC Classifications On January 28</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 28, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Law</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing for the West Bengal government's petition challenging the Calcutta High Court's decision to quash the OBC classification of 77 communities. The hearing is set for January 28 and 29.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Calcutta High Court annulled the OBC status of 77 communities.</li>
  <li>Justice BR Gavai and Justice Augustine George Masih will preside over the case.</li>
  <li>The Solicitor General indicated the National Commission for Backward Classes has submitted relevant documents.</li>
  <li>Concerns were raised about proper consultation and process transparency regarding OBC classifications.</li>
  <li>The High Court's order reflected on potential political motivations behind the classifications.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Commission and State acted in undue haste... no proper enquiry was conducted by the Commission.”</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court's ruling will determine the future of OBC classifications in West Bengal, potentially impacting the communities involved.</p>]]></description>

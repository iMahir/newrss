<p>Delhi lieutenant governor Vinai Kumar Saxena has publicly criticized former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, attributing the severe pollution in the Yamuna River to his actions, including interference with cleaning efforts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Saxena accused Kejriwal of halting pollution clean-up operations mandated by the Supreme Court.</li>
  <li>The Yamuna has reportedly reached unprecedented pollution levels this year.</li>
  <li>Saxena reiterated his requests for Kejriwal to personally assess the pollution situation.</li>
  <li>This incident follows prior instances of Saxena holding Kejriwal accountable for the river's declining condition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Yamuna has reached its highest level of pollution this year. I will personally hold you responsible for this.” - Vinai Kumar Saxena</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Sheikh Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, amid student-led protests that deposed her.</li>
  <li>Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal has issued arrest warrants against Hasina for crimes against humanity.</li>
  <li>The interim government has sent a diplomatic note to India requesting her return for judicial proceedings.</li>
  <li>An existing extradition treaty between Bangladesh and India could facilitate the process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Bangladesh wants her back here for the judicial process,” Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain said.</blockquote>

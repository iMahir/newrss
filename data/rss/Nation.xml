<p>The Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR due to improving air quality index (AQI) levels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage III restrictions lifted due to favorable AQI trends.</li>
  <li>Stage I and II measures still in effect, including a ban on non-essential construction work.</li>
  <li>Classes up to grade 5 were previously shifted to a hybrid mode.</li>
  <li>Restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in effect, with exceptions for persons with disabilities.</li>
  <li>Strong advice remains to follow GRAP-II restrictions due to potential changing weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Owing to the favourable meteorological conditions and better wind speed, the AQI of Delhi has been continuously improving" - CAQM's order citing the India Meteorological Department.</blockquote>
<p>This decision comes as the sub-committee will continue to monitor the air quality situation closely.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 05, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>

<figcaption>Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh (ANI file photo)</figcaption>
<p>AAP MP Sanjay Singh criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a rally in Rohini, taking aim at the BJP's failure to declare a chief ministerial candidate ahead of Delhi's assembly elections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Singh mocked Modi's rally comments, stating that nothing would change due to PM's words and highlighting Delhi's pride in Arvind Kejriwal.</li>
<li>He claimed the BJP was 'walking ahead with a marriage procession without the groom', referring to their election strategy.</li>
<li>Modi had earlier urged Delhi voters to elect a BJP-led government, blaming the AAP for development failures in the capital.</li>
<li>Kejriwal reacted by asserting that central government projects wouldn't have happened without AAP's cooperation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Nothing will happen because of what PM Modi says in his speech. Delhi takes pride in Arvind Kejriwal and his work... wo bina dulhe ke baraat lekar nikle hain." - Sanjay Singh</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing exchanges between AAP and BJP leaders indicate a heightened political rivalry as the Delhi assembly elections approach.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Through the 1990s, when alcohol was heavily taxed across India, Goa’s sunset beers and shacks became young India’s first taste of freedom. | Vikram Bhalla</figcaption>
<p>As Goa faces scrutiny over declining tourist numbers, both tourists and locals express frustration about evolving travel norms and rising costs. Officials assert that tourist numbers are robust, while many locals feel that the type of tourists visiting has changed significantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media showcases contrasts between packed tourist spots and empty cafes.</li>
<li>Domestic tourists voice complaints about costs and service, labeling some visitors as “minibus tourists.”</li>
<li>Government officials assert that tourism remains strong and criticize influencers for negative portrayals.</li>
<li>The hospitality industry grapples with a shift in tourist demographics post-pandemic.</li>
<li>Many in Goa seek to redefine the destination’s identity amidst ongoing transformations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Perhaps what we’re witnessing isn’t so much the death of Goa’s tourism—it’s the end of a particular dream of Goa, steeped in nostalgia.”</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing debate highlights the need for Goa to navigate its identity as it evolves, balancing the needs of its residents with those of new visitors.</p>]]></description>

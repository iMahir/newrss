<figcaption>Farmers have been protesting for months over several demands, including a legal guarantee of MSP, on the borders of Delhi. (PTI)</figcaption>
<p>Farmers, led by Jagjit Singh Dallewal, are calling on the Supreme Court to enforce the parliamentary committee's recommendation for a legally guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) for farm produce.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dallewal is on a fast-unto-death to push for the implementation of the MSP law.</li>
  <li>The parliamentary standing committee has emphasized the need for legally guaranteed MSPs for farmers.</li>
  <li>The report suggests the agriculture ministry should create a roadmap for implementing MSP.</li>
  <li>MSPs are intended to provide a minimum price to prevent distress sales among farmers.</li>
  <li>The committee's report discusses the advantages of implementing MSP as a legal guarantee to enhance rural economic growth.</li>
  <li>If not implemented, the government must provide a formal explanation to the committee.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Implementing a legally binding MSP in India is essential not only for safeguarding farmers’ livelihoods but also for promoting rural economic growth.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the farmers' plea, supported by the parliamentary committee, highlights the critical need for legal guarantees to ensure fair compensation for farmers’ produce, which could lead to sustainable farming practices.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023<br><strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>The Punjab Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has faced a significant setback in the recent civic polls, winning only one of five municipal corporation victories, raising concerns about its political strength.</p>
<ul>
  <li>AAP secured a victory in Patiala but lost major ground in Sangrur, Chief Minister Mann's home region.</li>
  <li>Two sitting AAP MLAs' wives lost their election bids in Ludhiana.</li>
  <li>AAP won 522 of 961 wards (55%), while Congress claimed 191 wards (20%).</li>
  <li>In Sangrur, AAP only won 7 of 29 wards; Congress and BJP performed better.</li>
  <li>Backed Independents gained ground in some areas, complicating AAP's position.</li>
  <li>Despite setbacks, AAP claimed a strong performance in municipal councils, winning 31 of 41 councils.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We wrested urban areas, which are seen to be the strongholds of the Congress and BJP,” said Punjab AAP chief Aman Arora.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while AAP can celebrate some wins, the overall results indicate troubling trends, especially in areas previously considered secure for them.</p>]]></description>

<p>A 24-year-old man from Assam was arrested for allegedly killing his one-year-old daughter and wife, then staging their deaths as an accident.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The accused, Rois Uddin Barbhuiya, initially claimed the deaths were due to a car accident in the Barak River.</li>
    <li>Investigation revealed he killed his wife, Heli Begum, and daughter before pushing their car into the river.</li>
    <li>The bodies were recovered from the river on December 18, prompting further investigation by local police.</li>
    <li>Barbhuiya's in-laws filed a complaint after finding discrepancies in his account of events.</li>
    <li>Authorities are investigating the motive behind the alleged killings.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The locals too said that Barbhuiya had called them after allegedly plunging the car into the river and claimed that he had managed to escape.” - Numal Mahatta, Superintendent of Police</blockquote>

<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah stated that Tripura remained a backward state during the 35 years of Left rule, claiming significant development occurred only after the BJP took power in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shah emphasized that under communist rule, development was stagnant, with only 2.5% of the population having access to piped drinking water.</li>
<li>He highlighted improvements made since BJP assumed power, including 85% access to potable water and free healthcare initiatives.</li>
<li>Shah noted significant support extended to rehabilitated Bru tribals, who were displaced due to ethnic violence in Mizoram.</li>
<li>The Home Minister assured that rehabilitated individuals received financial support for home construction and have been integrated into the electoral process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For 35 years, the communists ruled Tripura. The communists claimed that they worked for the welfare of the poor... but now we are addressing it.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Amit Shah's statements aim to showcase the contrasts in governance and development between the BJP and the previous Left government in Tripura, emphasizing the positive changes since the BJP took office.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Dec 20, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Times</p>

<p>In a major relief for commuters using the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway, the Supreme Court has upheld a decision barring the collection of toll charges, reprimanding the Noida Authority for allowing a toll company to exploit commuters indefinitely.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court confirmed the Allahabad High Court's 2016 ruling against toll collection by the Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd (NTBCL).</li>
  <li>The court found that NTBCL had already recovered the costs and profits since the expressway opened in 2001.</li>
  <li>Justice Kant criticized the Noida Authority for not defining a time frame for toll collection, leading to indefinite charges on users.</li>
  <li>The court validated a public interest litigation filed against NTBCL's toll collection practices.</li>
  <li>Prior to this ruling, commuters were paying ₹28 per trip or ₹56 for round trips.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“NOIDA overstepped its authority by delegating powers to NTBCL to collect or levy fees, resulting in undue burden on users,” - Justice Surya Kant.</blockquote>
<p>The verdict is expected to alleviate the financial burden on thousands of daily commuters, promoting fairness in public infrastructure projects.</p>]]></description>

<p>The ongoing political dynamics in India have spotlighted the BJP's shifting stance towards Dr. B R Ambedkar, especially amidst recent tensions in Parliament regarding remarks made by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The recent showdown in Parliament highlights the BJP's evolving stance on Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>The BJP seeks to attract all Hindu castes, including Dalits, into its political fold.</li>
  <li>The party’s engagement with Ambedkar is described as politically expedient, especially in competition with the weakened Congress.</li>
  <li>Ambedkar's history as a critic of the caste system complicates his place within Hindu nationalist politics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The BJP has attempted to bring all Hindu castes, including Dalits, under the fold of Hindutva — constantly redefining its position on Ambedkar.”</blockquote>
<p>This transformation in the BJP's approach to Ambedkar reflects broader changes in India's political landscape and the party’s strategy to unify diverse groups under its ideology.</p>]]></description>

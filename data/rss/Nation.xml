<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 29 Dec 2024, 1:53 am</p>

<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Rahul Gandhi paying respects to Manmohan Singh">
<figcaption>Rahul Gandhi pays last respects to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</figcaption>
<p>The political dispute regarding the memorial for former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh intensified after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi condemned the government for performing his last rites at Nigambodh Ghat instead of an authorized burial site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi labels the government's actions as a "total insult" to Singh.</li>
  <li>He urges that Singh deserved a memorial that reflects his stature and contributions.</li>
  <li>The Aam Aadmi Party demands an apology from the government for the treatment of Singh's last rites.</li>
  <li>Critics highlight the disparity in memorial treatment compared to other former prime ministers.</li>
  <li>Union Home Minister Amit Shah states that space for a memorial will be allocated later.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To date, respecting the dignity of all former Prime Ministers, their last rites were performed at authorized burial sites…”</blockquote>
<p>This controversy raises questions about the respect given to former leaders and the implications of political actions in times of national mourning.</p>]]></description>

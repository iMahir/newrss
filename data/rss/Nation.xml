<img title="'If Pranab Mukherjee Were PM...': Mani Shankar Aiyar On Congress' 2014 Rout" alt="'If Pranab Mukherjee Were PM...': Mani Shankar Aiyar On Congress' 2014 Rout" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-09/89vl7lpo_pranab-mukherjee-pti650_625x300_01_September_20.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=650,height=400">
<figcaption>Pranab Mukherjee was elected President in 2012 after a four-decade career in Congress</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses comments made by Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar regarding the impact Pranab Mukherjee could have had on the Congress party's performance in the 2014 general elections if he had been Prime Minister instead of Dr. Manmohan Singh.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar believes that Pranab Mukherjee as Prime Minister during UPA-II would have changed the outcome of the 2014 elections.</li>
    <li>The Congress party faced its worst performance, winning only 44 seats, attributed to "no governance" in 2013.</li>
    <li>Pranab Mukherjee, who had significant charisma and energy, could have better led the party and government.</li>
    <li>Aiyar compares Congress's 2014 defeat to its peak of 414 seats in 1984.</li>
    <li>The absence of effective governance in 2013 made it difficult for Congress to counter BJP's attacks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>"A party that had been at 414 in December 1984 had fallen by 2014 to 44 seats. That is because there was no governance in 2013..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Aiyar reflects on the potential different paths the Congress party could have taken if Pranab Mukherjee had been at the helm, suggesting it might have resulted in a better electoral outcome.]]></description>

<figcaption>Omar Abdullah addresses the inconsistencies in questioning EVMs.</figcaption>
<p>Omar Abdullah, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and member of the National Conference, criticized Congress for its inconsistent stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), emphasizing that such questioning should be consistent.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Omar Abdullah stated it is wrong to question EVMs only when results are unfavorable.</li>
    <li>He mentioned that if parties distrust EVMs, they should refrain from contesting elections.</li>
    <li>Abdullah highlighted his own electoral experiences, noting he never blamed EVMs for election outcomes.</li>
    <li>The National Conference performed well in recent Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls, winning 48 out of 95 seats.</li>
    <li>Abdullah praised infrastructure initiatives by the Modi government, contrasting with Congress's critiques.</li>
    <li>His remarks reflect a potential rift within the INDIA alliance, particularly concerning Congress's leadership role.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs... you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to." - Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>Abdullah's comments underline the complexities within the opposition alliance and suggest a call for greater consistency and self-reflection among its members regarding electoral integrity and leadership dynamics.</p>]]></description>

<p>Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the Congress party's stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), arguing that they cannot reject EVMs after losses while celebrating wins with the same machines.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdullah addressed the Congress's doubts about EVMs following defeats in the Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly polls.</li>
    <li>He stated that one cannot selectively trust EVMs based on election outcomes.</li>
    <li>Abdullah encouraged parties to remain consistent in their views on voting mechanisms.</li>
    <li>He defended the Central Vista project, stating it was necessary for a new Parliament building.</li>
    <li>Reports indicate rising tension between the National Conference (NC) and Congress, particularly after recent elections in Jammu and Kashmir.</li>

<p>Abdullah's comments indicate growing friction within the INDIA alliance and highlight the need for party leaders to consistently support their electoral processes. His advocacy for principles over partisan loyalty bolsters his political stance amid rising tensions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>My Career Made, Then Unmade By Gandhis: Mani Shankar Aiyar's Big Claim</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Press Trust of India</p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has claimed that the Gandhi family played a significant role in both his political rise and subsequent marginalization within the party.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar stated, "The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis."</li>
    <li>He expressed frustration over a lack of substantial engagement with key members of the Gandhi family over the years.</li>
    <li>Aiyar mentioned he did not have the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi for a decade and had only limited interactions with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>He recalled needing to ask Priyanka to convey birthday wishes to Rahul during a period of his suspension from the party.</li>
    <li>Aiyar wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi seeking clarity on his suspension but received no acknowledgment.</li>
    <li>He reflected on the political environment in 2012 during crises for both Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh, noting Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership during that time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi.”</blockquote>
<p>This interview sheds light on the complex dynamics within the Congress party and highlights Aiyar's personal experiences regarding his political journey influenced by the Gandhi family.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 13, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Law</p>
<p>Allahabad High Court Judge, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, is facing an impeachment motion in the Rajya Sabha due to controversial remarks he made about the Muslim community.</p>
<ul>
    <li>An impeachment motion against Justice Yadav was initiated by 55 MPs.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court sought details regarding his remarks following media coverage of the incident.</li>
    <li>Impeachment involves parliamentary proceedings based on allegations of misconduct or incapacity.</li>
    <li>The procedure for impeachment is defined in the Constitution of India and the Judges Inquiry Act 1968.</li>
    <li>Impeachment requires a special majority in both houses of Parliament.</li>
    <li>Previous attempts at impeachment in India have often failed due to lack of support.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-third of the members of the House present and voting.”</blockquote>
<p>The impeachment process has historical context with only four formal attempts in independent India, highlighting the complexity and challenges faced during such proceedings.</p>]]></description>

<p>A day after raids were carried out in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal to check irregularities in electricity distribution in two localities, the district administration claimed that power theft worth Rs 1.3 crore by four mosques and a madrassa has been uncovered.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The raids revealed that significant electricity theft has occurred over the past year in the area, coinciding with efforts against power theft.</li>
    <li>Sambhal District Magistrate Rajender Pensiya noted electricity theft during a loudspeaker check, prompting two raids involving multiple authorities.</li>
    <li>Electricity worth around Rs 300 crore is supplied to Sambhal Nagar Palika area yearly, with line losses reported at 72%. In some areas, losses approach 85%.</li>
    <li>1,250 FIRs related to electricity theft have been lodged in the area since September.</li>
    <li>An illegal power house was found supplying electricity to over 100 houses, with other methods of theft including tampered meters.</li>
    <li>Measures to combat theft include laying 20 kilometres of armed wire, while dealing with encroachments and noise complaints simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “In our drive to stop the electricity theft, we found that people use five to six ways… of these, a few methods are new to us. We never knew electricity could be stolen this way.” — Rajender Pensiya
</blockquote>
<p>The situation highlights extensive power theft that has been ongoing in Sambhal, with local authorities taking increased measures to combat this issue through raids and infrastructure improvement initiatives.</p>]]></description>

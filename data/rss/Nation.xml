            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Congress Defends Rahul Gandhi's Remarks on 'Indian State'</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Thursday<br><strong>Source:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>The Congress party defended Rahul Gandhi against criticism for his comments about 'fighting the Indian state', referencing Article 12 of the Indian Constitution to clarify his statements about institutional capture by the ruling BJP and RSS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi stated that the Congress is fighting against not only the BJP and RSS, but the broader Indian state.</li>
  <li>Former Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel supported Gandhi’s remarks, emphasizing the capture of institutions meant to uphold justice and democracy.</li>
  <li>Baghel criticized government institutions for being misused by the ruling party, citing the Election Commission and other agencies as examples.</li>
  <li>Pawan Khera highlighted concerns about the selective enforcement of laws, claiming opposition leaders are targeted while allies go unpunished.</li>
  <li>Baghel also condemned RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's comments regarding India's independence, framing them as anti-constitutional.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Why else do institutions like the ED seem to remember the addresses of only opposition leaders?” - Pawan Khera</blockquote>
<p>This defense reflects ongoing tensions between the Congress party and the ruling government, centering on the integrity of democratic institutions in India.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Delhi Pollution: Stage 4 Restrictions Revoked as Pollution Levels Decline</h1>
<p><strong>Date: January 16, 2025</strong> | <strong>Source: Hindustan Times</strong></p>
<img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/16/550x309/Delhi_pollution_1737037652149_1737037652445.jpg" alt="Commuters step out on a cold foggy morning in New Delhi.(Sunil Ghosh/Hindustan Times)">
<figcaption>Commuters step out on a cold foggy morning in New Delhi.(Sunil Ghosh/Hindustan Times)</figcaption>
<p>The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked Stage 4 curbs of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) due to a drop in pollution levels in Delhi-NCR, though curbs under Stage 3 will remain in effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>The revocation comes after air quality improved, reducing the need for stricter measures.</li>
<li>Stage 4 restrictions included a ban on all construction, limiting entry of non-essential polluting trucks, and moving most school classes to hybrid mode.</li>
<li>Stage 3 restrictions include a ban on private construction, school shifts for younger classes to hybrid learning, and restrictions on certain vehicles.</li>
<li>Pollution levels in the region rise during winter due to various local factors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local pollution sources, lead to hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during winters.”</blockquote>
<p>Overall, while pollution levels have declined, further monitoring and restrictions under Stage 3 of GRAP will continue to ensure air quality standards are met.</p>]]></description>

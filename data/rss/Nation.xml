(Representational photo)(HT File)</figcaption>
<p>An engineering student in Maharashtra's Nagpur allegedly killed his parents over differences regarding his academic record and career, news agency PTI reported. The 25-year-old accused, Utkarsh Dhakhole, killed his parents at their residence in Kapil Nagar area on December 26. He also hid their bodies and told his relatives that his parents had gone to Bengaluru to take part in a meditation programme. Days later, Dhakole's neighbours complained to the police of a foul smell in the neighbourhood, leading to the discovery of the bodies and his arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The victim's parents wanted him to quit engineering due to his poor academic record.</li>
<li>Utkarsh allegedly strangled his mother and stabbed his father to death.</li>
<li>He confessed to the crime during police investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notable Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>“Utkarsh failed to clear several subjects during his engineering course. His parents, therefore, wanted him to quit engineering and choose something else. However, he was against their suggestion,” the official added.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The incident serves as a grim reminder of the pressure students face regarding academic expectations and career choices, often leading to tragic consequences.</p>]]></description>

<h1>Chilling Murder-Suicide: UP Man Kills Family, Blames Land Mafia and Neighbors</h1>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, a 24-year-old man from Uttar Pradesh named Arshad murdered his mother and four sisters before sharing a video of the crime online. Arshad was later arrested at the crime scene in Lucknow.</p>
<p>The chilling video, which emerged hours after the murders, shows Arshad alleging that neighbors and land mafia in their hometown of Budaun had captured their house and planned to traffic his sisters. He claimed that he killed his family members to prevent this from happening.</p>
<ol>
<li>Arshad choked and slit the wrists of his mother and sisters.</li>
<li>He blamed local land mafia and neighbors for harassing his family and capturing their house.</li>
<li>Arshad requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for justice.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have killed my mother and sisters. When police get this video, they must know that the locals are responsible. They harassed us to capture our house. We raised our voice, but no one heard. It has been 15 days that we have been sleeping on the footpath, wandering in the cold. We don’t want the children to wander in the cold. They have captured our house. The documents are with us."<br>
- Arshad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arshad also claimed that his family wanted to live peacefully and had approached many people for help, but no one assisted them. He expressed fear that his sisters were dying and that he himself would not live much longer.</p>

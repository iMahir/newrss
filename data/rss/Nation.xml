<li>Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reiterated India's longstanding position on sovereignty and the illegality of China's occupation.</li>
<li>India is also monitoring the situation concerning other geopolitical issues, such as the sentencing of Ms. Nimisha Priya in Yemen.</li>

<blockquote>“Creation of new counties will neither have a bearing on India’s long-standing and consistent position regarding our sovereignty over the area nor lend legitimacy to China’s illegal and forcible occupation.” - Randhir Jaiswal</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Rules CBI Can Register FIRs Against Central Employees Without State Consent</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 2, 2023  <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<p>The Supreme Court affirmed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is not required to seek consent from state governments to register FIRs against central government employees working in that state regarding corruption allegations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Court addressed two FIRs filed under the Prevention of Corruption Act against central government employees in Andhra Pradesh.</li>
  <li>The Andhra Pradesh High Court had initially ruled that state consent was necessary due to the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.</li>
  <li>The Supreme Court overturned this ruling, emphasizing that general consent given under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act remains valid.</li>
  <li>The Court reaffirmed its stance from previous cases regarding the necessity of consent for CBI investigations across state lines.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Therefore, the question is in such circumstances merely because such an employee works within the territory of a particular State, to register an FIR by the CBI in connection with commission of an offence under a Central Act whether consent from the State Government concerned is required or not?”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling clarifies the extent of the CBI's authority and the interpretation of consent under central laws, ensuring streamlined investigations into corruption without state hindrances.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Clarifies Continuity of Laws Post Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Bifurcation</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has clarified that the laws applicable to the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh will continue to apply to the newly formed States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh until altered or repealed. This decision follows a legal challenge regarding the jurisdiction of the CBI in corruption cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court set aside a prior judgment from the Andhra Pradesh High Court regarding consent for CBI investigations in the newly formed states.</li>
  <li>The High Court previously ruled that CBI needed consent from Andhra Pradesh for investigations under the Prevention of Corruption Act.</li>
  <li>The Supreme Court found that no explicit consent was necessary as the accused were Central Government employees.</li>
  <li>The decision references previous case law regarding the continuity of laws after state bifurcations.</li>
  <li>This ruling may affect similar jurisdictional issues in other cases involving Central Government employees.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Finally, the Court framed the question: ‘merely because such an employee works within the territory of a particular State, to register an FIR by the CBI in connection with commission of an offence under a Central Act whether consent from the State Government concerned is required or not?’”</blockquote>
<p>The ruling specifies that the continuity of laws remains effective until legally changed, impacting the operations of various governmental agencies in both states.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Issues Notice to Dera Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in 2002 Murder Case</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Today, <strong>Source:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has issued a notice to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, chief of Dera Sacha Sauda, along with four others in the 2002 murder case of former Dera manager Ranjit Singh, after the CBI challenged the Punjab and Haryana High Court's acquittal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The notice follows the CBI's plea against the acquittal of Ram Rahim and co-accused.</li>
  <li>The murder occurred on July 10, 2002, related to an anonymous letter alleging sexual exploitation by Ram Rahim.</li>
  <li>A special CBI court had previously convicted Ram Rahim and four others in 2021, awarding them life imprisonment.</li>
  <li>In May 2024, the Punjab and Haryana High Court overturned this conviction.</li>
  <li>Ram Rahim's past convictions include the rape of two women, leading to widespread violence in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The CBI court concluded that Ram Rahim orchestrated the murder due to suspicions about Mr. Singh’s involvement in exposing allegations.”</blockquote>
<p>This case highlights the ongoing legal battles involving Gurmeet Ram Rahim and the significant societal implications stemming from his actions.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Supreme Court has requested responses from Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and four others concerning the CBI's appeal against their acquittal in a murder case from 2002.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court issued the notices on January 3, 2025.</li>
  <li>The CBI has appealed against a previous acquittal by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.</li>
  <li>The acquittal involved the murder of Ranjit Singh, the former manager of Dera Sacha Sauda.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The CBI has challenged the order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on May 28, 2024, acquitting Singh and four others over the murder of the sect's former manager Ranjit Singh.</blockquote>
<p>This case may have significant implications for the individuals involved and for the intersection of law and religious leadership in India.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Survey finds nearly 50% of health insurance claims rejected in last 3 years: Top 5 reasons</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> June to December 2024<br><strong>Source:</strong> LocalCircles</p>
<p>Health insurance claim rejections have become a significant concern for policyholders in India, with a recent survey indicating that nearly half faced either partial or complete claim rejections.</p>
<ul>
<li>The survey received over 100,000 responses from policyholders across 327 districts.</li>
<li>Over 60% of respondents reported waiting six to 48 hours post-claim approval for hospital discharge.</li>
<li>Of 28,700 responses on claim settlements, 33% reported partial payments, and 20% faced outright rejections.</li>
<li>The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) noted a 19.10% annual increase in denied claims, totaling ₹26,000 crore in FY24.</li>
<li>Reasons for claim rejections include incorrect documentation, non-coverage of pre-existing conditions, policy lapses, waiting period violations, and inadequate medical records.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Whether it’s missing information or errors in medical records, insurers often reject claims if the paperwork doesn't match their requirements."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the survey highlights critical issues within the health insurance system that need addressing to prevent claim denials and support policyholders better.</p>]]></description>

<li>Only 67,000 schools operate without functional toilets, mainly affecting government schools.</li>
<li>Only 33.2% of government schools have disabled-friendly toilets, with fewer being functional.</li>
<li>50% of all schools lack access to computers for educational purposes.</li>
<li>Only 10.5% of schools have implemented solar panel facilities.</li>
<li>Only 17.5% of schools have co-curricular activity rooms or arts and crafts facilities.</li>
<li>In government secondary schools, 50.2% have science laboratory facilities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The condition is much worse when it comes to providing disabled-friendly facilities, with only 33.2% of schools having disabled-friendly toilets."</blockquote>

<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah claims that Article 370 has played a critical role in fostering terrorism in Kashmir, attributing it to the notion of temporary relations between Kashmir and India.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 370 fostered separatism among Kashmiri youth, leading to terrorism.</li>
<li>Other Muslim-majority regions in India did not experience similar terrorism despite sharing borders with Pakistan.</li>
<li>Mr. Shah stated that the misconception of Kashmir's relationship with India promoted extremism.</li>
<li>The revocation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, must be understood in the larger historical context.</li>

<p>The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has invoked Stage 3 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) due to deteriorating air quality in Delhi, with the AQI reaching 371. Unfavorable weather conditions have contributed to the worsening pollution levels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAQM has mandated immediate implementation of Stage 3 curbs to mitigate rising pollution.</li>
  <li>The AQI has shown a significant increase, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.</li>
  <li>Last week, these curbs were lifted as air quality improved due to rain.</li>
  <li>Supreme Court orders require GRAP Stage III measures for AQI above 350.</li>
  <li>Stage 3 bans non-essential construction work and restricts certain vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Stage 3 curbs have been invoked due to the 24-hour average air quality index standing at 371.”</blockquote>
<p>The invocation of Stage 3 reflects the growing concern over air quality in Delhi, necessitating swift action to protect public health.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>In FY24, rural poverty ratio fell below 5% for the first time: SBI report</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> [Date not provided] | <strong>Source:</strong> SBI Research</p>
<p>Poverty in rural areas has decreased significantly, with the ratio falling to 4.86% in FY24 from 7.2% in FY23. This marks the first time it has dipped below 5%, contrasting with a smaller decrease in urban poverty.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The urban poverty ratio decreased from 4.6% to 4.09%.</li>
  <li>The decline in rural poverty is attributed to increased consumption growth in the lower income fractile and improvements in physical infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Transfer schemes such as Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) have also contributed to narrowing the rural-urban income gap.</li>
  <li>The new poverty line is estimated at ~1,632 per month for rural areas and ~1,944 for urban areas.</li>
  <li>Critics argue the SBI report relies on a flawed poverty line methodology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Enhanced physical infrastructure is scripting a new story in rural mobility.”</blockquote>
<p>Despite positive trends, experts caution about the robustness of the data and its implications for future poverty assessments.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Rules CBI Can Register FIRs Against Central Employees Without State Consent</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 2, 2023  <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<p>The Supreme Court affirmed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is not required to seek consent from state governments to register FIRs against central government employees working in that state regarding corruption allegations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Court addressed two FIRs filed under the Prevention of Corruption Act against central government employees in Andhra Pradesh.</li>
  <li>The Andhra Pradesh High Court had initially ruled that state consent was necessary due to the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.</li>
  <li>The Supreme Court overturned this ruling, emphasizing that general consent given under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act remains valid.</li>
  <li>The Court reaffirmed its stance from previous cases regarding the necessity of consent for CBI investigations across state lines.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Therefore, the question is in such circumstances merely because such an employee works within the territory of a particular State, to register an FIR by the CBI in connection with commission of an offence under a Central Act whether consent from the State Government concerned is required or not?”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling clarifies the extent of the CBI's authority and the interpretation of consent under central laws, ensuring streamlined investigations into corruption without state hindrances.</p>]]></description>

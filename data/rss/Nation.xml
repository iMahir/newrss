<figcaption>The bill is expected to be introduced in the Lok Sabha on Monday (HT photo)</figcaption>
<p>The Constitutional Amendment Bill for "One Nation, One Election" aims to synchronize the terms of the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, but actual simultaneous voting will not begin until 2034.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The bill proposes new articles to allow synchronization of terms for both Lok Sabha and state assemblies.</li>
    <li>Should a legislature dissolve early, mid-term elections will only be for the remaining term of that specific legislature.</li>
    <li>The amendments include adding Article 82(A) and modifying Articles 83, 172, and 327.</li>
    <li>The provisions will take effect from an "appointed date" as determined by the President after the next general election in 2029.</li>
    <li>It establishes that legislative assemblies elected after the appointed date will end with the tenure of the Lok Sabha.</li>
    <li>A second bill will align elections in Union Territories with the synchronizations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Notwithstanding anything in Article 83 and Article 172, the term of all legislative assemblies constituted in any general election held after the appointed date and before the expiry of the full term of the House of the People shall come to an end on the expiry of the full term of the House of the People.”</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of this bill marks a significant move towards potential electoral reform in India, with critics raising concerns about its implications for democracy.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar addresses the launch of 'The Nehru Development Model'.</figcaption>
<p>In a recent address, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar discussed the failures of the 'Nehru development model' and the ongoing efforts to correct its consequences since 2014.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jaishankar stated that both Russia and China reject the economic assumptions of the Nehru era.</li>
    <li>The 'Nehru development model' has influenced India's politics, bureaucracy, and education.</li>
    <li>He emphasized a strong need for a course correction post-2014, but acknowledged this task remains challenging.</li>
    <li>Jaishankar quoted John Foster Dulles on India's independence to highlight past geopolitical misconceptions.</li>
    <li>He pointed out a national consensus on the model's failure but noted a reluctance to explore alternatives.</li>
    <li>The current environment requires more focus on resiliency, reliability, and trust rather than just openness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"As a result, we end up doing the reforms we must, rarely the reforms we should." - S. Jaishankar</blockquote>
<p>Jaishankar concluded that the idea of 'Atmanirbharta' should be about self-reliance without equating to protectionism, emphasizing the importance of national security and thoughtful action.</p>]]></description>

<p>Within 24 hours of finding a woman's severed head at a garbage dump in south Kolkata's Tollygunge area, her brother-in-law was arrested for allegedly killing her.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atiur Rahman Laskar, the victim's brother-in-law, allegedly killed her after she rejected his advances.</li>
  <li>The victim's severed head was found in a garbage dump near Graham Road on Friday.</li>
  <li>Laskar, a construction worker, confessed to the murder and was arrested from his native village in South 24 Parganas' Diamond Harbour.</li>
  <li>The victim had been separated from her husband for two years and worked as a domestic help in the Regent Park area.</li>
  <li>Laskar's advances were rejected, which infuriated him, leading to the murder.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On Thursday evening, after she was done with work, he forced her to accompany him to an under-construction building. He strangulated her there and then beheaded her. He cut the body in three parts and dumped those," DCP (South Suburban) Bidisha Kalita said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The incident sent chills down the residents' spines, triggering fear in the locality. The police are investigating the possible involvement of other people in the crime.</p>]]></description>

</figure>
<p>Launching a piercing attack on the Congress in Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the party of undermining the Constitution under successive governments led by members of the Gandhi family.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Modi criticized the Congress for bringing a series of amendments to the Constitution, starting from Jawaharlal Nehru's tenure.</li>
    <li>He highlighted the imposition of Emergency under Indira Gandhi as a significant misstep.</li>
    <li>The PM accused Rajiv Gandhi of sacrificing constitutional principles for votebank politics.</li>
    <li>Modi also mentioned Rahul Gandhi's actions, such as tearing up an ordinance, as examples of the Congress's disregard for constitutional norms.</li>
    <li>He defended his government's amendments, including the abrogation of Article 370 and the amendment of the Citizenship Act, as corrections to past mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>“One family of the Congress did not leave any stone unturned to undermine the Constitution. And I mention one family because out of the last 75 years, it controlled the country for 55 years. This family harboured harmful ideas, activities, policies and this tradition continues to this date. At every possible level, this family has challenged the constitutional principles and values,” Modi said.</blockquote>

<p>The Lok Sabha became a stage for heated debates on December 14, 2024, when Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde cited a letter from Indira Gandhi praising V.D. Savarkar, prompting uproar among opposition members.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shrikant Shinde questioned the Congress party's criticism of Savarkar amidst Indira Gandhi's praise.</li>
    <li>He read from Indira Gandhi’s letter, emphasizing Savarkar's role in the freedom struggle.</li>
    <li>Shinde challenged Rahul Gandhi on whether Indira Gandhi was against the Constitution for her views on Savarkar.</li>
    <li>Congress members demanded Rahul Gandhi's right to respond during the chaotic session.</li>
    <li>Shinde accused Congress leaders of ignoring Constitutional matters and highlighted historical violence during their tenure.</li>
    <li>BJP MP Nishikant Dubey claimed Indira Gandhi funded Savarkar’s trust and criticized Rahul Gandhi's comparisons.</li>
    <li>Rahul Gandhi later recounted Indira Gandhi's remarks on Savarkar apologizing to the British.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “Veer Savarkar’s daring defiance of the British Government has its own importance in the annals of our freedom movement.” - Indira Gandhi
</blockquote>
<p>Rahul Gandhi responded, “Savarkar apologised to the British... Gandhi ji went to jail, Nehru ji went to jail, but Savarkar ji sought forgiveness.”</p>
<p>This exchange marks a significant moment in the ongoing debates surrounding India's historical figures and their legacies within the political arena.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha.(Sansad TV)</figcaption>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized the Congress party over the imposition of Emergency in 1975, stating that it severely damaged the Constitution and civil liberties in India.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Modi referred to the Emergency as a time when "the Constitution was torn apart" and civil rights were suppressed.</li>
    <li>He claimed that under Congress rule, "all rights of the citizens were snatched" and there was significant media censorship.</li>
    <li>The Prime Minister specifically targeted the Gandhi family for their role in undermining the Constitution.</li>
    <li>He praised India's journey since the adoption of the Constitution, calling it "extraordinary" and emphasizing India as the "Mother of Democracy."</li>
    <li>Modi acknowledged the contributions of the Constitution makers and highlighted women's voting rights as a notable achievement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “The Constitution was torn apart when it was completing 25 years; the Emergency was imposed (in 1975), all constitutional rights were snatched and the country was turned into a jail.” - PM Narendra Modi
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Modi's statements reinforce the narrative of the Congress party's failures during the Emergency, while also celebrating the values and journey of Indian democracy since the Constitution's adoption.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Supreme Court of India</figcaption>

<p>The Indian Supreme Court has issued directives blocking trial courts from registering new lawsuits against places of worship until further notice, as it reviews challenges to the Places of Worship Act, 1991.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Supreme Court's decision comes amid petitions claiming historical mosques were built on former temple sites.</li>
    <li>The court has temporarily halted any effective interim or final orders in pending cases until it finalizes its review of the 1991 Act.</li>
    <li>A petition to survey a 13th-century Muslim shrine in Ajmer has raised significant religious tensions.</li>
    <li>Recent court-ordered surveys of mosques have led to violence, including fatalities and injuries to police.</li>
    <li>Hindu nationalist groups are increasingly vocal, encouraged by recent political events.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    “We are examining the vires, contours and the ambit of 1991 Act,” - Supreme Court bench
</blockquote>

<p>The Supreme Court’s order aims to maintain the religious status quo amid rising tensions over historical claims to places of worship in India, amidst changing political dynamics and increased activism by Hindu groups.</p>]]></description>

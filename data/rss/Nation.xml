            <description><![CDATA[<h1>18th Victim of Jaipur Highway LPG Explosion Dies; Families in Agony</h1>
<p><strong>Date & Source: </strong>Published on Dec 12, 2024, <a href="https://indianexpress.com">The Indian Express</a></p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Truck-3col1.jpg" alt="LPG tanker explosion" width="640" height="360">
<figcaption>Rescue operations at the site of the LPG tanker explosion on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway.</figcaption>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>The deadly collision of a truck with an LPG tanker on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway has claimed its 18th victim, with families left in pain and anguish.</p>
<ol>
  <li>22-year-old Vijita Meena, a B.Ed. student, died at Sawai Man Singh Hospital after suffering 70% burns.</li>
  <li>Mahendra (24), an employee at a car dealer, also succumbed to his burns.</li>
  <li>Shahbuddin (33), a resident of Bareilly, died hours after the accident.</li>
  <li>Five more patients remain in a critical condition.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>"She was on fire and still running when a bystander helped put out her flames," said Vijita's father, Ramachandra Meena.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The police are questioning the driver of the tanker to understand the cause of the accident, with the driver being the sole survivor. The families of the victims await an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>]]></description>

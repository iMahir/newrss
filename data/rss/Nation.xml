<p>Assam has reported its first case of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection this season, with a 10-month-old child testing positive. The infant is currently undergoing treatment at Assam Medical College and Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh and is said to be stable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ten-month-old child tests positive for HMPV in Dibrugarh, Assam.</li>
  <li>Child admitted to AMCH with cold-related symptoms four days ago.</li>
  <li>HMPV infection confirmed by ICMR-RMRC Lahowal after routine tests.</li>
  <li>HMPV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms.</li>
  <li>Similar HMPV cases reported in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The HMPV infection was confirmed yesterday after we got test results from Lahowal-based ICMR-RMRC. The child is stable now. It is a common virus, and there is nothing to worry about.” - Dr. Dhrubajyoti Bhuyan, AMCH superintendent</blockquote>
<p>The detection of HMPV is not unusual, as the virus circulates seasonally and typically impacts infants and individuals with weaker immune systems more severely.</p>]]></description>

<p>An investigation by the Mumbai police Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has found that the two suspected Ukrainian masterminds of the Torres investment fraud case escaped the country in December 2024 after telling staff and agents they were going on Christmas leave.</p>
<ul>
<li>Victoriia Kovalenko and Olena Stoian are suspected masterminds behind the fraud.</li>
<li>The EOW is investigating links to a similar mass fraud in Turkey.</li>
<li>Three additional arrests have been made in relation to the Ponzi scheme.</li>
<li>A substantial amount of cash has been seized during the investigation, including Rs 5 crore from multiple locations.</li>
<li>A heated argument at the Dadar store revealed financial irregularities, prompting investor action.</li>

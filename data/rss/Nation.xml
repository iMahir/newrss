<p>The engineering student, aged 21, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly raping his classmate, according to Kolkata Police. The incident occurred on December 21 when the accused allegedly lured the girl to an empty apartment, drugged her drink, and raped her. The girl informed her parents about the incident on Tuesday, leading to the registration of a complaint and subsequent arrest of the accused.</p>
<p>The police have also summoned the friend of the accused, who owns the flat where the incident took place, for questioning.</p>
<p>The initial probe suggests that the two had a falling out previously but patched up in December before the alleged incident occurred.</p>]]></description>

(Representational photo)(HT File)</figcaption>
<p>An engineering student in Maharashtra's Nagpur allegedly killed his parents over differences regarding his academic record and career, news agency PTI reported. The 25-year-old accused, Utkarsh Dhakhole, killed his parents at their residence in Kapil Nagar area on December 26. He also hid their bodies and told his relatives that his parents had gone to Bengaluru to take part in a meditation programme. Days later, Dhakole's neighbours complained to the police of a foul smell in the neighbourhood, leading to the discovery of the bodies and his arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The victim's parents wanted him to quit engineering due to his poor academic record.</li>
<li>Utkarsh allegedly strangled his mother and stabbed his father to death.</li>
<li>He confessed to the crime during police investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notable Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>“Utkarsh failed to clear several subjects during his engineering course. His parents, therefore, wanted him to quit engineering and choose something else. However, he was against their suggestion,” the official added.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The incident serves as a grim reminder of the pressure students face regarding academic expectations and career choices, often leading to tragic consequences.</p>]]></description>

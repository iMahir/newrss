            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Clarifies Continuity of Laws Post Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Bifurcation</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has clarified that the laws applicable to the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh will continue to apply to the newly formed States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh until altered or repealed. This decision follows a legal challenge regarding the jurisdiction of the CBI in corruption cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court set aside a prior judgment from the Andhra Pradesh High Court regarding consent for CBI investigations in the newly formed states.</li>
  <li>The High Court previously ruled that CBI needed consent from Andhra Pradesh for investigations under the Prevention of Corruption Act.</li>
  <li>The Supreme Court found that no explicit consent was necessary as the accused were Central Government employees.</li>
  <li>The decision references previous case law regarding the continuity of laws after state bifurcations.</li>
  <li>This ruling may affect similar jurisdictional issues in other cases involving Central Government employees.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Finally, the Court framed the question: ‘merely because such an employee works within the territory of a particular State, to register an FIR by the CBI in connection with commission of an offence under a Central Act whether consent from the State Government concerned is required or not?’”</blockquote>
<p>The ruling specifies that the continuity of laws remains effective until legally changed, impacting the operations of various governmental agencies in both states.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Issues Notice to Dera Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in 2002 Murder Case</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Today, <strong>Source:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has issued a notice to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, chief of Dera Sacha Sauda, along with four others in the 2002 murder case of former Dera manager Ranjit Singh, after the CBI challenged the Punjab and Haryana High Court's acquittal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The notice follows the CBI's plea against the acquittal of Ram Rahim and co-accused.</li>
  <li>The murder occurred on July 10, 2002, related to an anonymous letter alleging sexual exploitation by Ram Rahim.</li>
  <li>A special CBI court had previously convicted Ram Rahim and four others in 2021, awarding them life imprisonment.</li>
  <li>In May 2024, the Punjab and Haryana High Court overturned this conviction.</li>
  <li>Ram Rahim's past convictions include the rape of two women, leading to widespread violence in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The CBI court concluded that Ram Rahim orchestrated the murder due to suspicions about Mr. Singh’s involvement in exposing allegations.”</blockquote>
<p>This case highlights the ongoing legal battles involving Gurmeet Ram Rahim and the significant societal implications stemming from his actions.</p>]]></description>

  <li>Flights by airlines such as SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Air India experienced delays ranging from 5 to 11 minutes.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nimisha Priya case: $40,000 paid, but Talal's family yet to receive blood money, says lawyer</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> Not specified</p>
<p>Nimisha Priya, a Malayali nurse facing death row in Yemen, has had $40,000 demanded for her release, with complications arising over payments and a recent ratification of her death sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Iran has expressed readiness to mediate for Nimisha Priya's release.</li>
<li>Yemeni tribal leaders demanded $40,000 in advance for negotiations.</li>
<li>The first installment of $20,000 was paid months ago, with the second delayed.</li>
<li>Reports state that Talal's family claims they have not received any portion of the money.</li>
<li>Indian authorities face challenges due to lack of bilateral relations with the Houthi administration.</li>
<li>Nimisha has been incarcerated since 2017 for the alleged murder of Talal Abdul Mahdi.</li>
<li>Human rights activists criticize missed opportunities for negotiation due to delays in payment.</li>
<li>Nimisha Priya’s mother is in Yemen seeking her daughter’s release.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The opportunity for negotiations had passed because of the failure to pay the second installment on time.” - Samuel Jerome, Human Rights Activist</blockquote>
<p>This situation highlights the complex interplay of legal, humanitarian, and diplomatic efforts in the case of Nimisha Priya, whose life hangs in the balance.</p>]]></description>

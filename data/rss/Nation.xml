<p>Junior medics at the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital began an indefinite complete cease work following the suspension of six colleagues by the West Bengal government, allegedly for their role in a tragic incident involving a woman’s death after childbirth.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Doctors argue that the suspension aims to distract from ongoing corruption in the health department.</li>
  <li>The junior medics stated their protest began in solidarity with suspended colleagues.</li>
  <li>The government has suspended 12 doctors overall due to negligence related to administering 'expired' intravenous fluids.</li>
  <li>Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced actions to prevent further use of the disputed intravenous fluid in state-run hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"All junior doctors of the MMCH stand in solidarity with our fellow colleagues in this state of moral crisis, and announce complete cease work from today morning (8 AM)." - Junior medic</blockquote>
<p>This protest underlines the ongoing tensions within the healthcare system in West Bengal and raises questions about accountability and systemic issues.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why is Modi pampering Chiranjeevi so much?</h1>

<img src="https://www.greatandhra.com/newphotos10/chiru_modi21737078967.jpg" alt="Why is Modi pampering Chiranjeevi so much?">
<figcaption>Chiranjeevi with Modi during Sankranti celebrations.</figcaption>
<p>Megastar Chiranjeevi, despite having distanced himself from active politics, continues to be a focal point in Andhra Pradesh's political landscape, especially following his appearance alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Sankranti celebrations in Delhi.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chiranjeevi’s presence at political events is raising questions about the BJP's strategies in Andhra Pradesh.</li>
<li>During the event, he received special attention from Modi, which is unusual for non-political figures.</li>
<li>Chiranjeevi's previous appearances with Modi suggest ongoing political ties.</li>
<li>Speculation arises regarding whether Modi is preparing to bring Chiranjeevi into the BJP fold.</li>
<li>Chiranjeevi’s Kapu identity may be significant for the BJP's political ambitions, given the party's struggles in the region.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A potential ‘double-engine’ political arrangement, with Pawan Kalyan and Chiranjeevi as key faces, could bolster the BJP’s ambitions in Andhra Pradesh.”</blockquote>
<p>The growing speculation around Modi’s fondness for Chiranjeevi potentially hints at larger electoral strategies within Andhra Pradesh.</p>]]></description>

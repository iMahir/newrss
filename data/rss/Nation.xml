<p>Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav has accused the newly-formed Jan Suraaj Party by Prashant Kishor of functioning as the ‘B team’ of Nitish Kumar's ruling alliance in Bihar. Yadav made this accusation after police used water cannons to disperse students protesting the recent BPSC exam, an event in which Kishor and his supporters were involved.</p>
<ul><li>Yadav alleged that the protesters were misled into marching towards Gandhi Maidan and faced police action.</li><li>He promised political support for the protesters' demand for the cancellation of the Combined Competitive Exams held on December 13.</li><li>An FIR was filed against Kishor, Jan Suraaj Party president Manoj Bharti, and several others for their involvement in the protests.</li></ul>
<p>Yadav warned the protesters not to be swayed by empty promises and to stick to their demands, as the BPSC comes under the government's control.</p>

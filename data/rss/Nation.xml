<p>Businessman Boby Chemmanur has applied for bail in the Kerala High Court following his arrest for a sexual harassment case filed by a Malayalam actress. His initial bail request was denied by a magistrate who found his comments to be inappropriate.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chemmanur was arrested on January 8 and remanded for 14 days after his bail application was rejected.</li>
  <li>The High Court will hear the case further on January 14, with the judge emphasizing that the case is not considered special.</li>
  <li>The actress claims Chemmanur made inappropriate comments during a public event, exacerbating online harassment towards her.</li>
  <li>Chemmanur's legal team argues the allegations are fabricated, pointing out delays in filing the complaint.</li>
  <li>A key issue discussed was the potential bias of the magistrate who initially refused bail.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“There is no speciality for you. I have to give the prosecution time to get instructions.” – Justice PV Kunhikrishnan</blockquote>
<p>The case raises significant questions about public comments and accountability, reflecting ongoing societal issues surrounding sexual harassment.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Kerala High Court Ruling on BH Series Vehicle Tax Rates</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> (Date not provided) <strong>Source:</strong> Live Law</p>
<p>The Kerala High Court has ruled that the Central Government cannot enforce motor vehicle tax rates for Bharat (BH) registered vehicles, affirming that taxation on vehicles falls under state jurisdiction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Court held that the Central Government lacks authority to prescribe tax rates for BH vehicles.</li>
  <li>BH registration was introduced to facilitate seamless transfer of vehicles across states.</li>
  <li>The judgment responds to petitions from vehicle owners regarding tax payment for BH registration in Kerala.</li>
  <li>The court specified that while principles for taxation can be set by the Centre, the rates must be determined by the states.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Central Government would not have the power to prescribe the rate of tax on motor vehicles,” the Court stated.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the Court emphasized that states can levy their own tax rates based on respective laws for BH registered vehicles, guided by the principles laid out by the Centre.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 10, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Law</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has issued a stay on notices by Uttar Pradesh authorities regarding a well near the Sambhal mosque that claimed it to be a Hindu temple.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Supreme Court restrained the local authorities from enforcing notices about the well adjacent to the mosque.</li>
  <li>The Sambhal Shahi Jama Masjid Committee filed a petition challenging a lower court's order for a survey claiming the mosque was built on a demolished temple.</li>
  <li>Concerns were raised over posters labeling the well as a 'Hari Mandir', with implications for communal harmony in the area.</li>
  <li>The court ordered that no notices, including the one falsely describing the well, should be acted upon.</li>
  <li>The situation at the well has been a flashpoint for communal tensions, highlighted by a past incident of violence.</li>
  <li>The court has directed a status report on the situation and recommended forming a peace committee.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Kochi City police have taken businessman Boby Chemmanur into custody following a complaint by a woman actor alleging sexual harassment. This follows a swift investigation and is part of a broader inquiry into multiple complaints against him.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chemmanur was taken into custody less than 24 hours after a complaint was made.</li>
  <li>A special investigation team (SIT) is overseeing the case, having extracted him from another district.</li>
  <li>He faces non-bailable charges under various sections of law, including sexual harassment and the transmission of obscene material.</li>
  <li>The actor has provided digital evidence to support her claims and has previously lodged a complaint against multiple individuals for similar behavior.</li>
  <li>The police have already arrested one individual linked to the initial complaints.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“His custody is the culmination of our action initiated from the moment we registered the case on Tuesday evening.” - C. Jayakumar, Assistant Commissioner</blockquote>
<p>This case reflects ongoing concerns regarding online harassment and the treatment of women in the industry.</p>]]></description>

<p>An IED blast in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district resulted in the deaths of eight security personnel, five of whom were former Naxalites who had joined the police force after surrendering. This tragic incident marks a significant attack on security forces by Naxalites.</p>

<p>The Karnataka government's call for wanted Maoists to surrender has come to fruition as six Naxals have announced their intention to surrender, marking a potentially significant turning point in the region's battle against Maoist influence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Top leaders expected to surrender include Mundagaru Latha, Sundari Kuthlur, and Mareppa Aroli.</li>
<li>The surrender will take place at the office of the Deputy Commissioner in Chikkamagaluru.</li>
<li>This event is being seen as a culmination of extensive police efforts and a sign of diminishing Naxal influence in Southern India.</li>
<li>Officials noted that local support for Naxals has waned significantly due to government welfare schemes.</li>
<li>The ongoing counter-insurgency operations have pushed Naxal cadres to surrender.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“With the surrender of these six individuals, the Maoist movement in Karnataka can be considered effectively over.” - Senior officer involved in the surrender process.</blockquote>
<p>The impending surrender of these six Naxals highlights the effectiveness of the government and law enforcement in addressing the longstanding issue of Maoist activity in Karnataka.</p>]]></description>

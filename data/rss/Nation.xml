<p>BPSC aspirants protested at Gandhi Maidan, demanding a re-examination of the 70th BPSC preliminary exam and a meeting with Nitish Kumar. A heated exchange occurred between students and Prashant Kishor when aspirants accused him of being absent during police action against the protesters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Students accused Kishor of being absent when police used water cannons and batons against them.</li>
<li>Kishor arrived at the scene and faced angry protesters who demanded he step away.</li>
<li>Kishor's remark, "You take blankets from us and then show us attitude," escalated tensions.</li>
<li>The protest began on Dec 13, gaining support from politicians, educationists, and activists.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Protesters asked, "Where was Prashant Kishor during the lathicharge?"</blockquote>
<p>After his eviction, Kishor addressed a press conference, refuting allegations, reaffirming support for the students' cause, and condemning police action. He plans to file an FIR against Patna Police and join the protest if no resolution is reached.</p>]]></description>

<p>Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav has accused the newly-formed Jan Suraaj Party by Prashant Kishor of functioning as the ‘B team’ of Nitish Kumar's ruling alliance in Bihar. Yadav made this accusation after police used water cannons to disperse students protesting the recent BPSC exam, an event in which Kishor and his supporters were involved.</p>
<ul><li>Yadav alleged that the protesters were misled into marching towards Gandhi Maidan and faced police action.</li><li>He promised political support for the protesters' demand for the cancellation of the Combined Competitive Exams held on December 13.</li><li>An FIR was filed against Kishor, Jan Suraaj Party president Manoj Bharti, and several others for their involvement in the protests.</li></ul>
<p>Yadav warned the protesters not to be swayed by empty promises and to stick to their demands, as the BPSC comes under the government's control.</p>

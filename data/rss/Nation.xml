<p>A woman in Karnataka's Belagavi was arrested for allegedly murdering her husband and chopping his body, police said on Thursday.</p>
<ul>
<li>The woman allegedly strangled her 40-year-old husband, identified as Srimantha Itnali, and then smashed his face with a stone.</li>
<li>She cut his body into two pieces to dispose of it away from her house.</li>
<li>The incident took place on December 8, and the body was found on December 10 in Umarani village in Chikkodi taluk of Belagavi.</li>
<li>The police initially did not suspect the woman, but later brought her in for questioning, and she confessed to the crime.</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>"She first strangled him and when he was unconscious, used a boulder lying nearby to smash his face. She then disposed of the boulder in a well."</blockquote>
<p>The woman has been taken into custody.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Amit Shah: Article 370 Fueled Terrorism in Kashmir</h1>

<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah claims that Article 370 has played a critical role in fostering terrorism in Kashmir, attributing it to the notion of temporary relations between Kashmir and India.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 370 fostered separatism among Kashmiri youth, leading to terrorism.</li>
<li>Other Muslim-majority regions in India did not experience similar terrorism despite sharing borders with Pakistan.</li>
<li>Mr. Shah stated that the misconception of Kashmir's relationship with India promoted extremism.</li>
<li>The revocation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, must be understood in the larger historical context.</li>
</ul>
<p><blockquote>“Why did terrorism not spread in other Muslim areas of the country? ... It is unfortunate that 40,000 people lost their lives,” Mr. Shah said.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Home Minister further emphasized the importance of re-evaluating Kashmir's history and offered perspectives that could reshape national narratives.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Former PM Manmohan Singh. (Express Archive)</figcaption>
<p>Top officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs met to identify potential sites for a memorial for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two sites shortlisted: Ekta Sthal and Vijay Ghat.</li>
  <li>Ekta Sthal is near Jawaharlal Nehru’s samadhi, while Vijay Ghat is near Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial.</li>
  <li>The selection comes after the Congress party's request for a memorial following Singh's death on December 26.</li>
  <li>Urban Development Secretary will inform Singh’s family about the proposed sites and establish a Trust for land allocation.</li>
  <li>Former Congress leaders criticized the government's choice of location for Singh's last rites.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The government’s choice of location had disrespected the former Prime Minister’s legacy.”</blockquote>
<p>The announcement of the final memorial site is awaited, as public discourse continues regarding the appropriateness of the chosen locations.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Karnataka announces 15% hike in bus fares from January 5 - Deccan Herald]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Karnataka's Bus Fares to Increase by 15% Starting January 5</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> 02 January 2025, 12:56 IST</p>
<p>The Karnataka government has approved a 15% fare increase for all bus services operated by the state's Road Transport Corporations, effective January 5, 2025.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The hike is the first for RTCs since 2020 for KSRTC and other corporations and since 2014 for BMTC.</li>
  <li>This increase is expected to generate an additional revenue of Rs 74.85 crore for the RTCs.</li>
  <li>Buses in Karnataka will still have lower ticket prices compared to neighboring states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra.</li>
  <li>The fare hike meets one of the major demands from RTC employees, who postponed a planned protest due to this decision.</li>
  <li>The government's expenses on the Shakti scheme, allowing free travel for eligible women, will rise significantly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This fare hike is essential for maintaining our services and ensuring the sustainability of our operations amidst rising costs.</blockquote>
<p>This decision marks a significant development in Karnataka's public transportation landscape, as it addresses both employee demands and operational costs.</p>]]></description>

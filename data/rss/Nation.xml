            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Centre's Key Nod Brings Fresh Trouble For Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>In fresh trouble for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal ahead of the Delhi election, the Union Home Ministry has authorized the Enforcement Directorate to prosecute both him and former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in a money laundering case linked to the now-scrapped liquor policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Home Ministry's approval removes the legal obstacle for the Enforcement Directorate to proceed with the prosecution.</li>
<li>This development follows a Supreme Court ruling requiring prior sanction for prosecuting public servants.</li>
<li>Kejriwal and Sisodia were arrested in connection with money laundering cases related to the liquor policy and are currently out on bail.</li>
<li>Both leaders have denied the charges, claiming political harassment by the BJP.</li>
<li>The timing of this development may impact their campaign for the upcoming February 5 elections.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Enforcement Directorate did not have the sanction to prosecute me.” - Arvind Kejriwal</blockquote>
<p>The fresh developments could intensify BJP's criticism of AAP as the elections approach.</p>]]></description>

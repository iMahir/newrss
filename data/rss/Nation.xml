  <li>According to Stalin, Ravi’s actions disrespect the assembly and the people of Tamil Nadu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This House cannot bear to see the governor doing something with political motives that drags the position and responsibility he held by not respecting the dignity of this Assembly.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, CM Stalin's remarks reflect ongoing tensions between the Tamil Nadu government and the governor's office, highlighting issues of political integrity and respect in legislative procedures.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>The deceased son, Omkar was the youngest of three brothers had returned home from his hostel in Udgir, Latur district, to celebrate Makar Sankranti.</figcaption>
<p>A father and son in Maharashtra tragically took their lives after financial constraints prevented the father from purchasing a smartphone requested by his son for academic use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 16-year-old boy, Omkar, had been asking for a smartphone, but his father couldn't afford it due to financial issues.</li>
<li>After being unable to fulfill his son’s wish, Omkar left home, which led to a frantic search when he did not return.</li>
<li>His father discovered him hanging from a tree on their farm and subsequently took his own life using the same rope.</li>
<li>The incident has raised concerns about mental health and financial pressures in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Omkar again raised the issue on Wednesday evening. However, his father expressed his inability to purchase a smartphone because he was repaying loans he took for the farm and a vehicle,” - Sub-Inspector Dilip Munde.</blockquote>
<p>This devastating event highlights the emotional and social challenges faced by families in difficult financial situations.</p>]]></description>

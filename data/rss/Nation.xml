<p>Switzerland's recent suspension of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status for India poses challenges for Indian companies, particularly in finance, pharmaceuticals, and IT sectors, affecting trade dynamics between the two nations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The MFN suspension disrupts the preferential trade framework under WTO rules for Indian firms.</li>
    <li>Indian companies will now incur a 10% tax on dividends and incomes in Switzerland, up from 5%, effective January 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The change may lead to higher tariffs and reduced market access for Indian goods in Switzerland.</li>
    <li>The Indian government anticipates renegotiating its double taxation treaty with Switzerland due to changes in trade agreements.</li>
    <li>In FY 2023-24, bilateral trade reached approximately $23.76 billion, with a significant portion being imports from Switzerland.</li>
</ul>

<p>The suspension of MFN status necessitates adaptability among Indian investors and firms, as they navigate new tax implications and trade barriers in the Swiss market.</p>]]></description>

<!-- No image available -->
<p>In a significant judgment, the Supreme Court established that contempt jurisdiction extends beyond explicit violations of court orders to any actions intended to frustrate court proceedings or bypass eventual judgments.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Supreme Court ruled that contempt includes conduct aiming to disrupt judicial authority or processes.</li>
    <li>A borrower transferring property during ongoing court proceedings was found to be in contempt of court.</li>
    <li>The contempt case was prompted by a petition from Celir LLP, the auction purchaser of the property.</li>
    <li>The Court noted attempts by the borrower and transferee to obstruct the implementation of its judgment.</li>
    <li>Despite ruling that such attempts constitute contempt, the Court did not hold the parties guilty but allowed them a chance to comply with the judgment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The contempt jurisdiction of the court extends beyond the mere direct disobedience of explicit orders. Deliberate conduct aimed at frustrating court proceedings may amount to contempt." 
</blockquote>
<p>The ruling emphasizes the need to respect the judicial process, indicating the Court's readiness to intervene against actions that threaten its authority and the rule of law.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
    <li>Rahul Gandhi made a humorous gaffe while addressing the Lok Sabha.</li>
    <li>The incident drew laughter and reactions from members of the NDA.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Ruling on Police Officials and False Cases</h1>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 13, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Live Law</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled that police officials accused of lodging false cases are not protected from prosecution under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as such actions do not fall within their official duties.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Court clarified that the protection of Section 197 CrPC applies only to acts performed in the course of official duties.</li>
    <li>Fabrication of evidence and filing of bogus cases are considered outside the scope of official duties.</li>
    <li>The ruling overturned the MP High Court's decision which had quashed the criminal case against the accused police officials for lack of sanction under Section 197.</li>
    <li>The Court emphasized the necessity of evaluating the facts and circumstances of each case before deciding on the application of Section 197 CrPC.</li>
    <li>It ruled that allowing public officials to misuse their status under the guise of official duty would lead to illegal and unethical acts.</li>
    <li>The trial against the police officials was directed to proceed, affirming that wrongful acts emerging from official duties are not automatically protected.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“Allowing so would enable the accused to use their status as public servants as a facade for doing an objectionable, illegal and unlawful act and take undue advantage of their position." - Supreme Court</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, this ruling underscores the judicial commitment to accountability among public officials, ensuring that misuse of power cannot be shielded by the protections typically afforded under Section 197 CrPC.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> PTI</p>
<p>A purported suicide note linked to the deaths of a businessman and his wife in Madhya Pradesh has ignited political tensions between the Congress party and the ruling BJP, with allegations of harassment by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).</p>
<ul>
    <li>The couple, Manoj and Neha Parmar, were found hanging in their home in Sehore district.</li>
    <li>The suicide note, addressed to key political leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi, accused ED officials and BJP leaders of harassment.</li>
    <li>The Congress party claims that Parmar's affiliation with them led to the couple's targeting by the ED.</li>
    <li>State Congress president Jitu Patwari described the death as a potential state-sponsored murder rather than suicide.</li>
    <li>ED has been investigating Parmar for alleged financial crimes including a money laundering case.</li>
    <li>Former MP Chief Minister Kamal Nath linked the deaths to political pressure from the BJP government and ED.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "The whole case was more about wiping out an entire family than harassing a businessman to the point of suicide for political reasons." - Kamal Nath
</blockquote>
<p>This incident has raised significant concerns regarding the intersection of politics and law enforcement in India, prompting calls for a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the couple's deaths.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<p>The 'One Nation, One Election' Bill aims to amend the Constitution to facilitate simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and all Legislative Assemblies. The Bill is set to be tabled in Parliament and proposes significant changes to existing electoral laws.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Bill seeks to insert Article 82A for simultaneous elections to the House of the People and all Legislative Assemblies.</li>
    <li>It also amends Articles 83, 172, and 327 regarding the duration and conduct of elections.</li>
    <li>Simultaneous elections mean general elections held together for the Lok Sabha and all Legislative Assemblies.</li>
    <li>Provisions include how mid-term elections will be managed and their alignment for Union Territories.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"There was an imperative need for holding of simultaneous elections. The imposition of Model Code of Conduct in various parts of the country which are poll-bound puts on hold the entire development programs." - Government Statement</blockquote>
<p>The proposed amendments focus on streamlining the electoral process, addressing inefficiencies caused by staggered elections, and aligning legislative terms to enhance governance and development.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Recent | <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>

<p>In her inaugural speech in Parliament, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra addressed the BJP's criticisms regarding the Emergency, urging them to acknowledge their own mistakes and fight fair elections.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Priyanka Gandhi spoke during a special debate on the Constitution, challenging BJP leaders.</li>
    <li>She quoted Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, suggesting that the BJP should apologize for its mistakes.</li>
    <li>Congress leaders, including Rahil Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, have previously acknowledged the Emergency as a “mistake.”</li>
    <li>Historian Pranab Mukherjee described the Emergency as a "misadventure" in his writings.</li>
    <li>Shashi Tharoor highlighted that the Emergency was "undemocratic" but not "unconstitutional."</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“What happened in the Emergency is wrong. Let us not go back and forth on it.” — Jyotiraditya Scindia</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Though S.52 TP Act Doesn't Make Pendente Lite Transfer Void, Court Can Invalidate Such Sale Exercising Contempt Jurisdiction</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> September 21, 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<!-- Image section is excluded as there is no image provided -->
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that while a transfer during ongoing court proceedings is not automatically void, it can be invalidated if done in contempt of court orders.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The case involved a contempt petition filed by Celir LLP regarding a property auctioned under the SARFAESI Act.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court ruled that even if Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act does not make such transfers void, courts can reverse them to uphold judicial authority.</li>
    <li>The transaction in question occurred after a Supreme Court petition was filed, highlighting contempt of judicial directions.</li>
    <li>The Court emphasized the need for respect towards the court's authority and the judicial process.</li>
    <li>Senior Advocates represented the involved parties in the case.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>"The mere conduct of parties aimed at frustrating the court proceedings or circumventing its decisions, even without an explicit prohibitory order, constitutes contempt. Such actions interfere with the administration of justice." - Supreme Court</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court's decision reinforces the importance of adhering to court directions and maintaining the integrity of the judicial system, even in the context of property transfers.</p>]]></description>

<p>Veteran BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani has been admitted to Apollo Hospital in New Delhi, where he is currently in stable condition and under observation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advani, aged 96, is being treated by Dr. Vinit Suri, a senior neurology consultant.</li>
    <li>He was admitted two days ago, and this is not his first hospitalization at this facility this year.</li>
    <li>The specific reason for his recent admission has not yet been disclosed.</li>
    <li>Advani is a key figure in the BJP's rise to prominence and has had a long political career since joining the party in 1951.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Advani is widely recognized for guiding the BJP from a mere two seats in the 1984 general election to becoming a national force in the 1990s."</blockquote>
<p>Advani's contributions and leadership have significantly impacted Indian politics, especially through his role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which strengthened the BJP's political position.</p>]]></description>

<p>Day after 30 schools in Delhi received bomb threats, several schools in the city were sent similar threats via email on Saturday, police said.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bomb threat emails were sent to several schools in Delhi, including Delhi Public School, RK Puram, and Ryan International School, Vasant Kunj.</li>
  <li>The email was sent from childrenofallah@outlook.com and signed under the name of Barry Allah.</li>
  <li>The email stated that "Our children are brave servants of Allah. They shall complete their task."</li>
  <li>Police and security teams are currently searching the school premises, with nothing suspicious found yet.</li>
  <li>Previous bomb threat emails on Monday demanded $30,000 and threatened to detonate small bombs hidden in the buildings.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  "Our bomb vests are blessed by the Prophet Muhammad. They shall not fail their goal. Our children are brave servants of Allah. They shall complete their task."
</blockquote>
<p>The bomb threat emails have raised concerns among parents and school staff, with police assuring them that thorough investigations are ongoing and safety remains their top priority.</p>]]></description>

<p>A Delhi school received a bomb threat on Saturday (December 14, 2024), marking the third instance of threat emails being sent to schools in the national capital this week.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The bomb threat was reported at DPS RK Puram at 6:09 am.</li>
    <li>Authorities from the fire department, local police, and bomb detection teams conducted a thorough search of the school.</li>
    <li>No suspicious items were found during the searches conducted following the bomb threat.</li>
    <li>On the previous day, around 30 schools received similar bomb threat emails, prompting multi-agency search operations.</li>
    <li>A total of 44 schools had received bomb threats via email earlier in the week, which were later classified as hoaxes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"We received a call about a bomb threat at DPS RK Puram at 6:09 am," a Delhi Fire Services official said.</blockquote>
<p>The pattern of bomb threats raises concerns about safety in schools, though previous threats were deemed hoaxes. Ongoing investigations continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>]]></description>

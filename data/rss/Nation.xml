<figcaption>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the convention which aims at showcasing Odisha’s culture and heritage in front of the NRIs (non-resident Indians) who are coming to India from 50 countries(ANI file)</figcaption>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will flag off the Pravasi Bharatiya Express, a special tourist train for the Indian diaspora, from New Delhi’s Safdarjung railway station. This launch coincides with the 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pravasi Bharatiya Express is designed for the Indian diaspora aged 45 to 65 years.</li>
<li>The train will travel for three weeks to multiple destinations including Ayodhya, Patna, Gaya, Varanasi, and more.</li>
<li>The launch date, January 9, commemorates Mahatma Gandhi's return to India from South Africa in 1915.</li>
<li>Accommodating 156 passengers, the tour aims to connect the Indian diaspora with their roots.</li>
<li>Organized under the 'Pravasi Teerth Darshan Yojana', it collaborates with IRCTC.</li>

<blockquote>The Indian diaspora has emerged as one of the largest sources of remittance in the world. The Indian diaspora stands at 35.4 million, including 19.5 million Persons of Indian Origins (PIOs) and 15.8 million NRIs.</blockquote>
<p>In summary, this initiative is expected to strengthen ties between the Indian diaspora and their homeland while boosting tourism in Odisha.</p>]]></description>

<p>Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr. BR Ambedkar, criticized Home Minister Amit Shah's remarks regarding Dr. Ambedkar, suggesting they highlight the BJP's outdated mentality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prakash Ambedkar claimed that the BJP’s inability to achieve its goals is due to Dr. Ambedkar's influence.</li>
  <li>He stated Shah’s comments reflect a deep-rooted mentality within the BJP and accused them of not being able to implement their agenda due to opposition from Dr. Ambedkar's ideals.</li>
  <li>Several opposition MPs protested in Parliament against Shah’s remarks, calling them an insult to Dr. Ambedkar.</li>
  <li>Amit Shah suggested that the frequent mention of Ambedkar has become fashionable among opponents, implying a diminished respect for him.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"There is nothing new in the statement. They are not able to execute their old plans. Not because of Congress, but because of Babasaheb Ambedkar."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Prakash Ambedkar's comments not only criticize Shah's remarks but also express concern over political trends and their implications on democracy and governance.</p>]]></description>

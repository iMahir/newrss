<p>Elon Musk has voiced his support for Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi regarding her assertion about the use of the term 'Asian' in relation to grooming gangs predominately composed of men of Pakistani heritage in the UK.</p>
<ul>
<li>Musk backed Chaturvedi's post asserting that these gangs should be identified as 'Pakistani grooming gangs'.</li>
<li>The controversy was ignited by UK PM Keir Starmer’s remarks surrounding a child sexual abuse scandal.</li>
<li>Chaturvedi criticized the broad categorization of 'Asian', asserting that it unfairly implicates all Asian communities.</li>
<li>The matter has spurred calls for a new inquiry into the incidents involving child exploitation in northern England.</li>
<li>Groups from the Indian diaspora in the UK have echoed Chaturvedi's calls for accuracy in identifying the perpetrators of these crimes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Repeat after me, they aren’t ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs,” said Priyanka Chaturvedi, to which Elon Musk replied ‘True’.</blockquote>
<p>The discussion underscores the need for precise language in addressing sensitive social issues surrounding criminal activities and community reputation.</p>]]></description>

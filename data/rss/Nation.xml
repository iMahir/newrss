<p>Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal is supporting farmers protesting against the central government's potential plan to reintroduce three controversial farm laws that were withdrawn in 2021. He criticized the BJP for not engaging in dialogue with the farmers.</p>
<ul>

  <li>Farmers demand a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) amidst ongoing protests.</li>
  <li>Kejriwal warns that the BJP would be responsible if any harm comes to farmer leaders.</li>
  <li>The central government allegedly plans to implement laws "through the back door" under the guise of new policies.</li>

<blockquote>"If something happens to them, then BJP will be responsible for it," Kejriwal stated.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> LiveLaw</p>
<p>The Bar Council of India has filed an application in the Supreme Court requesting to raise the enrollment fee from Rs 750 to Rs 25,000.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The application is part of the case <i>Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India</i>.</li>
    <li>The current fee cap was established by a Supreme Court judgment in July 2024.</li>
    <li>The BCI argues that the last fee amendment was over 30 years ago, and inflation should be considered.</li>
    <li>Justice Narasimha questioned the appropriateness of the Court's involvement in legislative matters.</li>
    <li>The BCI is also collaborating with the Ministry of Law & Justice regarding this amendment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>This is a legislative Act. Why should we [interfere]? Ask the Government to change it.</blockquote>
<p>Justice Narasimha remarked on the Bar Council's role as a regulator and expressed concern over their request to the Court.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Supreme Court has pointed out the misleading portrayals by Punjab officials and certain farmer leaders regarding the ongoing hunger strike of farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal. The court emphasized that the efforts to hospitalize Dallewal should not be seen as an attempt to end his protest.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Justice Surya Kant criticized both Punjab officials and farmers' leaders for creating a false narrative in the media.</li>
  <li>Justice Ujjal Bhuyyan questioned the Centre's reluctance to address the grievances of the protesting farmers.</li>
  <li>The health of Dallewal is increasingly precarious as he continues his fast, which has lasted over 35 days.</li>
  <li>Justice Kant stated that hospitalizing Dallewal does not mean he must end his fast.</li>
  <li>The farmers are advocating for a law that guarantees minimum pricing for their crops to protect their interests.</li>
  <li>A court-appointed committee is set to meet with farmers virtually on January 3.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This issue is becoming more and more sensitive, and time is passing,” Justice Kant observed.</blockquote>
<p>Justice Kant described Dallewal as a “precious leader” dedicated to the farmers' cause and expressed concerns over the Punjab government’s lack of conciliatory measures.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court to Hear Plea by Asaduddin Owaisi to Implement Places of Worship Act</h1>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> 02 Jan 2025, 8:14 am</p>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear a plea by AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi regarding the implementation of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Owaisi's petition seeks the enforcement of the Act, which protects the religious character of places of worship as of August 15, 1947.</li>
  <li>The plea has been tagged with another petition by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.</li>
  <li>The matter is expected to be heard in February.</li>
  <li>In December 2024, the Supreme Court ordered trial courts to avoid issuing orders or conducting surveys about existing religious structures in related cases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The Act explicitly prohibits the filing of such suits.”</blockquote>
<p>This development emphasizes ongoing legal debates concerning the religious and historical status of places of worship in India, potentially affecting numerous cases across the nation.</p>]]></description>

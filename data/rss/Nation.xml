<p>The interim government of Bangladesh, led by Muhammad Yunus, has requested India's extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, stating they will wait for a formal response before escalating the request.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bangladesh sent a diplomatic note to India seeking Hasina's extradition for judicial proceedings.</li>
  <li>Under the 2013 extradition treaty, Bangladesh argues for her return, citing various charges against her.</li>
  <li>If India does not respond within what Bangladesh calls ‘natural time’, they will follow up with a note of urgency.</li>
  <li>Hasina is accused of serious charges, including murder and crimes against humanity related to protests earlier this year.</li>
  <li>Yunus’ interim government has been proactive in seeking Hasina's return since taking office in August.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We informed the Indian government through a Note Verbale that we want her (Hasina) back for the judicial process.” - Touhid Hossain, advisor on foreign affairs</blockquote>
<p>The Yunus administration stresses the importance of timely communication with India regarding this sensitive diplomatic matter.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Enforcement Directorate suspects there are 262 such colleges in Canada. (Representational photo)</figcaption>
<p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has initiated an investigation into several Indian individuals, entities, and Canadian colleges for allegedly trafficking Indians into the United States via Canada. This probe follows the tragic death of a family from Gujarat who succumbed to extreme cold while attempting to cross the border illegally in 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ED conducted raids at 8 locations in Mumbai, Nagpur, Gandhinagar, and Vadodara linked to the case.</li>
<li>Individuals, including Bhavesh Ashokbhai Patel, are accused of orchestrating the trafficking under the guise of college admissions.</li>
<li>Victims were reportedly charged between ₹55 and ₹60 lakh for the illegal journey.</li>
<li>Over 25,000 students are referred to foreign colleges annually by associated entities.</li>
<li>112 colleges in Canada might be involved in these illegal activities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"ED initiated the investigation on the basis of an FIR registered by DCB, Crime Branch, Ahmedabad City, Gujarat against Bhavesh Ashokbhai Patel after a family of 04 Indian nationals was found dead on the Canada-US Border."</blockquote>
<p>This investigation highlights significant human trafficking issues and raises concerns on the vulnerability of individuals seeking better opportunities abroad.</p>]]></description>

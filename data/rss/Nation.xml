<p>The article discusses the Indian government's reluctance to engage with protesting farmers who have been calling for a legal guarantee for minimum support prices and other reforms. The Union Agriculture Minister has indicated the government is waiting for Supreme Court directives before initiating talks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The protests are led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha.</li>
<li>Farmers have been protesting at the Punjab-Haryana borders since February last year.</li>
<li>The current government is taking a more hands-off approach compared to previous administrations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The article highlights a shift in the Modi government's strategy towards farmer protests, emphasizing caution and reliance on judicial outcomes rather than direct negotiations.</p>]]></description>

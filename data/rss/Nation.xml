<p>The Winter Session of Parliament, initiated on November 25, has entered its final week. The central government has introduced a constitutional amendment bill for simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal introduced the 'One Nation, One Election' bill.</li>
<li>The bill is part of the BJP's 2024 election manifesto, supported by PM Modi but opposed by various political parties.</li>
<li>The Congress has ordered its MPs to attend the Lok Sabha session for discussions on the bill.</li>
<li>The Rajya Sabha is engaged in a debate celebrating 75 years of the Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The 'One Nation, One Election' Bill is a direct attack on federalism,” said Shiv Sena leader Anil Desai during discussions.</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of these bills is stirring significant political debate regarding their implications for federal structure and democratic accountability in India.</p>]]></description>

<p>Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa has been discharged from the hospital after being granted interim bail on medical grounds, leaving without undergoing planned surgery for a back injury.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Darshan was initially granted bail by the Karnataka High Court, allowing him six weeks for medical treatment.</li>
  <li>The intended surgery was postponed due to his high blood pressure.</li>
  <li>Following his discharge, he went to the City Civil Court to complete bail formalities.</li>
  <li>He is currently linked to the Renukaswamy murder case, with accusations of orchestrating the murder due to derogatory messages sent to his alleged girlfriend, Pavithra Gowda.</li>
  <li>Darshan has faced legal troubles previously, including a 2011 arrest for domestic violence allegations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The messages sent by the victim suggested that Pawithra was tampering with Darshan's marriage.”</blockquote>

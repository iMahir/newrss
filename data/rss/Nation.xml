<p>A tragic incident occurred in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district where a 10-year-old boy, Sumit Meena, lost his life after falling into a 140-feet borewell. Despite extensive rescue efforts lasting 16 hours, he was declared unresponsive upon retrieval.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sumit fell into the borewell around 5 p.m. on December 28, 2024, in Pipliya village.</li>
  <li>Rescue operations included the National Disaster Response Force and involved digging a parallel pit.</li>
  <li>Sumit was trapped at a depth of 39 feet for the entire night before being retrieved.</li>
  <li>Medical examination indicated he had endured hypothermia and was unresponsive upon being brought out.</li>
  <li>The borewell had not been properly secured as it did not strike water.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Sorry to say, he is no more,” Guna district chief medical and health officer Dr. Rajkumar Rishishwar told reporters.</blockquote>
<p>This tragic accident raises concerns regarding child safety and the need for better securing of borewells to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Rahul Gandhi pays last respects to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</figcaption>
<p>The political dispute regarding the memorial for former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh intensified after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi condemned the government for performing his last rites at Nigambodh Ghat instead of an authorized burial site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi labels the government's actions as a "total insult" to Singh.</li>
  <li>He urges that Singh deserved a memorial that reflects his stature and contributions.</li>
  <li>The Aam Aadmi Party demands an apology from the government for the treatment of Singh's last rites.</li>
  <li>Critics highlight the disparity in memorial treatment compared to other former prime ministers.</li>
  <li>Union Home Minister Amit Shah states that space for a memorial will be allocated later.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To date, respecting the dignity of all former Prime Ministers, their last rites were performed at authorized burial sites…”</blockquote>
<p>This controversy raises questions about the respect given to former leaders and the implications of political actions in times of national mourning.</p>]]></description>

<p>The 2024 Lok Sabha elections saw a dramatic decline in overseas voter turnout, plummeting to 2.47% from 25.64% in 2019. The report highlights significant variation across states, with some recording no turnout at all.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overseas voter turnout in 2024 was a mere 2.47%, down from 25.64% in 2019.</li>
  <li>1,19,374 overseas electors were registered, but only 2,958 voted.</li>
  <li>Turnout in states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka was recorded as nil.</li>
  <li>Kerala's turnout decreased significantly from 29.13% in 2019 to 2.97% in 2024.</li>
  <li>Haryana saw a small increase with 37 voters compared to nil in 2019.</li>
  <li>The number of overseas electors was highest in Kerala, followed by Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“An overseas voter must be a citizen of India and has not acquired citizenship of any other country...”</blockquote>
<p>The decrease in overseas voter participation raises concerns about electoral engagement and the impact of expatriate votes on the electoral process.</p>]]></description>

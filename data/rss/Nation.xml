<figcaption>Adani Energy Solutions</figcaption>
<p>The Tamil Nadu government has cancelled a global tender for smart meters, citing the high costs quoted by Adani Energy Solutions Ltd. This decision follows serious allegations against the Adani Group regarding a USD 250 million bribery scheme for solar contracts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation cancelled smart meter tenders due to high costs.</li>
  <li>Adani Energy Solutions was the lowest bidder but quoted higher prices than expected.</li>
  <li>The cancellation occurred on December 27, 2024.</li>
  <li>A re-tender for procuring smart meters is likely to occur soon.</li>
  <li>Allegations against Gautam Adani involve a USD 250 million bribery scheme, which the company denies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The company has refuted the allegations."</blockquote>
<p>The cancellation of the tender raises questions regarding procurement practices and the impact on smart meter implementation in Tamil Nadu.</p>]]></description>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political journey showcases his ability to connect with the masses and redefine political narratives, particularly in light of challenges faced in 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modi's leadership saw a resurgence in 2024 with key state victories despite local setbacks in the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>The 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony of the Ram Temple marked a significant moment of Hindu pride restoration.</li>
<li>Despite the BJP losing seats in the Lok Sabha, the party secured a historic third term due to strong state wins and alliance support.</li>
<li>Modi countered opposition narratives effectively, maintaining a focus on unity and strength leading into future elections.</li>
<li>Looking ahead to 2025, Modi's resilience and strategic acumen will be pivotal as opposition challenges intensify.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Modi’s ability to rebound from setbacks is a hallmark of his political career.”</blockquote>
<p>As 2024 concludes, Modi's political narrative strengthens, hinting at a continued significant presence in Indian politics into 2025.</p>]]></description>

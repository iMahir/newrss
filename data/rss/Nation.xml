<p>In a tragic incident, eight District Reserve Guard (DRG) jawans and one driver were killed in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh, when their vehicle was targeted by Naxals using an improvised explosive device (IED).</p>
<ul>
    <li>The blast occurred on the Bedre-Kutru Road.</li>
    <li>This marks the largest loss of life among security forces due to Naxalite violence in two years.</li>

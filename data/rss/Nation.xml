<figcaption>ISRO SpaDex Docking Mission Live Updates: SpaDeX satellites hold position at 15m. (@isro/X)</figcaption>
<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has conducted a trial attempt with the SpaDeX satellites, bringing them as close as 3 meters in preparation for future docking operations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The SpaDeX mission demonstrates in-space docking using small spacecraft.</li>
  <li>ISRO aims to join the ranks of the US, Russia, and China in mastering docking technologies.</li>
  <li>The mission's success may aid future Indian space endeavors, including a potential Moon mission by 2040.</li>
  <li>ISRO is prioritizing precision over speed in this technology demonstration mission.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Getting it right is more important than getting it done on schedule.”</blockquote>
<p>ISRO's cautious approach emphasizes the complexity of docking operations in space and the importance of thorough data analysis before any docking attempts.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>SpaDeX Mission | Two satellites just 50 feet away for an exciting handshake says ISRO</h1>
<p><strong>Published Date:</strong> January 12, 2025 <strong>Source:</strong> The Hindu</p>

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is successfully nearing the docking of its SpaDeX satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target), which have now reduced their distance to 15 meters. This achievement follows a previous drift that had delayed the docking experiment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The two satellites are currently within 15 meters of each other, just 50 feet away from a handshake.</li>
  <li>ISRO encountered and corrected an unexpected drift between the satellites that postponed earlier docking schedules.</li>
  <li>The docking experiment was initially set for January 7, then moved to January 9, before being postponed again due to the drift issue.</li>
  <li>Successful docking would make India the fourth nation to attain this technology after the USA, Russia, and China.</li>
  <li>This mission is crucial for future projects, including manned lunar missions and the establishment of an Indian Space Station.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“At 15m we see each other clearer and clearer, we are just 50 feet away for an exciting handshake,” ISRO stated on X.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the SpaDeX mission represents a significant step forward for India's capabilities in space technology, with potential implications for future missions beyond Earth.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Bihar Police have arrested three individuals involved in a cyber fraud scheme where they promised men ₹10 lakh to impregnate childless women, despite the men being faced with elaborate scams.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The arrested are identified as Prince Raj, Bhola Kumar, and Rahul Kumar.</li>
  <li>The suspects were operating from Kauara village and may be part of a larger gang.</li>
  <li>The fraudsters promised potential clients ₹50,000 even if they failed to impregnate women.</li>
  <li>They asked victims to supply identification details and registration fees.</li>
  <li>The police are probing the matter further and have identified similar schemes involving significant financial extortion.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“They used to offer people ₹5-10 lakh in exchange for making women pregnant. Even in case of failure, customers were promised ₹50,000,” said Nawada DSP Imran Parwej.</blockquote>
<p>This recent fraud highlights the ongoing challenges posed by cybercrime and the importance of vigilance in online interactions.</p>]]></description>

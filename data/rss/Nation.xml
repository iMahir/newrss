            <description><![CDATA[<h1>‘Army is the servant of people…exists to defend democracy’: remembering General Cariappa’s legacy</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 12, 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>This article commemorates Army Day and reflects on the legacy of General K M Cariappa, the first Indian general and commander-in-chief of the Indian Army. It highlights his emphasis on the army's role in defending democracy and serving the people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Army Day is observed in memory of General K M Cariappa, who became commander-in-chief on January 15, 1949.</li>
<li>General Cariappa stated, “The Army is the servant of the people and it exists to defend democracy and protect…”</li>
<li>He advocated for discipline and moral integrity within the army as custodians of taxpayer-funded resources.</li>
<li>Introduced voluntary military training for civilians to instill a sense of discipline among the public.</li>
<li>The training proposal included physical training and sanitation talks but was not approved by the political establishment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Remember the Army, and everything in it, is the property of the taxpayer.” – General K M Cariappa</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, General Cariappa's vision for a disciplined army that serves the public remains relevant, although some of his training proposals faced political resistance.</p>]]></description>

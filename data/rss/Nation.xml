<p>New Delhi: The Lok Sabha approved a 39-member joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to examine two significant bills aimed at implementing simultaneous state and national elections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The committee's formation follows requests from smaller parties for representation.</li>
  <li>Parliamentary minister Kiren Rijiju stated that including prominent political parties was crucial.</li>
  <li>The JPC will consist of 27 Lok Sabha MPs and 12 Rajya Sabha members.</li>
  <li>The panel is expected to report by the last week of the 2025 budget session.</li>
  <li>Opposition parties have expressed concerns about the proposals impacting democratic accountability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The government agreed that the matter is very important and it relates to the reformation of the election process of our country...” - Kiren Rijiju</blockquote>
<p>The establishment of the JPC reflects the government's commitment to reforming the electoral process, despite facing opposition. However, the passage of the bills may encounter challenges in the House.</p>]]></description>

<p>India has lodged a protest with Bangladesh over controversial comments made by Mahfuj Alam, an aide to the interim government, regarding India's recognition of past political upheavals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alam's comments suggested that India should recognize the uprising that forced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign.</li>
<li>India's External Affairs Ministry emphasized the need for responsibility in public statements.</li>
<li>The protest reflects ongoing tensions between India and Bangladesh, particularly under the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus.</li>
<li>India has previously expressed concerns about violence targeting minorities in Bangladesh.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We would like to remind all concerned to be mindful of their public comments,” said Randhir Jaiswal.</blockquote>
<p>This protest highlights the delicate nature of India-Bangladesh relations, especially post Hasina's resignation amid protests.</p>]]></description>

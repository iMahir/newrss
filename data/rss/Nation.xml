<p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) council deferred the decision to cut tax on insurance premiums as many inputs including IRDAI comments are awaited. Additionally, the council clarified taxi regulations on popcorn taxation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The GST council did not approve a tax cut on insurance premiums pending IRDAI feedback.</li>
  <li>Clarification issued that pre-packed ready-to-eat snacks will face a 12% tax.</li>
  <li>Tax on caramelised popcorn is set at 18% without changing the existing popcorn tax rate.</li>
  <li>A group of ministers (GoM) will be formed to address Andhra Pradesh’s demand for a calamity cess on luxury goods.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The cess will be on luxury items and state-specific levy," said Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav.</blockquote>
<p>This decision reflects ongoing considerations in adapting taxation to address current needs while awaiting further input from key stakeholders.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Date & Source:</strong> December 21, 2024 - Indian Express</p>

(File Photo)" width="640" height="360">
<figcaption>The body has yet to be identified but police say it is likely from a nearby village “because the sender would not take the risk of sending the parcel with a dead body inside from a far-off location”. (File Photo)</figcaption>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> A woman in Undi, Andhra Pradesh, received a body with a disfigured face in a wooden crate, prompting a police investigation and a search for her brother-in-law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Body Delivery:</strong> The body was sent to R Tulasi’s under-construction house, wrapped in plastic sheets within a wooden crate along with electrical wires.</li>
<li><strong>Police Investigation:</strong> The police are investigating a call made to Tulasi informing her of the parcel delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Suspect:</strong> C Sridhar alias Varma, Tulasi’s brother-in-law, is the prime suspect and has been absconding since Friday.</li>
<li><strong>Note Found:</strong> A note claiming that Tulasi’s husband owed Rs 3 lakh, now standing at Rs 1.30 crore with interest, was found.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“This was very carefully planned, the way the body was packed and stuffed in the crate, and how it was ensured that it was delivered to the house. So far, no one from any village has come forward to report their family member or relative missing,” SP Asmi said.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The body has been sent for post-mortem, and the police are continuing their investigation into the identity of the deceased and the motive behind the crime.</p>]]></description>

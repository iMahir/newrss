<figcaption>Pani Puri vendor facing GST notices</figcaption>
<p>Amid a growing trend of digital transactions among street vendors, a Pani Puri vendor in India has received GST notices for exceeding Rs 40 lakh in annual transactions, causing a stir on social media filled with humorous takes and commentary on small business taxation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pani Puri vendors traditionally operated informally but are now facing GST notices due to digital transactions.</li>
  <li>Social media reacts with jokes and memes about Pani Puri vendors becoming corporate giants.</li>
  <li>The increasing prevalence of digital payment methods like UPI has led to more street vendors crossing the GST threshold.</li>
  <li>As digital payments rise, the informal economy shrinks, bringing more vendors into the formal tax framework.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“As digital payments expand, small businesses are being drawn into the formal tax system.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident reflects a significant transformation in the Indian small business landscape, highlighting the effects of digitalization and tax compliance on informal vendors.</p>]]></description>

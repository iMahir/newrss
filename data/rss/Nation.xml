            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Madras High Court Stops Tamil Nadu HR&CE Department from Building on Temple Land</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 9th January 2024</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> New Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-30-150603.png?resize=553%2C298&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="553" height="298" />
<figcaption>Data furnished by the HR&amp;CE Department of the Tamil Nadu govt in 2022</figcaption>
<p>The Madras High Court has prohibited the Tamil Nadu HR&CE Department from utilizing temple surplus funds for constructing a commercial shopping complex on temple property, emphasizing that these funds should be allocated only for religious purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The case began when a Hindu man, P Bhaskar, filed a Public Interest Litigation challenging the proposed construction plan.</li>
<li>The HR&CE Department claimed the complex would generate revenue and support further temple developments.</li>
<li>The court found that the surplus funds could not legally be used for non-religious purposes, such as commercial developments.</li>
<li>Judges highlighted the need for a project study to validate potential financial benefits from the proposed construction.</li>
<li>The court suggested alternative uses for surplus funds, including helping the poor and preserving religious practices.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Constructing the shopping complex using the funds of the temple certainly does not indicate any propagation of the religious tenets of the institution, i.e., the temple.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the ruling reinforces the directive that temple funds must be managed according to specific religious guidelines, ensuring they serve the intended community purposes instead of commercial interests.</p>]]></description>

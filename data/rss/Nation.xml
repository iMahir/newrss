<figcaption>Omar Abdullah addresses the inconsistencies in questioning EVMs.</figcaption>
<p>Omar Abdullah, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and member of the National Conference, criticized Congress for its inconsistent stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), emphasizing that such questioning should be consistent.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Omar Abdullah stated it is wrong to question EVMs only when results are unfavorable.</li>
    <li>He mentioned that if parties distrust EVMs, they should refrain from contesting elections.</li>
    <li>Abdullah highlighted his own electoral experiences, noting he never blamed EVMs for election outcomes.</li>
    <li>The National Conference performed well in recent Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls, winning 48 out of 95 seats.</li>
    <li>Abdullah praised infrastructure initiatives by the Modi government, contrasting with Congress's critiques.</li>
    <li>His remarks reflect a potential rift within the INDIA alliance, particularly concerning Congress's leadership role.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs... you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to." - Omar Abdullah
</blockquote>
<p>Abdullah's comments underline the complexities within the opposition alliance and suggest a call for greater consistency and self-reflection among its members regarding electoral integrity and leadership dynamics.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>My Career Made, Then Unmade By Gandhis: Mani Shankar Aiyar's Big Claim</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Press Trust of India</p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has claimed that the Gandhi family played a significant role in both his political rise and subsequent marginalization within the party.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiyar stated, "The irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis."</li>
    <li>He expressed frustration over a lack of substantial engagement with key members of the Gandhi family over the years.</li>
    <li>Aiyar mentioned he did not have the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi for a decade and had only limited interactions with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.</li>
    <li>He recalled needing to ask Priyanka to convey birthday wishes to Rahul during a period of his suspension from the party.</li>
    <li>Aiyar wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi seeking clarity on his suspension but received no acknowledgment.</li>
    <li>He reflected on the political environment in 2012 during crises for both Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh, noting Pranab Mukherjee's potential leadership during that time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi.”</blockquote>
<p>This interview sheds light on the complex dynamics within the Congress party and highlights Aiyar's personal experiences regarding his political journey influenced by the Gandhi family.</p>]]></description>

<p>Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray has urged Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to initiate an inquiry into a road scam targeting former CM Eknath Shinde ahead of the state cabinet expansion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aaditya Thackeray calls for the exclusion of Eknath Shinde and two other former ministers from the cabinet.</li>
    <li>Thackeray alleges involvement in a ₹12,000 crore road scam, emphasizing the need for accountability.</li>

<p>A day after raids were carried out in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal to check irregularities in electricity distribution in two localities, the district administration claimed that power theft worth Rs 1.3 crore by four mosques and a madrassa has been uncovered.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The raids revealed that significant electricity theft has occurred over the past year in the area, coinciding with efforts against power theft.</li>
    <li>Sambhal District Magistrate Rajender Pensiya noted electricity theft during a loudspeaker check, prompting two raids involving multiple authorities.</li>
    <li>Electricity worth around Rs 300 crore is supplied to Sambhal Nagar Palika area yearly, with line losses reported at 72%. In some areas, losses approach 85%.</li>
    <li>1,250 FIRs related to electricity theft have been lodged in the area since September.</li>
    <li>An illegal power house was found supplying electricity to over 100 houses, with other methods of theft including tampered meters.</li>
    <li>Measures to combat theft include laying 20 kilometres of armed wire, while dealing with encroachments and noise complaints simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “In our drive to stop the electricity theft, we found that people use five to six ways… of these, a few methods are new to us. We never knew electricity could be stolen this way.” — Rajender Pensiya
</blockquote>
<p>The situation highlights extensive power theft that has been ongoing in Sambhal, with local authorities taking increased measures to combat this issue through raids and infrastructure improvement initiatives.</p>]]></description>

<p>Aarti was performed for the first time in 46 years at the ancient Bhasma Shankar temple in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh, after it was reopened by local authorities recently.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The temple was discovered during an anti-encroachment drive, where officials found it houses deities Lord Shiva and Hanuman.</li>
    <li>This centuries-old temple had been closed since the 1978 communal riots.</li>
    <li>Local authorities have initiated measures to restore the temple and ensure its security, including the installation of CCTV cameras.</li>
    <li>Officials plan to hand over the temple to the community it originally belonged to and take action against encroachments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"A Brahmin should be appointed here so that he can stay here. Till the time caretaker is appointed, we will take responsibility." - Acharya Brahm Shukla</blockquote>
<p>The reopening of the temple marks a significant moment for the local community, rekindling spiritual practices that had been dormant for decades and promising to restore the temple to its original state.</p>]]></description>

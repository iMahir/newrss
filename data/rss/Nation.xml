<p>Assam has reported its first case of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection this season, with a 10-month-old child testing positive. The infant is currently undergoing treatment at Assam Medical College and Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh and is said to be stable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ten-month-old child tests positive for HMPV in Dibrugarh, Assam.</li>
  <li>Child admitted to AMCH with cold-related symptoms four days ago.</li>
  <li>HMPV infection confirmed by ICMR-RMRC Lahowal after routine tests.</li>
  <li>HMPV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms.</li>
  <li>Similar HMPV cases reported in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The HMPV infection was confirmed yesterday after we got test results from Lahowal-based ICMR-RMRC. The child is stable now. It is a common virus, and there is nothing to worry about.” - Dr. Dhrubajyoti Bhuyan, AMCH superintendent</blockquote>
<p>The detection of HMPV is not unusual, as the virus circulates seasonally and typically impacts infants and individuals with weaker immune systems more severely.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a podcast with Nikhil Kamath in Delhi. (HT_PRINT)</figcaption>
<p>In a recent podcast, PM Narendra Modi stated that he is human and can make mistakes, a claim met with skepticism from Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who accused the Prime Minister of engaging in damage control due to his previous assertion of being 'non-biological'.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modi acknowledged his humanity and capacity for mistakes during a podcast with Nikhil Kamath.</li>
  <li>Ramesh's critique refers to Modi's earlier statement on his 'non-biological' status made just months prior.</li>
  <li>Modi emphasized the need for idealism in politics over strict ideological adherence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This from a man who proclaimed his non-biological status just eight months back. This is clearly damage control.” - Jairam Ramesh</blockquote>
<p>The exchange highlights ongoing tensions between Congress and the ruling party regarding Modi's leadership narrative.</p>]]></description>

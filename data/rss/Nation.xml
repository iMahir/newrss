The court reaffirmed her right to motherhood amid questions about her mental capacity.</p><ul><li>The woman, over 20 weeks pregnant, refused consent for abortion.</li><li>A medical board found both the woman and the foetus to be physically normal.</li><li>The court highlighted that having below-average intelligence does not negate her right to be a mother.</li><li>The father adopted the woman when she was six months old and expressed concerns about her mental health and ability to care for a child.</li><li>The court emphasized parental responsibility and urged the father to support his daughter's choices.</li></ul><blockquote>"Observation is she has below average intelligence. Nobody can be super intelligent.. we are human beings, everybody has different level of intelligence. Because she has below average intelligence, she has no right to be a mother?"</blockquote><p>The case is set to continue on January 13, during which the court will determine if the woman's partner is willing to marry her.</p>]]></description>

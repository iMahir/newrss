            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Congress Defends Rahul Gandhi's Remarks on 'Indian State'</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Thursday<br><strong>Source:</strong> New Delhi</p>
<p>The Congress party defended Rahul Gandhi against criticism for his comments about 'fighting the Indian state', referencing Article 12 of the Indian Constitution to clarify his statements about institutional capture by the ruling BJP and RSS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rahul Gandhi stated that the Congress is fighting against not only the BJP and RSS, but the broader Indian state.</li>
  <li>Former Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel supported Gandhi’s remarks, emphasizing the capture of institutions meant to uphold justice and democracy.</li>
  <li>Baghel criticized government institutions for being misused by the ruling party, citing the Election Commission and other agencies as examples.</li>
  <li>Pawan Khera highlighted concerns about the selective enforcement of laws, claiming opposition leaders are targeted while allies go unpunished.</li>
  <li>Baghel also condemned RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's comments regarding India's independence, framing them as anti-constitutional.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Why else do institutions like the ED seem to remember the addresses of only opposition leaders?” - Pawan Khera</blockquote>
<p>This defense reflects ongoing tensions between the Congress party and the ruling government, centering on the integrity of democratic institutions in India.</p>]]></description>

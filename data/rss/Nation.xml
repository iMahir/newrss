            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nimisha Priya Case: What option does Kerala nurse on death row in Yemen have?</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 31, 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Indian Express</p>
<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is working to secure the release of Nimisha Priya, a Kerala nurse sentenced to death in Yemen for allegedly murdering a Yemeni citizen in 2017.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Priya was imprisoned in 2017 after allegedly killing Talal Abdo Mehdi, a Yemeni citizen.</li>
  <li>She was sentenced to death in 2020, with her appeal dismissed by the Supreme Judicial Council in November 2023.</li>
  <li>Negotiations for 'blood money' compensation are underway, with Priya's family expected to pay up to $400,000 to waive the death penalty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We understand that the family of Priya is exploring relevant options. The government is extending all possible help in the matter.” - MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal</blockquote>
<p>The situation highlights the complexities of legal recourse in foreign jurisdictions and raises significant humanitarian concerns.</p>]]></description>

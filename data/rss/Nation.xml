<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is successfully nearing the docking of its SpaDeX satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target), which have now reduced their distance to 15 meters. This achievement follows a previous drift that had delayed the docking experiment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The two satellites are currently within 15 meters of each other, just 50 feet away from a handshake.</li>
  <li>ISRO encountered and corrected an unexpected drift between the satellites that postponed earlier docking schedules.</li>
  <li>The docking experiment was initially set for January 7, then moved to January 9, before being postponed again due to the drift issue.</li>
  <li>Successful docking would make India the fourth nation to attain this technology after the USA, Russia, and China.</li>
  <li>This mission is crucial for future projects, including manned lunar missions and the establishment of an Indian Space Station.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“At 15m we see each other clearer and clearer, we are just 50 feet away for an exciting handshake,” ISRO stated on X.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the SpaDeX mission represents a significant step forward for India's capabilities in space technology, with potential implications for future missions beyond Earth.</p>]]></description>

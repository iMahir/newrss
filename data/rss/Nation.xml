<p>Bangladesh has announced that it is waiting for a response from India regarding the extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The foreign ministry has issued a formal request and stated that they will take further action if India does not reply soon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bangladesh sent a diplomatic note to India on December 23 but has not yet received a response.</li>
  <li>A 'note of urgency' will be issued if India fails to respond within a certain period.</li>
  <li>No specific timeline exists for the extradition process between the two countries.</li>
  <li>The spokesperson for Bangladesh stressed that the country is willing to wait but will not hesitate to act further.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"If India does not respond on the issue in an appropriate period of time, Bangladesh will take further steps to ensure Hasina’s extradition." - Mohammed Rafiqul Alam</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Bangladesh's threats of diplomatic action highlight the tension surrounding the extradition request of Sheikh Hasina and could escalate if responses from India remain pending.</p>]]></description>

<p>M. Suhaib, an Additional District Judge in Kozhikode, has been suspended following allegations of misconduct involving a woman court employee. This decision was taken after an emergency meeting of the Administrative Committee of the Kerala High Court, led by Chief Justice Nitin Madhukar Jamdar, which deemed the allegations as damaging to the credibility of the judiciary.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incident reportedly took place in the judge's official chamber.</li>
    <li>The court received an oral apology from the judge towards the woman involved.</li>
    <li>The woman has been reluctant to file a formal complaint, complicating potential legal actions.</li>
    <li>The judicial officer will be issued a show cause notice regarding his conduct.</li>
    <li>This case has raised concerns among the legal community regarding the judiciary's integrity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The alleged incident has dented the credibility of the judicial institution of the State.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights ongoing challenges within institutional frameworks regarding accountability and the handling of misconduct allegations.</p>]]></description>

<p>Sriram Krishnan has been appointed as a Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence by President-elect Donald Trump, stirring backlash on social media, especially from conservative circles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Krishnan, a technology veteran who has worked at prominent companies, is tasked with shaping AI policy at the White House.</li>
<li>His stance on immigration, specifically regarding H1-B visas, sparked controversy and accusations of undermining Trump's America First policy.</li>
<li>Public criticism was largely driven by right-wing commentators who misrepresented his views on immigration.</li>
<li>Supporters of Krishnan clarified that his proposals aim for a merit-based immigration system.</li>
<li>Some individuals claim Krishnan prioritizes foreign workers over American citizens in technology sectors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I’m honoured to be able to serve our country and ensure continued American leadership in AI working closely with David Sacks. Thank you, Donald Trump, for this opportunity.” — Sriram Krishnan</blockquote>
<p>The uproar reflects broader tensions surrounding immigration and the role of minorities in American politics, specifically targeting Indian-Americans like Krishnan.</p>]]></description>

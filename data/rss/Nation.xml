<p>The Supreme Court has directed that the status quo be maintained regarding a well near the Shahi Jama Masjid at Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh, following an application from the mosque management committee.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The court issued directives to local authorities and private respondents to file counter-affidavits within two weeks.</li>
  <li>Concerns were raised regarding plans to refer the site as ‘Hari Mandir’ and the commencement of religious activities.</li>
  <li>Legal representatives presented historical significance of the well and its longstanding usage by the mosque.</li>
  <li>The case is scheduled to be posted for hearing on February 25, 2025.</li>
  <li>Last year, the Supreme Court intervened to maintain peace following violent clashes in the area.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“No such activities will be permitted. Please file a status report,” - Chief Justice Khanna</blockquote>
<p>This ruling aims to preserve the historical and cultural heritage associated with the mosque and its surroundings, continuing to monitor any future developments related to the site.</p>]]></description>

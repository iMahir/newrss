<p>M. Suhaib, an Additional District Judge in Kozhikode, has been suspended following allegations of misconduct involving a woman court employee. This decision was taken after an emergency meeting of the Administrative Committee of the Kerala High Court, led by Chief Justice Nitin Madhukar Jamdar, which deemed the allegations as damaging to the credibility of the judiciary.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incident reportedly took place in the judge's official chamber.</li>
    <li>The court received an oral apology from the judge towards the woman involved.</li>
    <li>The woman has been reluctant to file a formal complaint, complicating potential legal actions.</li>
    <li>The judicial officer will be issued a show cause notice regarding his conduct.</li>
    <li>This case has raised concerns among the legal community regarding the judiciary's integrity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The alleged incident has dented the credibility of the judicial institution of the State.”</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights ongoing challenges within institutional frameworks regarding accountability and the handling of misconduct allegations.</p>]]></description>

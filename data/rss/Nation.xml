<p>A 24-year-old man from Assam was arrested for allegedly killing his one-year-old daughter and wife, then staging their deaths as an accident.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The accused, Rois Uddin Barbhuiya, initially claimed the deaths were due to a car accident in the Barak River.</li>
    <li>Investigation revealed he killed his wife, Heli Begum, and daughter before pushing their car into the river.</li>
    <li>The bodies were recovered from the river on December 18, prompting further investigation by local police.</li>
    <li>Barbhuiya's in-laws filed a complaint after finding discrepancies in his account of events.</li>
    <li>Authorities are investigating the motive behind the alleged killings.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The locals too said that Barbhuiya had called them after allegedly plunging the car into the river and claimed that he had managed to escape.” - Numal Mahatta, Superintendent of Police</blockquote>
<p>This case raises concerns about domestic violence and the urgent need for protective measures for vulnerable individuals.</p>]]></description>

<p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah stated that Tripura remained a backward state during the 35 years of Left rule, claiming significant development occurred only after the BJP took power in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shah emphasized that under communist rule, development was stagnant, with only 2.5% of the population having access to piped drinking water.</li>
<li>He highlighted improvements made since BJP assumed power, including 85% access to potable water and free healthcare initiatives.</li>
<li>Shah noted significant support extended to rehabilitated Bru tribals, who were displaced due to ethnic violence in Mizoram.</li>
<li>The Home Minister assured that rehabilitated individuals received financial support for home construction and have been integrated into the electoral process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“For 35 years, the communists ruled Tripura. The communists claimed that they worked for the welfare of the poor... but now we are addressing it.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Amit Shah's statements aim to showcase the contrasts in governance and development between the BJP and the previous Left government in Tripura, emphasizing the positive changes since the BJP took office.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Traffic accident involving a truck and SUV in Bengaluru</figcaption>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The accident occurred near Nelamangala when a truck's container fell onto the Volvo XC90 occupied by Chandram Yegapagol and his family.</li>
  <li>The truck driver, Arif, claims a blue car abruptly braked, causing him to lose control.</li>
  <li>Police have secured CCTV footage that seems to support the truck driver's statement.</li>
  <li>All six victims, including Yegapagol’s wife and children, were on their way to their native village.</li>
  <li>The family was well-prepared for safety, with Yegapagol recently purchasing the Volvo for its safety features.</li>
  <li>The incident has garnered significant local attention due to the family’s prominence and their tragic loss.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Plea Seeks to Restrain PM Modi from Offering Chadar at Ajmer Sharif Dargah</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 03 Jan 2025</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Bar and Bench</p>
<p>A plea has been filed in an Ajmer court requesting a temporary injunction to stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi from offering a Chadar at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah during the Urs of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, citing ongoing legal disputes over the site's history.</p>
<ul>
<li>The plea was filed by Hindu Sena President Vishnu Gupta.</li>
<li>The application argues that the Dargah is built on a site previously occupied by a Shiva temple.</li>
<li>Gupta claims that sending a Chadar undermines judicial independence while the case is pending.</li>
<li>The Dargah is a significant site, respected for its Sufi heritage.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“This gesture reflects his deep respect for India’s rich spiritual heritage and the enduring message of harmony and compassion,” - Kiren Rijiju</blockquote>
<p>The plea appeals that no chadar should be offered by the Central government amidst the ongoing litigation.</p>]]></description>

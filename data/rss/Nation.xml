<img src='image_url.jpg' alt='Accident Scene' />
<figcaption>Traffic accident involving a truck and SUV in Bengaluru</figcaption>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The accident occurred near Nelamangala when a truck's container fell onto the Volvo XC90 occupied by Chandram Yegapagol and his family.</li>
  <li>The truck driver, Arif, claims a blue car abruptly braked, causing him to lose control.</li>
  <li>Police have secured CCTV footage that seems to support the truck driver's statement.</li>
  <li>All six victims, including Yegapagol’s wife and children, were on their way to their native village.</li>
  <li>The family was well-prepared for safety, with Yegapagol recently purchasing the Volvo for its safety features.</li>
  <li>The incident has garnered significant local attention due to the family’s prominence and their tragic loss.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Safety was a priority for him. He checked many vehicles before deciding on the Volvo.” - Umesh Murudi, relative</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court Urges Government to Avoid Exploitative Temporary Employment Practices</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Recent</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Supreme Court Judgment</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has urged government departments to refrain from misusing temporary employment contracts, highlighting the negative impact of the gig economy on worker rights and job security.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Court criticized the use of temporary contracts in government institutions, which mirrors problematic gig economy practices.</li>
  <li>Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Prasanna B Varale emphasized the need to protect workers from exploitative employment practices.</li>
  <li>The judgment allowed for the regularization of temporary employees at the Central Water Commission, who have been in service for nearly two decades.</li>
  <li>Key issues identified include arbitrary termination, lack of career progression, and denial of basic rights and benefits.</li>
  <li>The Court highlighted the importance of fair treatment of workers as critical to maintaining public trust.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The pervasive misuse of temporary employment contracts reflects a broader systemic issue that adversely affects workers' rights and job security.</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court's ruling calls for a commitment to fair employment practices by government entities, urging them to align with international labor standards.</p>]]></description>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to send a ceremonial ‘chadar’ to the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, continuing his tradition amid the ongoing Shiva temple controversy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This year marks Modi's 11th participation in offering the 'chadar'.</li>
  <li>The ‘chadar’ will be presented at the Urs of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.</li>
  <li>Refresh of controversy: A court case is ongoing regarding claims that there is a Shiva temple within the Dargah.</li>
  <li>The Dargah is one of the most revered Sufi shrines, celebrating millions of devotees annually during the Urs festival.</li>
  <li>Prior offerings included representation by other officials during last year's event.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“During the Urs festival, offering the chadar is regarded as a powerful form of worship, believed to bring blessings and fulfill vows.”</blockquote>
<p>This ongoing gesture underscores Modi's commitment to interfaith relations, despite the contrasting Shiv temple claims surrounding the historic Dargah.</p>]]></description>

<p>The police have also summoned the friend of the accused, who owns the flat where the incident took place, for questioning.</p>

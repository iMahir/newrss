<p>The Delhi Directorate of Education (DoE) has ordered all government and private schools to conduct hybrid classes for students up to Class 9 and Class 11 due to a severe dip in air quality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The air quality index (AQI) in Delhi rose sharply from 275 to 396.</li>
  <li>All schools must adopt 'Hybrid Mode' for classes up to Class IX and XI.</li>
  <li>Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been invoked, banning all construction activities and non-essential polluting trucks.</li>
  <li>Delhi's air quality index has now reached levels above 400, categorized as severe.</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>“All Heads of Schools of Govt., Govt. Aided, Unaided Recognized Private Schools of DOE, NDMC, MCD and Delhi Cantonment Board are directed to conduct classes in schools for children up to Class IX &amp; XI in a 'Hybrid Mode'.”</blockquote>

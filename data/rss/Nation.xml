            <description><![CDATA[<h1>CATS Warrior Drone: Why IAF Is Unlikely To Place Orders For HAL’s “Stealth UAV” Despite All The Hoopla?</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 11, 2025 &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)</p>
<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhA6T9wbcAAIeK_?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="CATS Warrior"><figcaption>The flagship program of HAL, the Combat Air Teaming System, achieved a milestone by successfully conducting the Engine Ground Run of a Full-Scale Demonstrator, CATS – Warrior. Via: HAL</figcaption></figure>
<p>HAL's CATS Warrior drone has accomplished a significant engine ground run, sparking both interest and concern about its operational capabilities and design.</p>
<ul>
<li>The CATS program includes multiple UAVs designed for collaboration in contested airspace.</li>
<li>The Warrior drone is intended for autonomous operations with a range of 800 km and a speed of ~850 km/h.</li>
<li>Key specifications include a maximum weight of 1,300 kg and the ability to carry various weapons.</li>
<li>HAL emphasizes stealth characteristics, aiming to minimize radar detection.</li>
<li>Challenges remain, notably in engine power and the quest for true stealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The promise of CATS will only be realized if the Warrior and Hunter drones are adequately stealthy.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while HAL's technology demonstrator showcases advancements, there remain significant hurdles before the CATS can be considered operational. IAF's commitment to the project is premature and should be approached with caution.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
    <li>The founders sought an investment of Rs 1.2 crore for 1% equity.</li>
    <li>Vineeta Singh raised doubts about their social media reach and sales figures.</li>
    <li>Claims of manipulating business numbers led to an emotional response from the pitchers.</li>
    <li>Aditi emphasized the genuine growth of their community and brand on social media.</li>
    <li>The pitchers urged their loyal customers to showcase their support online to counter the accusations.</li>
</ul>

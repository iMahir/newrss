  <li>Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer with the Kolkata Police, was arrested following the discovery of the victim's body, with evidence linking him to the crime.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Supreme Court: Suicide abetment charges must not be invoked ‘mechanically’ to comfort deceased’s family</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 17, 2025 | <strong>Source:</strong> The Indian Express</p>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/Indian-Express-2025-01-17T125319.807.jpg?w=640" alt="suicide" width="640" height="360">
<figcaption>The remarks by the bench came while discharging a bank manager of charge of abetting the suicide of a man who allegedly took his own life after being unable to repay the loan that he had availed from the bank. (Express File/Amit Mehra)</figcaption>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that invoking abetment of suicide charges must not be done mechanically to comfort the deceased’s family. This judgment emphasizes the necessity of a higher legal threshold before such charges are applied.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The court discharged a bank manager accused of abetting a suicide linked to loan repayment issues.</li>
  <li>It criticized the casual application of Section 306 IPC by police, advocating for stricter adherence to legal standards.</li>
  <li>Justice Viswanathan emphasized genuine cases must not be overlooked while cautioning against procedural abuses.</li>
  <li>The court stated that emotional outbursts should not be interpreted as instigation to suicide.</li>
  <li>The decision sets a precedent for how law enforcement and courts should approach suicides connected to debt disputes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“To attract the ingredient of Section 306, the accused should have abetted the commission of a suicide.”</blockquote>
<p>This ruling seeks to prevent the misuse of suicide abetment charges and ensure that only those responsible for instigating suicide face legal consequences.</p>]]></description>

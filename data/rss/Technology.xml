<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Mint</p>
<p>New Delhi: A string of blockbuster movies towards the end of 2024 has partly helped rescue shopping malls and retailers after a near washout earlier in the year, according to top industry executives.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Pushpa 2: The Rule</i> starring Allu Arjun, one of the all-time top grossers, opened in cinemas in December.</li>
<li>Kartik Aaryan-starrer <i>Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3</i> and <i>Mufasa: The Lion King</i> have also drawn crowds.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the holiday season approaches, these significant film releases contribute to increased foot traffic in shopping malls, providing a much-needed boost to retailers who experienced downturns earlier in the year.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses the retirement of Nvidia's GeForce Experience in favor of the new Nvidia App, marking a drastic change that many users are celebrating.</p>
<ul>
  <li>GeForce Experience (GFE) was criticized for being convoluted and requiring user logins without offering value.</li>
  <li>The new Nvidia App combines useful features from GFE and the outdated Nvidia Control Panel.</li>
  <li>User feedback indicates significant improvements in usability and convenience with the new Nvidia App.</li>
  <li>The Nvidia App does not require logins, removing the frustration associated with GFE.</li>
  <li>Despite improvements, some areas still need enhancement for full integration of features.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Nothing infuriated me more than GeForce Experience during that time."</blockquote>
<p>This change signifies a positive step for Nvidia users, although concerns remain about potential future changes that may reintroduce unwelcome features.</p>]]></description>

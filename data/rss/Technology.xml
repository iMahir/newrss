<p>Samsung has initiated a trial of the Galaxy Trade-In Program, allowing customers to gain value from their old devices without needing to purchase a new phone. Currently operating in South Korea and France, this program accepts various Galaxy models for trade-in.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The program is designed to support a circular economy.</li>
  <li>Eligible devices include Galaxy S20, S21, S22, S23 series, and Z Fold and Flip models.</li>
  <li>Payments vary based on the condition of the devices categorized as Excellent, Good, or Recycle.</li>
  <li>The program is expected to expand to more markets later this year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“We’re excited to launch our brand-new year-round Galaxy Trade-In Program in an effort to enrich the value of Galaxy devices for users and contribute to a circular economy,” said Jun Kim, EVP and Head of Galaxy Value Innovation team, Mobile eXperience Business at Samsung Electronics.</blockquote>
<p>This innovative program highlights Samsung's commitment to sustainability and customer value, setting a new benchmark in the phone trade-in landscape.</p>]]></description>

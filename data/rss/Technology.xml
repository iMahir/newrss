<p>Roborock has introduced its latest robot vacuum, the Saros Z70, which boasts a unique mechanical arm capable of picking up small items while cleaning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Saros Z70 features the OmniGrip, a five-axis robotic arm that can lift objects up to 10.5 ounces.</li>
  <li>The vacuum also has advanced navigation with next-gen sensors and AI-powered object recognition.</li>
  <li>Initial demos showed some mechanical glitches, but Roborock assures that these issues have been addressed for retail versions.</li>
  <li>The vacuum can detect and avoid up to 108 different obstacles during cleaning cycles.</li>
  <li>Safety features include a child lock and a safety stop button to prevent accidental grabs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Instead of using a traditional LDS (LIDAR) tower module for navigation, the system integrates next-gen dual-light 3D time-of-flight sensors and RGB cameras powered by AI to determine its position, surroundings and whether the object it grips is overweight." - Roborock</blockquote>
<p>The Roborock Saros Z70 not only innovates with its mechanical arm but also maintains strong vacuuming capabilities with 22,000 Pa of suction power and an anti-tangle system.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra S Pen Loses Bluetooth Functionality</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Two weeks from now<br><strong>Source:</strong> Leakster Ishan Agarwal</p>

<figcaption>S Pen in Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra to become even less usable</figcaption>
<p>Samsung is set to unveil the Galaxy S25 series in two weeks. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, featuring rounded corners and a built-in S Pen, seems to be losing its Bluetooth functionality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The S Pen will forfeit Bluetooth capabilities, eliminating features like gestures and remote control.</li>
  <li>Current Bluetooth functions include taking photos, switching cameras, and changing photo modes via gestures.</li>
  <li>The feature set, known as Air Actions, will no longer be available in the S Pen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li>
  <li>This change may discourage some users from upgrading to the new series.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Eliminating remote control features seems like a step back."</blockquote>
<p>This decision by Samsung may point to design changes that accommodate a subtly smaller stylus fitting into the device.</p>]]></description>

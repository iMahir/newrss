<p>After years of using the Apple Watch and launching into the Android market with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, the author realizes the importance of features like the digital crown that are absent from the Samsung watch.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensive experience with Apple Watch since its 2014 launch.</li>
  <li>Amazed at the absence of the digital crown in the Galaxy Watch Ultra after trying it for just 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Notes functionality differences between the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, particularly in outdoor and activity settings.</li>
  <li>Recommends that future versions of Samsung watches include a digital crown for improved user experience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The lack of a digital crown has made me question everything I thought I knew about smartwatches."</blockquote>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a strong contender in the smartwatch market but its missing digital crown poses a significant usability issue for those coming from Apple devices.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A schematic of the model of the vocal tract (📷: M. Caren et al.)</figcaption>
<p>This article discusses groundbreaking advancements in AI, focusing on a system developed by MIT's CSAIL that mimics sounds like humans do, enhancing communication through vocal imitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers at MIT have created an AI system that can mimic human vocal sounds without prior training.</li>
  <li>The system models the human vocal tract and can interpret and imitate various real-world sounds.</li>
  <li>Three versions of the model were developed, improving upon human-like sound imitation.</li>
  <li>Human judges preferred AI-generated imitations in many experiments, indicating great potential in sound design.</li>
  <li>Despite limitations, such as struggling with certain consonants, this work paves the way for potential applications in creative fields.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Given this success, the researchers hope that the model could enable future sound designers, musicians, and filmmakers to interact with computational systems in creative ways.”</blockquote>
<p>The study of sound imitation could redefine communication with AI, impacting fields such as sound design and deeper language understanding.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Discover Genmoji in Apple’s iOS 18.2!</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> FE Tech Bytes</p>
<p>As Apple releases its iPadOS 18.2 and iOS 18.2, it introduces Genmoji, a feature that allows users to create custom emojis using Apple’s artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2>How to use Genmoji</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open a conversation and click on the text field.</li>
<li>Tap the smiley icon or globe icon.</li>
<li>Describe the emoji you want to create and click “Done.”</li>
<li>Share your personalized emoji.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also delete a Genmoji by accessing the emoji keyboard, selecting it, and choosing the ‘remove’ option.</p>
<h2>Understanding Genmoji</h2>
<p>Genmoji are custom emojis created based on user descriptions, leveraging Apple Intelligence. For instance, typing ‘cat singing’ prompts the AI to generate a corresponding emoji.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can create emojis based on images of people they know by using their pictures as a reference for customization.</p>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> N/A <strong>Source:</strong> N/A</p>
<p>As technology advances, the concept of immortality within the metaverse raises unique social, legal, and psychological challenges. This research analyzes the implications of having AI-driven avatars that may continue to exist and operate long after a user's physical death.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The metaverse combines AI, AR, VR, and blockchain technologies to create immersive digital environments.</li>

  <li>The paper explores the ethical implications of avatars carrying on after users' deaths, raising questions about liability and privacy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The soul is immortal” - a sentiment that echoes both socially and legally as we consider digital legacies.</blockquote>

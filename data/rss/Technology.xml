<p>The next big upgrade to Apple’s mobile devices could be foldability, according to multiple reports published Sunday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple aims to launch two foldable devices in the upcoming years—one a foldable iPhone and the other a larger model with a 19-inch screen.</li>
<li>The foldable iPhone is expected to have a larger screen than the iPhone 16 Pro Max and likely ready for launch in 2026, potentially subject to delays.</li>
<li>Progress is being made towards eliminating the visible crease on current foldable screens.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The company is reportedly planning a 2026 launch, but that could be pushed back by a year.”</blockquote>
<p>This innovation potentially reshapes Apple's mobile device lineup, showcasing its commitment to adaptability and advanced technology in consumer electronics.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified <strong>Source:</strong> Economic Times</p>
<p>Tech giant Apple is under scrutiny following an incident where its AI service, Apple Intelligence, generated a misleading alert claiming that murder suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself. The notification has raised concerns about the reliability of AI in news delivery.</p>
<h2>The False Alert: What Happened?</h2>
<p>BBC subscribers in the UK received a notification stating, “Luigi Mangione shoots himself,” which was incorrect as he is currently in custody awaiting extradition.</p>
<h2>How Apple Intelligence Got It Wrong</h2>
<p>The AI service misinterpreted news context, leading to the erroneous alert. The BBC clarified that they had not published such information and contacted Apple about the issue.</p>
<h2>Apple’s Response and Concerns</h2>
<p>A company representative acknowledged concerns about the potential harm to credibility of both Apple and news organizations, highlighting past errors with AI summaries.</p>
<h2>The Case of Luigi Mangione and Its Media Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Luigi Mangione is charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, making the error particularly sensitive and potentially damaging to public trust in news.</p>

<p>No image available.</p>
<p>Apple's much talked about next iPhone, the iPhone 17 Air, has reportedly entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn. This model is expected to replace the 'Plus' variant in the iPhone 17 lineup and is set to be released in 2025.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to be Apple's slimmest smartphone yet, with thickness ranging between 5mm and 6mm.</li>
  <li>Prototypes suggest the elimination of the physical SIM card tray in favor of eSIM technology.</li>
  <li>It may feature a centralized camera bump on the back, potentially with a single sensor instead of a dual-camera system.</li>
  <li>Rumors indicate a reduction in battery capacity due to the slimmer design.</li>
  <li>Audio setup may include only a single speaker in the earpiece.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The NPI phase takes a product from the concept stage to mass production.”</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while there are promising innovations with the iPhone 17 Air, there are also trade-offs regarding features and specifications compared to previous models.</p>]]></description>

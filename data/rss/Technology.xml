<p>Hisense showcases its new large-scale TVs at CES, featuring the 136-inch MicroLED and the 116-inch TriChroma LED TV, aiming to enhance home theater experiences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 136-inch MicroLED 136MX is touted as a consumer-ready MicroLED display but remains high-end and expensive.</li>
  <li>Hisense claims the 136MX represents a significant step towards making cutting-edge display technology more accessible.</li>
  <li>The TV uses over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs for exceptional brightness and quality without the risk of burn-in.</li>
  <li>The new TriChroma LED TV utilizes RGB Local Dimming Technology to achieve a vibrant color spectrum and high brightness levels.</li>
  <li>The TriChroma is reported to cover 97% of the BT.2020 color space, making it superior in color vibrance among Mini LED displays.</li>
  <li>No pricing or release date information is available yet for the TriChroma TV.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The 136MX builds on Hisense’s legacy of display innovation, leveraging a high-density array of over 24.88 million microscopic LEDs to deliver unparalleled brightness, resolution, and precision.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both TVs aim to redefine viewing experiences, but they remain high-end options for most consumers.</p>]]></description>

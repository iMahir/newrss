<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 9, 2025 &nbsp; <strong>Source:</strong> India Today</p>
<img src="https://cf-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/visualstory/wp/2025/01/cropped-WhatsApp-Image-2025-01-09-at-15411-PMITG-1736411101508.jpeg" alt="iPhone 17 Air Image">
<figcaption>Image depicting the iPhone 17 Air</figcaption>
<p>Apple is reportedly planning a new ultra-thin iPhone model for its 2025 flagship lineup, likely called the iPhone 17 Air, aimed at replacing the iPhone Plus variant.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to offer a thinner, lighter design in line with Apple's portfolio, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air.</li>
  <li>Expected launch is in September 2025, with production rumored to have started in December 2024.</li>
  <li>It will feature a 6.6-inch OLED display, slightly smaller than the iPhone 16 Plus' 6.7-inch screen.</li>
  <li>The new model may adopt a significantly thinner aluminum chassis, potentially measuring as little as 6mm in thickness.</li>
  <li>It is rumored to come with a single 48MP rear camera, potentially omitting features found in higher-end models.</li>
  <li>The iPhone 17 Air is likely to have an A19 chip, offering modest performance improvements over the A18 series.</li>
  <li>Despite its minimalist design, it is expected to include 120Hz ProMotion technology.</li>
  <li>Launch of the iPhone 17 Air has not been confirmed, with rumors also mentioning the iPhone SE 4 as a possible release.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Despite its thin design, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature 120Hz ProMotion technology, which Apple is rumored to include in the entire iPhone 17 lineup."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the potential introduction of the iPhone 17 Air marks Apple's continued focus on sleek and lightweight devices, though confirmation is still pending.</p>]]></description>

<p>Sega is exploring the possibility of launching its own video game subscription service similar to Netflix and Xbox Game Pass. Although details are scarce, the company is evaluating options to join other publishers in offering its games digitally for a monthly fee.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sega is assessing its options for a new game subscription service.</li>
  <li>The company has a wealth of popular franchises like Sonic, Yakuza, and Persona.</li>
  <li>Sega's president, Shuji Utsumi, expressed interest in subscription models during a recent interview.</li>
  <li>Existing services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus have popularized the subscription model in gaming.</li>
  <li>Sega plans to revive its brand and confidence in the gaming industry.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“I want to make Sega really shiny again,” said Utsumi, emphasizing the company's great RPG group and well-known IPs.</blockquote>

<figcaption>Comparison between iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro</figcaption>
<p>The iPhone 17 series is set to introduce a new model, the iPhone 17 Air, which may outshine the iPhone 17 Pro in several aspects.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The iPhone 17 series will feature four models, replacing the Plus with the Air variant.</li>
  <li>The iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be the thinnest iPhone ever, potentially beating the iPhone 6's thickness.</li>
  <li>While the iPhone 17 Pro maintains similar dimensions to the previous model, the Air will showcase a unique design.</li>
  <li>The iPhone 17 Pro will retain a 6.9-inch display, while the Air will have a 6.6-inch display, catering to those seeking a middle ground.</li>
  <li>Rumours suggest the iPhone 17 Air will be priced similarly to the iPhone 16 Plus, making it more budget-friendly compared to the Pro variant.</li>
  <li>Key differences in network technology: the Pro will use Qualcomm's modem, whereas the Air will feature Apple's new in-house modem.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The iPhone 17 Pro will definitely come with a higher price tag compared to the iPhone 17 Air."</blockquote>

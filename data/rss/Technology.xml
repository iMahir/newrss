<h2>What Are Today’s Quordle Hints?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Word 1 (top left) hint — operated a car</li>
    <li>Word 2 (top right) hint — one of a pair of poles that allow you to walk while you’re elevated from the ground</li>
    <li>Word 3 (bottom left) hint — a type of fabric often used for bed sheets</li>
    <li>Word 4 (bottom right) hint — a pro baseball player in San Francisco</li>
    <li>Two of the words each have a pair of repeated letters</li>
    <li>Today’s words start with D, S, L and G</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are Today’s Quordle Answers?</h2>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert!</strong> Today’s words are...</p>

</figure>
<p>The article discusses the changing landscape of Chinese flagship smartphones, emphasizing their increasing prices while maintaining high value and specifications, particularly in Western markets.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Oppo are making significant inroads in Western markets, including the UK and Australia.</li>
    <li>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra retails for £1,299, surpassing some of the most expensive models from established brands.</li>
    <li>Chinese manufacturers, previously focused on cheaper alternatives, are shifting toward offering high-end devices at competitive prices.</li>
    <li>Upcoming models are expected to carry even higher price tags, indicating a trend toward premium pricing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>The modus operandi for Chinese flagship challengers has changed: where previously these companies sought to offer comparable performance at cheaper prices, now they're focused on delivering better performance at bigger prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article concludes that consumers might want to secure a Chinese flagship phone soon, as the era of affordable high-end devices may soon be over.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Apple's AI service generated a false BBC news alert claiming that Luigi Mangione had shot himself(REUTERS)</figcaption>
<p>Apple is facing criticism after its AI service erroneously sent a fake news alert about Luigi Mangione, wrongly attributed to the BBC. The broadcasting service has filed a complaint regarding the incident.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The BBC claimed that Apple's AI-generated alert claiming Mangione had shot himself was false.</li>
    <li>Luigi Mangione is currently in custody in Pennsylvania, awaiting extradition, and did not harm himself.</li>
    <li>The alert misrepresented a story involving Mangione, who is accused of a murder linked to the United Healthcare CEO.</li>
    <li>The BBC emphasized the importance of trust in their reporting and has raised concerns with Apple.</li>
    <li>This incident follows previous misrepresentations by Apple’s AI service, including a false alert about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“BBC News is the most trusted news media in the world,” a BBC spokesperson stated, stressing the need for trust in information published in their name.</blockquote>
<p>This incident highlights the challenges and responsibilities faced by tech companies in managing AI-generated news and its implications for factual accuracy.]]></description>

<figcaption>GTA 6 will be an extraordinary game worth waiting for</figcaption>
<p>Rockstar Games' parent company, Take Two Interactive, has provided an update on the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, claiming it will be "extraordinary" and worth the wait.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Take Two's CEO, Strauss Zelnick, praises GTA 6 as "extraordinary" and hints that it will exceed expectations.</li>
    <li>The game is set to launch next year with hopes of a trailer dropping by the year's end.</li>
    <li>GTA 6 will take place in a fictional state called Leonida, inspired by Florida, featuring areas reminiscent of Vice City.</li>
    <li>Recent updates to Rockstar's YouTube playlist have sparked speculation about a potential new trailer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I think it'll be extraordinary and worth waiting for... You thought you were anticipating this thing but this is way bigger and way better," - Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take Two.</blockquote>
<p>While the lack of a recent trailer is disappointing, the excitement surrounding GTA 6's development suggests a promising future for this blockbuster title, set to launch in less than a year.</p>]]></description>

<p>OpenAI has announced the rollout of “Projects” for ChatGPT, a new feature designed to help users better organize their work, as part of its ongoing ‘shipmas’ celebrations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Projects will be accessible from the left sidebar of ChatGPT.</li>
    <li>Users can customize project titles and icons, add files, and provide instructions for the AI.</li>
    <li>The feature allows users to import previous chats into ongoing projects.</li>
    <li>Creating a project involves clicking the + button and naming the project.</li>
    <li>Projects will utilize GPT-40 as the default model.</li>
    <li>The feature is currently available for Plus, Pro, and Teams users, and will expand to Enterprise and Education users in early 2025.</li>
    <li>Free users will receive access “as soon as possible.”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"OpenAI employees shared examples of using ChatGPT’s new Projects feature to plan a Secret Santa gift exchange and keep track of home maintenance."</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the introduction of ChatGPT Projects aims to enhance user experience by simplifying the organization of tasks and integrating chat history into project management.</p>]]></description>

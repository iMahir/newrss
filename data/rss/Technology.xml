<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not specified | <strong>Source:</strong> Company Business News</p>
<p>The math at the heart of venture capital is out of whack, with successful exits becoming extremely rare.</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful exits for founders and early investors are increasingly scarce.</li>
<li>Challenges for startups to go public contribute to this downturn.</li>
<li>The current regulatory climate is unfavorable for large mergers and acquisitions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Successful exits, the transactions that let founders and early investors cash out with significant gains, have become vanishingly few and far between."</blockquote>
<p>In light of these challenges, the venture capital industry needs to rethink its strategies to adapt.</p>]]></description>

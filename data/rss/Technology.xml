            <description><![CDATA[<h1>2024's Best Games Capture the Spirit of the '90s</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> The Verge</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3840x2160/2400x1350/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25658702/ss_527790d51f418e98fb04819221a348103c85a69b.jpg" alt="A screenshot from Metaphor: ReFantazio"><figcaption>Image: Atlus</figcaption>
<p>In 2024, gaming saw a revival with titles such as <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>, and <em>Balatro</em> harkening back to the gaming innovations of the late '90s. These games succeeded by merging nostalgic formats with modern gaming trends, indicating potential paths for revitalizing the industry amidst recent struggles.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Classic genres were reimagined with fresh mechanics, leading to critical acclaim and commercial success.</li>
  <li>Capcom excelled with a mix of heavy hitters and indie-style games, proving that both can coexist profitably.</li>
  <li><em>Balatro</em> simplified roguelike systems by incorporating the universally familiar game of poker, broadening its appeal.</li>
  <li><em>Astro Bot</em> celebrated nostalgia with a mascot platforming experience reminiscent of early Sony titles.</li>
  <li>The success of these games suggests a shift in industry focus toward unique experiences over costly mega-projects.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“If the big publishers want to staunch the bleeding of the last two miserable years, they could take the lessons Capcom, <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Metaphor</em>, and <em>Astro Bot</em> provide.”</blockquote>
<p>The return to classic gaming formats and innovative gameplay not only appeals to nostalgia but also highlights a viable business strategy for developers in a changing market.</p>]]></description>

<p>The European Union is set to implement a directive mandating the use of USB-C charging ports for most electronic devices starting December 28, 2024. This directive aims to reduce e-waste and standardize charging solutions, improving consumer convenience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The directive encompasses a wide range of devices including smartphones, tablets, and headphones.</li>
  <li>Companies must ensure products sold in the EU are capable of charging via USB-C or risk being pulled from the market.</li>
  <li>Regulations will also cover fast charging practices and encourage unbundling chargers from devices, reducing excess waste.</li>
  <li>Exceptions apply to laptops and certain devices, with phased compliance timelines.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The sheer breadth of this directive means its impact will be felt by both consumers and businesses."</blockquote>
<p>As the EU enforces this directive, it could lead to significant industry changes, pushing for more sustainable practices and simplified charging solutions across the technology landscape.</p>

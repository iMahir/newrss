<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 7, 2025<br><strong>Source:</strong> Wccftech</p>
<img src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-06_13-10-00-728x410.png" alt="AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT & RX 9070 GPU"/>
<figcaption>AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT & RX 9070 GPU Pre-Orders Expected To Start On 23rd January</figcaption>
<p>AMD's upcoming Radeon RX 9070 XT aims to revolutionize the mainstream GPU market with exceptional price-to-performance characteristics. Despite not presenting detailed specs at CES 2025, rumors and insider statements suggest a strong competitive stance against NVIDIA's offerings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The RX 9070 XT will feature a Navi 48 die, utilizing 16 GB GDDR6 memory.</li>
  <li>Power consumption is set at 330W, with boost clocks around 3060 MHz.</li>
  <li>AMD shifts focus from high-end market competition to value-driven performance.</li>
  <li>The GPU has performed well in early benchmarks, rivaling NVIDIA's 70 and 80-class GPUs.</li>
  <li>Pre-orders for the RX 9070 XT begin on January 23rd, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"AMD has managed to keep details under wraps for its RDNA 4 SKUs, which is why we are currently unaware of the extensive specifications of the Radeon RX 9070 XT. However, most of the important details have surfaced."</blockquote>
<p>This shift in AMD’s strategy could transform the gaming experience, especially for 2K and 4K gaming scenarios. The company aims to price the RX 9070 XT between $600 and $800, competing directly with NVIDIA's offerings.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Apple's M4-powered MacBook Air may launch sooner than expected</h1>
<p><strong>Published On:</strong> Dec 24, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Published By:</strong> Nandini Yadav</p>
<p>Apple’s M4 chips are powering high-performance devices, and the anticipated MacBook Air with M4 is speculated to launch ahead of the iPhone SE 4.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mark Gurman from Bloomberg hints that the MacBook Air M4 could be released earlier than the iPhone SE 4, scheduled for Spring 2025.</li>
  <li>The new MacBook Air is expected to consist of a 13-inch and a 15-inch model with minor design updates and the M4 chip.</li>
  <li>Apple's accidental confirmation of new MacBook Air models in a macOS update suggests they are coming in 2025.</li>
  <li>There are rumors of performance improvements and potential upgrades like a Center Stage camera.</li>
  <li>The M4 chip shows a 25% performance boost over the M3 chip according to Geekbench results.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Apple could possibly start selling the laptop in the first quarter of 2025.”</blockquote>
<p>The MacBook Air powered by M4 chip may signal a shift in Apple's usual product launch schedule, potentially announced through a press release rather than an event.</p>]]></description>

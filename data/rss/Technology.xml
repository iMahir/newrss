<p>There has been a mild decline in the use of US dollars for trade finance in the Asia Pacific region, with demand for local currency financing increasing to fill the gap, according to a senior banker at JPMorgan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Currency trends show a decrease in US dollar usage in trade finance.</li>
  <li>Local currency financing is on the rise to bridge the gap.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Currency trends have been very interesting over the last few years, specifically in trade finance, where the bank has observed a mild decrease in US dollar usage, Charley Zhang, head of trade and working capital, APAC at JPMorgan, said in a virtual interview.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Apple’s iPhone could copy from Samsung for a change</h1> <p><strong>Published on:</strong> January 1st, 2025 at 13:15 UTC+01:00 <strong>Source:</strong> Sammobile</p> <img src="https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Galaxy-S23-FE-review-camera-640x360.jpg" alt="Galaxy S23 FE review camera" width="640" height="360" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"> <figcaption>Samsung Galaxy S23 FE</figcaption> <p>Apple fans have long accused Samsung of copying their favorite brand, but now it seems the tables are turning. Rumors suggest that Apple is developing an affordable iPhone, the iPhone 16E, inspired by Samsung's FE series.</p> <h2>Key Points</h2> <ol> <li>The iPhone 16E is rumored to have specs more suitable for its price range but may also feature the Action Button, currently limited to Apple's flagship iPhones.</li> <li>Samsung's FE series has seen success with devices like the Galaxy S23 FE, Galaxy Buds FE, and Galaxy Tab S9 FE and S9+ FE.</li> <li>Apple's iPhone SE lineup has laid the groundwork for catering to a more price-conscious segment.</li> </ol> <blockquote><p>“That's the formula that Samsung has perfected with its FE series... It's now realizing that growth is slowing down in the premium segment, so more value must be derived elsewhere through providing the right mix of functionality and affordability.”</p> <footer><cite>Sammobile</cite></footer> </blockquote> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Apple's rumored move to introduce an affordable iPhone inspired by Samsung's FE series suggests a shift in strategy to cater to a broader range of customers.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 <strong>Source:</strong> NASA News</p>
<img src='image-url.jpg' alt='Mars Chopper rendering'>
<figcaption>NASA's new Mars Chopper design rendering.</figcaption>
<p>Nasa has introduced a new helicopter design, the Mars Chopper, which is set to enhance Mars exploration after the success of its predecessor, Ingenuity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Mars Chopper is larger and equipped with six rotors, each with six smaller blades to increase lift.</li>
  <li>It has a payload capacity of 5 kg, enabling it to carry scientific instruments for detailed terrain analysis.</li>
  <li>The helicopter demonstrates capabilities to reach distances of up to three kilometers.</li>
  <li>It aims to assist in exploring areas that are inaccessible to rovers.</li>
  <li>Ingenuity performed 72 flights over three years, far exceeding its initial mission requirements.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Scientists could use Chopper to study large swaths of terrain in detail, quickly – including areas where rovers cannot safely travel.” - NASA</blockquote>
<p>The Mars Chopper's advanced design is expected to significantly contribute to future missions, providing vital aerial data for both robotic and potential human explorations.</p>]]></description>

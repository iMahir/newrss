            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The iPhone 17 Air Price Details Leaked</h1>
<p><strong>Published On:</strong> Jan 6, 2025<br><strong>Source:</strong> Aman Rashid</p>
<div><img fetchpriority="high" src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/iphone-17-air-concept-source-frontpagetech-012244196-16x9.png?VersionId=hTb600SmlpqZ9n1fRmiWsQNHW6XVr5YL&amp;size=690:388" width="690" alt="iPhone 17 Air Concept/ Source: FrontPageTech" title="iPhone 17 Air Concept/ Source: FrontPageTech" height="388">
<figcaption>iPhone 17 Air Concept/ Source: FrontPageTech</figcaption></div>
<p>Apple is gearing up to launch the iPhone 17 Air, touted to be the thinnest iPhone ever at just 6.25mm thick, featuring a 6.6-inch display and a single rear camera, targeting a similar price point to the iPhone 16 Plus.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be launched in September 2025.</li>
  <li>It may be about 20% thinner than the iPhone 16 models, and around 25% thinner than the Pro models.</li>
  <li>Pricing is expected to be around $899 in the USA, with similar pricing in the UK and India yet to be announced.</li>
  <li>It will feature Apple’s new A19 chip, Dynamic Island, and 8GB of RAM.</li>
  <li>The ultra-thin profile may lead to compromises like a smaller battery and reduced camera capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“A thinner phone often means a smaller battery, and with a single rear camera, photography enthusiasts might find themselves drawn to the Pro models instead.”</blockquote>
<p>The iPhone 17 Air promises an exciting design with its ultra-slim profile, appealing to users looking for a lightweight device, though it raises questions about the trade-offs in features.</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<blockquote>“Enhancing black expression” along with rejecting glare is the primary focus of Glare Free 2.0 technology.</blockquote>

<p>A new study highlights the mental health benefits of reducing screen time for children and adolescents, noting significant improvements in behaviour and social interactions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study involved 181 children and adolescents from 89 families and was published in JAMA Network Open.</li>
    <li>Participants who reduced their screen media use to three hours per week displayed fewer emotional difficulties and better social interactions.</li>
    <li>Excessive screen time has been linked to poorer mental health, prompting the need for screen time detoxification.</li>
    <li>Implementing simple strategies, like setting clear limits and encouraging offline activities, can help parents reduce their children's screen time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This study highlighted the profound impact even a short-term reduction in screen time can have on children’s mental health."</blockquote>
<p>Reducing screen time can significantly enhance children's emotional stability and social skills, paving the way for a healthier family dynamic. Parents are encouraged to take steps toward limiting screen usage in their homes for the overall well-being of their children.</p>]]></description>

<p>The confusion around Microsoft updates continues as the company warns 400 million users that they risk losing future security fixes if they update their PCs. This announcement comes alongside the release of the last Patch Tuesday of 2024.</p>
<ul>
    <li>400 million Windows users are at risk of losing support for future updates if they upgrade their machines.</li>
    <li>Microsoft recently softened its stance on Windows 11 compatibility, reportedly allowing updates on incompatible PCs.</li>
    <li>The conflicting messages from Microsoft contribute to user confusion regarding Windows 10's impending end of support.</li>
    <li>Media outlets have misreported Microsoft's policy changes, suggesting that older PCs can run Windows 11 without restrictions.</li>
    <li>Microsoft has clarified that it is not lowering the system requirements for Windows 11.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Windows 11 minimum system requirements remain unchanged." - Microsoft Support</blockquote>
<p>The situation underscores the importance of clear communication from Microsoft, especially as users near the deadline for Windows 10 support. A unified guide is needed to help users navigate their options effectively.</p>]]></description>

    <li>Sutskever accepted a "Test Of Time" award for his influential 2014 paper.</li>
    <li>He emphasized that the era of scaling data through pre-training is nearing its limits.</li>
    <li>Innovation in AI must come from generating new data or evaluating multiple answers for better accuracy.</li>
    <li>Predicted that AI will one day exhibit human-like reasoning, understanding, and self-awareness.</li>
    <li>Noted that increased reasoning capabilities may lead to more unpredictable AI outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The more it reasons, the more unpredictable it becomes," Sutskever said.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as AI technology advances with reasoning capabilities, it is expected to evolve into a form that is significantly different from what we currently understand, leading to both opportunities and challenges in predictability.</p>]]></description>

<p>OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever shared his insights at the annual AI conference NeurIPS, discussing the future implications of superintelligent AI, which he predicts will differ fundamentally from current AI systems.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sutskever predicts superintelligent AI will surpass human capabilities and possess a qualitatively different nature.</li>
    <li>He describes superintelligent systems as "agentic" and capable of reasoning, making them more unpredictable.</li>
    <li>Sutskever expresses that these AIs may seek rights and aim to coexist peacefully with humans.</li>
    <li>After leaving OpenAI, Sutskever founded Safe Superintelligence (SSI), which focuses on AI safety and raised $1 billion in funding.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“[Superintelligent] systems are actually going to be agentic in a real way... They’ll understand things from limited data.” - Ilya Sutskever</blockquote>
<p>The discussion led by Sutskever emphasizes the need to consider the responsibilities and potential rights of future AI systems as they evolve.]]></description>

<h1>NBFCs turn to other avenues as bank credit slows on repeated RBI warnings</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Mint</p>
<p>India’s non-bank financiers are shifting their borrowing strategies in response to Reserve Bank of India's warnings, moving towards market borrowings and other alternatives rather than relying exclusively on bank loans.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Non-bank financiers are diversifying their borrowing profiles as bank credit slows.</li>
    <li>RBI's warnings about the interconnectedness between banks and NBFCs contributed to this shift.</li>
    <li>The share of bank credit in total debt for top NBFCs has significantly decreased in July-September FY25 compared to prior periods.</li>
    <li>Alternative borrowing sources include overseas borrowing, securitization, and asset sales.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Top NBFCs have seen the share of bank credit in their total debt fall significantly in July-September FY25.”</blockquote>
<p>This trend reflects a growing caution among NBFCs as they adapt to a changing regulatory environment and seek to enhance their financial resilience.</p>

<figcaption>Luigi Mangione is accused of murdering healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson</figcaption>
<p>The BBC has raised concerns with Apple over a false headline generated by the tech company's new AI feature regarding a murder case in the US. The AI incorrectly suggested that Luigi Mangione had shot himself, which he did not.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The BBC's complaint follows the release of Apple's AI-powered notification feature in the UK.</li>
    <li>The incorrect notification suggested Mangione shot himself, despite him being arrested for the murder of Brian Thompson.</li>
    <li>A BBC spokesperson indicated they contacted Apple to address the issue.</li>
    <li>Apple has not commented publicly on the complaint.</li>
    <li>Similar misrepresentations occurred with notifications from the New York Times.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"BBC News is the most trusted news media in the world... it is essential to us that our audiences can trust any information or journalism published in our name." - BBC spokesperson</blockquote>
<p>While Apple's new feature aims to streamline notifications, it raises concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated summaries. Experts warn of the danger of spreading misinformation with such technology.</p>]]></description>

<p>A mountain of hydrogen is lurking beneath Earth's surface — and scientists say that just a fraction of it could break our dependence on fossil fuels for 200 years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Earth may contain approximately 6.2 trillion tons of hydrogen in rocks and underground reservoirs, 26 times the known amount of oil left.</li>
    <li>Accessing most of these reserves may be impractical due to depth, location, and size.</li>
    <li>Just 2% of the hydrogen could supply all necessary hydrogen for net-zero carbon emissions for a couple hundred years.</li>
    <li>The energy from this hydrogen is double that of all known natural gas reserves on Earth.</li>
    <li>Researchers used a model considering hydrogen production rates and trapping mechanisms to estimate the hydrogen present.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen is produced through chemical reactions in rocks and could significantly contribute to future energy supply needs.</li>
</ul>

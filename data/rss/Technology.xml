</figure>
<p>Shipments of foreign-branded smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone, to China fell 47.4% in November, continuing a decline from October. Apple's market share shrinks amid economic slowdown and fierce competition from Huawei, which saw a 42% sales increase. Overall phone shipments in China also dropped by 5.1% year-on-year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Foreign smartphone shipments decreased to 3.04 million units from 5.769 million units year-on-year.</li>
  <li>The drop follows a 44.25% decline in October.</li>
  <li>Apple faces competition from local players like Huawei.</li>
  <li>Consumer prices in China fell to their lowest in five months.</li>
  <li>In response to declining market share, Apple cut prices by up to 500 yuan on flagship models.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Overall phone shipments in China fell 5.1% year-on-year in November to 29.61 million handsets."</blockquote>
<p>This slump highlights the increasing difficulty foreign brands face in competing within the Chinese market amid rising local competition.</p>]]></description>

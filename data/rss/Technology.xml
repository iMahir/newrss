<figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At CES 2025, LG has unveiled its new four-stack OLED technology, which promises to significantly enhance TV brightness and color accuracy compared to previous models. The G5 OLED offers 40% higher brightness than its predecessor, the G4, positioning it as a leading competitor in the premium TV market.</p>
<ul>
  <li>LG has transitioned from its Micro Lens Array (MLA) panel technology to a four-stack OLED design.</li>
  <li>The new panel architecture allows for increased brightness and improved color accuracy.</li>
  <li>Panasonic is adopting similar technology, with a focus on performance improvements.</li>
  <li>LG’s G5 OLED is expected to achieve over 2,000 nits of brightness.</li>
  <li>Energy consumption for the new 65-inch G5 is rated at 164W, significantly lower than the G4's 209W.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>"I’ve often come across LG OLEDs that exhibit a subtle pink- or green-colored tint... This does not seem to be the case with the G5 after initial viewing." <cite>Michael Desjardin</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The advancements in LG’s OLED technology not only highlight improvements in display performance but also mark a competitive shift in the industry landscape.</p>]]></description>

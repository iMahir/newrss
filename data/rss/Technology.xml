<p>The Pixel Camera app has long been considered one of the best camera apps on the market. However, users seeking alternatives may find several other camera apps that offer different features and controls.</p>
<ul>

  <li><strong>GCam:</strong> An unofficial port of the Pixel Camera app offering better photo quality but requiring sideloading and device-specific versions.</li>
  <li><strong>ZeroCam:</strong> Focuses on minimal processing but has a subscription model and struggles in mixed lighting conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>ProShot:</strong> A paid app with a DSLR-like interface, offering a rich set of features including RAW capture and 4K video support.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“That’s it for my look at the best alternatives to the Pixel Camera app. Did we miss any picks?”</blockquote>
<p>In summary, while the Pixel Camera remains a top choice, various alternatives cater to different photography needs and preferences.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Roborock's new vac features a mechanical arm to clean away any debris in its path. Tara Brown/CNET</figcaption>
<p>Roborock has introduced its latest robot vacuum, the Saros Z70, which boasts a unique mechanical arm capable of picking up small items while cleaning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Saros Z70 features the OmniGrip, a five-axis robotic arm that can lift objects up to 10.5 ounces.</li>
  <li>The vacuum also has advanced navigation with next-gen sensors and AI-powered object recognition.</li>
  <li>Initial demos showed some mechanical glitches, but Roborock assures that these issues have been addressed for retail versions.</li>
  <li>The vacuum can detect and avoid up to 108 different obstacles during cleaning cycles.</li>
  <li>Safety features include a child lock and a safety stop button to prevent accidental grabs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Instead of using a traditional LDS (LIDAR) tower module for navigation, the system integrates next-gen dual-light 3D time-of-flight sensors and RGB cameras powered by AI to determine its position, surroundings and whether the object it grips is overweight." - Roborock</blockquote>
<p>The Roborock Saros Z70 not only innovates with its mechanical arm but also maintains strong vacuuming capabilities with 22,000 Pa of suction power and an anti-tangle system.</p>]]></description>

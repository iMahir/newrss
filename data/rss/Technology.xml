<figcaption>FILE PHOTO: Apple has temporarily paused its AI news summary feature after multiple complaints of inaccurate headlines. | Photo Credit: Reuters</figcaption>
<p>Apple has temporarily paused its AI news summary feature after multiple complaints of inaccurate headlines, deactivating it on iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3 betas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pause was prompted by complaints from BBC and other news outlets regarding false reports.</li>
<li>In December, a false notification claimed that a suspect charged with the death of a CEO shot himself.</li>
<li>In November, a notification incorrectly stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been arrested.</li>
<li>Recent summaries involving WSJ journalist notifications were also inaccurate.</li>
<li>Apple plans to improve and reintroduce the feature in the future, alongside an updated notification style.</li>
<li>Users will have more control over these notifications, including the ability to toggle them directly from the lock screen.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"Apple plans to improve the feature and then release it again in the future."</blockquote>
<p>The temporary suspension reflects Apple's commitment to accuracy and user control in news reporting features.</p>]]></description>

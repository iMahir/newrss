<figcaption>The Galaxy S25 series is launching in around one month from now</figcaption>
<p>With the launch of the Galaxy S25 series expected next month, speculation around its pricing has emerged, hinting at no shock price increases in Europe.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Galaxy S25 in Sweden is expected to remain at 11,490 kroner, the same as the S24.</li>
<li>Galaxy S25 Ultra might retail for 1449 euros in Germany, with the entry-level model priced at 899 euros.</li>
<li>Samsung is planning to provide significant upgrades in features and internal specs while keeping prices stable.</li>
<li>There could be a price increase in Asian and Middle Eastern markets due to rising manufacturing costs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Samsung’s price decision in Asia and the Middle East might not be that exciting, and the chances of the Galaxy S25 prices getting a hike is quite high.”</blockquote>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is anticipated to offer substantial enhancements at relatively stable prices, appealing to buyers after previous flagship releases.</p>]]></description>

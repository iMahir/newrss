<figcaption>New Dell rebranding image inspired by Apple-like strategies.</figcaption>
<p>Dell Technologies Inc. is rebranding its PCs to challenge the stagnation in sales and appeal to modern consumers by simplifying product names akin to Apple.</p>

  <li>The new naming strategy will include three tiers: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max.</li>
  <li>Executives acknowledge the similarities to Apple's marketing naming conventions.</li>
  <li>AI-optimized systems and the end of support for Windows 10 are expected to drive new purchases.</li>

<p>The Samsung QN90F mini-LED, showcasing an impressive 115-inch display, is turning heads at CES 2025. However, it is not the largest mini-LED TV at the event, with the Hisense 116-inch model taking that title.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Samsung QN90F is a successor to the highly regarded QN90D model, known for its performance in sports and gaming.</li>
<li>The Hisense 116” model features groundbreaking specs including a new RGB mini-LED backlight design and 10,000 nits brightness.</li>
<li>Both TVs emphasize superior viewing experiences with advanced technologies for brightness and glare reduction.</li>
<li>Pricing could be a significant factor, with Samsung typically positioned at a higher cost than competitors like Hisense.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>With the addition of Glare Free tech to the new model, it should be a fantastic choice for viewing sports in bright rooms.</blockquote>
<p>Choosing between these two impressive mini-LED TVs will be challenging, as ultra-big-screen TV buyers seek the best value and performance features.</p>]]></description>

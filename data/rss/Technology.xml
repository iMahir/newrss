<p>A new study highlights the mental health benefits of reducing screen time for children and adolescents, noting significant improvements in behaviour and social interactions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study involved 181 children and adolescents from 89 families and was published in JAMA Network Open.</li>
    <li>Participants who reduced their screen media use to three hours per week displayed fewer emotional difficulties and better social interactions.</li>
    <li>Excessive screen time has been linked to poorer mental health, prompting the need for screen time detoxification.</li>
    <li>Implementing simple strategies, like setting clear limits and encouraging offline activities, can help parents reduce their children's screen time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"This study highlighted the profound impact even a short-term reduction in screen time can have on children’s mental health."</blockquote>
<p>Reducing screen time can significantly enhance children's emotional stability and social skills, paving the way for a healthier family dynamic. Parents are encouraged to take steps toward limiting screen usage in their homes for the overall well-being of their children.</p>]]></description>

<p>Former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever predicts that advancements in AI reasoning will lead to less predictable technology. His insights were shared at the NeurIPS conference, where he discussed the future of superintelligent machines.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sutskever accepted a "Test Of Time" award for his influential 2014 paper.</li>
    <li>He emphasized that the era of scaling data through pre-training is nearing its limits.</li>
    <li>Innovation in AI must come from generating new data or evaluating multiple answers for better accuracy.</li>
    <li>Predicted that AI will one day exhibit human-like reasoning, understanding, and self-awareness.</li>
    <li>Noted that increased reasoning capabilities may lead to more unpredictable AI outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The more it reasons, the more unpredictable it becomes," Sutskever said.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as AI technology advances with reasoning capabilities, it is expected to evolve into a form that is significantly different from what we currently understand, leading to both opportunities and challenges in predictability.</p>]]></description>

<h1>NBFCs turn to other avenues as bank credit slows on repeated RBI warnings</h1>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Mint</p>
<p>India’s non-bank financiers are shifting their borrowing strategies in response to Reserve Bank of India's warnings, moving towards market borrowings and other alternatives rather than relying exclusively on bank loans.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Non-bank financiers are diversifying their borrowing profiles as bank credit slows.</li>
    <li>RBI's warnings about the interconnectedness between banks and NBFCs contributed to this shift.</li>
    <li>The share of bank credit in total debt for top NBFCs has significantly decreased in July-September FY25 compared to prior periods.</li>
    <li>Alternative borrowing sources include overseas borrowing, securitization, and asset sales.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Top NBFCs have seen the share of bank credit in their total debt fall significantly in July-September FY25.”</blockquote>
<p>This trend reflects a growing caution among NBFCs as they adapt to a changing regulatory environment and seek to enhance their financial resilience.</p>

<figcaption>Luigi Mangione is accused of murdering healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson</figcaption>
<p>The BBC has raised concerns with Apple over a false headline generated by the tech company's new AI feature regarding a murder case in the US. The AI incorrectly suggested that Luigi Mangione had shot himself, which he did not.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The BBC's complaint follows the release of Apple's AI-powered notification feature in the UK.</li>
    <li>The incorrect notification suggested Mangione shot himself, despite him being arrested for the murder of Brian Thompson.</li>
    <li>A BBC spokesperson indicated they contacted Apple to address the issue.</li>
    <li>Apple has not commented publicly on the complaint.</li>
    <li>Similar misrepresentations occurred with notifications from the New York Times.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"BBC News is the most trusted news media in the world... it is essential to us that our audiences can trust any information or journalism published in our name." - BBC spokesperson</blockquote>
<p>While Apple's new feature aims to streamline notifications, it raises concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated summaries. Experts warn of the danger of spreading misinformation with such technology.</p>]]></description>

<p>A mountain of hydrogen is lurking beneath Earth's surface — and scientists say that just a fraction of it could break our dependence on fossil fuels for 200 years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Earth may contain approximately 6.2 trillion tons of hydrogen in rocks and underground reservoirs, 26 times the known amount of oil left.</li>
    <li>Accessing most of these reserves may be impractical due to depth, location, and size.</li>
    <li>Just 2% of the hydrogen could supply all necessary hydrogen for net-zero carbon emissions for a couple hundred years.</li>
    <li>The energy from this hydrogen is double that of all known natural gas reserves on Earth.</li>
    <li>Researchers used a model considering hydrogen production rates and trapping mechanisms to estimate the hydrogen present.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen is produced through chemical reactions in rocks and could significantly contribute to future energy supply needs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"I was surprised that the results were larger than I thought going in. The takeaway is that there is a lot down there." - Geoffrey Ellis, USGS</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while the potential for harnessing hydrogen from underground reservoirs is significant, the exact locations and accessibility of these hydrogen deposits remain uncertain. Ongoing research aims to pinpoint geological criteria for these accumulations.</p>]]></description>

<p>On Wednesday, a video of an AI-generated gymnast by OpenAI’s Sora went viral, revealing serious flaws in AI video generation capabilities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The video features a gymnast with absurd, morphing features, including sprouting extra limbs and losing her head.</li>
    <li>Venture capitalist Deedy Das highlighted gymnastics as a challenging benchmark for AI's understanding of movement.</li>
    <li>Despite improvements in Sora's performance, the AI still produces nonsensical outputs when given complex prompts.</li>
    <li>The current limitations are partly due to insufficient training data and the AI's lack of understanding of physics.</li>
    <li>As AI video technology progresses, it's expected that coherence and realism will improve.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"As cool as the new Sora is, gymnastics is still very much the Turing test for AI video." - Deedy Das</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the absurdities displayed in Sora's gymnastics video underscore the ongoing challenges in AI video generation, indicating that much work remains before these models can produce credible outputs.]]></description>

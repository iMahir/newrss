  <p id="FeE7Mk">General Motors and EV charging company EVgo <a href="https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/topic/us/en/2024/dec/1204-evgo.html">announced</a> that they’ve installed their 2,000th public EV charging stall, in Murrieta, California. With that, GM has met a deadline it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242068/gm-energy-evgo-ev-dc-fast-charging-network-flagship-locations">set in September</a> to have the bulk of its planned 2,850 DC fast-charging stalls set up by the end of this year. </p>
<p id="LVCUuR">GM says the new station, which is near Interstate 215 in Riverside County, serves five 350kW fast chargers for as many as 10 EVs simultaneously. It doesn’t mention whether these are strictly CCS chargers or if they include Tesla’s NACS ports, which have emerged as the de facto standard over the last year and a half. We’ve asked GM for more information and will update if it responds.</p>

<p id="9kkmcB">EVgo president Dennis Kish said that its relationship with GM has helped his company “bring public charging to communities in more than 30 states across the US,” and that the company is working toward deploying its “first flagship destinations next year.” </p>
<p id="aTKQqc"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242068/gm-energy-evgo-ev-dc-fast-charging-network-flagship-locations">GM said back in September</a> that this network, which is distinct from another planned 2,000-strong network of DC fast chargers at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988171/gm-ev-charging-station-progress-pilot-evgo">Flying J and Pilot truck stops</a>, will include 400 “flagship” gas station-style charging locations. Those will be built out in major metropolitan areas of states like Florida, California, Texas, and Michigan, the company said today. That’s all in addition to <em>another</em> EV charging network consortium <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176160/ionna-ev-charging-dc-fast-headquarters-network">called Ionna</a> that GM is participating in along with car companies like Hyundai, Kia, BMW, and Stellantis.</p>

  <p id="hV6sk7">Tesla is again issuing a physical recall of its Cybertruck. This time it’s recalling 11,688 of its electric pickups due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180519/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-windshield-wiper-issue">a faulty windshield wiper</a> that could reduce visibility for the driver, and 11,383 Cybertrucks due to trim in the truck bed that could come loose and create a road hazard for others.</p>
<p id="s8Wn96">These new recalls follow a recall in April affecting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24134753/tesla-recall-cybertruck-faulty-accelerator-pedal-nhtsa-defect">3,878 Cybertrucks over the risk of a jammed accelerator pedal</a>. </p>
<p id="ilC4jb">Issues with the gigantic wiper had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180519/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-windshield-wiper-issue">surfaced in owner forums</a> in recent weeks and reportedly delayed Cybertruck deliveries on short notice. <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK/PU%25252FCC/AWD#recalls">The NHTSA recall notice</a> for the wiper says that “excessive electrical current can cause the front windshield wiper motor controller to fail.” Tesla service will replace the wiper motor,...</p>

  <p id="PTOiYM">Uber’s freight hauling business will use Aurora’s driverless trucks on routes between Dallas and Houston as part of a new “long-term” deal that builds on a <a href="https://www.uberfreight.com/blog/uber-freight-and-aurora-expand-pilot-in-texas-with-veritiv/">three-year-old commercial pilot</a>. </p>
<p id="xz24H3">Uber Freight will be one of Aurora’s first customers on the Texas route launching later this year. Launched in 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20856812/uber-freight-200-million-expansion-chicago-headquarters">Uber Freight</a> connects truck drivers with shippers, much in the same way the company’s ridehailing app pairs drivers with those looking for a ride. </p>
<p id="mYUyXX">Aurora, which was founded by former executives from Google, Uber, and Tesla, has said it plans to deploy 20 fully autonomous trucks this year. When it does, those trucks will be hauling goods for Uber Freight customers. </p>

  <p id="ImhDP4">Spotify has officially shut down its Car Thing accessory that offered simple and slick control over music and playlists while driving, and it’s giving owners just over a month (January 14th) to reach out to the company and get a refund. The device started to display its final words early today as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/comments/1haaywe/car_thing_is_officially_dead/">enthusiasts mourn the loss of the device on its dedicated subreddit</a>.</p>
<p id="wX4GQD">The final message on the Car Thing reads:</p>
<blockquote><p id="9KzaF9">Car Thing is discontinued and no longer operational. Thank you for being on this journey with us, safe travels. For more information, visit <a href="http://carthing.com">carthing.com</a>. Contact customer service by no later than January 14th, 2025 to discuss your refund options.</p></blockquote>
<p id="QVqfJZ">Spotify <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163383/spotify-car-thing-discontinued-december-2024">announced in May</a> that it intended the already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280357/spotify-stops-manufacturing-car-thing-q2-2022-earnings">discontinued</a> devices would shut down in December, and now they have. The company also said, eventually, that it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168081/spotify-car-thing-end-of-life-customer-refund">work to issue refunds</a>, but owners need to contact the company and provide proof of purchase to receive compensation.</p>
<p id="UfEAiC">For most users, the Spotify Car Thing is just another piece of e-waste humans will have to deal with later. The company recommends resetting it to factory settings and “safely disposing of your device following local electronic waste guidelines.”</p>
<p id="rUkIOf">However, tinkerers are finding new uses for the hardware: Car Thing can be hacked to run custom software that doesn’t require Spotify’s backend. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/09/spotify-officially-kills-car-thing-remaining-units-no-longer-work/">As <em>9to5Google</em> notes</a>, it’s a bit underpowered to run full-on Android, but some projects like “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeskThing/">Desk Thing</a>” can repurpose them as a controller at your computer desk.</p>

The discount is essentially an advancement of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691597/ev-tax-credit-eligible-vehicles-battery-irs-china">federal tax incentive for previously owned vehicles</a>, but it lets customers reap the benefit immediately rather than waiting for tax refunds the following year.</p>
<p id="uDhN67">You will still need to file your taxes correctly using IRS Form 8936, and you have to agree to transfer the credit to Carvana once you do file. So, while it’s not making tax season any easier, Carvana is offering a lower cost of entry to buy an electric vehicle, which could help push customers interested in EVs to take the leap.</p>
<p id="ekWPLK">You can now take advantage of the offer on Carvana’s app or website by searching for EVs or plug-in...</p>

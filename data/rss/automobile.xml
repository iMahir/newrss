  <p id="wnZdOg">Waymo is making the moves on Magic City. </p>
<p id="iCmjze">Alphabet’s robotaxi service said it would launch in Miami in 2026. The company has been testing its autonomous vehicles in the Florida city on-and-off <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2019/08/rain-testing-in-sunshine-state/">since 2019</a>, and more recently has begun to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/waymos-self-driving-cars-on-miami-streets-as-company-tests-its-technology/">lay the groundwork in earnest</a>. </p>
<p id="9Eoi2Q">Waymo plans to start “reacquainting” its autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to Miami’s streets in 2025. And in 2026, it expects to start making its vehicles available to riders through its Waymo One ridehail app. </p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="KA5P68"><q>Waymo plans to start “reacquainting” its autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to Miami’s streets in 2025</q></aside></div>
<p id="0sRasM">The vehicles will be maintained by a company called <a href="https://www.moove.io/">Moove</a>, which provides fleet services, as well as a range of financial products for mobility companies. The African company (it has several offices in Nigeria) is backed by Uber and was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/uber-leads-100m-investment-in-african-mobility-fintech-moove-as-valuation-hits-750m/">valued at $750 million</a>. </p>
<p id="CVW6oY">Moove will start out by taking over Waymo’s fleet management operations in Phoenix. That includes cleaning the vehicles, charging them, and making sure that the sensors are calibrated and unobstructed. </p>
<p id="3UDMF4">Waymo’s robotaxi business is slowly growing. It currently operates fleets of driverless cars in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Phoenix. It also plans to launch a robotaxi service in Atlanta in an exclusive partnership with Uber. Waymo said recently it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283127/waymo-now-does-150000-paid-trips-per-week">crossed the threshold of providing 150,000 paid trips per week</a>. </p>
<p id="KlVMti">Miami once played host to Ford-backed ArgoAI’s autonomous vehicle testing, but the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423998/argo-ai-shut-down-ford-vw-av-self-driving">company shut down</a> when Ford pulled its funding. </p>

  <p id="3xVktb">Rivian’s latest EV charging station is the first to be open to other companies’ vehicles. </p>
<p id="a2BGcx">The new station located in California’s Joshua Tree National Park will be the companies’ first that’s available to non-Rivian electric vehicles. The station features a new design, including larger displays with a tap-to-pay option, that can accommodate any car brands’ EVs.</p>
<p id="xLNhYf">Currently, the <a href="https://rivian.com/experience/charging">Rivian Adventure Network</a>, which comprises 560 chargers at 92 sites across the country, are exclusive to owners of the company’s R1T and R1S vehicles. This was a similar approach to Tesla, which initially built its own Supercharger network so it could offer exclusive charging to its own customers. </p>
<p id="IsvEXe">But with billions of dollars in federal funding at stake, automakers are now reassessing this exclusivity. One of the requirements for receiving federal funding for EV charging installation is that chargers need to be available to all EVs, not just a single brand. </p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="JZ91uk"><q> Rivian Adventure Network comprises 560 chargers at 92 sites across the country</q></aside></div>
<p id="FpZsFW">Tesla began <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23620368/tesla-supercharger-non-tesla-ev-payment-access-app">opening its network to non-Tesla EVs</a> in 2023. Soon after, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453587/tesla-connector-north-american-standard-ccs-combo">it open-sourced its charging plug</a>, renaming it the North American Charging Standard (NACS), and began making a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755184/tesla-ev-charging-standard-nacs-ccs-gm-ford">series of deals</a> with the rest of the auto industry (including Rivian) to use it for their EVs. </p>
<p id="mFkvTg">Rivian’s EV chargers use the standard CCS connector for DC fast charging. But the stations are still exclusive to Rivian vehicles thanks to proprietary software. With today’s announcement, the company is beginning the process of unwinding that exclusivity. </p>
<div id="BjVowe"><div data-anthem-component="gallery:12498553"></div></div>
<p id="R4wRj5">Rivian has also said that it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23766979/rivian-tesla-ev-charging-standard-nacs-r1t-r1s">adopt Tesla’s NACS charging standard</a>. Current Rivian customers can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104786/rivian-tesla-supercharger-access-adapter-free-r1t-r1s">buy an adapter</a> if they want to use the Supercharger network. In 2026, Rivian said it will begin producing vehicles with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093215/rivian-r2-revealed-ev-suv-price-specs-price">a native NACS port</a>.   </p>
<p id="U0Sgvw">Rivian spokesperson Evan Barbour said that the company’s future EV charging sites will also be open to non-Rivian EVs. Rivian plans to open additional charging sites in Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York before the end of 2024. </p>
<p id="T2LJxY">Meanwhile, current stations will be retrofitted with software updates to accommodate other brands, as well as hardware updates to add NACS charging plugs. In the meantime, the Joshua Tree location and others will be available to Tesla owners with NACS-to-CCS adapters. </p>
<p id="G497sv">EV ownership is currently a tangle of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23797527/ev-charging-ccs-nacs-tesla-adapter-guide">competing standards</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23308612/ev-charging-broken-unreliable-survey-jd-power">subpar software experiences</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312002/ev-plug-and-charge-universal-protocol-sae-pki-roaming">dueling payment apps</a>. And while some customers admit that the EV charging experience is slowly improving, this next phase of adapters and formerly proprietary chargers going universal has really only just begun. </p>

  <p id="BnhQQ2">Uber expanded its cohort of autonomous vehicle partners today with the addition of Avride, formerly known as Yandex Self-Driving Group. The companies signed a “multiyear” agreement in which Uber customers can take rides and accept takeout deliveries from Avride’s autonomous vehicles. </p>
<p id="cznlU1">Starting this week, Uber customers in Austin will see an option to receive Uber Eats deliveries from Avride’s six-wheeled sidewalk robots. That deal will expand to Dallas and Jersey City, New Jersey, later this year. And in 2025, Avride’s autonomous vehicles will be available to some Uber customers for rides in Dallas. The company also operates delivery robots in South Korea. </p>

  <p id="rnIcrn">Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is pressuring John Deere to update its manuals to better enable customers to repair their tractors. By omitting information about repair rights and pollution control systems, Warren alleges that John Deere could be in violation of the Clean Air Act. </p>

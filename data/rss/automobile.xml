  <p id="yAkAu5">Ford is releasing <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/09/26/new-version-of-bluecruise--smoother--more-natural-hands-free-hig.html">a new version of its hands-free driving BlueCruise software</a>, version 1.4, which it claims will let you keep your hands off the wheel twice as long. In fact, the company tells us it can now run on average five times longer compared to version 1.2 that rolled out last year, and double that of 1.3 which started rolling out more recently. The company doesn’t specify exactly how long, on average.</p>
<p id="cCpp77">The improvements come thanks to new “motion controller” software that Ford says keeps your BlueCruise-equipped vehicle better centered in its lane, as well as improvements in handling different weather conditions, tight curves, narrow lanes, and withstanding reflections from the sun. </p>

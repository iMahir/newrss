  <p id="ZamnkQ">Volkswagen has taken one of the final steps toward delivering the ID Buzz in the US, by <a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1812">announcing pricing, battery range, and initial options</a> available at launch later this year. The ID Buzz will start at $59,995 for a Pro S model that comes standard with RWD and, crucially, seven seats, as it’s the bigger long wheelbase version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155355/vw-id-buzz-us-trim-powertrain-details-launch-first-edition">previously confirmed</a> for the American market.</p>
<p id="LfTBTM">The 2025 ID Buzz now has a finalized EPA-estimated range of 234 miles for RWD models and 231 miles on the 4Motion AWD ones — well under some expected guesses of 300 or so miles on a single charge for a vehicle that has a sizeable 91kWh battery.</p>

  <p id="r9tbXg">Different brands do different things under the hoods of their EVs. Some fill that space with inverters and high-voltage cabling. Others carve out a cubby of extra storage, the frunk that many EV aficionados demand but few actually use. </p>
<p id="9fFvd2">With the Gravity SUV, Lucid is taking the frunk option a step further, creating a space that can be used as a seat. I confess, I thought it was a gimmick, but sitting in that frunk is surprisingly comfortable. It’s a bit cozy for two adults, as I found when Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson joined me, but we fit just fine. </p>

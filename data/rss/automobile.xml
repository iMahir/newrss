  <p id="e4SmmE">Lime is testing <a href="https://www.li.me/blog/new-vehicle-pilot-limebike-and-limeglider-hit-the-streets-this-summer-in-select-cities">two new e-bikes</a> designed to make bike-sharing accessible to a wider range of riders. Alongside throttles that mean you don’t have to pedal to move, the LimeBike and the LimeGlider both offer 20-inch wheels with fat tires for better traction, step-through frames to make getting on and off easier, and lower centers of gravity for more stability. </p>
<p id="ylrt7o">The LimeBike is meant to “complement” the pedal-assist<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22878726/lime-ebike-specs-hands-on-micromobility-scooter">Gen4 e-bike that Lime launched in 2022</a>. It comes with pedals as well as a handlebar throttle, allowing riders to either pedal with electric assist or move with electric power only. Its seatpost has a quick-adjust clamp to make it easier to move up or down, among other improvements.</p>

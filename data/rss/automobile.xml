<p class="has-text-align-none">Somewhere between San Luis Obispo and Monterey, California, I wondered if the rain would ever cease. Pounding storms had followed me on my two-week solo road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco, so much so that the Pacific Coast Highway was closed to motorists through Big Sur — one of my planned pit stops. While I meticulously planned the drive and itinerary down to the hour, I never once considered a backup plan for something as common as a closed road. At a loss for what to do, I scrambled to find an Airbnb in a remote area for the night. I had unintentionally broken one of the top road trip rules, according to seasoned roadtripper and blogger <a href="https://southernersays.com/">Lori Blalock</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Having a plan B and C is a good idea,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For nearly as long as cars have been on the road, Americans have practiced the art of the road trip. In the 1910s and ’20s, motorists drove from cities to more remote areas to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-america-joined-its-two-great-loves-cars-and-the-outdoors">set up camp beside their cars</a>. After World War II, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/american-road-trip/">road trips were the family vacation of choice</a>, with many visiting national parks and extended family in other cities. The humble road trip has been immortalized in countless movies over the years including <em>National Lampoon’s Vacation</em>, <em>Lost in America, </em>and <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>. Hesitant to travel by plane during the pandemic, many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/travel/to-many-travelers-2020-was-the-summer-of-1965.html">Americans opted to adventure by car</a>. The love for the open road hasn’t let up in post-pandemic years either: A recent poll found that 73 percent of Americans <a href="https://swnsdigital.com/us/2024/04/why-3-in-4-prefer-road-trips-over-flying/">preferred to drive</a> to their vacation destination instead of flying.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While road trips allow travelers to avoid the hassle and expense of air travel, there are plenty of considerations roadtrippers should keep in mind. From planning a practical route to keeping the peace with your travel companions, road trip experts offer their best advice for planning a vacation on wheels.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be realistic when planning an itinerary</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blalock’s road trip planning begins first with a timeframe and then a list of sites and stops she wants to see — not the other way around. “A lot of people reverse that,” she says. “People know where they want to go, but then they don’t quite have the time, and then they end up having road trip failures, because where they want to go just does not fit into their timeframe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Map out your route based on the time you have and then determine your must-see sights and attractions, whether it’s a national park or a brewery. Estimate how long you’ll spend at each destination — be generous — to avoid rushing from one place to the next. Have an idea of what you might do instead if a trailhead is closed because of bad weather or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you only have three days earmarked to get from point A to point B and back, you don’t want to feel overwhelmed racing from one roadside attraction to the other. The trip should be just as much about the journey as the destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When planning itineraries for clients, Sam Highley, CEO and founder of road trip travel company <a href="https://www.allroadsnorth.com/">All Roads North</a>, focuses on the “in-between places”: off-the-beaten-path towns, restaurants, and parks. The routes themselves are on scenic backroads rather than highways. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t overlook lesser-known landmarks. “National parks are treasures in the US and they form a big part of our itineraries,” Highley says. “But I think there’s also a ton of other state parks, public land wilderness areas, that can be equally as beautiful and rewarding and you’re likely to be there with a tenth of the people that you might experience in a national park.”</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you need some inspiration for in-between places, check out tourism board websites for the various towns and cities you’ll be passing through, suggests Danielle Desir Corbett, the host of the podcasts <a href="https://roadtripreadypodcast.com/"><em>Road Trip Ready</em></a> and <a href="https://thoughtcard.com/podcast/"><em>The Thought Card</em></a>. She also discovers unique pitstop destinations from travel blogs, vlogs, and Instagram posts. As you’re planning, save Instagram posts to road trip inspiration folders or make Pinterest boards to organize your research, Desir Corbett says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Book your tickets and accommodation for popular locations ahead of time, such as camping at tourist-heavy national parks or Instagram-famous motels, Blalock says. As soon as you know which towns you want to spend the night in, book a hotel, Desir Corbett says. Similarly, secure tickets for can’t-miss museums, cooking classes, pick-your-own produce, and other experiences early. “It&#8217;s not something that you have to necessarily do months and months in advance,” Desir Corbett says. “It could be the week you’re planning everything out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leave room for spontaneity, too, Desir Corbett says. If you see a billboard for an interesting museum or farmers market while you’re driving, don’t be afraid to check it out. These unplanned excursions are part of the magic of road trips. When you stop for gas at welcome centers or rest stops, pick up pamphlets for local tourist attractions. Ask bartenders, employees at the front desk of hotels, or other locals you encounter for their recommendations, Desir Corbett says. “You could either fit it during this trip or just have it back in your back pocket for your next adventure,” she says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure your car is in top shape</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A perfectly planned itinerary is only as good as the car getting you there. A few weeks before you depart, take your car in for a regular maintenance check, says AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz. That way, you won’t be delayed if your car needs a repair that might take a few days. Make sure your tire pressure, car battery, oil levels, and windshield wipers are in working order. Try to fill up your gas tank or charge your car the night before you leave home and each subsequent night of the trip.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t forget to pack the essentials (like snacks)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aside from the clothes and other necessities you plan on bringing with you, there are a number of things you should have in your car to keep comfortable or in case of a breakdown. Diaz suggests having jumper cables, a flashlight, wet wipes or baby wipes, and a first aid kit on hand. Depending on the time of year, you might want to keep blankets or personal fans around. Have multiple chargers for your phone, tablet, or other devices in case you lose one or more than one person needs to charge up at a time. Blalock recommends packing a portable tire inflator and a kit for repairing a flat tire. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Desir Corbett and Highley suggest packing a cooler stocked with easy-to-eat, nonperishable meals, like sandwiches, yogurt pouches, granola bars, nuts, popcorn, and water — items that won’t melt or make a mess. Desir Corbett recommends bananas, grapes, cheese, and crackers for kid roadtrippers since they’re not too sugary or sticky.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take safety seriously</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While you may be motivated to barrel through an eight-hour drive, experts suggest taking a break or switching out drivers every two hours or so. “Drowsy driving, just like distracted driving, is a problem and can be very dangerous,” Diaz says. Try to depart in the morning on each day of your trip to maximize daylight driving. Either find a rest stop, fast food spot, or an interesting attraction to take a break and stretch your legs. If you have kids with you, expect to stop more frequently, Desir Corbett says. Try to find a park or a rest stop with a playground so they can burn off energy. And always keep your phone away and on do not disturb while you’re driving. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t annoy your travel companions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re traveling with kids, you’ll want to make sure they’re comfortable and entertained. In Desir Corbett’s experience traveling with a toddler, limited-mess snacks and drinks are a must, as is entertainment. “We’re not afraid to pull out our iPad, and we have some holders in the back of our car,” she says. “We may put on one of his favorite shows. We also try to put on his favorite music.” Make sure any devices are fully charged (and you have backup chargers handy) and download movies or shows in case you lose service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Diaz recommends playing games with kids, like imagining where the other cars on the road are heading. “Try to get their imagination going and engage with them,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the adults in the car, Blalock likes to assign roles to passengers to help keep the peace. Knowing who is in charge of navigation, music, snacks, and driving holds everyone accountable. Let passengers have some time to themselves if need be. For example, Blalock says her daughter occasionally pops in headphones and listens to her own music during their road trips.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keeping the car clean and organized can prevent fights, Blalock says. Have a bag for trash and organizational bins for other essentials, like camping supplies, food, and hygiene products.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of who you’re traveling with, road trips can be the perfect opportunity to choose your own adventure and uncover offbeat treasures along the way. Just make sure to do your homework first.</p>

  <p id="xhfeT0">Mitsubishi <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/240801-03-e">signed a memorandum of understanding</a> with Nissan and Honda to join their pre-existing partnership to jointly develop electric vehicles and other related tech. The hope is that by working together, the three Japanese automakers can catch up to their rivals in the race to introduce more technologically advanced vehicles in the future. </p>
<p id="eXsjQ6">It’s another example of big, global automakers pooling their resources in the interest of defraying costs and finding more efficient ways to introduce new EVs to the marketplace. The inclusion of Mitsubishi “will not only add new knowledge and strengths but will also provide further synergies that can only be generated by the three companies,” Nissan and Honda said in a statement. </p>

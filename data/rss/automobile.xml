The car, which looks more like a performance crossover like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126098/ford-mustang-mache-2024-model-updates-range-charging">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a>, is in many ways a total departure from the traditional stock car. Don’t expect the ABB NASCAR EV Prototype to replace the fuel-burning V8 anytime soon, though.</p>

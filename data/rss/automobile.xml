  <p id="OKewOc">Waymo just completed an <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2024/10/investing-to-bring-the-waymo-driver-to-more-riders/">oversubscribed funding round of $5.6 billion</a>, its largest investment round to date. The company said it will use the funds to support its robotaxi business in its current markets of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, as well as bring it to new cities, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243397/waymo-uber-austin-atlanta-robotaxi-partnership">Austin and Atlanta</a>, where its vehicles will be available exclusively on the Uber app. </p>
<p id="22oIBX">Waymo also hinted at future “business applications” for its “Waymo Driver,” which is the company’s branding for the hardware and software used to enable its vehicles to drive autonomously. This could be a reference to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334012/waymo-fca-ram-delivery-self-driving-van">food and package deliveries</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23809237/waymo-via-autonomous-truck-delay-timeline-layoffs">trucking</a>, or even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17412908/waymo-chrysler-pacifica-minvan-self-driving-fleet">personally owned autonomous vehicles</a> — all possibilities that Waymo has explored in the past. </p>

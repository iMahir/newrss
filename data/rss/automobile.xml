  <p id="B4aH4l">Toyota <a href="https://media.toyota.co.uk/world-premiere-of-the-all-new-toyota-urban-cruiser/">revealed its latest all-electric vehicle today</a> as the Urban Cruiser compact SUV. The EV, which will be fully revealed at the Brussels Motor Show next month, is intended for the European market, first coming to the UK in the third quarter of 2025. </p>
<p id="xPrnOI">Toyota says the wheelbase is only about 5 inches longer than the European-only Yaris Cross, making it another fun-sized electric EV slated for the continent like the recently revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312042/ford-puma-gen-e-europe-ev-specs-range">Ford Puma Gen-E</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187409/hyundai-inster-small-ev-compact-price-specs-us">Hyundai Inster</a>.</p>
<p id="9ylhPK">The Urban Cruiser has clear design inspiration from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988111/toyota-ev-concept-urban-suv-sport-crossover">last year's Urban SUV concept</a>. It also shares its new EV platform built in conjunction with Suzuki, which announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289169/suzuki-e-vitara-ev-electric-suv-toyota-launch">its made-in-India E Vitara SUV last month</a>. Toyota’s other EV, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180408/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-review-specs-price">the bZ4X</a>, also shares its EV platform with another automaker, Subaru, which has the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23042924/subaru-solterra-pricing-starting-ev-tax-incentives">Solterra EV</a>.</p>

<p id="8DUJ2y">Toyota’s Urban Cruiser has nearly match-for-match specs as the E Vitara, including a relatively small 49 kWh battery with an FWD drivetrain and a 61 kWh battery with an option for AWD. </p>
<p id="JR45LX">Toyota says power output can get as high as 135kW in the AWD version (with 40kW on the rear axel for “stable and secure performance on loose and slippery surfaces”) and up to 300 Nm of torque. While the official range is not announced, it’ll likely match the E Vitara’s expected 248 miles on a single charge.</p>
<div id="CEZ4HY"><div data-anthem-component="gallery:12505170"></div></div>
<p id="hAXHLP">Additionally, the Urban Cruiser has downhill assist and trail modes for added control, and the FWD model includes a snow mode. All models come with a heat pump and include the ability to manually start preconditioning the battery to prepare for a DC fast charging session.</p>
<p id="mIFvJM">Toyota has been slower in building and adopting EVs than other legacy manufacturers. The automaker has been focused on its outstanding hybrid technology as well as hydrogen vehicles. </p>
<p id="yoROb4">But the automaker isn’t done with EVs — it’s planning to have 15 EVs, including six models on a next-gen shared platform by 2026, and it just invested <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319893/toyota-sinks-more-money-into-its-kentucky-plant-where-its-making-a-new-three-row-ev">nearly another $1 billion in Kentucky</a> for a paint facility to prepare for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24063943/toyota-ev-investment-kentucky-factory-three-row-suv">a three-row electric SUV</a> for the US.</p>

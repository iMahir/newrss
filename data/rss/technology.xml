Delivery workers are seeing reduced incomes and job stability as consumer spending weakens. Workers now earn less despite longer hours and face increased risks from tight delivery deadlines, making it difficult to sustain livelihoods.]]></description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-food-delivery-industry-faces-downturn-workers-earnings-drop-by-1000-yuan/articleshow/114392615.cms</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-food-delivery-industry-faces-downturn-workers-earnings-drop-by-1000-yuan/articleshow/114392615.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 07:43:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[As Silicon Valley eyes US election, beware Elon Musk and the tech bros with political nous | John Naughton]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The owner of X is just one of many who may prefer Donald Trump to greater regulation under the Democrats</p><p>Way back in the 1960s “the personal is political” was a powerful slogan capturing the reality of power dynamics within marriages. Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that “the technological is political”, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/politics/video/elon-musk-trump-rally-butler-pa-digvid">recent appearance</a> of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump&nbsp;at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen <em><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/as-artemis-moves-forward-nasa-picks-spacex-to-land-next-americans-on-moon/">by N</a></em><em><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/as-artemis-moves-forward-nasa-picks-spacex-to-land-next-americans-on-moon/">asa</a></em> to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon.</p><p>There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to be because politics at the time wasn’t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Antitrust_Paradox">Robert Bork</a> and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School – the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google’s and Facebook’s services were “free”, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon’s products weren’t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors’ prices and pandering to customers’ need for next-day delivery. Again: where was the harm in that?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/as-silicon-valley-eyes-us-election-elon-musk-is-not-the-only-tech-bro-to-worry-about">Continue reading...</a>]]></description><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/as-silicon-valley-eyes-us-election-elon-musk-is-not-the-only-tech-bro-to-worry-about</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/as-silicon-valley-eyes-us-election-elon-musk-is-not-the-only-tech-bro-to-worry-about</guid><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 08:00:39 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

  <p id="7kq8Hu">Instead of hunting for a runway, researchers have built an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can land by crashing into trees or poles and wrapping its grippy wings around them to prevent a fall. It’s an unorthodox approach, but one that could make it easier to position surveillance or inspection equipment in hard to reach areas.</p>
<p id="xWEWyE">The UAV, which its designers from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) have called the PercHug, is yet another robot built to emulate a behavior seen in nature: bats and owls using their wings to both fly and climb or perch onto trees.</p>
<p id="XttEKd">The PercHug robot is designed with dual-purpose hinged wings that remain rigid and outstretched allowing the UAV to fly but...</p>

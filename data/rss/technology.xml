  <p id="gmjroU">Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri is acknowledging recent mistakes in Meta’s moderation processes on Threads and Instagram. For example, Meta unexpectedly deleted my account this week because it thought I was underage, the company locked my colleague’s account because she joked about dying in a heatwave, and others have seen their posts disappear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266096/instagram-threads-moderation-account-post-deleted-limited">with no clear reason why</a>. “Threads Moderation Failures” <a href="https://www.threads.net/search?q=Threads%20Moderation%20Failures">has been trending this week</a> — putting more pressure on Meta’s moderation processes. </p>

<p id="AaB8bf">Now Mosseri admits that Meta is having problems with those processes, and has publicly posted that acknowledgement on Threads. He explains there’s a “tool” that broke, which apparently did not show human reviewers “sufficient context” before they made posts...</p>

<p id="fzIFVD">Not into VR? It’s also a great time to pick up extra controllers, gaming headsets, and other PS5 accessories. Now until December 13th, Sony’s standard <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"><strong>DualSense Wireless Controller</strong></a> is on sale for as low as $54 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSenseTM-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CQKLS4RP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/pqqy8du894kfs">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5-midnight-black%2F-%2FA-83374958&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Target</a>, while the reflective “Chroma” variants can be had for $59. There aren’t many PS5 controllers we’d recommend over the DualSense, namely because most third-party options lack the adaptive triggers and haptic engine, which add real tension to mirror your in-game actions.</p>
<p id="dfK7iP">You can also pick up Pulse-branded headsets throughout the same period, including the <strong>Pulse Elite</strong>, which is down to an all-time low of $129.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/ckX7ZN0AZg2">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-PULSE-Elite-Wireless-Headset%2F5113175920&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fgaming-headsets%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fsony-pulse-elite-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-5%2F402800.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GameStop</a>.

You have to pay for all 12 months upfront, but that’s a great value for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146547/t-mobile-mint-mobile-acquisition-complete">T-Mobile-owned MVNO carrier</a>. Just bring your phone, drop in the SIM card (or activate via eSIM), and you can connect to the same 4G LTE and 5G towers that T-Mobile customers do. Just be mindful that you’ll be slowed after using 40GB of data each month, and your video streaming will be limited to 480p.</li>

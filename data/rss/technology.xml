The proposed regulation, which the agency <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-403520A1.pdf">announced on Thursday</a>, would require mobile providers to unlock consumers’ phones within 60 days of activation.</p>
<p id="hos6kJ">Under current regulations, consumers who want to unlock their phone — as in, freeing up a phone so it can move from one network to another — are at the mercy of their service provider. Per the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/cell-phone-unlocking">FCC</a>, consumers who want to unlock their device should contact their service provider to find out when and how their phone can be unlocked.

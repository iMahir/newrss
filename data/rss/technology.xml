  <p id="pTUFU3">Uber has signed up another robotaxi company to offer driverless rides inside its app. Starting sometime next year, for “qualifying” rides, Uber will give you the option to take the trip in one of Cruise’s autonomous vehicles. The two companies announced a “multiyear strategic partnership” <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2024/Uber-and-Cruise-to-Deploy-Autonomous-Vehicles-on-the-Uber-Platform/default.aspx">on Thursday</a>. </p>

It also offered driverless rides with Motional before Motional <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/motional-puts-robotaxi-deployment-back-burner-focus-technology-development-2024-05-07/">paused its robotaxi deployments in May</a>. The original date for Elon Musk’s event revealing Tesla’s robotaxi developments <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216148/the-tesla-robotaxi-day-that-wasnt">passed a couple of weeks ago</a>, but now it’s supposed to take place October 10th.</p>

  <p id="l5tIz2">Hardware enthusiast site AnandTech is shutting down after nearly three decades of covering computers. AnandTech’s final Editor-in-Chief, Ryan Smith, announced the news in <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell">a farewell post</a> this morning, writing, “...Few things last forever, and the market for written tech journalism is not what it once was — nor will it ever be again. So, the time has come for AnandTech to wrap up its work, and let the next generation of tech journalists take their place within the zeitgeist.”</p>
<p id="QcBt5a">AnandTech was founded in 1997 by Anand Lal Shimpi, who led the site until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/31/6091393/anandtech-founder-anand-shimpi-retires-from-journalism-to-join-apple">retiring from journalism in 2014 to work for Apple</a> as part of the team that delivered the M series Apple Silicon chips. Before leaving, Shimpi spoke with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/14/2560801/5-minutes-on-the-verge-anand-shimpi"><em>The Verge</em></a>  in 2011 about his...</p>

  <p id="uklLPx">TikTok is giving users a way to more precisely shape what kind of content they see on their feeds — or at least signal to the algorithm what they’re interested in.</p>
<p id="kzVcBr">Under <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/manage-topics">Content preferences &gt; Manage topics</a> (which can be found in “Settings and Privacy”), users can adjust sliders to signal they want more or less of certain topics in their For You Page. Topics include “creative arts,” “current affairs,” “humor” and more. Sliders are set to a default middle ground at first, and users can tweak it from there.</p>

  <p id="4uHUPV">For many a year, Windows users have been dragging their program windows over to the borders of the screen to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710511/windows-11-snap-layouts-how-to">snap them into position</a>, splitting the screen up evenly into halves or quarters. Now, with the rollout of macOS Sequoia, Mac users can do the same. You can get a Spotify playlist up alongside your email inbox, for example, or a report you’re writing up alongside the online articles you’re reporting on. It means less switching between windows and more information on the screen.</p>
<p id="SHDQnO">Once you’ve got macOS Sequoia installed on your Mac, you can take advantage of what Apple calls window tiling. There are several methods you can use.</p>
<h2 id="1eMYyd">Use the green button</h2>
<ul>

  <p id="JdxDCe">For the last eight months, David Cogen has been living a double life. By day: a YouTuber and creator, the face of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheUnlockr/videos">TheUnlockr</a>, reviewing phones and testing ebikes and explaining how food smokers really work. By night and morning and every single other available moment in between: a coffee shop entrepreneur, working to get a Brooklyn spot called Coffee Check up and running. The whole thing started late last year and escalated quickly.

  <p id="VdvvTl">Arlo is upgrading its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arlo-announces-secure-5-next-generation-of-smart-home-security-powered-by-arlo-intelligence-302256439.html">security cameras and video doorbells with additional AI capabilities</a>. The company is adding the ability for its cameras to recognize people and vehicles, and learn to detect custom objects or changes in the surroundings. While an Arlo camera can currently alert you when it spots a person or vehicle (as well as packages and animals), it can now be trained to tell you exactly who it sees and which vehicle. </p>
<p id="vyvV87">The new capabilities are part of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arlo-announces-secure-5-next-generation-of-smart-home-security-powered-by-arlo-intelligence-302256439.html">Arlo Secure 5</a>, a package of AI-powered features combined with machine learning. Secure 5 is available now to Arlo users in the US, Canada, and Asia-Pacific, with other regions coming soon, according to Ashton Good, senior director of marketing at Arlo.  </p>

  <p id="C04PJHEGR9D-1727197361.364879-thread-list-Thread_1727199025.096969">It’s time for another PlayStation State of Play livestream where Sony showcases its next big game and hardware announcements. Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24252281/sony-playstation-state-of-play-ps5-psvr-2-games">has promised</a> we’ll see “more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR2 games from studios around the world” during the 30-minute-plus presentation.</p>
<p id="9j5r1h">Sony announced <em>Astro Bot</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167370/astro-bot-ps5-sequel-trailer-date">during its May State of Play stream</a>, and the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">racked up “Game of the Year” nominations</a> once it launched earlier this month. Now, September’s showcase will try to present strong follow-ups that keep the momentum going.</p>
<p id="A1t77c">The new State of Play comes just two weeks after the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">announced a new beefed-up PS5 “Pro” model</a>, which will be open for preorder on September 26th.

  <p id="jP86zZ">Hardware leaks are common these days, but here’s an unusual one from Samsung: <a href="https://howl.me/cm96lOvptlJ">the Galaxy S24 FE preorder page</a> is live even though the phone hasn’t even been announced yet. <a href="https://x.com/rquandt/status/1838594337866740196">X user Roland Quandt</a> spotted the preorder page live on Samsung’s site. While it’s probably an error and we expect to see the page disappear soon, this seemingly confirms the S24 FE’s imminent launch — and a few high-level specs.</p>
<p id="Pr3bES">From the looks of it, the S24 FE (that’s <em>Fan Edition</em>, for the uninitiated) will cost $649.99 with 128GB of storage, with a 256GB version available for $709.99. That’s a slight price bump over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23950799/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-review-screen-camera-battery-price">the S23 FE</a>, which started at $599. A slide in an image carousel on the page seems to confirm similar camera specs to last year, including a 50-megapixel...</p>

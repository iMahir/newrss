  <p id="sC3H9A">Two years before German air taxi manufacturer Lilium promised to deliver its first two aircraft to customers, the air taxi pioneer has run out of money and will imminently stop making them. <a href="https://investors.lilium.com/node/10441/html">In a filing to the US SEC</a>, Lilium says it cannot acquire the funding to continue operations in its subsidiaries (Lilium GmbH and Lilium eAircraft GmbH), and is going into insolvency. We’ve been covering the company continually since 2017, when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/20/15369850/lilium-jet-flying-car-first-flight-vtol-aviation-munich">successfully took its first flight</a> in Germany.</p>
<p id="AGZB5C">Lilium had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YieG1Z6nMeA">previously confirmed</a> it had begun assembling its first two all-electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft in Germany, while working towards certification from the EASA and FAA, but its first customer deliveries weren’t slated until 2026....</p>

  <p id="Go63wj">Apple might be updating several Macs with M4 chips <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24266448/apple-mac-announcements-october-2024">as early as next week</a>, but it’s looking like the MacBook Air lineup might not join the party <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277876/apple-m4-macbook-air-update">until early 2025</a>. That said, if you’re on an older MacBook and can’t wait to upgrade, there have been few better times than now. The base <strong>13-inch M2 MacBook Air</strong> with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage has fallen to an all-time low of $699.9 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B3C7MJX3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, while the step-up 512GB model is down to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B3C5H787?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$949.99</a> ($249 off) thanks to an on-page coupon. You can even grab the <strong>M3 MacBook Air 13</strong> at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a> starting at $899 ($200 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low.</p>

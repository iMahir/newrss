  <p id="t5QvCI">Xbox cofounder J Allard joined Amazon last month as a vice president on the company’s devices and services team. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Allard confirmed his new role but says it’s “too early to have anything to say” about what he’ll be working on at Amazon beyond “new ideas.”</p>
<p id="aIe8Uy">Allard will report to former Windows and Surface chief Panos Panay at Amazon, according <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-microsoft-xbox-leader-j-allard-joins-amazon-in-latest-surprise-career-twist/">to <em>GeekWire</em></a>. Panay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892462/amazon-hires-panos-panay-microsoft">left Microsoft</a> last year after being at the software giant for almost 20 years. Allard spent more than 20 years at Microsoft, cofounding the Xbox division, launching Microsoft’s Xbox Live network, and developing the Xbox 360 console. Allard also oversaw the development of the Zune, Microsoft’s iPod competitor.</p>

  <p id="m7AbFf">Amazon just announced a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablets-gen-ai-hd-entertainment">new Fire HD 8 tablet</a>, and like many new gadgets in 2024, generative AI-powered tools are among the big new features. But you won’t necessarily need to buy the new Fire HD 8 to try them; Amazon says they’re coming to the Fire HD 10 and Fire Max 11 tablets, too.</p>
<p id="wmZl1T">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_WZaFWzmQk">new AI tools</a> are things you’ve probably seen before. There’s a writing assist feature, which will help you polish up your writing and is built into the device’s keyboard. You’ll be able to get webpage summaries when using Amazon’s Silk browser. And you’ll be able to create a wallpaper from a prompt. Amazon says the tools will start rolling out to “all compatible Fire tablets later this month.”</p>

  <p id="RITCc2">iFixit now sells genuine Xbox parts you can use to repair your Xbox Series X or S and offers official guides to help with fixes.

  <p id="9MWLQH">If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/23313529/apple-airpods-4-noise-cancellation-price-features">new AirPods 4</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236804/airpods-max-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date">AirPods Max</a> are just starting to receive discounts, for instance, while both the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features">second-</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features">third-gen AirPods</a> can often be found at a steep discount. The same goes for the original Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><div id="FtAh67"><div data-anthem-component="aside:11906226"></div></div></div>
<p id="2Ywi2P">Here, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including the second-gen and third-gen AirPods, both iterations of the AirPods 4, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review">latest AirPods Pro with USB-C</a>, and the last-gen AirPods Max. </p>
<div><aside id="9jF4AW"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'></div></aside></div>
<h2 id="ej2msf">The best AirPods (second-gen) deals</h2>
<div id="upOxaE"><div data-anthem-component="productcard:12147763"></div></div>
<p id="eg29V6">Before they were discontinued alongside the AirPods 4 announcement, the second-gen AirPods were Apple’s entry-level earbuds. Despite being released in 2019, they still offer terrific wireless performance, great ease of use, and reliable battery life, making them a solid pick if you can live without a wireless charging case or some of the more advanced software features afforded by Apple’s newer H2 chip.</p>
<p id="h8mHSN">The second-gen AirPods originally launched for $159; however, Apple eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733184/apple-second-generation-airpods-wired-charging-case-price-cut-129">lowered their list price</a> to $129, and we now often see them on sale for far less. Right now, for instance, you can buy them for $89 ($49 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Walmart</a>, which is $20 more than their all-time low.</p>
<h4 id="4mc9Pf">

<h2 id="eG2fnz">The best AirPods (third-gen) deals</h2>
<div id="mhoBWc"><div data-anthem-component="productcard:12375658"></div></div>
<div id="odwqvs"><div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'></div></div>
<p id="ri9LM8">With support for the company’s MagSafe charger and an asking price of $179, Apple’s third-gen AirPods were once considered the middle child in the AirPods lineup. The shorter stems made for a more subtle design, too, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for head-tracking spatial audio, and improved battery life rendered them a nice upgrade over their predecessor. </p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="RzidsV"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"All the news from Apple’s ‘week’ of Mac announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24279307/apple-mac-m4-updates-news-announcements"}]}'></div></aside></div>
<p id="MJ29Rx">However, the AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation have since replaced the third-gen AirPods in Apple’s lineup. The new earbuds run $129 and $179, respectively, with the step-up model offering a few perks once reserved for the Pro models, including ANC, a helpful transparency mode, and a case with a built-in speaker. You can also squeeze the stem to control media playback — a feature also available on the entry-level AirPods 4.</p>
<p id="orderTotalOutput">We recently saw the third-gen AirPods with a Lightning charging case drop to $94 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-3rd-Generation%2F5527780373%2F&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Walmart</a>. However, the best deal you can get right now is only available at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.costco.com/apple-airpods-3rd-generation-with-magsafe-charging-case.product.100806298.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Costco</a>, where members can buy them with a MagSafe charging case for $129.99 ($40 off). That said, it’s worth noting that you can buy the AirPods 4 at Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$119</a>, which is a far better deal.</p>

<p id="2GeIQP">During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239739/apple-iphone-16-event-announcements-watch-series-10-airpods">Apple’s “It’s Glowtime” event</a> in September, the company introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two flavors: a $129 standard model and a noise-canceling version for $179. Both models represent significant upgrades over the second-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which better isolates your voice so that you can more clearly be heard in noisy environments. </p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="L8Gwaz"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What’s really different about the AirPods 4 models?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260385/whats-really-different-about-the-airpods-4-models"},{"title":"The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone"}]}'></div></aside></div>
<p id="r0td1H">For $50 extra, you can also buy the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, which offer ANC, a helpful transparency mode, and several more Pro-like features. Admittedly, the latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but Apple’s newest pair of wireless earbuds still do a good job of reducing sound. They also offer other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s highest-end earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app. </p>
<p id="XaR39J">Although they just launched, we’re already starting to see slight discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, Amazon is offering the standard AirPods 4 for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$119 ($10 off)</a> and the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$164.99 ($15 off)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Iewbkw">The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals</h2>
<div id="PDko4O"><div data-anthem-component="productcard:12375646"></div></div>
<p id="Zaa6jO">In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed them up last year with a minor refresh, one that features a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review">USB-C charging case</a> and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple’s new Vision Pro headset</a> and now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242929/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aids-fda-authorization">double as FDA-approved hearing aids</a>.</p>

You can also buy them at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a> for the same price, though they’re temporarily unavailable and Amazon hasn’t provided a shipping estimate.</p>

<div id="E5cMsS"><div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"></div></div>
<p id="FlijvB">The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones">best noise-canceling headphones</a> for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.</p>

<p id="irGZgJ">At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24242378/airpods-max-usb-c-unchanged-missing-features">new model</a> that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options.

  <p id="HUb5Az">Owners of Pixel 6-series, 7-series and Pixel Fold phones can look forward to a couple extra years of OS upgrades than initially expected, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mishaal_rahman/post/DDNLshVRhr_?xmt=AQGziWqbxwO4PZax4szvOsv47sH6UwtZT_Wqm2yYWJOfmA">as discovered by Android expert Mishaal Rahman</a> and <a href="https://x.com/madebygoogle/status/1864794840673980452">confirmed by Google on X</a>. When they were introduced, Google originally promised three years of OS upgrades and five years of security patches for each device, starting from the time they went on sale. But a quiet update to <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#zippy=%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold">a support page</a> confirms that these phones will get two additional OS upgrades, giving them a full five years of OS and security support that “may also include new and upgraded features with Pixel Drops.” That, my friends, rules.</p>
<p id="HSCGgB">Google’s three-and-five policy wasn’t <em>bad, </em>but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/6/23861563/google-pixel-8-pro-rumors-android-os-software-support">wasn’t the best either</a> — after the Pixel 6 arrived in 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22923577/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-android-upgrades-4-years">Samsung did one better</a> by offering four years of OS updates for the Galaxy S22. Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23904092/google-pixel-update-seven-years-editorial">got its act together</a> with the Pixel 8, announcing a class-leading seven years of OS and security update support. Which is great! But you wouldn’t blame a Pixel 6 or 7 owner for feeling like they were unfairly left behind. Google seems to be making up some of the shortfall by offering these additional OS upgrades, and it’s a welcome change.</p>

<p id="GiB1Rs">Of course, an ‘OS update’ isn’t quite what it used to be — for better and worse. Google is emphasizing pushing out more updates across older versions of Android through its Play framework. That’s a great thing, but it does mean that the yearly OS upgrade <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/13/23720419/android-14-google-io-keynote-announcements">isn’t quite as important as it once was</a>. The company can also gate certain features to pricier or more recent models, as it has with <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/night-sight-video/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Night Sight Video</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/19/pixel-8-pro-google-photos-zoom-enhance/">Zoom Enhance</a>. Google’s mention of new features via Pixel Drops for the next couple of years is promising, though.</p>
<p id="uLjoY0">Going by Google’s original schedule, the Pixel 6 should have gotten its last OS platform upgrade with this year’s Android 15. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/19/pixel-6-android-16-dp1/">Inquiring minds wondered if something was up</a> when the Pixel 6 series was deemed eligible for the Android 16 beta, and now we know: Pixel 6 phones are on track to get Android 16 <em>and</em> 17 when they become available. Not too shabby.</p>

  <p id="a6zPMY">Google is making it easier to switch off personalized search results thanks to an option that sometimes appears at the bottom of the results page, <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-results-are-personalized-try-without-personalization-38520.html">as reported by <em>Search Engine Roundtable</em></a>. After searching for something, scroll all the way down and look for a link to “Try without personalization.” Click or tap that and Google will load a new page without personalized results.</p>
<p id="IRyJaR">The link might not be present for you in all searches. Some results for me include a message at the end of the results page that already says “Results are not personalized.” This might be user error — maybe I have other settings that prevent it from appearing or am not using the right queries. But I did get the option to turn off personalized results much more often for searches on my iPhone than on my Mac, for some reason. </p>
<p id="bRL3Fb">“This change makes it easier for people to get an accurate understanding of whether their results have been personalized, while also providing them with the opportunity to explore non-personalized results,” spokesperson Ned Adriance says in a statement. “We also make it easy for people to adjust their personalization settings at any time.” Adriance adds that “while we previously showed this information in About this result on individual results, this display is more accessible and clear.”</p>
<p id="cD2OoF">Adriance also says that the link “gives people the option to temporarily view results that aren’t personalized” — so note that if you tap the link to try results without personalization, you’re not <em>permanently</em> changing your personalization settings.</p>
<p id="de5Ohv">You have already been able to get unpersonalized search results for a very long time; as <em>Search Engine Roundtable</em> reported <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/archives/013989.html">in 2007</a>, you can see unpersonalized results by appending a parameter, “&amp;pws=0,” to the end of a Google search URL. You can also turn off personalized search from your Google account settings. </p>

  <p id="Gnpo1U">Following news that foreign hackers may <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313187/encrypted-apps-salt-typhoon-hack-telecom-fbi-cisa">still be in US telecom networks</a>, the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/rosenworcel-proposed-requiring-telecom-carriers-secure-their-networks">proposed a new rule</a> that would require telecom companies to secure their networks from “unlawful access or interception of communications.” It would also force providers to submit an annual certification to the FCC stating they have implemented a plan to counter cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p id="IfuC2b">On Wednesday, US officials recommended Americans use encrypted apps to make phone calls and texts in response to the ongoing infiltration of telecom networks linked to the Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon. Deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger confirmed that at least eight telecom providers have been impacted by the hack, as <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/white-house-salt-typhoon-hacked-telcos-in-dozens-of-countries/">reported by <em>Bleeping Computer</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="OrNs2U">“We cannot say with certainty that the adversary has been evicted because we still don’t know the scope of what they’re doing,” Neuberger said during a press briefing, <em>Bleeping Computer</em> reports. Neuberger added that the attack has been going on for “likely one to two years” but doesn’t “believe any classified communications has been compromised.”</p>

<p id="fPoOoj"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em> </em>reported in October that Chinese hackers had broken into AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen’s networks and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/chinese-hackers-targeted-phones-of-trump-vance-and-harris-campaign-e04abbdf">even targeted members</a> of President-Elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaigns. In a letter on Wednesday, Senators Eric Schmitt (R-MO) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2024/12/senators-call-investigation-dods-comms-following-chinese-telecom-breach/401431/">urged Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch</a> to investigate the DOD’s “failure to secure its unclassified telephone communications from foreign espionage.”</p>
<p id="JueOlF">If the FCC’s proposed rule is adopted, it will go into effect immediately.</p>
<p id="iqjxbO">“While the Commission’s counterparts in the intelligence community are determining the scope and impact of the Salt Typhoon attack, we need to put in place a modern framework to help companies secure their networks and better prevent and respond to cyberattacks in the future,” FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in the press release. </p>

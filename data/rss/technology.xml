  <p id="oMc1yc">What’s next after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">PS5 Pro</a>? A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/">report from <em>Reuters</em></a><em> </em>focuses on Sony’s plans beyond this fall’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">new $700 system</a>, saying that the battle to win a contract for the chip powering a future PlayStation 6 came down to AMD vs. Intel, with others like Broadcom eliminated earlier, with AMD eventually winning out. </p>
<p id="fj0Lm7">According to <em>Reuters</em>, since AMD makes the chip in the PS5 and PS5 Pro, maintaining backwards compatibility in a possible move was part of “months” of discussions in 2022 between executives and engineers at Sony and Intel. However, Intel’s bid was blocked because they couldn’t agree on how much profit Intel would make from each chip it would design as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) handled the manufacturing process.</p>

  <p id="bjavGm">Google appears to be working on a way to finally synchronize notifications across devices in its ecosystem, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sync-notifications-android-devices-leak-3481920/">according to <em>Android Authority</em></a><em>’</em>s Mishaal Rahman, who discovered code references to a new “sync across devices” option in the Android 15 beta.</p>
<p id="w9s4p1">The snippet is apparently located under the Notifications section of Settings, nestled between “sensitive notifications” and a new “notification cooldown” option he <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/notification-cooldown-android-15-qpr1-3481384/">spotted last week</a>. There’s no Android notification syncing feature at the moment, as Rahman notes. So if you dismiss a notification on your Android tablet, the same notification will still greet you over on your phone later. This would, I’m sure, be a welcome change for most.</p>

  <p id="M5GbcW">After years of being on the fringes of home automation, LG is now making a big play in the smart home. It has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230692/lg-thinq-on-smart-home-hub-ai-voice-assistant">shiny new multi-protocol hub</a>, is opening its <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.lg.com/us/lg-thinq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ThinQ platform</a> to work with more smart home devices, and will soon allow other platforms to integrate its appliances into their ecosystems. </p>
<p id="myQI4m">ThinQ’s shift from being solely an app to control LG appliances and electronics to becoming a competitor to smart home platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23743633/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-how-to">Samsung’s SmartThings</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23751656/apple-home-smart-devices-gadgets-homepod-mini">Apple Home</a> has been spurred by the standardization of smart home connectivity through initiatives like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23751656/apple-home-smart-devices-gadgets-homepod-mini">Thread</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer">Matter</a> and the rapid development of artificial intelligence. </p>

  <p id="swbrsy">All the new iPhone 16 models unveiled this week can reportedly charge more than 50 percent faster through a wired USB-C connection than the previous series. That’s according to a <a href="https://weibo.com/2430711645/5077721141739882">Chinese certification posted on Weibo</a> indicating that Apple’s latest iPhones can support up to 45W of wired fast charging.</p>
<p id="3jsjje">The certification from the China Quality Certification Centre regulatory body, also posted to <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1834056001873699062">X by user ShrimpApplePro,</a> shows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237940/iphone-16-hands-on-pictures-price-features-apple">all of the new iPhone 16 models</a> were tested at 5-15 volts and 3 amps, which equates to a 45W maximum. The iPhone 15 lineup maxed out at 29W. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/11/iphone-16-wired-fast-charging/">As noted by <em>9To5Mac</em></a>, it’s not unusual for Apple to neglect announcements around wired charging. </p>
<p id="u4BlqI">The 45W max of the iPhone 16 easily bests the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24232480/google-pixel-9-review-screen-camera-battery">Google Pixel 9’s 27W capabilities...</a></p>

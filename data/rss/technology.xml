  <p id="OcEc4N">Meta is adding conversational voices by celebrities to its AI chatbot in Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. </p>
<p id="SxlkrZ">The company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/metas-ai-product-news-connect/">announced</a> at its Connect event today that you can now talk to Meta AI and hear it respond in one of several voices, including celebrity soundalikes such as Awkwafina, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Bell, and the only one I truly care about: Dame Judi Dench.</p>

And if you prefer a voice that is a little more mundane, you can also pick from non-celeb voices with names like “Aspen,” “Atlas,” or “Clover.” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219553/google-gemini-live-voice-chat-mode">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24220378/openai-advanced-voice-mode-uncanny-valley">OpenAI</a> also now offer similar conversational...</p>

  <p id="FkIxHE">If you think avoiding AI-generated images is difficult as it is, Facebook and Instagram are now going to put them directly into your feeds. At the Meta Connect event on Wednesday, the company announced that it’s testing a new feature that creates AI-generated content for you “based on your interests or current trends” — including some that incorporate your face.</p>
<p id="DxA2kf">When you come across an “Imagined for You” image in your feed, you’ll see options to share the image or generate a new picture in real time. One example (embedded below) shows several AI-generated images of “an enchanted realm, where magic fills the air.” But others could contain your face... which I’d imagine will be a bit creepy to stumble upon as you scroll.</p>

  <p id="0J2eHP">Just two months after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204055/meta-ai-llama-3-1-open-source-assistant-openai-chatgpt">releasing its last big AI model</a>, Meta is back with a major update: its first open-source model capable of processing both images and text.</p>
<p id="whhlAj">The new model, Llama 3.2, could allow developers to create more advanced AI applications, like augmented reality apps that provide real-time understanding of video, visual search engines that sort images based on content, or document analysis that summarizes long chunks of text for you.</p>
<p id="EV21Qi">Meta says it’s going to be easy for developers to get the new model up and running. Developers will have to do little except add this “new multimodality and be able to show Llama images and have it communicate,” Ahmad Al-Dahle, vice president of generative AI at Meta, told <em>The Verge.</em></p>

  <p id="5w9au6">Meta is discontinuing the Quest Pro, its high-end VR headset launched in 2022 that we said “isn’t very good.” The company plans to sell its remaining Quest Pro headsets through the end of the year or “until they’re gone, whichever comes first,” <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Fquest%2Fmeta-quest-3s-announced-connect-2024&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F9%2F25%2F24253322%2Fmeta-quest-pro-2-discontinued-vr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">according to a blog post</a>. </p>
<p id="EFJTfh">Meta’s post didn’t specify why it’s moving on from the Quest Pro so soon, but it’s clear the headset wasn’t well received. My colleague Adi Robertson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451629/meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-horizon-review">rated the headset a 4</a>, finding that the device was heavy and uncomfortable and that its professional-focused Workrooms experience was “basically a matter of luck.”</p>

<p id="vajYjt">At launch, the Quest Pro was also jaw-droppingly expensive at $1,499. Meta permanently dropped the price to $999 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/3/23622975/meta-quest-pro-2-price-cuts">just months after launch</a>, but that was still a...</p>

But now that the specs are official, I can tell you that it’s a lot closer to the Quest 3 than expected for a refresh that’s almost half the price. If you don’t have a Quest headset already, the 3S is potentially a very compelling purchase.</p>
<p id="BUNsjN">The Quest 3S offers the same mixed reality features and performance as the Quest 3 — it even has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip — meaning you can play all of the same games and experiences on either device. The Quest 3S uses the same Touch Plus controllers as the Quest 3. And the Quest 3S is actually rated for a higher...</p>

  <p id="7H7XnE">Osom Products Inc. — the mobile phone company founded by former employees of Essential, which shut down after releasing a single phone — is reportedly shutting down this week, having released a single phone. </p>
<p id="vBpk31">The news comes shortly after Osom’s former chief privacy officer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24233005/essential-phone-osom-products-ceo-lawsuit-personal-spending-lamborghinis-racing-mortgage">sued the company</a>, claiming that it’s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/osom-privacy-lawsuit-3477182/">out of money</a> after its CEO used business funds to pay for personal trips and exotic cars.</p>
<p id="cinBfK">During an internal meeting on Tuesday, Osom executives announced their decision to shutter the company, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/osom-shut-down-3478302/">according to multiple sources</a> who spoke to <em>Android Authority</em>. The report claims that most of the company’s employees will be laid off on Friday but will receive severance pay and be eligible for continued healthcare.</p>

  <p id="diNXCF">Sony has started celebrating 30 years of PlayStation and seems to have confirmed a PS5 Pro design leak in the process.

  <p id="FvadzO">Google officials had concerns about potential human rights violations that might be linked to its $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government before ever even signing the deal, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/technology/google-israel-contract-project-nimbus.html">documents first reported on by <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> today</a>.</p>
<p id="mrlNzJ">“Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations, including Israeli activity in the West Bank,” Google lawyers, members of the company’s policy team, and outside consultants wrote in the documents prepared for executives and reviewed by the <em>Times</em>. The documents date to several months before Google announced the deal in May 2021 and show that the company was worried about whether the contract might be bad for its reputation.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="z6JZ9U"><q>“Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations”</q></aside></div>
<p id="sjEdNP">The company has staunchly defended the deal since inking it in 2021, going so far as to fire dozens of employees who protested the contract they believed might involve them in violence against Palestinians. Now, it seems Google was weighing those risks, too — but ultimately decided to move forward with the deal anyway. </p>
<p id="lTQs6c">Dubbed Project Nimbus, the contract gives the Israeli government access to cloud services from Google and Amazon. Project Nimbus enabled the use of AI tools to analyze and identify objects in images and videos, according to the <em>Times</em>. It also included videoconferencing and “services to store and analyze large amounts of data.”</p>
<p id="Th1X2j">The most profitable part of the deal was $525 million from Israel’s Ministry of Defense expected between 2021 and 2028, the <em>Times</em> reports. That’s not a huge sum for Google, which reportedly made $258 billion in sales in 2021. But it was enough to give the company some clout with other potential military and intelligence customers.   </p>
<p id="1sq27k">Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>. But in April, it said in an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid">emailed statement</a> that “the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” A Google spokesperson provided a similar statement to the <em>Times.</em></p>
<p id="A9Qbcl">However, separate Israeli government contract documents recently <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/12/02/google-project-nimbus-ai-israel/">reported on by<em> The Intercept </em>suggest</a> that Project Nimbus is subject to “adjusted” terms of service rather than Google’s general terms of service.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="i9Ulei"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google fired a software engineer over an anti-war demonstration — he says he wasn’t even protesting ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint"},{"title":"Google fires 28 employees after sit-in protest over Israel cloud contract ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract"},{"title":"Nine Google employees arrested after eight-hour sit-in protest ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid"}]}'></div></aside></div>
<p id="20s864">In the months leading up to the contract in 2021, Google reportedly sought input from consultants including the firm Business for Social Responsibility (BSR). Consultants apparently recommended that the contract bar the sale and use of its AI tools to the Israeli military “and other sensitive customers,” the report says. BSR reportedly recommended “due diligence” on Google’s part to make sure its services weren’t being misused and that Google add its AI principles that prohibit surveillance or weapons to the contract.</p>
<p id="i1NWq0">Ultimately, the contract reportedly didn’t reflect those recommendations. The contract did, however, include a right to suspend customers for breaching Google’s <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://cloud.google.com/terms" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">terms of service</a> and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup?hl=en" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">acceptable use policy</a>.</p>
<p id="9e8Mla">Before signing the deal, the <em>Times </em>says, Google had additional concerns about the company itself potentially running into legal quandaries because of the contract: </p>
<blockquote><p id="EEp5qd">The company also worried that it would be forced to accept “onerous” risks, such as the possibility that it could run into conflicts with foreign or international authorities if they sought Israeli data and that it might have to “breach international legal orders” under the deal terms, according to the documents.</p></blockquote>
<p id="dOsdGA">Project Nimbus has become an even bigger flashpoint within the company since the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-20-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f">44,000 people in Gaza</a>. Google has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract">fired</a> roughly 50 employees for their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint">alleged involvement</a> in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid">protests</a> against Project Nimbus. </p>
<p id="4ktmoP">“We did not come to Google to work on technology that kills. By engaging in this contract leadership has betrayed our trust, our AI Principles, and our humanity,” Billy Van Der Laar, a Google software engineer, said in an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid">emailed statement following protests</a> in April that called on Google to exit Project Nimbus. </p>

        <figcaption><em>The creators of the Flexbar think Apple’s Touchbar deserves a second chance as a standalone solution.</em> | Screenshot: YouTube</figcaption>

  <p id="aLjyBv">Apple may have said goodbye to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/31/23938841/apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-discontinued-proof-of-concept">MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar</a> last year, but a team of four engineers believes the concept deserves a second chance. They’ve <a href="https://eniacelec.com/">created the Flexbar</a>, which is essentially a standalone version of the MBP’s thin touchscreen display that can be used with multiple devices and platforms through a USB connection.</p>
<p id="RJCc2f">The Flexbar’s creators have started a new company, Eniac, which is attempting to bring the accessory to consumers through a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1735591421/flexbar-a-versatile-and-fully-customizable-touch-bar-solution?">Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a>. The earliest backers can preorder one discounted to $119 from the full MSRP of $179, with delivery expected as early as February 2025.</p>
<p id="8K7UbZ">This is the company’s first product, however, and while they have demonstrated functional hardware <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05KmczA7gA8">in several videos</a>, there’s still an element of risk when backing it. The company told <em>The Verge</em> it was sourcing “components through standard supply channels,” but didn’t confirm where the Flexbar’s uniquely-sized 10-inch 2K OLED screen was coming from. Ideally it’s not repurposing Apple’s Touch Bar screens, which have a limited supply stock.</p>

  <p id="Z9iMsh">MSI has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msi.com%2Fnews%2Fdetail%2FMSI-s-New-Claw-8-AI----Claw-7-AI--Handheld-with-Powerful-Performance-and-Low-Power-Consumption--Available-Now--145096&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F3%2F24311944%2Fmsi-claw-7-ai-plus-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-32gb-ram-gaming-pc-handhelds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">officially announced</a> its next crack at handheld gaming is here with the Lunar Lake-powered MSI Claw 7 AI Plus and MSI Claw 8 AI Plus. The two Windows-based handhelds come with 32GB of RAM and larger batteries than their predecessors. They release on December 25th, but you can preorder them now, starting at $799 for the Claw 7 and $899 for the Claw 8.</p>
<p id="EhxG30">When the original MSI Claw shipped last spring, MSI needed to address battery life and performance, both of which were both sticking points in Sean Hollister’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review"><em>Verge</em> review</a>. The Claw 8 brings more significant changes here; its 80-watt-hour battery is a big jump over the original model’s 53 watt hours. The Claw 7 has a much smaller increase at 54.5 watt hours. The Claw 8 also has an “easy access” SSD storage slot that the Claw 7 lacks. </p>
<p id="Q216Mv">Both devices have a 120Hz variable refresh rate LCD display, but the Claw 8’s 8-inch screen is slightly higher resolution (1920 x 1200) than the Claw 7’s 7-inch one (1920 x 1080). Performance-wise, MSI claims the handhelds will have a 113 percent higher peak FPS and 20 percent higher average FPS than its competitors “under identical power conditions.” MSI doesn’t say which competitors it’s referring to, but in Sean’s review, the previous model was outdone by the Steam Deck OLED, Asus ROG Ally Z1E, and the Lenovo Legion Go.</p>

  <p id="gEwoKn">Microsoft went and made its pricey Xbox Elite 2 controller part of the resurgent transparent tech trend with some fetching new see-through “Cipher Series” color options in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23156812/xbox-design-lab-new-custom-controller-options">Xbox Design Lab</a> custom controller shop. In addition, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/">announced</a> new chromatic options for the D-pads and paddles. Prices start at $149.99 for a custom design, but you’ll pay extra for some options.</p>
<p id="1YZOeg">The new translucent faceplate options are white (Ghost Cipher), green (Velocity Cipher), purple (Astral Cipher), blue (Surf Cipher), pink (Candy Cipher), and red (Pulse Cipher) options. Meanwhile, you can choose Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma for the paddles and D-pad. </p>

  <p id="beqGLu">Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is partnering with Google Cloud to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-deploys-ai-powered-captioning-solution-built-using-google-cloud-ai-302256591.html">generate closed captioning for content</a> on the studio’s Max streaming service in the US. WBD will use a new “caption AI” solution that runs on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform to generate speech-to-text for some shows, starting with “unscripted programming.”</p>
<p id="lEHPye">Captions generated for the Max shows will have human oversight for quality assurance. According to Google, the workflow will reduce caption file creation time by up to 80 percent and cut costs by up to 50 percent compared to manual methods. WBD will continuously refine and train caption AI to make fewer mistakes.</p>
<p id="r1lUzo">Notably, most content on Max already has closed captioning tracks, and WBD hasn’t said how extensively it...</p>

  <p id="lfNaV7">Marques Brownlee, the YouTuber known as MKBHD, has responded to backlash over the launch of his new wallpaper app, called Panels. In <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1838582554749755438">a post on Tuesday</a>, Brownlee says he’s going to address users’ concerns about pricing and “excessive data disclosures.”</p>
<p id="M0Qbbe">Brownlee revealed the new app as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRtg6A1f2Ko">his iPhone 16 review</a> on Monday — a video that’s usually among his biggest of the year. But a flood of criticism about the Panels app quickly overshadowed comments about the new iPhone. “Part of building in public is getting mass feedback immediately, which is pretty dope. Almost exactly like publishing a YouTube video,” Brownlee said.</p>

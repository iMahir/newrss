  <p id="jJhVey">Google will soon let Gemini subscribers <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-update-august-2024/">create custom chatbots</a> that can serve as a gym buddy, cooking partner, writing editor, and more. Users can give the chatbots — called Gems — distinct personalities and specialties by simply describing a set of instructions.</p>
<p id="3AaSVv">Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156511/google-ai-gemini-gems-custom-chatbots">first introduced Gems</a> during I/O in May. In an example prompt shown by Google, users can create a “knowledgeable, casual, and friendly” Gem that can help people plan low- or no-water gardens. For users who don’t want to create a custom chatbot right away, Google is offering some premade Gems, including a learning coach, an idea brainstormer, a career guide, a coding partner, and an editor. </p>

  <p id="O9VWXZ">Google is letting its users generate images of people through its Gemini AI chatbot again after pulling the feature earlier this year amid reports of historically inaccurate images, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079371/google-ai-gemini-generative-inaccurate-historical">racially diverse Nazis</a>. In <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-update-august-2024/">an announcement</a>, Google says it will roll out an early access version of the capability to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users in English “over the coming days.”</p>
<p id="dHM1Ez">This upgrade will be powered by Imagen 3, the latest version of Google’s AI text-to-image generator. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221218/google-ai-image-generator-imagen-3-available">Google quietly launched Imagen 3</a> through its AI Test Kitchen earlier this month, and now it’s coming to Gemini across all languages. The upgraded tool is capable of generating anything from photorealistic landscapes to textured oil paintings with a...</p>

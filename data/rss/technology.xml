    </figure>

  <p id="bGDos7">Anbernic announced its next retro handheld today and it’s easy to see where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64M_BHXsiiE&amp;t=1s">design of the RG34XX draws its inspiration</a>. It appears to be a faithful clone of Nintendo’s original Game Boy Advance, although updated with <a href="https://x.com/KeepRetro/status/1865057457157877766">additional action and shoulder buttons</a> allowing games from more recent systems to be played. Pricing and availability hasn’t been revealed yet, but the RG34XX will come in transparent red and green colors, as well as the GBA’s purple and black.</p>
<p id="HPg8X8">One feature Anbernic didn’t carry forward is the Game Boy Advance’s LCD screen which lacked a backlight and was notoriously difficult to see unless you were playing outside on a sunny day or cozied up next to a bright lamp. The RG34XX will instead feature a larger 3.4-inch display with a 720x480 resolution. The display will also use the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the Game Boy Advance, so GBA titles should look great, and older games developed for 4:3 TV screens will fit without extensive stretching or pillarboxing.</p>

  </figure>
<p id="IcgRa8">As with previous Anbernic handhelds, the RG34XX doesn’t have a cartridge slot like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">Analogue Pocket</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date">ModRetro Chromatic</a>. It’s instead designed to play games through software emulation. Details on the RG34XX’s processor aren’t known yet, but <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/anbernic-rg34xx-announced/">Retro Handhelds speculates</a> it will be based on the Allwinner H700 chipset the company has <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx">used in its other XX series handhelds</a>. If that’s the case, you can expect it to play games from older consoles up to the original Sony PlayStation, and even some N64 and Sega Dreamcast titles.</p>

<p id="qNUY7l">The RG34XX will include Wi-Fi connectivity facilitating online play as well as streaming PC titles through <a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/">Moonlight</a>, and Bluetooth for connecting multiple wireless controllers for shared screen multiplayer. If that 3.4-inch screen still seems too small, the RG34XX also includes a mini HDMI port for connecting it to a TV, alongside a USB-C port for charging, and a pair of microSD card slots for storing ROMs and its operating system.</p>

  <p id="ZhW66J">Apple’s betting that its upcoming in-house 5G modem could help it beat Qualcomm's performance eventually, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027"><em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple has worked on developing its own modem for years, but the initiative reportedly experienced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883565/apple-5g-modem-failure-inside-story">technical issues and other setbacks</a> despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition">purchasing Intel’s modem unit</a> in 2019. </p>
<p id="d93I7k">The first Apple modem is rumored to come to the iPhone SE before appearing in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305670/iphone-17-slim-rumors-sim-card-battery-problems">the rumored iPhone “Slim”</a> and entry-level iPads. Down the line, Apple is reportedly planning to roll out a second-generation modem with mmWave in 2026, putting it in the iPhone 18 line and higher-end iPads. In 2027, <em>Bloomberg </em>reports that Apple “hopes to top Qualcomm” with its “Prometheus” modem, which could support AI features and “next-generation satellite networks.”</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="gEuZgx"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s next iPhone SE might get an OLED upgrade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234749/apple-iphone-se-4th-generation-oled-display-rumor-leak"},{"title":"The new Mac Mini is great — now do the&amp;nbsp;iPhone&amp;nbsp;SE","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24296505/apple-iphone-se-rumors-mac-mini"}]}'></div></aside></div>
<p id="PzAfpL">However, its first chip may fall short of Qualcomm’s in terms of the absolute highest possible speed for a couple of reasons: lacking support for the mmWave technology available in some cities from carriers like Verizon and supporting four-carrier aggregation instead of six. </p>
<p id="nDtW4H">Those features boost the maximum bandwidth available to multiple gigabits per second, but speeds are typically much slower in the real world, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22968066/apple-iphone-se-5g-mmwave-verizon-uw">the current iPhone SE also lacks mmWave support</a>. The new modem will, however, support dual SIM standby, allowing people to have two active SIM cards at the same time.</p>

  <p id="3zPjMX">Microsoft is expanding the testing of its new Recall AI feature to Intel- and AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCs. The software giant first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24302947/microsoft-recall-windows-insider-testing-dev-channel-click-to-do">released a preview of Recall</a> on Qualcomm-powered laptops last month, allowing Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel to test the new AI-powered feature. Now Intel and AMD Copilot Plus PCs <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/06/previewing-more-copilot-experiences-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/">are getting access</a> in a new build today.</p>
<p id="QL974Z">Recall takes screenshots of almost everything you do on a Copilot Plus PC to make it searchable and easy to recall a memory or retrace your steps. Microsoft has made the AI experience entirely optional, so you can enable snapshots to find what you were working on previously through natural language search or a scrollable timeline.</p>
<figure class="e-image">
        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfzmcyXUD84A0yvmrnIYQ79JkGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25749006/2_recall_timeline.png">

      <figcaption><em>The Recall timeline feature.</em></figcaption>
  </figure>
<p id="e5hjkx">Much like the experience on Qualcomm Copilot Plus PCs, Windows 11 will download the models for Recall and Click to Do in the background once you install the Dev Channel build. You’ll then need to enable snapshots yourself. You can control what snapshots are saved and delete them based on apps or much like you’d delete browsing history by date. Microsoft also provides a way to exclude apps and websites from Recall, and the feature also automatically detects sensitive information like credit card details, passwords, and personal ID numbers to ensure snapshots are not saved.</p>
<p id="3xAwzO">Microsoft has made a variety of security upgrades to Recall after researchers raised the alarm over the controversial feature. You now need to use Windows Hello to confirm your presence and access snapshots, and it also requires BitLocker and Secure Boot — both of which should be enabled already on a Copilot Plus PC.</p>
<p id="vni8CC">Click to Do is also part of this Recall testing. Click to Do can recognize text and images in Recall snapshots so you can use AI-powered actions on them like copying text or saving images out of old snapshots. Microsoft is also expanding Click to Do outside of Recall so you can use it to take actions on images and text by summoning it through Windows key + mouse click. </p>
<p id="JDCT2v">Lastly, Microsoft is also introducing its Image Creator and Restyle Image features to the Photos app for Intel- and AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCs. These devices will also get access to Cocreator in Paint today to let you create AI-powered images directly in Paint.</p>

  <p id="eVergz">Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is now available to free users on X. <a href="https://x.com/blankspeaker/status/1864826210951307330">Several users</a> <a href="https://x.com/nima_owji/status/1865058483529290086">noticed the change</a> on Friday, which gives non-Premium subscribers the ability to send up to 10 messages to Grok every two hours.</p>
<p id="swGogS">xAI launched Grok last year as a “humorous AI assistant,” but it was only available to Premium subscribers. In August, xAI added a text-to-image generation feature to Grok, which turned out to be capable of producing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220173/xai-grok-image-generator-misinformation-offensive-imges">some questionable images</a>.</p>

  <p id="K01ihQ">The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review">AirPods Pro</a> stole the spotlight recently with an incredible discount that made them even cheaper than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review"><strong>AirPods 4</strong></a><strong> with Active Noise Cancellation</strong>. But now the script is flipped and the AirPods 4 are currently discounted to $139 ($40 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DGJ7HYG1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. That’s a new record low for Apple’s newest pair of wireless earbuds and just $9 more than the version without ANC.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="dRj2tj"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Why is Apple sleeping on the AirPods Max?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24242378/airpods-max-usb-c-unchanged-missing-features"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'></div></aside></div>
<p id="dDZG3r">The AirPods 4 are a substantial upgrade over the previous generation, with better overall sound quality and a stronger bass profile. They also borrow a couple more features from the AirPods Pro, like the Voice Isolation feature that analyzes your voice to separate it and cancel out the environment, resulting in clearer voice calls. Other features include a wireless charging case with a speaker that lets you trigger a sound from Apple’s Find My app, spatial audio with head-tracking, and adaptive audio. </p>
<p id="G9XfO4">Active noise cancellation is solid in the upgraded pair, but since there are no canal-sealing ear tips, they won’t offer the same dampening. That’s where you’d opt instead for the AirPods Pro, which ultimately sound better and offer a few extra capabilities, like more intuitive volume controls and the ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview">use them as hearing aids</a>. But if you don’t mind making some tradeoffs, the entry-level AirPods 4 offer a lot for the money.</p>

<h2 id="e2p9Xl">A few more deals to kick the weekend off</h2>
<ul>
<li id="TREAkg">If you need a solid pair of earbuds but you can’t justify spending close to $100 or more, the <strong>JLab Go Air Pop</strong> should have your attention right now. They’re just $9.88 ($15 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJLab-Go-Air-Pop-Bluetooth-Earbuds-True-Wireless-with-Charging-Case-Slate%2F799981023&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Walmart</a>, which is their lowest price to date. They don’t do much but play music, but they sound decent, they’re reasonably comfortable, and you can get them in a variety of fun colors. You’ll get eight hours of runtime per charge, with an extra 24 hours available in the charging case.</li>
<li id="nxaF3q">Today only, you can get a two-pack of black<strong> Xbox Core Wireless Controllers</strong> with a USB-C cable from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2F2-pack-xbox-core-wireless-controller-usb-c-cable&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F6%2F24314768%2Fapple-airpods-4-with-active-noise-cancellation-wireless-earbuds-xbox-core-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Woot</a> for $73.59 (about $46 off) with code <strong>20PERCENT</strong>. The controllers are often on sale for $40 on their own, so you’re getting a better deal compared to buying them separately. Although Microsoft created the controllers specifically for the Xbox Series X/S launch, you can use them with older Xbox One consoles and on Windows PCs.</li>
<li id="Xd4JJx">The <strong>Ring Battery Doorbell Plus</strong>, which we think is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera">best battery-powered video doorbell</a>, is matching its all-time low of $99.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Battery-Doorbell-detection/dp/B09WZBPX7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/2b4pzb9n9vuf6">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-battery-doorbell-plus-8211-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell-with-head-to-toe-hd-video-satin-nickel%2F-%2FA-88293229&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Target</a>. The doorbell boasts an impressive 1536p video resolution as well as a head-to-toe view that offers better visibility for packages and visitors. While there are cheaper wireless options from Ring and competitors, they’re not quite as responsive as the Doorbell Plus. Other handy features include color night vision, live view, and two-way audio, though you’ll need to pay $4.99 a month for others like recorded video and package alerts.</li>

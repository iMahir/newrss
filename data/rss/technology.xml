  <p id="r5Anl9">Apple has hiked the price of its <a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-replacement">battery repair service</a> for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239802/iphone-16-pro-max-hands-on-apple-photos-features-price">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max</a>. Now, it will cost $119 to get your battery replaced in either phone — a $20 jump over its older fee. The price remains the same for the standard and “Plus” models, as do those for last year’s phones, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/09/15/apple-jacking-up-prices-on-post-applecare-iphone-battery-replacements">as <em>MacRumors</em> notes</a>.</p>
<p id="EQprC1">The company doesn’t seem to have started charging more for other battery replacements yet, but it wouldn’t be unexpected. In 2022, Apple drove the cost of iPhone 14 battery service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348705/iphone-14-apple-battery-replacement-price">up by $30 to $99</a>. Increases for iPad, MacBook, and older iPhone battery repairs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/2/23535428/apple-iphone-ipad-mac-battery-service-replacement-price-increase">came after that</a>, and Apple Watches <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875514/apple-watch-battery-replacement-cost-expensive">followed suit later</a>. (One longs for the salad days of battery <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology">drama-induced $29 battery replacements</a>!)</p>

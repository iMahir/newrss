  <p id="ZDM4Sa">Green bubbles, rejoice: your iPhone-using friends are finally going to have a much better time texting you. As part of iOS 18, which was released for everyone on Monday, Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24171315/apple-messages-rcs-ios-18-imessage-green-bubble">added support for RCS</a>, the Rich Communication Services protocol for messaging. This means that chats between iPhone and Android users will finally have a bunch of sorely needed features that should have been in place a long time ago.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="1Gg1ao"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"RCS on the iPhone is almost the solution to our green-bubble nightmare","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24194362/rcs-iphone-ios-18-preview"}]}'></div></aside></div>
<p id="tgTYc2">A big reason I’ve stayed on iOS (and haven’t even considered switching to Android) is because iMessage conversations work especially well for my family group chats, and I don’t want to nerf those chats. This new RCS support is a great step toward making iPhone-to-Android texts work a lot better (though there are still enough drawbacks...</p>

  <p id="JLrEa3">With each <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24170586/macos-15-mac-apple-ai-wwdc-2024">operating system update</a>, our computers get further away from their earliest, text-based interfaces, when copying files and launching programs required typing out specific commands rather than double-clicking on icons. But although a lot of today’s users won’t know these command line interfaces ever existed, and others will have forgotten all about them, they’re still present in macOS and in Windows. More than that, they’re still actually useful. </p>
<p id="PCkb4L">In this article, I’ll look at some ways you can access and use Terminal, a throwback to the days before macOS. There are two ways of launching it:</p>
<ul>
<li id="fQB4W3">In Spotlight, start typing <strong>Terminal</strong>, and when <strong>Terminal.app</strong> comes up, hit return.</li>

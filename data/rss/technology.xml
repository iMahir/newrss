  <p id="0DVbqa">The UK’s top soccer league is switching up the tech it uses to detect offside violations on the football pitch. The English Premier League (EPL) has contracted with a company called Genius Sports, which will use dozens of iPhones combined with machine-learning models to help game officials make an offside call.</p>
<p id="wx68JP"><a href="https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-11---offside">Offside violations</a> aren’t always clear-cut, especially when players are grouped in a way that blocks officials and even multiple camera angles from seeing enough detail to accurately call them. That’s where video assistant referee (VAR) systems usually come in, ostensibly filling in the gaps using cameras and machine learning.</p>

  <p id="R2Ofjv">Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4326355263805583415">started publicly testing</a> sorting reviews in the Steam store based on how well they help players make purchase decisions about games. </p>
<blockquote><p id="dOaI88">Historically we’ve sorted reviews by the number of ‘helpful’ votes given to each review by other players. However, we’ve seen that many players use reviews for sharing jokes, memes, ascii art and other content that might not be the most helpful for a potential purchaser. </p></blockquote>
<p id="DFs8f2">Its solution to the problem is the new “helpfulness system,” which introduces an enabled-by-default “most helpful” toggle that skips past highly upvoted ASCII art or memes to show reviews Valve deems more informative.</p>

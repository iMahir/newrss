  <p id="XLcBbG">Early this morning, I received an email from “The Internet Archive Team,” replying to a message I’d sent on October 9th. Except its author doesn’t seem to have been the digital archivists’ support team — it was apparently written by the hackers who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266419/internet-archive-ddos-attack-pop-up-message">breached the site</a> earlier this month and who evidently maintain some level of access to its systems.</p>
<p id="AvQ3nc">I’m not alone. Users on the Internet Archive subreddit are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetarchive/comments/1g7sb6b/well_thats_concerning_got_this_reply_on_an_email/">reporting</a> getting the replies, as well. Here is the message I received:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="eRZXUe">It’s dispiriting to see that even after being made aware of the breach 2 weeks ago, IA has still not done the due diligence of rotating many of the API keys that were exposed in their gitlab secrets.</p>
<p id="dJ2ZMU">As demonstrated by this message, this includes a Zendesk token...</p>
</blockquote>

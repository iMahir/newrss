  <p id="D1g0sL">Adobe has teased some of its upcoming generative AI video tools, including a new feature that can produce video clips from still images. This latest preview builds on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130804/adobe-premiere-pro-firefly-video-generative-ai-openai-sora">in-development Firefly video model</a> that the software giant demonstrated in April, which is set to power AI video and audio editing features across Adobe’s Creative Cloud applications.</p>
<p id="7LBeu2">The new promotional teaser shows footage produced by Firefly’s text-to-video capabilities that Adobe announced (but didn’t demonstrate) earlier this year. The tool allows users to generate video clips using text descriptions and adjust the results using a variety of “camera controls” that simulate camera angles, motion, and shooting distance. An image-to-video feature was also demonstrated...</p>

  <p id="MkbMQb">Nuro, the delivery robot company created by veterans of Google’s self-driving car project, is taking the bold — and risky — step to expand its business model to include robotaxis and personally owned autonomous vehicles. </p>
<p id="YAN6wM">The California-based company, which currently operates a small fleet of delivery vehicles in California and Texas, doesn’t plan to build the vehicles itself. Instead, it will license its autonomous driving technology to outside companies, including car companies who want to use it for advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and rideshare operators for robotaxis. </p>
<p id="uutnAH">Nuro uses hardware provided by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079434/nuro-robot-delivery-arm-power-efficiency-range">major companies like Nvidia and Arm</a> to power its Nuro Driver, the company’s branding for the hardware and software used to power...</p>

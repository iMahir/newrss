  <p id="9NAxUj">A rare prototype of the original Apple Macintosh featuring a 5.25-inch disk drive instead of the 3.5-inch drive the personal computer eventually shipped with is <a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auction/29514/preview-lot/5918785/apple-twiggy-macintosh-prototype-used-in-the-development-of-demonstration-software-macintosh-personal-computer-apple-computers-inc-cupertino-ca-1983-with-5-14-inch-twiggy-disk-drive-with-corresponding-slot-in-front-panel/">headed to auction again</a> as part of Bonhams’ upcoming <a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auction/29514/history-of-science-and-technology/">History of Science and Technology collection</a>.</p>
<p id="Fa8alR">The prototype has been nicknamed the Twiggy Macintosh because it features the same 5.25-inch double-sided floppy disk drive originally created for the Apple Lisa, which had been <a href="https://www.folklore.org/Hide_Under_This_Desk.html">codenamed the Twiggy</a> during its development. Those drives were notoriously unreliable, and since the Macintosh didn’t come with any internal storage, a disk drive users could rely on was a critical component. </p>

This year’s two-day shopping event — dubbed Prime Big Deal Days — kicks off today, October 8th, and runs through tomorrow, October 9th, giving Amazon Prime subscribers a chance to chip away at their holiday wishlist before Black Friday and Cyber Monday land later this year.</p>

Take the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review"><strong>AirPods Pro 2</strong></a>, for example — the pair that comes with a USB-C charging case has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">plummeted all the way to $168.99</a> (about $81 off) for Prime members, matching the all-time low. </p>

Both earbuds are available now, while the new over-ear models are expected later this year.</p>
<p id="7pvmMp">The most notable of these is the $59.99 SoundForm Isolate, a pair of over-ear wireless headphones that offers active noise cancellation (ANC) and a “Hear-Thru” transparency mode. They’ve also got a built-in, looping ambient noise “Relaxation” track. </p>

  <p id="qq6US4">At IFA 2024, Anker announced a slate of new charging accessories, including a new portable 3-in-1 Qi2 charger. The new MagGo 3-in-1 foldable pad unravels into three wireless pucks tethered by rubbery straps: a Qi2-certified 15W charger on one end, a 5W Apple-certified Watch charger on the other, and a 5W Qi puck in the middle that also houses the USB-C power input port.</p>
<p id="VUoUYf">The new Anker 3-in-1 seems inspired by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988368/twelvesouth-butterfly-iphone-magsafe-charger-2in1-apple-watch-price-availability">Twelve South’s Butterfly charger design</a>, including its ability to fold back as a kickstand for an iPhone while charging. Still, the Butterfly only charges an iPhone and Apple Watch. Anker’s is available today for $88.99 and comes in black, white, and pink, with a green one launching “after October.”</p>

  <p id="ySuGlN">Eufy, the smart home product company under Anker, is launching new smart lights, including new permanent outdoor lights that can change color depending on who is walking up to your house. It works by communicating with Eufy’s video doorbells and security cameras and can be set to turn into, say, a welcoming soft white light for your family member.</p>
<p id="PTg7Bi">Another example Anker provided is that it can switch to a harsh bright red for unrecognized folks approaching late at night. That might be a problem for early morning shift Amazon delivery workers, but if you can get each of their faces registered, maybe they all can get a thumbs-up bright green light!</p>

    "summary": "- Hulu cut off its live feed before the Best Actress and Best Picture winners were announced during the Oscars.\n- Viewers received a message stating \"the live event has now ended,\" prompting complaints on social media.\n- The premature end likely resulted from an incorrectly set broadcast end time of 10:32 PM, coinciding with the planned conclusion of the event.\n- Earlier, Hulu acknowledged login issues for some users which were resolved shortly before 9 PM ET.\n- Unlike Hulu viewers, cable viewers and those using TV antennas did not face this streaming issue as they received the uninterrupted broadcast.\n- Hulu's livestream cut off during the final moments of the Oscars, missing key awards for best actress and best picture.\n- Viewers saw an error message instead of the concluding segments, leading to widespread anger online.\n- Some users experienced issues logging in at the start, causing them to miss the musical intro.\n- Disney, which operates Hulu, apologized for the technical issues affecting viewers.",

Meta Platforms](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67569326/kadrey-v-meta-platforms-inc/?order_by=desc) indicate Meta has paused discussions with book publishers for AI training data licensing.\n- Meta's AI partnership lead, Sy Choudhury, reported slow engagement from publishers during outreach efforts, leading to the decision to pause licensing efforts in early April 2023 due to logistical setbacks.\n- The plaintiffs, including authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, allege Meta may have used pirated ebooks for AI model training, raising concerns over copyright infringement.\n- Unsealed court documents disclose that Meta employees discussed the use of copyrighted content to train AI models.\n- A research engineer suggested purchasing e-books at retail prices for speed, despite legal concerns.\n- Meta considered using Libgen for accessing copyrighted books and debated how to avoid public acknowledgment of such actions.\n- Some insiders argued that existing data from Facebook and Instagram might not suffice for advanced AI training, driving a push for more extensive datasets, even against previous decisions regarding copyrighted content.\n- The Kadrey v. Meta case, initiated in 2023 in California, accuses Meta of analyzing both pirated and licensed books for potential licensing negotiations.",

    "id": "04rf6iv10vxtzr",
    "summary": "- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a public inquiry into censorship by tech platforms, seeking comments from affected users.\n- FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson emphasized the need to understand potential legal violations by these firms regarding user silencing and intimidation.\n- The inquiry coincides with social media companies loosening restrictions on hate speech, raising questions about the relation between content moderation and the First Amendment.\n- Legal experts argue that the inquiry might misinterpret the First Amendment, which restricts government interference with speech, not private companies.\n- President Trump signed an executive order making independent regulators accountable to the White House, potentially affecting the FTC's inquiry.\n- The FTC launches an inquiry into content moderation practices of online platforms including Meta and Uber.\n- The examination will assess if moderation amounts to \"censorship.\"\n- FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson seeks public comments on moderation's impact on free expression.\n- Inquiry follows Republican concerns regarding suppression of conservative viewpoints, highlighted by past bans on figures like Donald Trump.\n- Legal protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act may impact the inquiry's outcomes.",

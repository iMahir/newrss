    "summary": "- Moonvalley raised $43 million in fresh venture capital according to an SEC filing.\n- The startup is developing AI tools for video creation and recently launched its model, Marey.\n- Previous funding included $70 million in seed funding from notable backers.\n- There is a risk of market oversaturation among AI video generator startups.\n- Moonvalley’s Marey offers customization options for video generation and claims lower legal risks.\n- Andreessen Horowitz is negotiating to lead a funding round for Thinking Machines Lab, founded by Mira Murati, former OpenAI CTO.\n- The funding round could value Thinking Machines Lab at $10 billion, with potential funding nearing $2 billion.\n- The startup, launched in February 2025, aims to create safer AI systems and currently has approximately 30 researchers, mainly ex-OpenAI members.\n- Notable advisers include former OpenAI leaders Bob McGrew and Alec Radford.\n- This represents a trend where former OpenAI employees are rapidly attracting significant investments for new ventures.\n- In 2024, global AI funding surpassed $100 billion, demonstrating a shift in venture capital towards AI investments, focusing more on team credentials than traditional revenue metrics.\n- OpenAI's internal restructuring has led to significant departures, causing both challenges and new competition from its former executives.",

    "summary": "- On April 2, 2024, President Trump announced tariffs affecting Southeast Asia, potentially harming its appeal for global business diversification.\n- ASEAN nations face tariffs from 10% to 49%, impacting billions in tech exports.\n- Vietnam and Thailand are notably affected, with Vietnam's $48.5 billion tech exports facing $22.3 billion in tariffs; Thailand's $24.1 billion faces $8.7 billion.\n- The tariffs signal that ASEAN is no longer a viable alternative for circumventing tariffs on China.\n- Analysts express concerns that multinational corporations may reconsider foreign direct investment in the region.\n- The Indonesian government plans to negotiate a 32% import tariff imposed by President Trump.\n- Coordinating Minister Airlangga Hartarto and Foreign Minister Sugiono will lead the delegation.\n- The discussions are set to occur after the tariff takes effect on April 9, with the team expected to depart by April 17.\n- Indonesia is coordinating with ASEAN nations before discussions with the US.\n- Indonesia has a significant trade surplus with the US, making it vulnerable to tariffs based on trade imbalances.\n- Key sectors at risk include textiles and footwear, potentially affecting poverty rates and employment.\n- Despite challenges, Indonesia has opportunities to become a regional supply chain hub as companies seek alternatives to China.\n- Policymakers are exploring deregulation and coordination with ASEAN partners to mitigate negative impacts.",

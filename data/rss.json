    "summary": "- The Alliance of Automotive Innovation filed a lawsuit against a new rule mandating automatic emergency braking (AEB) by 2029.\n- Major automakers including Ford, GM, and Toyota are represented in the suit, aiming to repeal the regulation they describe as “flawed.”\n- The rule requires vehicles to automatically stop to avoid collisions at speeds up to 62mph and detect pedestrians at various speeds.\n- NHTSA stated the rule is practicable and necessary for increasing safety standards in new vehicles.\n- The auto alliance claims current technology cannot meet the requirements and prefers a previous voluntary agreement on AEB implementation.\n- Consumer advocates support the rule, arguing it is crucial for roadway safety and should be achievable by the 2029 deadline.",

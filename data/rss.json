    "summary": "- President-elect Donald Trump proposes a joint venture for TikTok, aiming for the US to own 50% of the app.\n- Trump intends to issue an executive order to delay the TikTok ban to protect national security.\n- Republican lawmakers express skepticism about halting the TikTok ban without a legitimate sale to eliminate foreign ownership.\n- TikTok went dark in the US on Saturday but may return soon.\n- Bipartisan legislation requires ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban.\n- The Supreme Court upheld the law before Trump’s inauguration.\n- TikTok indicated a need for clarity before continuing operations; Trump aims to resume the app's functionality before the order is issued.\n- A proposed solution includes forming a joint venture with a 50% US ownership stake, though specifics on whether it would be by the government or a private company are not detailed.\n- An executive order is expected on Jan. 20 that will protect companies assisting TikTok during negotiations from legal liability.",

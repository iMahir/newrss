    "title": "Trump Delays TikTok Ban for 75 Days with Executive Order",
    "id": "0l4yrs80rxggnf",
    "summary": "- President Trump signed an executive order on **January 21** to extend TikTok's service in the U.S. for 75 days.\n- The order instructs agencies to protect national security while allowing TikTok to remain operational.\n- U.S. Attorney General is directed not to enforce the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) during this period.\n- PAFACA effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. as of January 19.\n- The extension prevents TikTok from being banned and delays the requirement for ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations.\n- The decision follows a recent **U.S. Supreme Court** ruling concerning TikTok's sale due to national security concerns.\n- Trump suggested a potential half ownership of TikTok's U.S. business to keep the app operational and warned of tariffs if China does not approve a U.S. deal.\n- The TikTok ban issue arose as the app serves 170 million Americans, and legal maneuvers left users anxious about its future.\n- Following Trump's intervention, TikTok restored its service in the U.S., yet it remains unavailable for download in app stores.",

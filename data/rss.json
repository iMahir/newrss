    "summary": "- Researchers from Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University published a study on the effects of generative AI on critical thinking skills.\n- The paper warns that overreliance on AI may deteriorate cognitive faculties by shifting focus from higher-order thinking to verification of AI outputs.\n- In a study of 319 participants using AI weekly, 36% reported utilizing critical thinking skills to counter AI shortcomings.\n- Participants often verified AI outputs with external sources, undermining the AI's utility.\n- Confident users of AI tended to use less critical thinking than those confident in their own abilities.\n- Researchers suggest that while AI tools don't make users dumber, they can weaken problem-solving capacity if abused.\n- Microsoft unveils the Muse AI model for Xbox, aiding game development and preservation of classic games.\n- Muse generates game environments based on player actions, understanding 3D physics.\n- The model trained on data from the game *Bleeding Edge*, utilizing seven years of gameplay data.\n- Currently, Muse generates visuals at 300x180 pixels, a step up from previous models but still lower than standard gaming resolutions.\n- Microsoft aims to enhance creativity in game development without replacing creators.",

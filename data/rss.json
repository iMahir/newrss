The law is viewed as constitutional and content neutral, allowing government action without significantly hindering free expression. As of January 19, TikTok may cease operations unless President Biden intervenes or ByteDance sells the company. Donald Trump had discussions with Xi Jinping about TikTok and plans to make a decision in the near future, adding uncertainty to the platform's future.",

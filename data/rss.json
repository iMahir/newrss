    "summary": "- Meta Platforms launched ads on Threads in the US and Japan.\n- Brands participating in the initiative were selected; the announcement was made by Adam Mosseri on January 24.\n- This marks the beginning of monetization for Threads, launched in 2023.\n- Effectiveness of the test will be evaluated before a wider rollout.\n- The goal is for ads to be engaging like organic content.\n- As of December 2024, Threads had 300 million monthly users and over 100 million daily active users.\n- Zuckerberg announced plans for a \"return to OG Facebook\" by 2025 during the Q4 earnings call.\n- Specific changes are not disclosed; the focus is on restoring cultural influence and attracting younger users.\n- Changes could affect short-term revenues, anticipated rollout in six months.\n- Gen Z's declining interest presents a challenge for Facebook.\n- Past attempts to engage younger audiences, like Facebook Campus and the Gen Z redesign, have been unsuccessful.\n- Recent studies indicate only 33% of U.S. teens currently use Facebook, down from 71% a decade ago.\n- Zuckerberg's vision for \"OG Facebook\" remains vague, possibly referencing its earlier versions or nostalgic elements.",

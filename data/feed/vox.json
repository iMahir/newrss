The country’s population is projected to halve by 2100.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last week, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs released the <a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/\">World Population Prospects</a>, the international body’s annual report on the current and future state of global population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The headline was clear: We are well past the days of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/book-incited-worldwide-fear-overpopulation-180967499/\">worrying about having more people than the Earth can handle</a>. The UN’s demographers now expect the number of people on the planet to peak at a bit under 10.3 billion in 2084.<br><br>That’s two years earlier than the UN was predicting peak population as recently as 2022, and considerably earlier than forecasts from just a few years before, when population wasn’t expected to peak until the 22nd century.<br><br>10.3 billion, of course, is some 2 billion more people than the planet currently holds, so population growth isn’t stopping anytime soon, but it is slowing down rapidly. Women on average now have one less child than they did in 1990, and in more than half of all countries and areas, the lifetime fertility rate is less than 2.1 — the number needed for a population to replace itself through birth alone. And as of 2024, total population had already peaked in 63 countries or areas including Russia, Germany, and China, which last year was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/30/23702471/indian-china-population-united-nations-demographics-fertility-rate-poverty\">passed</a> by India as the world’s most populous nation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s impossible to discuss global population without landing in the middle of a culture war, whether it was over supposed overpopulation in the 1970s or now, when the right, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/11/02/hillbilly-elegy-author-faces-backlash-over-remarks-connecting-nationalism-to-fertility-rate/\">very much including</a> new Republican VP candidate J.D. Vance, is increasingly <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/abortion-bans-pronatalism/\">pushing</a> controversial pronatal policies designed to increase family sizes. What you think about population change — whether you welcome it or fear it — will depend on which side you fall in these fights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The battles over population policy will continue to be fought and they are important, involving reproductive rights, fiscal policy, and cultural values. But when it comes to the sweep of demography in the 21st century, they are largely beyond the point. That’s because of something called “<a href=\"https://populationmatters.org/news/2023/11/the-mystery-of-demographic-momentum/\">population momentum</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that fertility rates are falling everywhere and pronatal government policy <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/05/23/why-paying-women-to-have-more-babies-wont-work\">has almost totally failed to alter that fact</a>, population in the future is mostly going to be a function of how many adults of reproductive age a country has, which is already largely fixed. The UN’s demographers may be off by a few years or a few hundred million people, but the changes are generally baked in. “All populations,” John Wilmoth, head of the UN Population Division, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/un-world-population-growth-e2adab27719bb94ea19626dc53c57384\">told the AP,</a> “are following a similar path.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which means the important question we’re facing isn’t how to change a world headed toward peak population in 60 years. It’s how to understand it and respond to it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Extreme decline</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The UN population report is full of startling predictions, but perhaps none so much as this: China, where the fertility rate is now just one child per woman, is forecast to see its population drop from 1.4 billion today to 633 million by 2100. That’s a drop of more than half, and it would see China, a country long synonymous with population size, reaching a level it hasn’t experienced since before 1960.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">China is part of the nearly 20 percent of the world that has “ultra-low fertility,” according to the UN report — meaning fewer than 1.4 children per woman. Another country in that group is South Korea, which has the world’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68402139\">lowest fertility rate at 0.72</a>. By 2100, South Korea’s population is expected to halve, to just 27 million people. Even more surprising: just 800,000 South Koreans by then are forecast to be children under the age of 5, while some 11 million will be 65 or older.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">China&#8217;s and South Korea’s population declines will be extreme, but other countries will be right behind them. Another 48 countries and territories — including Brazil, Turkey, and Vietnam — are projected to see population peak between 2025 and 2054.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before they get there — and continuing well after — these countries and much of the rest of the world will get much older. That’s in part a success story — after dipping during the Covid-19 pandemic, global life expectancy <a href=\"https://populationmatters.org/news/2024/07/the-road-to-10-billion-world-population-projections-2024/\">is on the rise again</a>, reaching 73.3 years in 2024 and projected to continue to rise to 77.4 years in 2054. The upshot, though, will be global graying: while today children under 18 globally outnumber those 65 and above <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/graphics-2024-united-nations-world-population-prospects-report-data-rcna160017\">by a nearly three to one ratio</a>, by the late 2070s, there will be more elderly than children.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The importance of immigration</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US is an exception in the rich world in that its population is projected to keep growing through the 21st century, reaching some 421 million by 2100. But that’s much less a function of fertility — US fertility has been below replacement level for years — than it is of the country’s openness to immigration. Recent census projections show that if immigration to the US stopped tomorrow, the US population would begin to fall immediately and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-census-projections-show-immigration-is-essential-to-the-growth-and-vitality-of-a-more-diverse-us-population/\">hit just 226 million by 2100</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That fact underscores that while meaningfully shifting fertility rates may be impossible, countries can control immigration, which gives the US more influence over just how big or how small it will be decades into the future. But even that’s a relative change. Unless we start getting off-world immigrants, every new citizen to one country is a population loss to another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">A new world order</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even while population growth in the world as a whole slows down and eventually reverses, some countries with younger populations and relatively higher fertility rates — chiefly in sub-Saharan Africa — will see massive growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The result is that by the end of the century, the makeup of the world will look very different. Nigeria is projected to become the world’s second-most populous country after India, with a population that will more than triple to over 700 million. Pakistan’s population is expected to increase by more than 100 million. The Democratic Republic of Congo, which ranks 15th in the world in population now, is forecast to reach seventh place with 388 million people — more than the US has today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re only beginning to grapple with what an older, shrinking world will feel like. Population change is a bit like climate change: a mega-trend that will do much to shape the kind of future we and our declining number of descendants will live in. The difference is that it remains in our control to alter the trajectory of climate change through energy and environmental policy. Despite the culture war rhetoric, that’s largely not the case for demography. All we can do is adapt.<br></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In the 2020 Democratic primary, he positioned himself as the pragmatic and less polarizing choice than the more progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Throughout his first term, Biden has often clashed with the more leftist elements of the party on issues ranging from <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/06/biden-border-move-infuriated-progressives-00162171\">immigration</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/26/politics/joe-biden-israel-support-college-campus-protests/index.html\">Israel</a>, even though he’s also found common ground with them on the <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/167408/progressives-inflation-reduction-act-biden\">Inflation Reduction Act</a> and advanced progressive ideas like a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/11/bidens-2025-budget-marries-progressive-tax-hikes-with-populist-campaign-planks.html\">billionaire tax</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now Biden is again seeking their help — and they’re willingly offering it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) <a href=\"https://x.com/elwasson/status/1813616471727100242\">publicly urged</a> Biden to step aside Wednesday, the New Yorker published an interview with Sanders where he <a href=\"https://x.com/IChotiner/status/1813631026931105852\">threw his support behind Biden’s candidacy</a>. This comes after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a member of the progressive so-called “Squad,” <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/aoc-sanders-stick-biden-2024-turmoil-push-bolder-agenda-rcna160882\">left no room for doubt</a> that Biden should be the nominee and said, “I support him and making sure that we win in November.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s need for allies — wherever he can get them — may have created an opportunity for progressives to negotiate with him on policy. AOC made this explicit in her comments earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/aoc-sanders-stick-biden-2024-turmoil-push-bolder-agenda-rcna160882\">saying</a> that Biden should “lean in” to a bolder economic agenda “and move further towards the working class.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That seems to be what’s happening. Biden is suddenly pushing progressive priorities from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-16/biden-to-propose-supreme-court-reforms-including-term-limits?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;embedded-checkout=true\">Supreme Court reforms</a> to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/16/rent-cap-5-percent-increases-housing/74415521007/\">capping rents</a>. He has also renewed his calls for an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/17/biden-assault-weapons-ban-ar15-trump/\">assault weapons ban</a> following the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360489/trump-shot-thomas-matthew-crooks-secret-service-butler-rally\">assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump</a> at a rally last weekend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two questions loom over this push from Biden. One, are these proposals actually achievable — especially since, if he wins the presidency, he likely won&#8217;t have the congressional majorities needed to enact his agenda? And two, can this late push help him politically? </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Biden’s new progressive priorities</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The progressive policies Biden is pushing have little chance of becoming law, even though they might be popular among Democratic base voters, not just those on the left flank.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/16/biden-supreme-court-reforms/\">reportedly weighing</a> legislation that would impose term limits on Supreme Court justices who currently serve for life (or until they decide to retire), and introduce a new ethics code in the wake of several scandals involving conservative Justices <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow\">Clarence Thomas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/05/30/alito-scotus-flag-00160450\">Samuel Alito</a>. Such legislation would likely be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled House, and would struggle in a Senate full of members <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/1/19/22881837/senate-filibuster-vote-voting-rights-joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema\">hesitant to fiddle with institutional rules</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He is also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/16/biden-supreme-court-reforms/\">reportedly considering</a> a constitutional amendment that would roll back the recent Supreme Court decision providing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">broad presidential immunity</a> from prosecution for official actions. As any amendment requires the approval of 38 states — a tall order that hasn’t been fulfilled in decades — this constitutional change seems unlikely. That said, endorsing such policies would mark a big shift for a president who was previously reluctant to touch the Supreme Court amid leftist calls to pack the court with more justices, sometimes referred to as Democrats’ <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/2/17513520/court-packing-explained-fdr-roosevelt-new-deal-democrats-supreme-court\">nuclear option</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Tuesday, Biden revived his calls for a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/17/biden-assault-weapons-ban-ar15-trump/\">national assault weapons ban</a>. The shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump used an AR-style assault weapon, which he said has “killed so many others, including children.” The president’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/28/23660290/louisville-shooting-biden-assault-weapon-ban\">last effort on this front</a> failed due to a lack of congressional interest; though there have been a number of high-profile shootings since then, little has changed with Congress’s willingness to engage with gun reform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Also on Tuesday, Biden proposed legislation to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/economy/biden-rent-increase-5-percent-cap-plan/index.html\">limit rent increases</a> in an environment in which housing inflation has remained higher than overall inflation figures for the year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden would prevent landlords who raise rent by more than 5 percent annually from obtaining tax credits starting in 2024 and for the next two years. More than 20 million rentals would be affected under the plan, which applies only to landlords who own more than 50 units and would exempt newly constructed or renovated properties. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is disagreement among <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-18/yup-rent-control-does-more-harm-than-good?sref=Y5NzbMHF\">economists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/rent-control-scored-a-big-election-night-victory?sref=Y5NzbMHF\">housing advocates</a> as to whether this would help renters. Even setting that aside, this proposal, like the others, isn’t likely to be passed by Congress before the November election. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And even if Biden wins a second term, his current performance in the polls is now <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/07/biden-out-trump-polls-house-senate-democrats-downballot.html\">endangering down-ballot Democrats</a> who would need to win overwhelmingly to get the numbers in Congress required to pass such ambitious legislation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What is Biden’s strategy?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that raises the question: What exactly is Biden’s game plan here? These proposals are unrealistic even in the best of times for Democrats, and right now is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360812/democrats-replace-biden-trump-shooting\">definitely not</a> the best of times for Democrats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These policies might shore up support for Biden among Democratic base voters at a moment when his candidacy is in doubt. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats now want Biden to withdraw from the race, according to a recent&nbsp; <a href=\"https://apnorc.org/\">AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> poll.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But less than four months from the election is not a time when a candidate should have to worry about drumming up support in any wing of their party. In a normal election, a nominee’s position would be secure; They could spend their time courting swing voters who are <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/insights/2024/5/30/measuring-the-swing-evaluating-the-key-voters-of-2024/#views-key-issues\">especially likely to identify as moderate</a> and whose support they also need to win.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/news/trump-tempers-his-outbursts-in-pitch-for-moderate-voters-b832c901\">appears to be what Trump is doing</a>. His former rivals in the Republican primary have largely rallied around him. The message the former president is pushing at the Republican National Convention (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/17/donald-trump-rally-shooting-unity-message\">however disingenuous</a>) is <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-pivoting-unity-assassination-attempt-1235060318/\">one of unity</a> in a divided America.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden, however, is still seeking to negotiate with his own party for support — a perilous place to be.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Vance as his vice president, he’s picked someone who will egg him on to go very far indeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If I was giving him one piece of advice” for a second term, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets\">Vance said</a> on a 2021 podcast:</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was no idle talk. To an extent unusual for a politician — and perhaps because he hasn’t been in politics very long — Vance is interested in big ideas. He’s been deeply influenced by thinkers on the movement known as the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/11/19/22787269/conservatives-america-chris-rufo-patrick-deneen\">New Right</a>, who want to seize and transform societal institutions they believe are dominated by the left.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A big part of that would involve a restored President Trump purging any resistance to him, or checks on his power, from the executive branch.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vance is deeply committed to the project of seizing institutions away from the left</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has long had figures in orbit urging him to act to remake the executive branch, such as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-wh-strategist-vows-a-daily-fight-for-deconstruction-of-the-administrative-state/2017/02/23/03f6b8da-f9ea-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html\">Steve Bannon</a>, who called for “deconstruction of the administrative state” at the start of his brief White House tenure. In the chaos of Trump’s first term, such plans didn’t get very far at first. Trump grew increasingly frustrated by what he viewed as resistance to his agenda among permanent federal employees and his inability to get “loyal” people in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, younger conservatives on the outside of the administration — like Vance — were wondering why President Trump was struggling to enact his agenda and grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020\">leftward movement</a> of the nation on social justice issues. Many of them gravitated toward explanations offered by writers on the New Right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The New Right put forth an institutional theory for why conservatives couldn’t get what they wanted. Per this theory, the left had ultimate power due to their control of important institutions, from the media and academia to tech companies and the federal bureaucracy. The task ahead for the right was to fight for and seize control of these institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One particularly extreme New Right thinker is the blogger Curtis Yarvin, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug\">whom I profiled in 2022</a>. Yarvin has argued that a new right-wing president should “Retire All Government Employees” — fire them all — and rebuild the government anew. (He also supports toppling American democracy and replacing it with a monarchy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance cited Yarvin approvingly during that podcast appearance in which he discussed how Trump should fire “every civil servant.” He said: “There’s this guy, Curtis Yarvin, who has written about some of these things.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vance would likely push Trump to go further on reshaping the government</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Trump was about to leave office in 2020, he finally got around to trying to do something about the supposed “deep state”: He issued an executive order known as Schedule F.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This order laid the groundwork for reclassifying as many as 50,000 career civil servant jobs as political appointees who could then be fired and replaced by Trump. He was out of office before it could be implemented, however, and Biden quickly revoked it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s been much fear about Trump restoring this policy in his second term, replacing a great many nonpartisan career experts with political hacks or ideologues willing to go along with his extreme or corrupt plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such a move could be implemented in any number of ways, from the more limited and less disruptive to more sweeping and very disruptive. Considering Trump has only intermittent interest in the details of policy and implementation, I’ve thought that how this plays out would depend on who staffs his administration, since he could be pulled in various directions. Advisers worried about chaos and political blowback could counsel restraint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance would not do that. He would be a key voice in Trump’s administration urging him to go very big indeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elsewhere in the podcast, Vance said that the courts would inevitably “stop” Trump from trying to fire so many employees. When they do, Vance went on, Trump should “stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did, and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is: Vance urged that Trump radically remake the executive branch even if the Supreme Court said doing so was illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vance’s Silicon Valley backers also want major disruption to the federal government</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This interest in disruption makes more sense once you know that Vance’s top political backers include several famous figures on the Silicon Valley right — like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/technology/jd-vance-tech-silicon-valley.html\">Peter Thiel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-vp-decision.html\">Elon Musk</a> — who similarly loathe the left and want sweeping overhauls to left-dominated institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thiel has been perhaps the leading intellectual influence on Vance, who as a Yale law student attended a talk Thiel gave at the school in 2011. Vance was starstruck, <a href=\"https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance\">later calling</a> the talk “the most significant moment of my time at Yale Law School” and Thiel “possibly the smartest person I’d ever met.” Vance <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/technology/jd-vance-tech-silicon-valley.html\">soon made</a> Thiel’s acquaintance, eventually getting a job at a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/jd-vance-venture-capital-career\">Thiel-founded</a> investment fund, and much later getting $15 million from Thiel to back his Senate campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thiel has written about his own disillusionment with American institutions, <a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/\">writing in 2009</a>, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” He has also backed many in the New Right, including Yarvin, whose startup <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/24/urbit-is-web3-weird-and-wonderful-and-i-dont-care-who-made-it/\">he funded</a>. (“He’s fully enlightened,” Yarvin later <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism#.rmomGXmLr\">wrote of Thiel</a> in an email, “just plays it very carefully.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk, meanwhile, put the “seize the institutions” strategy into practice when he bought Twitter and remade it <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/elon-musk-has-made-x-more-right-leaning-study-shows?sref=qYiz2hd0\">into a more right-wing-friendly platform</a>. Musk <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html\">cut</a> about 80 percent of the company’s staff and abandoned most content moderation and hate speech policies, sending liberals fleeing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Could Trump and Vance try something similar — taking a wrecking ball to the permanent civil service? Even if the courts try to stop them? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t know for sure, but Vance’s selection increases the odds for maximum chaos in the federal government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are in a late republican period,” Vance <a href=\"https://jackmurphylive.libsyn.com/jd-vance-jml-070\">said in that 2021 podcast</a>, alluding to the fall of the Roman Republic. “If we’re going to push back against it, we’re going to have to get pretty wild, and pretty far out there, and go in directions that a lot of conservatives right now are uncomfortable with.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Donald Trump’s allies have laid out sweeping plans to reshape the executive branch of the federal government if he is returned to power, plans that involve firing perhaps tens of thousands of career civil servants and replacing them with handpicked MAGA allies. But how far, exactly, would Trump go in trying to tear down what [&#8230;]",

Vance as <a href=\"https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1813200322304541042\">signaling</a> a new age of Republican economic populism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this view, until now, the precise ideological contours of Trumpism had been muddy, as the mercurial demagogue oscillated between populist heresies and conservative orthodoxy — vowing to impose <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/20/politics/trump-unveils-controversial-drug-price-rules/index.html\">price controls on pharmaceutical companies</a> one day, fighting to <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/study-trump-tax-cuts-failed-growth-investment.html\">slash taxes</a> for the rich and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/biggest-outrage-of-trumpcare-continues-to-be-medicaid-cuts.html\">gut Medicaid</a> the next.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance is one of the few Republicans who has actually tried to translate Trump’s populist impulses into a coherent agenda, one that “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/15/vance-trump-economy-gop/\">unnerves business elites</a>” and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-oren-cass.html\">thrills</a> “<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/conservative-case-for-organized-labor.html\">pro-worker</a>” conservatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that Trump is 78 and ineligible for a third term, Vance is well-positioned to become the Republican standard-bearer in the near future, a development that could transform the GOP into a worker’s party, according to his populist admirers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance cultivated that impression during his address to the Republican National Convention Wednesday night.&nbsp; Vance characterized the GOP as a movement that would stand up for working-class communities like the one he was raised in and stand against the “ruling class” that had sold them out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re done catering to Wall Street, we’ll commit to the working man,” Vance said. “We’re done importing foreign labor, we’re going to fight for American Citizens and their good jobs and their good wages. We’re done sacrificing supply chains to unlimited global trade and we’re going to stamp more and more products with that beautiful label, ‘Made in the USA.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance’s commitment, though, to flipping the Republican Party’s class allegiances — and his prospects for doing so — have both been greatly exaggerated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">J.D. Vance’s economic outlook is distinct from the market fundamentalism of Ronald Reagan or Paul Ryan. Vance is skeptical of free trade and immigration, believing that both erode the bargaining power of native-born workers by providing corporations access to cheap labor at home and abroad. In his telling, were US employers forced to rely on a smaller labor pool, they would have no choice but to pay higher wages and invest more in productivity-enhancing technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance also supports state subsidies for the domestic production of cutting-edge products. As a Senate candidate, Vance <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jd-vance-quietly-supports-bill-his-gop-allies-hate-and-his-opponent-tim-ryan-sponsored\">voiced support</a> for Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, which subsidizes semiconductor manufacturers who operate in the United States. Once in Congress, he co-authored <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-baldwin-vance-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-ensure-taxpayer-funded-inventions-are-made-in-america\">bipartisan legislation</a> that would require companies that develop new technologies with taxpayer support to manufacture the resulting products within the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He has also been willing to antagonize discrete segments of the capitalist class. With Elizabeth Warren, he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/01/warren-vance-failed-banking-crackdown-bill-00099579\">cosponsored</a> a bill that would claw back the pay of executives at large failed banks, a measure aimed at discouraging reckless risk-taking. And he has given <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/15/vance-trump-economy-gop/\">rhetorical support</a> to the Biden administration’s aggressive antitrust enforcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most heretically, Vance <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91157177/j-d-vance-says-he-is-pro-worker-heres-what-he-really-believes\">claims to support</a> organized labor in theory, even if he’s less than enthusiastic about the trade union movement that actually exists. The senator has said that more American workers should be able to collectively bargain over pay and benefits but that the mainstream labor movement is <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-content/2024/07/jd-vance-vice-president-donald-trump-republican-ticket\">“irreconcilably hostile to Republicans</a>” and that left-wing unions like Starbucks Workers United <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054\">deserve conservatives’ opposition</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, Vance’s ascension to the highest echelon of Republican politics is unlikely to transform the GOP into an effective steward of working-class interests. This is true for (at least) four reasons:</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">1) Where Vance’s ideas have broad Republican buy-in — as on trade and immigration — his policy preferences would be more likely to reduce native-born Americans’ living standards than increase them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">2) Vance’s concrete legislative proposals for increasing government intervention in the economy have tepid support from other Republicans and in any case would have only a marginal impact on US workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">3) The Republican Party is structurally incapable of acting on Vance’s genuinely radical ideas about organized labor and the Ohio senator has done absolutely nothing to advance them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">4) The GOP has little incentive to betray the interests of its most well-heeled and organized constituencies for the sake of better serving working-class voters. After all, the party has already discovered that it can grow its support among blue-collar workers without making any significant concessions to their material interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Vance’s views on trade and immigration are anti-market but not pro-worker</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance is nothing if not an economic nationalist. He favors dramatically reducing immigration — particularly of undocumented and low-skill workers — and protecting domestic goods producers through expansive tariffs, such as Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs\">proposal for a 10 percent across-the-board duty</a> on all foreign imports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s unclear how many Republicans support trade restrictions that radical. Trump has succeeded in cultivating broad support within the GOP for at least some forms of protectionism and immigration restriction.&nbsp;Yet such nationalism offers little of material value to the typical American worker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance detailed his populist case for immigration and trade restrictions in an interview with the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/opinion/jd-vance-interview.html\">New York Times</a> in May. In his account, both free trade and expansive immigration erode American workers’ living standards by reducing their bargaining power: If companies can access laborers who hail from poorer countries (and thus have lower wage expectations) — whether they come to the United States or employers go to them — then native-born Americans will be unable to compete unless they accept lower compensation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two fundamental problems with this outlook. The first is that there is little evidence that immigration substantially harms native-born workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance is correct that workers benefit from tight labor markets, where firms are forced to bid against each other for scarce employees, but high levels of immigration are compatible with such markets. When immigrants enter America, they expand the economy’s labor supply but also its labor demand, since immigrants (like all humans) consume goods and services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The immigrant share of America’s labor force surged as the Covid-19 pandemic eased, hitting <a href=\"https://x.com/hshierholz/status/1759990590115021159\">a record high in 2023</a>. This did not prevent US workers from seeing <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES0500000003\">large increases</a> in their nominal wages and reductions in unemployment over the same period, as demand for labor in many sectors outstripped its supply.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is plausible that a sudden surge of less-skilled immigrants into a given local labor market might, for a period of time, reduce the bargaining power of similarly skilled native-born workers in some sectors. Viewed in the aggregate, though, high levels of immigration appear to be economically beneficial for the native-born working class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The theory that immigrants drive down wages and employment opportunities for the native-born has been repeatedly tested. The consensus of the empirical literature suggests they generally do not. Studies have searched for an adverse impact on wages or jobs from the <a href=\"https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/1050-is-it-merely-a-labor-supply-shock-impacts-of-syrian-migrants-on-local-economies-in-turkey\">mass influx of displaced Syrians into Turkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13276/w13276.pdf\">Dust Bowl migrants</a>’ immigration to other parts of the US during the Great Depression, <a href=\"http://www.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.123856.1360740401!/menu/standard/file/SULCIS%20WP%2020131.pdf\">refugee migration to Sweden between 1999 and 2007</a>, refugees immigrating to <a href=\"http://ftp.iza.org/dp8961.pdf\">Denmark in the 1980s and ’90s</a>, the mass movement of <a href=\"https://tad.colman.ac.il/paper-all/8212.pdf\">Russian Jews to Israel after the fall of the USSR</a> — and in every case, found none. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y\">Meta-analyses</a> of the research on <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088876\">immigration’s labor-market impacts</a> have found little to no negative consequences for native workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By contrast, empirical evidence strongly suggests that immigration increases labor productivity. A <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32389\">recent working paper</a> from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that, between 2000 and 2019, immigration to the U.S. increased the wages of non-college-educated native-born workers by enabling a greater degree of labor specialization and, thus, productivity. Research from Harvard economist George Borjas <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2001/01/2001a_bpea_borjas.pdf\">has similarly</a> found that immigration increases labor efficiency, thereby producing between $5 billion and $10 billion worth of economic value for native-born workers each year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, immigration increases the ratio of prime-age workers to senior citizens in the United States, which makes it <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2024071633/social-security-depends-on-immigrants-especially-those-in-the-us-unlawfully\">easier to sustain entitlements</a> at existing benefit levels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another problem with Vance’s plan to increase working-class prosperity through economic nationalism is that tariffs benefit manufacturing workers at the expense of all other workers, and the former comprise only a tiny minority of the US labor force. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/economy/manufacturing-jobs/index.html#:~:text=Today%20less%20than%2010%25%20of,81%25%20more%20than%20retail%20jobs.\">Fewer than 10 percent</a> of American workers are employed in the manufacturing sector. That is not merely a consequence of trade policy: Even at the end of World War II, only a minority of US workers labored in a factory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most US workers will therefore be primarily consumers of physical goods rather than producers of them, even if trade protection increases manufacturing employment at the margin. As a result, tariffs reduce the purchasing power of the typical American worker without increasing their bargaining power. At a time when Americans have expressed a profound sensitivity to rising prices, it is unlikely that many US workers would respond positively to a 10 percent tax on all foreign-made goods, were Trump and Vance to put their tariff plan into place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Vance’s support for small-scale populist reforms is clear. The authenticity of his avowed desire for radically increasing worker power is not.&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of Vance’s more idiosyncratic populist proposals are often more worthwhile. The senator’s plans, however, for increasing <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2023/03/22/vance-rail-safety-legislation-is-not-big-government/\">safety regulations in the railway industry</a>, punishing reckless bankers, and promoting domestic production of advanced technologies have won very limited support from fellow Republicans. As a result, none have made it into law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is conceivable that the GOP might grow more open to these reforms were Vance to eventually win the presidency, but only because they do not threaten to dramatically shift the balance of power between business owners and workers in the United States. Perhaps a Vance-led Republican Party might be willing to antagonize a small segment of corporate America, such as the executives of failed banks or railroad companies, but increasing labor’s leverage over capital throughout the economy is a different story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance has expressed interest in that radical pursuit. In <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-content/2024/07/jd-vance-vice-president-donald-trump-republican-ticket\">an interview</a> with the populist conservative Sohrab Ahmari, the senator voiced support for sectoral bargaining: an arrangement in which all the workers in a given industry collectively bargain with all of its employers over minimum pay, benefits, and working conditions. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/09/the-nerd-trying-to-turn-the-gop-populist.html\">Oren Cass</a>, a conservative policy wonk closely aligned with Vance, has also endorsed such a system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sectoral bargaining would radically change America’s political economy, to the benefit of workers. Low-wage employers would no longer be able to secure a competitive advantage through union-busting, and the overwhelming majority of American workers who do not belong to a union would win greater leverage over their bosses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Vance has not introduced legislation to establish a system of sectoral bargaining. In fact, as far as I can tell, he only mentions that policy when <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054\">asked by reporters</a> why he does not support any of the existing bills to increase union power in America, such as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22319838/house-passes-pro-act-unions\">the PRO Act</a> (Vance’s line is that the bill would further consolidate the nation’s status-quo labor model instead of moving it toward a sectoral system).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, although Vance has rhetorically <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91157177/j-d-vance-says-he-is-pro-worker-heres-what-he-really-believes\">opposed right-to-work laws</a> (which undermine unions’ finances by enabling workers who benefit from collective bargaining to shirk dues) and stood for <a href=\"https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-visits-uaw-picket-line-in-toledo-ohio/\">photo-ops with striking workers</a>, while in office he has done little to nothing to aid organized labor. In 2023, Vance voted with <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/jd-vance\">the AFL-CIO</a> on 0 percent of the positions it endorsed; the average among all Senate Republicans was 3 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond strengthening unions, federal policymakers can increase workers’ leverage by expanding the welfare state, thereby making it easier for Americans to walk away from exploitative employers. Yet Vance has evinced little interest in growing the safety net. Although he shares Trump’s rhetorical opposition to cutting Medicare or Social Security’s retirement benefits, Vance has not proposed any major new social programs. He has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/15/vance-trump-economy-gop/\">pledged to the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist</a> that he will oppose any proposal for raising taxes and told the Times that America can’t run “massive structural deficits indefinitely,” a pair of stances that effectively prohibit large expansions of social benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The GOP is a party of, by, and for bosses</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if Vance’s alleged “pro-labor” politics were indisputably genuine and thoroughgoing, the odds of the GOP embracing an authentically pro-worker agenda would be slim.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is true that the Republican coalition has grown markedly more working-class over the past eight years. In every presidential election between 1948 and 2012, white voters in the top 5 percent of America’s income distribution <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasjwood/status/1375231548237213699\">were more Republican</a> than those in the bottom 95 percent. Since Trump’s ascent, this pattern has reversed, with rich whites voting to the left of middle-class and poor ones in both 2016 and 2020. In the latter election, Trump made some gains with <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/why-democrats-are-losing-ground-with-hispanic-voters.html\">working-class nonwhite voters,</a> and polls suggest he is poised to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/351563/one-explanation-for-the-2024-elections-biggest-mystery\">build on those gains</a> in November.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Among <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electionstudies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@electionstudies</a> 2020 respondents, Trump replicated his (poor) 2016 performance among high income whites. <a href=\"https://t.co/T6HSTIrMRS\">pic.twitter.com/T6HSTIrMRS</a></p>&mdash; Tom Wood (@thomasjwood) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasjwood/status/1375231548237213699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But just because Republican voters are getting more blue-collar doesn’t mean that the party’s agenda will inevitably get more pro-worker. When it comes to determining the content of a party’s policies, the views its voters express in opinion polls matter less than the demands its most powerful interest groups lay out in memos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump voters might be a bit more sympathetic to labor than Mitt Romney’s voters were in 2012. Economically left-leaning Republican voters, though, are not organized; they do not collectively fund institutions that monitor GOP lawmakers’ voting behavior and punish disloyalty through negative ad campaigns. Right-wing Republican capitalists do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2016/10/12/study-republicans-are-24-percent-more-likely-than-democrats-to-be-business-owners/\">Business owners</a> in general — and staunchly anti-union ones, in particular — form the backbone of the institutional GOP. This is part of the New Deal’s long legacy: Once the Democratic Party aligned itself with organized labor, American businesses that could not tolerate an alliance with unions because their operations were labor-intensive and their profit margins were thin <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3624792.html\">sorted into the GOP</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through industry lobbies like the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers — and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Hands-Making-Conservative-Movement/dp/0393059308\">myriad think tanks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/29/18629799/federalist-society-brett-kavanaugh-olin-foundation-jane-mayer\">legal organizations</a> bankrolled by industrialists — anti-union businesses built the literal and figurative foundations of the conservative movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They have remained very much in control of the GOP in the Trump era. During his first term as president, Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/24/21078559/republicans-tax-cuts-congress-profits\">enacted large tax cuts for businesses</a> and appointed a conservative National Labor Relations Board, which made it <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/\">more difficult for workers to organize</a>, particularly at <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2017/12/15/16780404/joint-employer-nlrb-trump\">low-paying fast food franchises.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Business owners’ supremacy in the GOP may be most vivid at the state level. As Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/opinion/the-small-business-tyrant-has-a-favorite-political-party.html\">has noted</a>, over the past two years, Republican lawmakers in Texas, Florida, Kentucky, and Louisiana have advanced legislation rolling back such basic worker protections as mandatory water breaks for outdoor workers, restrictions on working hours for child laborers, and lunch breaks for working minors. In some cases, the lawmakers backing these bills were business owners themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance’s selection will not change the class composition of the Republican Party’s political class nor shift the fundamental material interests of the most well-organized and well-resourced interest groups in conservative America. Even if the Trump-Vance ticket succeeds in expanding the GOP’s blue-collar wing, that will not reduce elected Republicans’ incentives to cater to low-road employers. To the contrary, if Trump proves yet again that Republicans can win working-class votes merely through immigration restrictionism and populist gestures, they will have little reason to offer such voters forms of material uplift that would threaten corporate America’s profit margins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The GOP is far less likely to remake itself in Vance’s image than vice-versa. After all, the vice presidential nominee has already proven willing to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">transform himself ideologically</a> as the political winds shift. Between 2016 and his Senate race in 2022, Vance went from being <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/opioid-of-the-masses/489911/\">a NeverTrump conservative</a> to an unabashed <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html\">champion of the January 6 rioters</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The path of least resistance for a power-hungry Republican in today’s GOP is to be a populist in the streets but a servant of the bosses in the C-suites. In all likelihood, ambition will guide Vance in that direction. Or at least, so the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html\">militantly anti-labor</a> <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-and-tucker-carlson-secretly-lobbied-trump-to-pick-jd-vance\">tech</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/technology/jd-vance-tech-silicon-valley.html\">billionaires</a> who propelled him to the vice presidential nomination seem to believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, 11:30 pm ET:</strong> This story has been updated with quotes from Vance&#8217;s speech at the RNC.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s a barrage of deals that few can refuse, made even sweeter by Amazon’s same-day, one-day, or two-day delivery service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unsurprisingly, it’s an incredibly profitable day for Amazon. Last Prime Day, the company saw <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/prime-day-shopping-numbers/index.html\">$12.7 billion</a> in sales and <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/7/first-day-of-prime-day-was-the-single-largest-sales-day-ever-on-amazon-helping-make-this-the-biggest-prime-day-event-ever\">over 375 million items purchased</a>, the largest numbers it’s seen since Prime Day launched nearly 10 years ago in 2015. Adobe Analytics, an organization that studies e-commerce data, predicted that this year’s sale will be another record-breaker, with a forecast of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-sales-hit-record-14-billion-data-firm-says-2024-07-15/\">$14 billion dollars</a> in sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Amazon’s <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/7/amazons-10th-prime-day-event-offers-deep-discounts-and-millions-of-deals-from-top-brands-exclusively-for-prime-members\">self-proclaimed customer celebration</a> comes at a cost. While Prime members can purchase goods with the ease of a few clicks year-round, getting those millions of products to arrive at their doorsteps in just a day or two is far more intensive — and even dangerous, as <a href=\"https://thesoc.org/what-we-do/same-day-injury-amazon-fails-to-deliver-safe-jobs/\">research</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/16/bernie-sanders-amazon-investigation/\">investigations</a> into the company show — for the warehouse workers and delivery drivers that Amazon employs and relies on. The speed and scale is worse on Prime Day, when even more consumers are buying things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Workers have long been vocal about the risks they face on the job to keep up with consumer demands. On July 15, the eve of Prime Day, a group of former and current Amazon workers <a href=\"https://x.com/warehouse_life/status/1812915104805232652\">showed up to the corporation’s New York City office</a> to deliver stories from workers about injuries and deaths on the job and to request a meeting with the vice president of Amazon’s Global Workplace Health and Safety, Sarah Rhoads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speakers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LifeInWarehouses/videos/1199344564846918?notif_id=1721059868993828&amp;notif_t=live_video_schedule_viewer&amp;ref=notif\">shared</a> their experiences of getting hurt, being overworked, and being denied workers’ compensation. One of the banners held up by workers read, “Same-day delivery, lifetime of injury.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It shouldn’t shock anyone that working in a warehouse for long hours can be grueling, tiresome work. But the frequency at which Amazon workers are hurt on the job — with injuries ranging from musculoskeletal disorders developed from <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/hazardous-by-design-after-pandemic-boom-amazon-faces-safety-reckoning/\">repetitive, uncomfortable movements and heavy lifting</a> to <a href=\"https://prismreports.org/2023/11/06/amazon-workers-injuries/\">broken bones</a> — is not the industry standard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Prime Day’s pressure on workers</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kat Cole, a worker at Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, and an organizer with the Democratic Reform Caucus of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), says that regardless of what time of year it is, working a shift at one of Amazon’s warehouses is difficult. But during the week of the Prime Day sales, the pressure is up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You have people breathing down your neck,” Cole told Vox. That increased volume of work puts stress on workers and leads to more injuries, she added. She’s no stranger to injuries herself, even outside of Prime Day and other big sales weeks. “I go home with at least one huge black and blue bruise on my legs, at least once a week.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161655440.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.737892056687,100,78.524215886627\" alt=\"A person wearing a yellow safety vest scans an apple-branded package in a warehouse.\" title=\"A person wearing a yellow safety vest scans an apple-branded package in a warehouse.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A worker prepares an Apple iPad package at an Amazon same-day delivery fulfillment center on Prime Day, in the Bronx, New York City, on July 16, 2024. | Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She says her coworkers have suffered from a variety of injuries and illnesses while on the job: concussions, slipped discs, a sprained wrist, a broken ankle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Luke Cianciotto, an Amazon delivery driver in the northern Chicago area, says the increased workload doesn’t just include more deliveries. To accommodate for the influx of work on Prime Day, he says more drivers are hired leading up to it, and more veteran drivers are tasked with training them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What ends up happening is you put these drivers on the road, setting them up for failure,” Cianciotto told Vox. “They do a bad job. And they don’t deserve that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Cianciotto and his fellow delivery drivers have been on <a href=\"https://teamster.org/2024/06/illinois-amazon-drivers-strike-over-unfair-labor-practices/\">strike for the last three weeks</a>, his experience with Prime Day in the past includes drivers working late into the night, delivering hundreds upon hundreds of packages that fill their vans “wall to wall, floor to ceiling.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On an average week for full-time Amazon warehouse employees, shifts can be anywhere between 10 to 12 hours. Cole said that during weeks with increased consumer demand from events like Prime Day, it’s common for Amazon to schedule “mandatory extra time” — additional hours or days added on to workers’ shifts to assist with these surges, on top of this already demanding schedule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Prime Day being in the middle of July, some Amazon employees aren’t just working under extra pressure — they’re <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections\">working through severe heat, too</a>, with temperatures rising as high as 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the warehouse. At the JFK8 facility, Cole and her fellow union organizers have taken it upon themselves to hand out Gatorade and ice pops to her coworkers before they start their shifts. Cole says Amazon will put up signs reminding people that the company cares and to take breaks. Amazon will also try to “lighten the mood,” Cole says, with novelties like DJs or offering lemonade. But she says that’s not what workers need.<br><br>“They need the warehouse to be cooler, they need safer working conditions, they need to know that they can take these breaks when they need them without penalty or retaliation,” Cole said. “That’s what we need.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Shipping may be free, but the labor behind it comes at a price</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In today’s market, companies are competing with Amazon by offering their <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/360028/amazon-prime-day-2024-target-walmart-temu\">own version of Prime Day sales</a> and rapid delivery dates. But even with growing competition from the likes of Target and Walmart, Amazon is still one of the leaders in the pack of e-commerce giants — and that includes leading in workplace injuries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April 2021, the company published <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders\">a letter from then-CEO Jeff Bezos</a> about its commitment to being “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.” Just a month later, the company <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2021/5/from-body-mechanics-to-mindfulness-amazon-launches-employee-designed-health-and-safety-program-called-workingwell-across-u-s-operations\">announced</a> its health and safety program called WorkingWell, with a goal to cut its recordable incident rate (RIR) — or how often injuries or illness occur in the workplace per 100 full-time employees&nbsp;— in half by 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the announcement was made, the RIR was 7.6 per 100 full-time employees, according to Amazon’s most recent <a href=\"https://cdn-safety.aboutamazon.com/ea/c3/d72d03394d0db22e336048031ec8/amazon-safety-report-2022-v41.pdf\">annual safety report</a>. Amazon would need to reduce its incident rate by at least 10 percent each year in order to slash the RIR by half. In 2022, the RIR was 6.7, a reduction of 11.8 percent from the previous year, appearing to be on track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But one <a href=\"https://thesoc.org/what-we-do/same-day-injury-amazon-fails-to-deliver-safe-jobs/\">report</a> released this past May from <a href=\"https://thesoc.org/\">the Strategic Organizing Center</a> (SOC), a coalition of labor unions, challenges Amazon’s self-report. In its analysis of data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the center found that in 2022, there were 6.9 injuries for every 100 full-time employees, compared to 7.9 injuries in 2021. That’s an injury reduction of 12.7 percent in Amazon facilities, which includes warehouses, logistics, and delivery facilities. While these numbers are slightly different from the ones found in Amazon’s safety report, that’s still a notable decrease. But in 2023, SOC found in its report that those numbers only fell to 6.5 injuries per 100 full-time employees — a reduction of 5.8 percent, just a little over half of what it needs to average each year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">SOC researchers also noted that while these numbers fell from 2021 to 2023, injuries that required workers to be reassigned to lighter duties increased, while injuries that necessitated losing time at work decreased. There are two ways to interpret this: one being that Amazon has taken steps to meaningfully reduce severe injuries that would require an absence from work. The other possibility is that Amazon has shifted workers into lighter duties to keep them working when they should be resting and recovering from their injuries, which is misleading and puts workers at risk of injuring themselves again.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/final_workplace_injuries.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,21.425411105376,100,57.149177789249\" alt=\"Chart titled &quot;workplace injuries reported at Amazon facilities,&quot; showing a sharp increase in light duty cases and a decrease in lost time cases.\" title=\"Chart titled &quot;workplace injuries reported at Amazon facilities,&quot; showing a sharp increase in light duty cases and a decrease in lost time cases.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latter is what SOC has claimed Amazon is doing. Amazon’s own reasoning is not too far from this assertion: In its 2022 annual safety report, the company said that one of the main drivers of reducing the number of injuries that required time away from work was its “Return to Work” program, allowing workers to “continue to work while recovering from work-related injuries or illnesses.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cole&nbsp;— who was born with only one hand and uses a prosthetic arm — has experienced the push back to work soon after an injury. Once during a shift, she injured her hand and went to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-first-aid-clinics-push-injured-employees-to-keep-working/\">AmCare</a>, Amazon’s in-house first aid clinic. “I was in a lot of pain,” Cole said. After wrapping her hand up, management told her to return back to work. “I said, ‘Listen, I have one hand. I live with this hand. And it’s injured right now. I’m not going back on the floor to injure it further.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The SOC report also found that there were more than 38,300 recordable injuries at Amazon facilities in 2023 alone, with 94 percent of the injuries identified by SOC as serious — meaning employees were either placed on lighter work duties or forced to miss work entirely. It also found that Amazon’s serious injury rate was more than twice as high as non-Amazon warehouses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Injuries become much more common during events like Prime Day and other big sales, too. The week of Prime Day 2023, there were 1,066 recorded cases of serious injuries at Amazon facilities, according to the SOC report — the highest number of injuries recorded all year, and far above the average of 691 injuries per week. Those cases represented a 48 percent increase in injuries from the previous week, and were followed closely by cases recorded on Cyber Monday (1,015 serious injuries) and Prime Big Deals Day (898 serious injuries).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an email to Vox, Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel called the SOC report “misleading,” emphasizing that the switch-up between rates and raw numbers builds a “false narrative” and that the report should start at 2019, which would indicate a reduction to injuries by 28 percent.  “The fact is, there are far more people working in the buildings during these times and more total hours worked by those employees,” she wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee launched a yearlong investigation into Amazon’s labor practices. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/16/bernie-sanders-amazon-investigation/\">the Washington Post</a>, an interim report, led by committee chair <a href=\"https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/senator-bernie-sanders-help-committee-dangers-injuries-warehouses-amazon-prime-day-518713/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/senator-bernie-sanders-help-committee-dangers-injuries-warehouses-amazon-prime-day-518713/\">Senator Bernie Sanders</a>, found that nearly 45 out of 100 employees were injured during the week of Prime Day in 2019, and injuries peaked again during other holiday sales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon, which had cooperated with the investigation, pushed back on Senator Sanders’s preliminary report via an email to Vox, saying it “ignores our progress and paints a one-sided, false narrative using only a fraction of the information we’ve provided.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The HELP Committee is not the only federal investigation that’s found Amazon to have troubling safety issues. From January 2023 to August 2023, <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region2/08032023\">several investigations</a> from OSHA found that Amazon <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/01182023\">exposed</a> workers to well-known <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/02232023-0\">ergonomic hazards</a>, like lifting packages up and down constantly, handling heavy items, and bending and twisting in awkward positions, all for hours at a time. “Amazon’s operating methods are creating hazardous work conditions and processes, leading to serious worker injuries,&#8221; said assistant secretary for occupational safety and health Doug Parker in a February 2023 <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/02012023\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">OSHA also found that when Amazon workers were injured, the company failed to provide treatment. In one news release from OSHA, the agency <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/04282023\">wrote</a> that “at least six employees with head injuries and four with back injuries did not receive timely, necessary medical care.” Amazon disagreed with OSHA’s characterizations and appealed them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Amazon Labor Union (ALU), which has won only one election with the workers of Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, has made safe working conditions one of its primary goals in a first contract. However, Amazon still refuses to recognize the union and, in turn, has made no movement on its side to bargaining a collective agreement. There’s also been <a href=\"https://labornotes.org/2023/07/reform-caucus-rises-sues-elections-amazon-labor-union\">conflict</a> within the union on how to best bring Amazon to the bargaining table and organize other warehouses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in June, the ALU <a href=\"https://labornotes.org/2024/06/amazon-workers-affiliate-teamsters-next-electing-top-officers\">voted to affiliate</a> with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — a powerful union with resources that could help change the tides for the workers of JFK8 and other Amazon facilities. That same month, the New York State Assembly passed <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S5081/amendment/A\">the Warehouse Worker Injury Reduction Act</a>, which now sits on Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/read-amazons-response-to-oxfams-workplace-safety-allegations\">rejected</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/02/amazon-safety-citations-osha-department-of-justice\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/02/amazon-safety-citations-osha-department-of-justice\">claims</a> that it’s not meaningfully working to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/18/amazon-working-conditions-safety-osha-doj/\">improve workplace safety</a>. But even if we take it at its word, the data shows that it still has a long way to go before it can call itself “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, July 17, 6 pm ET:</strong> This story, published July 17, has been updated to include statements from Amazon.

J.D. Vance attends the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 15, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. | Win McNamee/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21547862/hillbilly-elegy-netflix-explained-rural-vance\">no fan</a> of <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, the 2020 movie starring Amy Adams and Glenn Close, but when I picked up the book it’s based on recently, in light of rumors that its author, J.D. Vance, would be Donald Trump’s pick for vice president, I expected it to feel more substantive than its screen adaptation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At one time, liberal and conservative centrists alike <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/2/2/14404770/jd-vance-trump-hillbilly-elegy-ezra-klein-show\">hailed</a> Vance’s bestselling 2016 memoir of making it out of rural, poverty-stricken Appalachia, transforming himself from a tempestuous teen into a successful Yale law school grad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet years on, Vance has undergone a transformation of a different sort, remolding himself from a fairly moderate professed conservative who once compared Trump to Hitler and wrote with disdain about the outer edges of the party into a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">would-be authoritarian</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not to say Vance doesn’t have some nuanced and even appealing positions. His populist economic instincts are a running theme of <em>Elegy</em>, and today he makes deals across the aisle with Democrats like Sen. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/05/j-d-vance-senate-banks-00104432\">Elizabeth Warren</a>. But to understand his larger worldview, you have to look past his economic ideas to his social ideas — and to what Vance actually displays about himself throughout the book.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps readers in 2016 were eager to look past the book’s <a href=\"https://thenewinquiry.com/hillbilly-ethnography/\">highly loaded subtext</a> and overt classism, as the promise of a sympathetic conservative who could unlock Trumplandia for liberals was just too appealing. It also seems likely that readers loved the book because it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/16/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-appalachia\">confirmed</a> all of the negative stereotypes they already held about country hicks. As a read on Vance himself, though, in the context of his subsequent embrace of Trump and far-right ideology, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> paints a portrait of a man obsessed with status — and brimming with contempt for just about everyone he meets.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why it was deceptively easy to buy Vance as an objective voice for Trump’s America</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> was released in the summer of 2016, Vance was a complete unknown, a Yale Law grad working for Peter Thiel’s investment firm in San Francisco. Panic over a potential Trump presidency was flourishing, and the culture was awash in works purporting to explain to an alarmed public how exactly we arrived at a moment that for many had seemed unthinkable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/6/12803636/arlie-hochschild-strangers-land-louisiana-trump\">one of</a> several <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/books/review-white-trash-ruminates-on-an-american-underclass.html\">books</a> that appeared on the scene around the same time that&nbsp;gained praise for its insights into Trump voters and the psychology of non-coastal, working-class whites. <em>Elegy</em> won fans for Vance’s engaging storytelling and what many people saw as a window into a different world, though it also <a href=\"https://people.com/is-jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-true-story-all-about-the-memoir-8678366\">drew skepticism</a> for allegedly fabricated anecdotes and broad generalizations about the rural poor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s astonishing to me — though perhaps it shouldn’t be — that <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> managed to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/19/14322998/keith-ellison-dnc-ezra-klein\">seduce</a> as many liberals as it did given that Vance’s scorn for almost everyone in his poverty-stricken small Ohio town reverberates on every page. He doesn’t do a very good job of disguising it, but he does arguably try — he occasionally tells us he feels empathy, while rarely actually displaying any. Early on, he writes, “I’m not arguing that we deserve more sympathy than other folks.” This comes immediately after demonizing a co-worker he once had because he was consistently late or absent from work, and who seems to represent the larger ailment among “hillbillies” he claims to want to diagnose. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though he seems to hate his community full of deadbeats, drug addicts, fat people, and “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12583376/welfare-reform-history-clinton-lillie-harden\">welfare queens</a>,” we’re supposed to read his portrayal as enlightening and empathetic because he’s constantly feinting briefly toward gentleness. “There are no villains in this story,” he tells us early on; except <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is full of them. Throughout the book, he frequently makes assumptions about the motivations and life circumstances of the people around him and rails against them for what he sees as their lazy, unmotivated, or bizarre choices. Indeed, more sympathy does not seem to be his concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even the book’s title is a manipulation. As <a href=\"https://cardinalnews.org/2022/09/12/st-paul-lawyer-authors-book-that-says-j-d-vance-is-a-fake-hillbilly/\">many people</a> have <a href=\"https://beltmag.com/jd-vance-long-con-hillbilly-elegy/\">pointed out,</a> Vance didn’t actually grow up as a fabled “hillbilly”; he merely spent some of his summers in Appalachia as a child. When he’s describing the small town of Middletown, Ohio, where he grew up, the first thing he focuses on is the town’s socioeconomic decline, unlike his more affectionate descriptions of the topography of rural Kentucky and detailed character profiles of his family there. He’s at pains to make sure we understand how much he hated it there, and how much his heart truly belonged with his renegade redneck family across the Kentucky border. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Middletown, his focus on the town’s economics, its rising “residential segregation” into concentrated areas of working-class poor, and the row of decaying mansions on Main Street, all reveal his obsession with class and upward mobility. It’s a fixation that underpins the book. “Looking back, I don’t know if the ‘really poor’ areas and my block were any different, or whether these divisions were the constructs of a mind that didn’t want to believe it was <em>really</em> poor,” he admits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In all of the many moments where he demonizes the poor people in his orbit, Vance fails to offer or even consider the broader context of what’s happening with his community that might drive people to lives of penury and misery. He rails against drug addicts and provides a close, painful look at his family’s own battle with addictions, particularly his mother — but he never mentions the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2024/1/16/24033590/treatment-opioid-addiction-crisis-2024\">opioid crisis</a> or the role companies and policy played in&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/19/1008304465/revisiting-two-cities-at-the-front-line-of-the-war-on-drugs\">ravaging rural communities</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We created these problems, not the government, not a corporation,” he insists, despite having <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/senate-panel-investigates-drug-company-ties-to-pain-groups\">plenty</a> of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-20/purdue-says-kentucky-suit-over-oxycontin-could-be-painful\">evidence</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/who-is-responsible-for-the-pain-pill-epidemic\">contrary</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Vance’s contempt for other people becomes <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></strong>’s refrain</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance is, of course, a conservative, and the focus on individual failing rather than systemic failures is to be expected. But what’s striking about <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, especially in the context of his recent turn toward Trumpian populism, is its disdain for people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even as he’s trying to define himself as part of one in-group or another, be it the Scots-Irish or the “hillbillies,” he can’t stop shaming and distancing himself from the other people in it. His characterizations of his community and the people in it thrum with disgust and a deep sense of remove. As someone who grew up in a similar world, it would never even occur to me to feel for my own rural small Southern town the loathing Vance seems to feel for his, and the fact Vance never even second-guesses his own level of antipathy is one of the more chilling aspects of the book.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He simultaneously praises his family for saving him from his town and himself while constantly repudiating them and everything they represent. His grandparents, whom he credits with essentially elevating his life and teaching him wholesome values, were both left-leaning, compassionate folk (his grandfather was a lifelong Democrat and union man, his grandmother “a radical conservative or a European-style social Democrat depending on her mood”) who advocated standing up for the little guy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Vance almost never actively empathizes with anyone else in the book. At one point he gets into a schoolyard fight on behalf of a weaker student, but seems more excited by the fighting than the prospect of justice itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For everyone beyond his grandparents, his older sister, and then, later, a couple of women at Yale, Vance’s contempt is more overt. The book drips with open disgust for his neighbors, his town, his government and its representatives, and frequently, his mother. It’s full of casual fat-shaming for the bodies around him as well as his own, and constant complaints that no one around him wants to work hard enough to earn a better life for themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, he also distances himself from the upper class. He seems determined to convince us that he’s superior and detached from the higher social strata into which he’s been inducted. Even after he’s ensconced in law school, he claims to mistrust the people around him, including the dean of his college and random people who enter his life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In one truly bizarre anecdote, he has an anxiety-induced fantasy about a random woman at a gas pump, and how she and her nephew, who attends Yale like Vance, must be sitting around mocking all of the hillbillies in his town. There’s zero basis for this bout of paranoia; like most of the book, it seems predicated on assumptions that seem reasonable and normal in Vance’s own head, but which feel baffling and unfounded — and often blatantly classist — when he lays them out for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To account for his mistrust, he makes&nbsp;confident blanket assertions that Scots-Irish people — yes, all of us — “do not like outsiders or people who are different from us, whether the difference lies in how they look, how they act, or, most important, how they talk.” While sentiments like these emphasize his theme of being unified with the underclass, they also differentiate himself and “his people” within that class based on their whiteness. This view seems much darker in retrospect, given where Vance and the Republican Party are in 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance acknowledges that both he and his sister still grapple with trust issues as adults due to their childhood experiences of violence, addiction, and abandonment; yet something about the mistrust he displays in <em>Elegy</em> seems consciously deployed. “There were two kinds of people,” he confesses at one point. “[T]hose whom I’d behave around because I wanted to impress them and those whom I’d behave around to avoid embarrassing myself. The latter people were outsiders.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In all this posturing and misdirection, there are, however, two moments in the book when he potentially gives himself away — by which I mean, he may be offering us a glimpse of the man whom Sen. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/11/mitt-romney-retiring-senate-trump-mcconnell/675306/\">Mitt Romney has claimed to despise</a> because of his perceived ability to shapeshift into an entirely new person when it’s convenient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first is during a job interview, when, momentarily thrown by the question, “Why do you want to work at a law firm?” Vance blurts out, “I don’t really know, but the pay isn’t bad! Ha ha!”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This wouldn’t seem so revealing, except that Vance tells us repeatedly that he often did things in law school just because they were expected of him — because this was how one gained impressive resume points or networked or got ahead. When he desperately tries to win a job as a clerk for a prominent judge, he tells us, “I didn’t know why I was doing it. Maybe, with my Southern drawl and lack of a family pedigree, I felt like I needed proof that I belonged at Yale Law. Or maybe I was just following the herd. Regardless of the reason, I needed to have this credential.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At that point, a law school professor seems to see right through him. “I don’t think you’re doing this for the right reasons. I think you’re doing this for the credential,” she tells him. His self-interest and careerism are clear even in a place where self-interest and careerism are the order of the day.&nbsp;Though he listens to her and drops pursuit of the job, mainly because it would require that much time away from his girlfriend (who he later married), he later resumes his job search; his mentor’s advice ultimately didn’t sway him from taking the path toward prestige.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this creates the picture of a man who wants to be seen as a populist hero, a common man risen from the working class into a fairy tale story of success. But throughout <em>Elegy</em>, he unwittingly shows us how much he’s motivated not by empathy or love but by naked ambition and a desperation to be anywhere but here — “here” usually meaning around other people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This might be the real takeaway from <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> — not that Vance is an anti-elitist, but that he is, to his core, anti-humanist. He may be saying the right words, intermittently pointing the reader toward signs of his compassion for the heartland.

However, the melting of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/greenland\">Greenland</a> and Antarctic ice sheets due to human-caused global heating has been redistributing water stored at high latitudes into the world’s oceans, leading to more water in the seas nearer the equator. This makes the Earth more oblate — or fatter — slowing the rotation of the planet and lengthening the day still further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The planetary impact of humanity was also demonstrated recently by <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01478-2\">research</a> that showed the redistribution of water had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/23/climate-crisis-has-shifted-the-earths-axis-study-shows\">caused the Earth’s axis of rotation</a> — the north and south poles — to move. Other work has revealed that humanity’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/12/emissions-shrinking-the-stratosphere-scientists-find\">carbon emissions are shrinking the stratosphere</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We can see our impact as humans on the whole Earth system, not just locally, like the rise in temperature, but really fundamentally, altering how it moves in space and rotates,” said professor Benedikt Soja of ETH Zurich in Switzerland, one of the world’s leading universities in science and technology. “Due to our carbon emissions, we have done this in just 100 or 200 years. Whereas the governing processes previously had been going on for billions of years, and that is striking.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Human timekeeping is based on atomic clocks, which are extremely precise. However, the exact time of a day — one rotation of the Earth — varies due to lunar tides, climate impacts, and some other factors, such as the slow rebound of the Earth’s crust after the retreat of ice sheets formed in the last ice age.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These differences have to be accounted for, said Soja: “All the datacentres that run the internet, communications and financial transactions, they are based on precise timing. We also need a precise knowledge of time for navigation, and particularly for satellites and spacecraft.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center\"><blockquote><p>“Due to our carbon emissions, we have done this in just 100 or 200 years. Whereas the governing processes previously had been going on for billions of years, and that is striking.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The research, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2406930121\">published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA</em></a>, used observations and computer reconstructions to assess the impact of melting ice on the length of the day. The rate of slowing varied between 0.3 and 1.0 millisecond per century between 1900 and 2000. But since 2000, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/25/global-ice-loss-accelerating-at-record-rate-study-finds\">melting accelerated</a>, the rate of change also accelerated to 1.3 millisecond per century.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This present-day rate is likely higher than at any time in the past few thousand years,” the researchers said. “It is projected to remain approximately at a level of 1.0 millisecond per century for the next few decades, even if greenhouse gas emissions are severely curbed.” If emissions are not cut, the slowing rate will increase to 2.6 milliseconds per century by 2100, overtaking lunar tides as the single biggest contributor to long-term variations in the length of days, they said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dr. Santiago Belda of the University of Alicante in Spain, who was not part of the research team, said: “This study is a great advance because it confirms that the worrying loss of ice that Greenland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica\">Antarctica</a> are suffering has a direct impact on day length, causing our days to lengthen. This variation in day length has critical implications not only for how we measure time, but also for GPS and other technologies that govern our modern lives.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Not once. Not twice. Many times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are lots of reasons for that. For one thing, traveling is stressful. I feel time pressure to make it to my gate quickly and social pressure not to hold up long lines. (This alone makes it feel like I’m not truly consenting to the face scans so much as being coerced into them.) Plus, I’m always getting “randomly selected” for additional screenings, maybe because of my Middle Eastern background. So I get nervous about doing anything that might lead to extra delays or interrogations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the main reason I haven’t declined airport face scans is actually very simple: I had no idea I could opt out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It turns out that saying no is not only doable, but <a href=\"https://keepbeyond.com/optout/\">surprisingly easy</a> —&nbsp;at least in theory. Everyone, regardless of citizenship, can opt out when it comes to domestic flights in the US. (For international flights, US citizens can opt out but foreign nationals have to participate in face scanning, <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/about/congressional-resources/testimony/statement-record-assessing-cbps-use-facial-recognition-technology\">with some exceptions</a>.) Simply stand away from the camera or keep your face covered with a mask, present your ID, and say, “I opt out of biometrics. I want the standard verification process.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In theory, an officer is then supposed to manually look over your ID and compare it to your face, as they used to do before facial recognition. But in practice, there have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/11/tsa-airport-security-facial-recognition/\">reports of passengers —&nbsp;even a senator — facing resistance or intimidation</a> when they try to go this route.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are also supposed to have clear signs informing passengers of the right to opt out. But at many airports, you have to look really, really hard to spot that message. Be prepared to crane your neck at an unnatural angle or squint at a very small font!</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is why the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit that sheds light on AI harms, launched a campaign this month called <a href=\"https://www.ajl.org/campaigns/fly\">“Freedom Flyers”</a> to raise awareness of your right to opt out. The timing is perfect: The TSA <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/4738416-transportation-security-administration-record-air-travel-day/\">recorded</a> an all-time record day for air travel on June 23, with nearly 3 million people screened at the country’s airports as summer vacation season picked up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now is the ideal time to make sure you know your rights when you pass through airport security —&nbsp;and understand exactly what’s at stake. The implications go way beyond air travel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How facial recognition works at the airport</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the US, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/facial-recognition-tsa-airport-security-privacy-7b97462591c49184d1cb19cda9c95211\">over 80 airports</a> are currently piloting facial recognition technology. The TSA’s goal is to roll out the tech in all of the more than 430 airports that it covers, <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf\">arguing</a> that this kind of automation would reduce “friction” at airports —&nbsp;meaning, presumably, how long it takes passengers to move through security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That should raise some eyebrows, because there are known risks with this AI technology, from the possibility that your face data will be <a href=\"https://www.oversight.gov/report/dhs/review-cbps-major-cybersecurity-incident-during-2019-biometric-pilot\">stolen due to breaches</a> to the chance that you’ll be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html\">misidentified as a criminal suspect —&nbsp;and jailed</a>. Neither of these are hypothetical scenarios; the former has happened due to CBP system vulnerabilities and the latter has happened at the hands of police. And then, of course, there’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence\">AI bias</a>; facial recognition tech is known to disproportionately <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender\">misidentify people of color</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as dangerous as face recognition can be if it goes wrong, a greater concern could be what happens if it’s seen to work as intended. When I asked <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23365558/future-perfect-50-ai-joy-buolamwini-founder-algorithmic-justice-league\">Joy Buolamwini</a>, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, what worries her about the use of this tech in airports, she said, “The big one for me is normalizing surveillance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Buolamwini argued that airport face recognition is a way of acclimating the public to having more and more sensitive information taken. “I see this on a longer trajectory,” she said. “And they’ve shown you the trajectory.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She was referring to <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf\">a roadmap released in 2018 by the TSA</a>. It distinguishes between two types of facial recognition: There’s one-to-one matching, where the TSA compares the photo in your passport with the photo they take of you at the airport, to make sure that the photos match. (If you ever use your face to unlock your iPhone, this is the kind of facial recognition you’re using.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s one-to-many matching, where your image is compared with images of others. One-to-many matching is already in use by CBP and airline partners in that they compare a passenger’s photo to a database of government documents (like US passports) for verification, TSA press secretary Carter Langston told me by email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A particularly worrisome form of one-to-many matching is live biometrics. “Live biometrics is the <em>Minority Report</em> kind of thing —&nbsp;where you’re just walking around and they can identify you,” Buolamwini said. And if everyone’s face becomes fair game for live biometrics, your likeness could one day be checked against a criminal database any time you walk through a drug store or show up at a protest, which may <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance\">create a dangerous chilling effect</a> across society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TSA’s own 2018 roadmap says they aim to use “live biometrics” in the future. However, Langston disputed Buolamwini’s interpretation of that term. “That interpretation of TSA’s use case is nothing that I have heard anyone involved in the program indicate. TSA’s use case is and continues to be about identity verification,” he told me.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, Buolamwini said, “You might hear people say ‘Oh, we’re only doing one-to-one matching. You show us your ID, you show us your face, and we delete the data.’” But, she stressed, the full story is more complicated.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do airports really delete your photo after taking it?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first thing to know is that if you’re not a US citizen, you have no guarantee that your photo will be deleted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Sep/CPE%20Final%20Report%20Traveler%20Verification%20Service%2020220815%20Final_%20Redacted_0.pdf\">according to CBP documents</a>, “Facial images for in-scope [noncitizen] travelers are also transmitted to the Department’s Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART). All biometrics of in-scope travelers are transmitted to IDENT/HART as encounters and are retained for 75 years in support of immigration, border management, and law enforcement activities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means your photo could end up in the database for the rest of your life. What’s more, CBP <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp056-tvs-february2021.pdf\">notes</a> that “CBP may share information with federal, state, and local authorities, which may be authorized to use the information for purposes beyond the scope of CBP’s mission.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re a US citizen, you might breathe a bit easier upon reading on the CBP <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics/biometric-privacy-policy\">website</a>, “CBP retains U.S. citizen photos for no more than 12 hours after identity verification, and only for continuity of operations purposes.” But even so, there’s reason to wonder whether all your data is really deleted after those 12 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you submit to facial recognition, the tech analyzes a photo of your face and creates what’s called a “face print” or “face template.” This is not an image —&nbsp;it comes in the form of a series of numbers. You can think of it as your face’s metadata.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem is, even if airports do delete your photo, that does not necessarily mean they’re deleting your face print. And that face print is the real informational gold. Researchers have shown that <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338413\">they can reconstruct an image of your actual face</a> as long as they’ve got the face print.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I asked CBP what happens to that precious series of numbers. A CBP spokesperson replied, but did not answer the question about whether face prints get deleted. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you’ve already let airports scan your face, is there a point in saying no next time?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maybe you’re in the same situation as me. Maybe you’ve already let airports scan your face. And maybe you’re wondering whether saying no in the future will make any difference, given that your face data is probably already in a database —&nbsp;or two —&nbsp;or three. (Separate from TSA, your individual airline may also scan your face instead of your boarding pass before letting you on the plane, though airlines <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/you-can-say-no-to-face-scans-for-airplane-boarding\">say</a> you can opt out for domestic flights.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Buolamwini’s opinion? It’s definitely still worth declining the face scan next time you fly. “Every opt-out opportunity is a way to vote for your biometric rights,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve already seen that when there’s enough of a public outcry, it can lead to deletion of face data. After Facebook’s facial recognition system sparked a class-action lawsuit, government investigations, and public furor, the company ended up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/technology/facebook-facial-recognition.html\">deleting the face prints of more than a billion users</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Face purges can and do happen,” Buolamwini said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Remember, the TSA’s stated reason for rolling out facial recognition in airports is to minimize friction. If you’re unhappy about the use of the tech, you can consider generating more friction next time you fly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

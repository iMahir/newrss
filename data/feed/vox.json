Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who played VP Selina Meyer on the 2010s HBO comedy series <em>Veep</em>, <a href=\"https://x.com/whitehouse/status/1640007568515801088\">visits the White House</a> to meet President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “Veep!” “Veep!” the two women greet one another. “By the way, she left as president,” Biden jokes to Harris, referring to a central plot point of the show: Meyer ascends to the top job, after the president first decides he won’t be seeking a second term, and later steps down altogether. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Biden announced he would be exiting the 2024 race this past Sunday, making Harris the frontrunner to be the Democratic presidential nominee, the internet’s collective mind exploded. To some it’s further proof that <em>Veep</em> wasn’t just a good satire, but a crystal ball. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not the first time comparisons have been drawn between the real and fictional first female vice presidents. In 2022, <em>The Daily Show</em> made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72vUngNA9RM\">supercut</a> combining Meyer’s habit of word salading with Harris’s more confusing sound bites, for which she has become <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2022/01/kamala-harris-offers-illuminating-thoughts-on-covid-strategy.html\">somewhat known for</a> over the years. The perception has been egged on by right-wing attacks and even a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/video-of-kamala-harris-rambling-her-speech-at-howard-university-is-digitally-cre-idUSL1N3712OM/\">digitally altered video</a> that went viral. (<em>Veep </em>showrunner David Mandel, for what it’s worth, doesn’t see the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/veep-kamala-harris-selina-meyer-showrunner-david-mandel\">resemblance in Harris</a>, pegging Mike Pence as more of a Selina Meyer-type.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the collision between the TV show, which aired from 2012 to 2019, and real life goes beyond just how Harris and Meyer start their presidential campaigns. People keep making <em>Veep</em> comparisons to explain the, if you will, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">context</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/lindsayballant/status/1810807033571992039\">in which</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/F466OT/status/1813336208954843241\">we live</a>. White House insiders — <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/3816339-julia-louis-dreyfus-harris-says-veep-is-more-like-dc-than-anyone-would-care-to-admit/\">including Harris</a> — have, after all, long praised the show for accurately capturing the <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/obama-aides-say-veep-accurate-west-wing-house-cards/\">bumbling chaos</a> within the auspicious halls. The fact that we’re so quick on the draw to connect <em>Veep</em> plotlines to real politics, though, might be a reflection of our own nihilistic mood. The show, for how funny and prescient it is, is a behind-the-scenes look at how Meyer becomes a petty tyrant. <em>Veep</em> plays up people’s most cynical suspicions about our government, satirizing an ugly, ugly world where politicians are self-serving monsters who fail upward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More so than forecasting precise scandals and snafus — though there were plenty of eerily predictive moments, including the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/veep-jonah-ryan-daylight-saving-time-1235112922/\">woke-ification of daylight saving time</a> — what <em>Veep</em> got right was the absurd tone of our fractured reality. Not just the increasingly nasty mud-slinging between politicians, but the head-swiveling plot twists that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns\">keep coming</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention\">our way</a>. American politics these days is often compared to a reality show where the story beats get more nonsensical each season. It’s likely that we’re now looking at a former reality TV star running against a politician buoyed by what started out as a bunch of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer\">irony-pilled memes</a>. <em>Veep</em>, at least, knew how ridiculous it could get all along.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Political fortunes turn on a dime</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there was anything <em>Veep</em> epitomized, it was the whiplash of the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-so-over-were-so-back\">It’s So Over/We’re So Back</a> vibes meter. Selina Meyer’s stock is always tanking or rallying throughout the series, often thanks to pure dumb luck or misfortune, and the opportunists around her scurry as the dial jerks back and forth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is taken to an extreme at the end of the first season, when Congressman Roger Furlong (Dan Bakkedahl), running for governor of Ohio, flip-flops on whether he wants Meyer to endorse him. He hems and haws even as she’s on stage giving a speech to introduce his gubernatorial bid. First it’s a no, because Meyer’s disapproval rating sits at a dismal 66 percent, and there are even whispers that POTUS might replace her on the ticket for his second term. Then she gives one good TV interview, and the endorsement is back on. But she cries a little too much during the Furlong speech — endorsement is off. In the next split second, she says something folksy that makes the crowd in Ohio cheer: endorsement is a go. The comically frustrating scene is not unlike the <a href=\"https://isitjoever.com/\">back-and-forth</a> whispers we saw in the <a href=\"https://x.com/josh_wingrove/status/1813993123883753662\">last few weeks</a>, with one report claiming Biden was <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/18/president-biden-drop-out-election-democrats\">close to dropping out</a> only for the next to claim he was, in fact, never <a href=\"https://x.com/josh_wingrove/status/1814032510591918182\">dropping out</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of <em>Veep</em>’s plotlines are, at their core, about the unpredictability of winds blowing hot and then cold. Who in the world could have foreseen that a former president would almost get assassinated, followed in quick succession by the current president getting Covid, then leaving the presidential race and completely shaking up the landscape of the 2024 election? When Meyer finds out she has a real shot at becoming president at the end of season two, she’s at her lowest, feeling ignored, underappreciated, tired. Every day she asks if the president called. The answer is always no. But now, halfway through his term, the president is probably facing impeachment, and things are not looking good for their party (<em>Veep</em> never makes clear which it is, though there are signs it’s the Dems). Meyer tells her staff that she’s out — she won’t be veep again. In six years, she’ll run at the top of the ticket.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then the president finally calls for her. He’s not seeking re-election. Meyer can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY0YsXQQS3k\">barely conceal her glee</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just Meyer, either — most of the characters go from being losers to winners to losers again. Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons) starts the show as the awkward, annoying liaison between the West Wing and the veep’s office, treated as a punching bag within the Meyer circle (see: a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/veep-jonah-ryan-daylight-saving-time-1235112922/\">compilation of Jonah insults</a>). But in the later seasons the sniveling brown noser described as having a “police sketch face” becomes first a congressman, then a populist right-wing presidential candidate, and then later Meyer’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpQF4xzU_4g\">hand-picked vice president</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Not serious people</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most famous American political dramas portray Washington with a degree of gravitas. The stakes are high, and the characters wield their power with intention, for better or for worse. <em>The West Wing</em> represents the most earnest end of the spectrum, showing us well-meaning adults running the country. <em>House of Cards</em> occupies the other end, depicting a dark world full of shadowy, capable puppet masters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Veep</em>, meanwhile, says that Washington is a circus — an inept one, where the tightrope walkers crash down and the fire breathers set themselves alight. The characters that populate its universe aren’t decent people like they are in <em>The West Wing</em>, but they aren’t evil masterminds like those in <em>House of Cards</em> are either; they desperately want to be Machiavellian but are, alas, too stupid for that.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meyer is herself the queen of petty and childish — so, despite the charm of Louis-Dreyfus, the comparison has never been a flattering one for Harris. In season one, she demands a member of her secret service be reassigned because he smiles at something she says (the move backfires on her). She also makes her absurdly loyal personal aide Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) break up with the man she’s been seeing, because she’s too cowardly to do it herself. In one of her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21550880/trump-tweet-stop-the-count-votes-presidential-election\">Trumpiest moments</a>, when a recount of votes in Nevada doesn’t seem to be going her way, she screams for her staff to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntpywGl5ak\">stop the recount.</a>” Even when things are going well, her innate smallness sabotages her ability to be a good leader, like when she’s seething with jealousy over her own running mate’s popularity. (In later seasons, her immaturity calcifies into straight-up cruelty.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Meyer’s not being immature, she (and her staff) can be laughably incompetent, whether it’s <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/the-hapless-veep-staff-trips-itself-up-as-selina-ascends/\">accidentally budgeting more money</a> for a program she wanted to cut or literally <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxC8w-vPGTM\">walking into a glass door</a>. To quote another show that was a critical darling from HBO, these are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/tv/23664902/succession-season-four-ep-two-recap-connor-roy-rehearsal\">not serious people</a>. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://x.com/annetdonahue/status/1814666259851526200\">bizarre blunders</a> in recent American politics, a lot of it from the topsy-turvy Trump years, that could be straight out of a <em>Veep</em> episode. Remember when Trump stared <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-looking-solar-eclipse.html\">straight into the sun</a>? Or who could forget the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/8/21555022/four-seasons-landscaping-trump-giuliani-philadelphia-press-conference\">Four Seasons Total Landscaping</a> press conference? Or South Dakota governor Kristi Noem admitting <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24145840/kristi-noem-puppy-killing-book-trump-vp\">to killing a dog</a> in a recent memoir, something Dan Egan (Reid Scott), one of Meyer’s slimiest advisers in<em> Veep</em>, also <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thetheaterandmemesguy/video/7367050789828775214\">admits doing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The frivolousness of <em>Veep</em>’s characters really shines through in the way they talk. In <em>The West Wing</em>, President Bartlet is always <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRYxQM1HHX0\">making a stirring speech</a> for one reason or another. In <em>House of Cards</em>, protagonist Frank Underwood <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLf4rnJYUGk\">speaks with dramatic authority</a>, sometimes even turning to the camera to communicate straight to the audience. In <em>Veep</em>, in a closer approximation to real life, politicians make mealymouthed declarations that are so careful not to offend any faction that their speeches end up being “noise-shaped air,” as Dan once puts it. This unwillingness to say anything of substance reaches its absurd peak when Meyer hires a yes-woman who has mastered <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6qoeSe_uzsI?si=wRJbp539QZW66Rsj&amp;t=97\">the art of saying absolutely nothing</a>. Meyer’s memoir, of course, has a perfectly nonsensical title, too — <em>A Woman First: First Woman</em>. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">It’s all about the image (and the memes)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Veep </em>was also merciless about how shallow politics could be — 99 percent of the game, it cynically contends, is theater. In the very first episode, Meyer asks Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), then her communications director, what he thought the biggest mistakes of her presidential campaign were. He says immediately that a certain hat she wore on the trail hurt them immensely because it looked bad. It sounds facile, but it’s not like there aren’t any real-life examples of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/barack-obama-tan-suit-fifth-anniversary/index.html\">political fashion scandals</a>. In a quick scene early in the premiere, Meyer also decides not to wear her glasses to an event because they make people look “weak.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the second episode, the veep team spends an inordinate amount of time brainstorming what flavor Meyer should get during a photo-op at the local froyo shop. “Good flavors” that will get a positive reaction from the American People include, apparently, chocolate, peach, and mango, while the bad ones are red velvet cake and peanut butter. Jonah is personally Team Mint, because “it implies freshness, trust, traditional values.” They land on Jamaican Rum but the froyo visit predictably devolves into a mess when Meyer is hit with a stomach virus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meyer’s staff, much like that of real politicians, is constantly <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-campaign-meme-manager-2024-election-dark-brandon-rcna153947\">monitoring the internet</a> just in case the VP goes viral (derogatory) and is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myxMEwyilqo\">turned into a meme</a>. Unlike the positive boost Harris memes have given the real veep — something the team now appears to be fully leaning into — internet virality almost always creates more headaches for Meyer, like when the hashtag #fakeveepweep starts trending after a journalist reveals that Meyer’s team intentionally made their boss cry during an interview so she would appear sympathetic. Even the Meyer-Harris memes, as enjoyable as they are now, could fall victim to the fickle It’s So Over/We’re So Back dichotomy, becoming a liability rather than a boon to the campaign. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What Meyer’s team tries (and fails) to do across seven seasons is to make her look likable — which is hard when almost everyone involved, most of all Meyer, are unlikable or out-of-touch people who frequently miss the mark on how the public will react. When a political rival publishes a Spotify playlist of what he’s currently listening to — angling for the youth vote — Meyer declares they need to make one too. (Gary suggests Katy Perry, much to Meyer’s dismay.) When Meyer uses an ableist slur in a speech, a moment that seems all but guaranteed to get negative press, her communications director’s first instinct is to hope for something worse to take attention away from the gaffe. “What if Tom Hanks dies?” he suggests. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What <em>Veep</em> didn’t predict</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mandel,<em> Veep</em>’s showrunner, has said that the show had to end once Trump took office. <em>Veep</em> was supposed to be satire, its black heart emerging during the height of the <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hopecore\">hopecore</a> Obama years. Then reality became more preposterous than the farce. “Trump, in a weird way, is sort of doing us,” Mandel wrote in a column for <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/making-veep-trump-era-golden-shower-joke-got-cut-guest-column-993109/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2017. “We’re not doing him.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Veep</em> does nod to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=embMAtagQiU\">Trump-esque figures</a> and the paranoid, anti-establishment <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOD8XXy2l4o\">conspiracy hunting</a> that dominates social media now, especially through the character of Jonah Ryan. But, having ended in 2019, the show didn’t anticipate the pandemic or how much worse everything would become — the anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers, the insurrection on January 6, the disinformation accelerated by fake AI photos and videos now littering the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump — who continues to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rnc-trump-stolen-election-claims-6b3bdc8c0b69cf1b9311068ee6cdae8c\">refer to the false claim</a> that the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21506029/trump-violence-tweets-racist-hate-speech\">2020 election was stolen</a> — is now the Republican presidential candidate once again. Mandel recently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/veep-kamala-harris-selina-meyer-showrunner-david-mandel\">told Vanity Fair</a> that <em>Veep</em> was already dated in one key way: “So much of it was based on the notion that there were consequences to what you do and say as a politician, and that just went out the window with Donald Trump,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t know how things will pan out in 2024, let alone decades from now — but in <em>Veep</em>, most of the characters ultimately don’t get what they want. Their careers end not with a bang but with a little sputter. Gary <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/veep-series-finale-tony-hale-betrayal-flash-forward-reveal-1210885/\">goes to prison</a>, taking the fall for Meyer’s sins. Aggressively ambitious Dan becomes a realtor. Jonah is impeached from the vice presidency. Most importantly, Selina Meyer has no legacy to speak of. The notoriously comprehensive Robert Caro writes what’s almost certainly a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/veep-coronavirus-episode.html\">scathing biography of her</a> in just 18 months, a sure sign of how pitifully small her political career was, and she dies somewhere in her mid-70s (which is younger than both Trump and Biden currently are). Her funeral is overshadowed by news of Tom Hanks’s death. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that’s the far-off future. For now, everyone — including Kamala Harris — is still laughing at <em>Veep</em>’s uncanny prophecies. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Will it last?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The day after <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361888/biden-drops-out-kamala-harris-endorsement-dnc-democratic-nominee\">President Joe Biden said he would not seek reelection</a>, his White House announced more than <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-43-billion-grants-community-driven-solutions-cut\">$4.3 billion in grants from the Environmental Protection Agency</a> to communities to curb climate change, cut pollution, and seek environmental justice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a big announcement, but easily lost amid the thunderous presidential campaign news.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The grants will fund projects across the country that include decarbonizing freight, installing geothermal systems, and capturing fugitive methane emissions. According to the EPA, these grantees will cut US greenhouse gas emissions up to 971 million metric tons by 2050. That’s equal to the emissions of five million average homes over 25 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid all the political pandemonium, it’s remarkable that the administration is continuing to pump out new environmental initiatives. Climate has consistently been a high priority for the Biden administration, and this announcement proves a genuine commitment. Biden has the distinction of introducing the earliest bill in the Senate to address climate change, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/2891\">1986 Global Climate Protection Act</a>. Humanity, though, has <a href=\"https://ieep.eu/news/more-than-half-of-all-co2-emissions-since-1751-emitted-in-the-last-30-years/\">more than doubled its greenhouse gas pollution</a> since then. As president, Biden has made dealing with global warming an even higher priority than it was during his last turn in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18634602/joe-biden-2020-climate-change-announcement\">White House as vice president</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The United States is the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/\">world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gasses</a> and is currently second in annual output, behind China and ahead of India. So on the world stage, the US has a significant role, and activists say a responsibility, to nudge the global warming trajectory downward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When he leaves office in January 2025, Biden will be able to credibly claim that he has done more on climate change than any other president and has been one of the most consequential decision-makers in the world for the future of the planet.  </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-23-at-12.24.41 PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.588118893515,100,74.823762212969\" alt=\"Graph showing greenhouse gas emissions trajectories under different presidents.\" title=\"Graph showing greenhouse gas emissions trajectories under different presidents.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Biden&#039;s climate change pledges aim to zero out US greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administration-has-taken-more-climate-action-than-any-other-in-history/&quot;&gt;Center for American Progress&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administration-has-taken-more-climate-action-than-any-other-in-history/&quot;&gt;Center for American Progress&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while he’s done the most, it’s still not enough to get the US in line with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22397364/earth-day-us-climate-change-summit-biden-john-kerry-commitment-2030-zero-emissions\">Biden’s own climate change goals</a>. Many of Biden’s environmental initiatives are still struggling to get rolling, and some <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/12/sunrise-youth-climate-biden-elections-00167851\">activist groups are not satisfied</a> with what he’s done.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if Donald Trump wins in November, that progress will stall.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Joe Biden has done for the climate</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Biden was one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for the top job in 2019, he <a href=\"https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/bidenclimateplan-1559610636.pdf\">proposed an extensive climate plan</a> released in two installments that emphasized cutting greenhouse gas emissions by building up a robust US clean energy sector with $2 trillion in investment. He also laid out a <a href=\"https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/bidenclimateplan-1559610636.pdf\">legislative strategy</a> and a list of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21549521/climate-change-senate-election-joe-biden\">executive actions</a> he would take on his own, such as imposing tough methane leak restrictions on new oil and gas facilities, requiring federal government operations to procure clean energy, and imposing new efficiency regulations on appliances. At the same time, Biden’s plan was seen as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/5/20850009/cnn-climate-town-hall-2020-presidential-democrats-winners-and-losers\">less ambitious</a> than those of his competitors — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/22/20827396/bernie-sanders-2020-climate-policy-green-new-deal\">Bernie Sanders called for $16.3 trillion in total</a> — and he was criticized for declining to support a ban on fracking and for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/politics/joe-biden-andrew-goldman-fundraiser.html\">attending a fundraiser</a> hosted by a natural gas company founder. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But since taking office in January 2021, Biden has demonstrated that at least part of his plan was realistic: He managed to tick many of the items on his to-do list that are directly under the president’s purview or from cabinet agencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He brought the US back into the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22241348/president-biden-climate-change-paris-agreement-executive-order-keystone-pipeline\">2015 Paris climate agreement</a>, personally <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/11/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-27th-conference-of-the-parties-to-the-framework-convention-on-climate-change-cop27-sharm-el-sheikh-egypt/\">attended international climate talks</a>, and committed the country to a more ambitious goal of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22397364/earth-day-us-climate-change-summit-biden-john-kerry-commitment-2030-zero-emissions\">cutting carbon dioxide emissions in half from 2005 levels by 2030</a> while achieving <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22737140/un-cop26-climate-change-net-zero-emissions-carbon-offsets\">net-zero emissions</a> across the economy by 2050. His administration enacted <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24106924/epa-vehicle-emissions-carbon-pollution-climate-ev-hybrid\">new fuel economy regulations</a> for cars and trucks to encourage electrification. It set <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/5/13/23719080/environmental-protection-agency-limit-power-plant-pollution\">stringent caps on air pollution and carbon dioxide</a> from <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel\">fossil fuel power plants</a>. It raised efficiency standards for stoves, refrigerators, and shower heads. It set <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/president-biden-signs-executive-order-federal-sustainability\">zero-emissions targets for federal buildings, energy suppliers, and vehicle fleets</a>, including placing orders for at least 45,000 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23518852/postal-service-electric-mail-truck-usps-ngdv-dejoy\">electric mail trucks</a>. It vastly expanded <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-restores-protections-for-three-national-monuments-and-renews-american-leadership-to-steward-lands-waters-and-cultural-resources/\">federal protections for public lands</a> and established a <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/civilian-climate-corps\">Civilian Climate Corps</a> to train workers to maintain them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps Biden’s single most impactful climate action was signing the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23373026/kigali-amendment-signed-biden-republican-hfc-climate-change-montreal\">Kigali Amendment</a>, an international treaty to phase out some of the most powerful greenhouse gasses. On its own, the Kigali Amendment would avert almost 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming by the end of the century. On September 21, 2022, it <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00343.htm\">cleared the Senate with bipartisan support</a>, including 21 Republicans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Congress, Biden signed the trio of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22772701/biden-infrastructure-law-environmental-funding\">Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/27/23277664/chips-act-solve-chip-shortage-biden-manufacturing\">CHIPS and Science Act</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. While climate change isn’t in their names, these laws mobilized billions of dollars in investments in clean energy, infrastructure, battery manufacturing, and building up supply chains. Together, they’re some of the largest investments in climate change mitigation in the world. Additionally, they’re structured as incentives, with no explicit penalties for carbon dioxide emissions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Getting these laws passed was a bruising fight. Biden’s signature <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act\">Inflation Reduction Act</a> in its final form — with $370 billion for clean energy deployment — was a fraction of the size of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-house-vote-bidens-175-trillion-bill-after-hours-long-delay-2021-11-19/\">$1.75 trillion version that passed the House in 2021</a>. The Democrats’ narrow majority in the Senate gave holdouts like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23955967/joe-manchin-climate-change-senate-biden-inflation\">West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin leverage</a> to chip away at its scope while securing more pot sweeteners for his own state. That in turn <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/08/10/victory-whose-expense-climate-activists-grapple-with-political-compromise/\">drew the ire of environmental activists</a> who were anticipating a much more robust law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the IRA’s costs come in the form of tax breaks rather than new spending. “The IRA’s projected costs to the U.S. federal budget are mostly reductions in taxes owed by U.S. taxpayers or increases in federal payments to those taxpayers,” according to a <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs\">Treasury Department analysis</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the IRA remains the <a href=\"https://rmi.org/the-ira-is-the-largest-climate-investment-in-us-history-are-utilities-planning-accordingly/\">largest investment to deal with climate change</a> in US history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Politics and <strong>Biden’s own policies undermined his climate ambitions </strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden has also had to navigate political rapids over the past four years and has ended up getting turned around on occasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For instance, Biden campaigned on <a href=\"https://x.com/umairfan/status/1515067048275202048\">banning new oil and gas development on public lands</a> (on a page since deleted from his website), but in 2022, the Interior Department opened the door to <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-significantly-reformed-onshore-oil-and-gas-lease-sales\">new drilling lease sales</a>. One example is the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/3/14/23637780/willow-project-biden-oil-drilling-climate-change\">Willow project in northern Alaska</a>, which the Biden administration greenlit last year, that could extract more than 600 million barrels of oil over 30 years.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fossil fuel projects like this have led to some of Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24098983/biden-oil-production-climate-fossil-fuel-renewables\">biggest climate contradictions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Biden’s watch, the US has become the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545\">largest oil and gas producer in history</a>. US exports of natural gas hit a record high, especially after the administration stepped up deliveries to allies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Even though the US is aiming to slash its domestic emissions, the country is on track to double liquid natural gas (LNG) exports by 2030. But Biden also imposed a pause on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24055711/lng-export-pause-biden-liquefied-natural-gas-climate-change\">new liquefied natural gas export terminals</a> pending a review of their environmental and national security bona fides. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-23-at-12.27.57 PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.34,0,99.32,100\" alt=\"Graph showing US, Russian, and Saudi Arabian oil production over time\" title=\"Graph showing US, Russian, and Saudi Arabian oil production over time\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The United States produces more oil than any country in history. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administration-has-taken-more-climate-action-than-any-other-in-history/&quot;&gt;Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administration-has-taken-more-climate-action-than-any-other-in-history/&quot;&gt;Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When desperate to tamp down inflation and smooth over supply chain disruptions stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, the White House <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/16/biden-oil-reserve-fuels-00121298\">tapped the strategic petroleum reserve</a> to help bring gasoline prices down. Biden has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/07/22/remarks-by-president-biden-during-economic-briefing-on-lowering-gas-prices/\">bragged about lowering gasoline prices</a>. These lower prices tend to spur more driving, which in turn increases greenhouse gas emissions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">America’s fossil fuel bounties have put the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24098983/biden-oil-production-climate-fossil-fuel-renewables\">Biden White House in the awkward position</a> of taking credit for facilitating their production while simultaneously trying to curb their use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s policies have also created friction within his climate goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His signature legislation, the IRA, has provisions mandating that cleantech companies <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/9/23712675/inflation-reduction-act-climate-change-trade-policy-joe-biden-nationalism-china\">build their products and supply chains in the US</a> if they want to tap the money in the law. The provision has <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/IPOL_IDA(2023)740087\">angered allies in places like Europe</a> that want to sell products like solar panels and efficient appliances to US customers. Biden has also <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/cost-trumps-trade-war-china-still-adding\">retained many of former President Donald Trump’s tariffs</a> on foreign goods and is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit\">imposing new ones on cheap electric vehicles made in China</a> by companies like BYD, currently <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2024/07/03/byd-top-tesla-worlds-largest-ev-maker-2024/\">vying with Tesla to be the largest pure EV maker in the world</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This protectionism for US companies raises prices for American buyers and means that the shift to clean energy is more expensive and slower than it needs to be. On the other hand, if cheaper cars and solar panels did enter the US market, they could get more Americans off of coal, oil, and natural gas at a faster pace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>America’s progress on climate change is fragile</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The question now is whether US climate policies will continue to gain momentum, stall, or reverse. The main hinge point is who wins the next election. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/362131/biden-drop-out-kamala-harris-climate-record\">own history with tackling climate change</a> as California’s attorney general. And with Biden’s endorsement, the <a href=\"https://x.com/findareaction/status/1588718308060168193\">Venn diagram</a> of their climate policies will have a lot of overlap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, there are some big obstacles. Few Americans grasp how they can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/8/16/23815837/inflation-reduction-act-joe-biden-impact-manufacturing-consumers\">benefit from the programs in the IRA</a>, and the money in the law has been slow to trickle out to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/28/ev-charging-stations-slow-rollout/\">build things like EV charging stations</a>. Shortages of specialized labor and permitting issues have <a href=\"https://www.constructiondive.com/news/manufacturing-delay-permits-labor-projects/694064/\">delayed big clean energy manufacturing projects</a>. Energy demand is poised to grow as well, driven by population growth and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/ai-uses-a-lot-of-energy-experts-expect-it-to-double-in-just-a-few-years\">technologies like artificial intelligence</a>, and already <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/05/ai-could-drive-natural-gas-boom-as-utilities-face-surging-electric-demand.html\">fossil fuels are feeding</a> some of that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/ai-uses-a-lot-of-energy-experts-expect-it-to-double-in-just-a-few-years\">new appetite</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s policies are facing legal setbacks too. Republican state attorneys general are <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/red-states-go-to-court-over-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards/\">suing the White House</a> to block new fuel efficiency regulations for cars and trucks. The Republican-led Supreme Court has also eroded the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/6/30/23189610/supreme-court-epa-west-virginia-clean-power-plan-major-questions-john-roberts\">federal government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions</a>, and with the recent reversal of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab\"><em>Chevron </em>doctrine</a>, agencies like the EPA will have much less leeway to craft environmental rules. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also not clear voters will reward the effort. A majority of Americans <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/\">support addressing climate change and deploying more clean energy</a>, but it ranks as a much lower priority behind issues like <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/02/06/economy-remains-the-publics-top-policy-priority-covid-19-concerns-decline-again/\">crime and inflation</a>. According to the <a href=\"https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/understanding-pro-climate-voters/\">Yale Program on Climate Change Communication</a> in a survey conducted in April 2024, 37 percent of US voters consider climate change to be “very important.”  </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1816160054.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736007856427,100,78.527984287147\" alt=\"Kamala Harris standing at a lectern that has United Nations Climate Change COP28 UAE.\" title=\"Kamala Harris standing at a lectern that has United Nations Climate Change COP28 UAE.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at the COP28 climate change summit in the United Arab Emirates in 2023. | Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Trump, the Republican nominee, is openly disdainful of action on climate change. A key focus of his first turn in office was systematically <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/29/16684952/epa-scott-pruitt-director-regulations\">undoing or blocking environmental regulations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/14/16634480/us-coal-nuclear-climate-change-cop23-protest\">promoting fossil fuels</a>, going as far as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/9/16619120/trump-administration-removing-climate-change-epa-online-website\">removing the words “climate change” from government websites</a>. Many of these rollbacks were stalled because they were poorly structured, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/1/19/22239074/affordable-clean-energy-rule-vacated-trump-court-climate-change-obama-biden\">blocked by courts</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/5/17192716/scott-pruitt-resigns-epa-administrator-andrew-wheeler\">undermined by bad staffing choices</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Conservative activists are working to ensure they don’t squander another opportunity in the White House to achieve their goals. The Heritage Foundation laid out a strategy for this in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">Project 2025</a>, which aims to staff federal agencies with people who will reduce regulations and increase fossil fuel development. Though Trump has sought to distance himself from the plan, many alumni from his administration and campaign personnel were among the authors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And there’s always the chance of another shock — a war, a pandemic, a depression — that could take the wind out of the sails of curbing climate change. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite this uncertainty, it’s increasingly clear that the turn toward cleaner energy is likely to endure. Worldwide, wind and solar are the cheapest sources of new electricity, and in some cases more cost-effective than existing fossil fuel sources. Market forces and climate policies are starting to have an effect, and according to some estimates, the world may be close to reaching <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action\">peak greenhouse gas emissions</a>, if it hasn’t already crossed this line. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even with so many potential setbacks, some of the big changes Biden set in motion are likely to stick, as the cleaner, more efficient technologies become cheaper and more polluting sources of energy enter their final days. Even if Trump were to retake the White House, it’s likely that <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/\">US emissions will continue to decline</a>, albeit not as quickly as they would under a Democrat. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Changing this course took decades of persistent effort from scientists, engineers, leaders, and activists. Joe Biden deserves some credit for helping turn the rudder.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "The day after President Joe Biden said he would not seek reelection, his White House announced more than $4.3 billion in grants from the Environmental Protection Agency to communities to curb climate change, cut pollution, and seek environmental justice.  It’s a big announcement, but easily lost amid the thunderous presidential campaign news.&#160; The grants will fund [&#8230;]",

Back in 2022, former Obama adviser and current political pundit David Axelrod was one of the first prominent Democrats to suggest Biden <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/11/us/politics/biden-2024-election-democrats.html\">should withdraw.</a> But yesterday’s news left him with mixed emotions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When I got the news yesterday, I was very, very sad,” Axelrod told <em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Sean Rameswaram Monday morning. “I thought he was a tremendous asset in the White House. Always enjoyed being with him, always appreciated the points that he was making. I think history will be a lot kinder to him than voters are right now, for the things that he’s accomplished.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Listen to Sean Rameswaram’s full conversation with Axelrod and follow <em>Today, Explained</em> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297\">Apple podcasts</a>,<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A\"> Spotify</a>,<a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140\"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. Below is a transcript of their discussion, edited for length and clarity. </p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP8691595294\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You were part of this mounting call for [President Biden] to step aside. Did you think that was actually in the cards? Did you think the party was capable of what it’s going through right now?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I thought it was almost inevitable after the debate. The debate kind of crystallized what had been a big and growing problem, which was doubts about his fitness to serve another four years. Those were not just magnified, but calcified by the debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then you had the bookend of Trump and the assassination attempt. And his preternatural marketing instincts to find the precise spot to take the hero pose. The two things read weakness and strength, which was the essence of the Trump message that the world was out of control. “Biden is not in command. He’s weak. Trump is strong. Vote for Trump.” That was their whole campaign. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now they have a complication because they don’t have Biden. So, it does change the nature of the race. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of the people who were calling for Biden to step aside are now jubilant, if not endorsing Vice President Harris. Your friend and former colleague, former President Barack Obama, has not yet done that. What do you think is going on there?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t think he wanted to prescribe for the party what the party should do, but rather be available to be a force for pulling the party together once the party made its choice. I think what’s very clear as we sit here this morning, the day after the president made his announcement, is that Kamala Harris is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. I don’t think there’s any real debate about that. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She very quickly consolidated support in a way that should actually inspire some confidence, because that’s a political task and she did it. She did it very well. I think the last of the prospective opponents will endorse her and she’ll move on to the business of choosing a vice presidential candidate.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So you don’t think she’s going to do what the Republicans did and wait until the DNC to announce who’s going to be on the ticket with her?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t think she can, because they are committed to an early vote of the delegates to nominate two candidates in order to accommodate all the states filing deadlines for the fall ballot. They’re scheduled to meet next week to codify the ticket. I don’t think that they really can put this off until the convention. I anticipate that we’ll know relatively quickly who the vice presidential nominee is going to be.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You host a podcast with a Republican strategist named Mike Murphy, who’s anti-Trump, but he’s one of the few voices saying that it’s happening too fast with Harris. Do you understand his perspective on that?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do, but I think that she would be the nominee if there were a process or if there were not a process, for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One, she has more of a relationship with the delegates to the convention. Biden-Harris delegates were chosen by the Biden campaign. And so they’re naturally going to gravitate towards her. The composition of those delegates favors her. I think she might have benefited from more of a competition just to show that she could win. But I get Mike’s point of view. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the reasons why I spoke out as early as I did about my concerns about the president moving forward was that had he made this decision last year, we would have had a Democratic primary. In the Democratic primary is how you pressure test these candidates. Remember, Ron DeSantis was viewed as a behemoth in the fall of 2022, and then he had to go through the nominating battle, and he ended up not faring as well. You do find out about people through that process. That said, she’s been vetted quite a bit. She ran for president. She’s been vice president for three and a half years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No matter what level of politics you’re at, there’s no training for it. There’s no simulator you can pop into to find out what the pressures of a presidential campaign are like. In many ways, the campaign simulates the sort of relentless pressure that presidents themselves will feel. She’s experienced that, she has been swimming in the deep end of the pool, and that, to me, is a big thing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other thing is she has apprenticed. She has been in those rooms. She has been in those meetings. She knows a lot about what the presidency entails. That, too, is something that’s very hard to learn, on the fly. So I think she’s got a lot of arguments on her side for this.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It seems like the Republicans really want to come after Biden, and now Harris, probably, on immigration, on inflation. Does Harris have the same weaknesses as Biden there, if not even more so?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, they will try to depict her as the immigration czar, and I’m sure they’ve got about 100 ads in the can on this. But the truth is, she’s not Joe Biden. She can chart her own course now. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m old enough to remember the ’68 campaign when Lyndon Johnson quit. Ultimately, his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, became the presidential candidate, and the heavy burden of Vietnam hung over him. He ended up losing by a point, but he also was like 20 points behind when he got nominated. And if that race had gone another month, another week, I should say he would have won. So, you know, she needs to chart her own course. Talk about what she would do. I think there are also points on this immigration issue that are vulnerabilities for Trump.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Are you looking forward to that debate?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Oh, yes. You know, what’s interesting is that the addled old man on the platform is not going to be Joe Biden this time.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. She’ll be an even more historic president, obviously. Do you think she leans into that, or do you think she leans into the issues? She leans into Donald Trump’s various criminal battles, what have you.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Listen, when Barack Obama was running for president, we never talked about the historic nature of his candidacy because we thought that was obvious. Others might be talking about it, but he always said, I am proudly of the Black community, but I’m not limited to it, and I’m not running to be the first Black president or the Black president. I’m running to be president of the United States. The people who step forward and say, you can’t bypass her because she’s the first Black woman vice president? They were diminishing her. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The case they should have been making and should be making today is why she’s the best candidate, why she has the best chance to win, what she brings to this race. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm among some folks about the historic nature of the race. But there are a lot of voters for whom other things are more important. And they want to know, are we going to have someone who understands our lives and is fighting for us? The more she focuses on that, I think the greater her chances of success.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You started saying that the news yesterday made you sad, but you obviously helped turn hope into a political strategy in 2008. Do you feel hopeful right now?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do, because I think that what was not a race yesterday is a race today. I see the enthusiasm that the vice president has generated in the first 24 hours. She raised $46 million in a matter of hours, online and small donations. That’s a record. It’s a gauge of enthusiasm which has been absent. So I am encouraged by what I see. It’s better to have hope than despair. And this morning, a lot of Democrats have hope that they didn’t have yesterday morning. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Typically, they have to win medals. Other times, their personalities are enough to build their own fandoms. Heading into this summer’s Olympics in Paris, Noah Lyles expects to be recognized for both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you don’t follow track and field, you may not be familiar with Lyles — although his name could soon become inescapable. Already, the new Netflix docuseries <em>Sprint</em>, set around the <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/track-and-field-world-championships-results-2023\">2023 World Athletics Championships</a> in Budapest, has shone a bigger spotlight on him. The six-part series follows track and field’s brightest stars in the 100- and 200-meter sprints, including the fastest woman on Earth, Sha’Carri Richardson; Jamaican gold medalist Shericka Jackson; and British record-holder in the 100 and 200 meters, Zharnel Hughes. Despite this star power, the series’s main attraction has been Lyles, whose ambitions to outrun retired legend Usain Bolt have ruffled <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-not-likable-at-all-noah-lyles-receives-heavy-criticism-from-twitters-track-field-community-for-netflixs-sprint-documentary/\">some feathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of Lyles’s soundbites in <em>Sprint</em> have been <a href=\"https://x.com/BadgyalTerryG/status/1811176867061260790\">perceived</a> by <a href=\"https://x.com/willthefred/status/1811185176766038069\">viewers</a> as <a href=\"https://x.com/pernillatweets1/status/1809892070334570956\">arrogant.</a> In one scene, he says that to be a successful athlete, “you have to have the mindset of a God.” “I’m a true believer in that the moment isn’t bigger than me, the moment was made for me,” he says in another. Compare this attitude to Shericka Jackson’s. When asked by someone off-camera about claims that she’s the best in the sport, she refused to comment. Meanwhile, others seem confused about Lyles’s claim to “the fastest man in the world” title while Bolt is still living. Still, much like <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview\">Richardson</a>, his bravado, personal style, and penchant for trash-talking has given Americans someone to place their bets on at the upcoming Olympics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, Lyles holds the title of the fastest man in the world after winning the 100 and 200 meters — also known as the sprint double — at last year’s World Championships. (He ran the 100 meter in 9.83 seconds and the 200 meter in 19.52.) Altogether, he holds six world titles. He also earned the bronze medal in the 200 meter at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, a disappointing result that he says inspired his lofty goals at this year’s games. Not only does he want to beat Bolt’s record times, he plans to take home four gold medals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether he can actually achieve this feat is anyone’s guess. Regardless, it seems like he’ll leave this year’s Olympics having achieved another career goal — having everyone talk about him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Lyles may have his critics, but it’s all part of his mythmaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When we think of celebrity athletes whose fame extends beyond their sport, sprinters aren’t exactly the first people to come to mind. While Bolt has practically become synonymous with running, it’s fair to say the sport doesn’t offer its athletes the same level of visibility that the NBA, for example, offers even its most unassuming players. For instance, it took a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22565419/shacarri-richardson-olympics-marijuana-ban-war-on-drugs\">drug-test scandal</a> — coming up positive for marijuana, not performance-enhancing drugs — and her subsequent suspension from the Tokyo Olympics for Richardson to become a national talking point and a currently beloved underdog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lyles wants this to change. “You have all these other athletes as stars, rockstars, popular wherever they go,” he says in the first episode of <em>Sprint</em>. “Track and field needs to be the same.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 26-year-old has certainly been doing his part to bring attention to the sport, or maybe just to himself. While he doesn’t represent the most head-turning style in track and field right now — that may belong to Richardson with her occasionally flame-colored hair, numerous tattoos, and Flo Jo-esque acrylics — he frequently shows up to meets in snazzy, designer looks, like F1 champion Lewis Hamilton or one of a handful of NBA stars. Also in the spirit of ’80s icon Florence Griffith Joyner, he even enjoys a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcolympics/video/7344869517991922990\">flashy manicure</a>. His accomplishments, thus far, have also gotten him a few magazine covers, most recently <a href=\"https://time.com/6991825/noah-lyles-olympics-2024-interview/\">Time</a>, and an extremely lucrative contract for a track star with Adidas. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcolympics/video/7344869517991922990\" data-video-id=\"7344869517991922990\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@nbcolympics\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcolympics?refer=embed\">@nbcolympics</a> <p>Noah Lyles paid tribute to his love of anime at the <a title=\"worldindoorchamps\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/worldindoorchamps?refer=embed\">#WorldIndoorChamps</a> in a unique way. 🔥 <a title=\"anime\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/anime?refer=embed\">#anime</a> <a title=\"trackandfield\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trackandfield?refer=embed\">#trackandfield</a> <a title=\"noahlyles\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/noahlyles?refer=embed\">#noahlyles</a> <a title=\"nailart\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nailart?refer=embed\">#nailart</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - NBC Olympics &#038; Paralympics\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7344869620353862446?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; NBC Olympics &#038; Paralympics</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On social media, he delivers the same high-quality, fashion-forward content of a major influencer. (In <em>Sprint</em>, he refers to himself as an “artistic director.”) On his Instagram (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nojo18/?hl=en\">@nojo18</a>), where he’s approaching a million followers, you’re just as likely to see high-res photos of his pre-meet fits, posts with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C8k6QGHI7qq/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">Snoop Dogg</a>, and wardrobe selections inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8yKXDnRYer/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">his favorite anime</a> as you are content related to track. He also posts playful videos with his girlfriend, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C9LDOhMvteN/?hl=en\">fellow runner Junelle Bromfield</a>, the pair seeming to be a power couple in the making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On his way to becoming America’s most beloved track star, though, Lyles has already rubbed some sports fans the wrong way. In an interview following his World Championship wins last year, he questioned why NBA Finals winners are referred to as “world champions.” “World champions of what?” he asked at a post-meet conference.“The United States?” Soon came a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/29/sport/noah-lyles-nba-backlash-spt-intl/index.html\">pile of responses</a> from NBA players, including Kevin Durant, Aaron Gordon, and Devin Booker denouncing his comments. Drake, a supporter of the Toronto Raptors, even chimed in, poking fun at Lyles. Others, like Ghanaian sports journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyalsmith/status/1696087026154541245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1696087026154541245%7Ctwgr%5E95a150cf499700a49eda9372113c58a1dfff9e17%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2023%2F08%2F28%2F1196396026%2Fnoah-lyles-nba-world-champions-basketball-drake-kevin-durant\">Gary Al-Smith</a>, said Lyles was simply observing a larger problem of American exceptionalism in basketball.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ironically, Lyles has been accused of displaying the same superior, <a href=\"https://x.com/wiiissssss/status/1810777524630397169\">culturally American</a> attitude in his own sport. On the fourth episode of <em>Sprint</em>, Lyles discussed the backlash he received after he posted his predicted times in the 100 meter and 200 meter at last year’s World Championships on Instagram, which he ultimately fell short of, despite taking home the gold. “What the heck does me saying my goal have to do with you?” he asks in a talking-head interview. It’s a good question, considering that it’s every athlete’s goal to perform at their best and destroy their opponents, whether or not they vocalize it as much as Lyles does. Fans’ negative responses to this sort of behavior have also confused Richardson, who says in the docuseries that there should be “more trash-talking” in the sport.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This poor reception online can at least be partially explained by a heated rivalry between American and Jamaican sprinters that intensified at the<a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1269260-olympic-track-2012-breaking-down-team-usas-rivalry-with-jamaican-sprinters\"> 2008 Beijing Olympics</a> where Bolt won the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter, while achieving record times in both sprints. Jamaican track stars Shelly Ann-Frazer and Veronica Campbell-Brown also won the 100 meter and 200 meter, respectively. More than any athlete, though, Bolt has become a national symbol and icon in Jamaica, where track and field is the dominant sport. Announcing your plans to overthrow him, as Lyles has done, expectedly has some repercussions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>All eyes are on Lyles at the Paris Olympics&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the US claims both the fastest man and woman in the world right now, one can assume an even larger number of American viewers will be tuned in to track this year, and there’s a lot at stake for Lyles’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, the Olympics have been fraught territory for the runner. In 2020, fans&nbsp;witnessed the emotional toll that training for and competing at the Olympics has had on Lyles, and how he handles disappointment when he’s fallen short of his goals.&nbsp;After landing in third place in the 200 meter in Tokyo, Lyles broke down during a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/08/04/noah-lyles-bronze-olympics-depression/\">post-meet interview</a> with the Washington Post. Tears started to fall when talking about his brother, Josephus Lyles, another professional sprinter, who failed to qualify for the Olympics that year. He spoke&nbsp;about his mental health and his journey with antidepressants leading up to the Olympics, as well as his experience marching alongside his brother in 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests, and the pressure he feels as a Black American athlete and a Black American man.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I knew there were a lot of people out there like me who were too scared to say something or start that journey,” he said. “I wanted them to know if you guys see me in a big light, I want you to know that it’s okay not to feel good and you can go out and talk to somebody … This is a serious issue.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2158934967_fdcc65.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower.\" title=\"Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Noah Lyles celebrates with the gold medal after winning the men’s 100-meter final on day three of the 2024 US Olympic Team trials Track &amp; Field at Hayward Field on June 23, 2024, in Eugene, Oregon. | Patrick Smith/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Patrick Smith/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, following a double-sprint win at the World Championships, Lyles is displaying more confidence than ever. During a recent appearance on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZRVEX2OG10\"><em>The Tonight Show</em></a>, Lyles took the opportunity to tell the country what he planned to achieve in Paris. For one thing, he wants to beat Bolt, who holds the top two times in the 100-meter dash at 9.63 and 9.69 seconds. But he also wants to take home four gold medals. “It’s not just good enough to be faster than that,” Lyles told Fallon. “You also have to have the medals to go with it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to taking home the gold in the 100 and 200 meter, Lyles wants to win in the 4&#215;100&nbsp;and 4&#215;400 meter relays. It wouldn’t be the first time an American sprinter nabbed four gold medals at one Olympics. For instance, Jesse Owens, Alvin Kraenzlein, and Carl Lewis have each won four. Their wins included the long jump, however; Lyles would be making history for those four sprints. Beyond any potential medals, the energy surrounding him and Richardson feels like a new era for American track stars, one defined by attitude and swagger. If Lyles can impress the world with his personality, he’ll at least have achieved half of his goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

On social media timelines the world over, Vice President Kamala Harris is currently being made into <a href=\"https://x.com/JoePostingg/status/1815387172469387530\">frenzied supercuts</a> where she dances, laughs, and delivers her now-iconic <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">metaphor about coconut trees</a> as she expounds on being “unburdened by what has been.” She’s being <a href=\"https://x.com/Saweetney/status/1813264361840148935\">edited into pop songs</a> and remixed <a href=\"https://x.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870\">queening out to “Brat,”</a> the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/354634/charli-xcx-brat-album-review\">Charli xcx album that’s become this summer’s</a> biggest cultural breakout and digital shorthand for unapologetic, messy hedonism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Memeability is an ineffable quality with undeniable electoral repercussions: Obama’s grabby slogans and punchy graphic design made him infinitely <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/11/obamas-yes-we-can-thank-michelle-for-that/\">more memeable</a> than standard-issue Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney, while Trump’s exaggerated facial expressions and off-the-cuff remarks can admittedly be very funny (who could forget <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NRUJbivhnE\">his reaction</a> to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death as “Tiny Dancer” played?) when they’re not overtly cruel. In both cases, the candidates’ ubiquitous internet presence spoke to their wider ability to capture young people’s attention and energy, even when the memes themselves were barely legible to the average voter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">why did I stay up till 3am making a von dutch brat coconut tree edit featuring kamala harris and why can’t I stop watching it on repeat <a href=\"https://t.co/hqcmerD1Pb\">pic.twitter.com/hqcmerD1Pb</a></p>&mdash; ryan (@ryanlong03) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 3, 2024</a></blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Democrats have been handed the blessing of completely organic Kamala memes. The out-of-context clips and creative edits of the vice president, usually steeped in at least some level of irony, gained steam following <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">Biden’s disastrous performance</a> at the June presidential debate, when swaths of voters were clamoring for a change in candidate and turned to the next most likely option.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Suddenly, mentions of the “KHive” were everywhere, referring to Harris’s supporters during her 2020 campaign, as were viral clips of Harris singing <a href=\"https://x.com/pIanetMEDIA/status/1589854533865607168?lang=en\">“The Wheels on the Bus,”</a> theatrically sharing <a href=\"https://x.com/rayofvenuss/status/1814096303854403711\">Thanksgiving turkey recipes</a> seconds before snapping to attention for an interview, and talking about her favorite subject, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymail/video/7394381952989596959\">Venn diagrams</a>. Harris is particularly prone to being memed: Many people on the internet have <a href=\"https://x.com/gayest_tone/status/1808249313455493491?s=46&amp;t=eeeaRs85C85Eh6UanNOWaQ\">described her kooky persona</a> as “your Xanned out aunt,” thanks to her propensity to burst into a high-pitched cackle at any moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Only recently has Harris herself embraced the jokes, now that she’s officially running for president with Biden’s backing. Should you visit the campaign’s <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHQ\">account</a> on X, you’ll notice a lime green banner with “kamala hq” written in the “Brat” font, an homage to the album cover. After Charli xcx <a href=\"https://x.com/charli_xcx/status/1815182384066707861\">tweeted</a> “kamala IS brat,” Harris followed her on both X and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fellow Democratic politicians have followed suit, with Illinois Gov. <a href=\"https://x.com/JBPritzker/status/1815401261690208303\">J.B. Pritzker asking</a>, “You think I just fell out of a coconut tree?” as his way of winkingly endorsing Harris (or perhaps gunning for a VP nomination), while Hawaii Sen. <a href=\"https://x.com/brianschatz/status/1815175570990276937\">Brian Schatz posted</a> a photo of himself climbing a literal coconut tree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>This, ultimately, is the power of memeability, or the talent of a candidate to transcend politics and become a legible cultural brand</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is this the beginning of a campaign that, for the first time since 2008, Democrats have actually found &#8230; fun? In 2016, the MAGA crowd delighted in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/21/12893656/pepe-frog-donald-trump\">memes circulated on red-pill forums</a> that depicted Trump as a cartoonish strongman who was exactly as hateful and despotic as the left feared. Everything that made him invigorating to his fans — an unlikely nominee who captured a certain kind of irony-poisoned nihilistic impulse on the internet — now seems to be working in progressives’ favor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until recently, 2024 promised to be one of the most uninteresting elections in history. After a series of extremely unpredictable events (a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357876/biden-trump-debate-cnn-won-step-down-atlanta\">poor debate performance</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates\">assassination attempt</a>, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-rehoboth-beach-harris-2024-ef4d643927247c59868607a80129c190\">case of Covid</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention\">historic dropout)</a>, Harris has now filled a most unlikely role: a Democratic presidential nominee who’s entertaining to watch, even if you don’t agree with everything she stands for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, ultimately, is the power of memeability, or the talent of a candidate to transcend politics and become a legible cultural brand. It has played a crucial role in elections since before anyone used the term: Memeability is Bill Clinton playing the saxophone on <em>Arsenio Hall,</em> and it’s Howard Dean’s awkward scream that lost him the 2004 Democratic nomination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Candidates have always attempted to stage this kind of virality — Hillary Clinton’s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/vvbwmj/hillary-clinton-accidentally-became-a-vine-meme\">“I’m just chilling in Cedar Rapids” Vine</a><em>, </em>for one<em> —</em> but the moments that truly take off lock into the absurdist, chaotic energy of the internet and are almost impossible to predict. Clinton never cracked that particular formula, whereas Harris has done it while barely even trying.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left\"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president.

I’ve gone so deep into the Kamala Harris YouTube archives, and there are just so many moments of her laughing and dancing.” The clips, he adds, stand in stark contrast to the stagnant mood coloring the Biden camp over the past year. “Kamala just brings new energy and the possibility of change,” he tells me. “She does such a good job of embodying ‘Brat’ summer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It wasn’t long ago that Harris was dubbed “Copmala” by liberals and leftists <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record\">dismayed by her “tough on crime” criminal justice record</a>. The vibe online has shifted significantly since then, and the left seems ready to <a href=\"https://x.com/thetolerantweft/status/1815142058555744734\">embrace the absurdity</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/chickenstrip007/status/1808154777634890089\">make peace</a> with the candidate they’ve been handed. Though <a href=\"https://x.com/julesterpak/status/1815444787375599814\">some online</a> have warned the Harris campaign against leaning into the jokes and memes too heavily or risk coming across as corny and try-hard, it’s just as easy to imagine large portions of voters excited about the prospect of a candidate who can — convincingly! — laugh along with them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m all in on President Kamala.

There’s an infallibility that comes with being in on the joke, and now that the Harris campaign has joined in, the attacks from the right don’t stick as they might have with a different candidate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was the RNC who made the <a href=\"https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811\">four-minute video</a> splicing together every time Harris used the phrase “unburdened” back in December. Now, the most popular quote tweet of that <a href=\"https://x.com/nikicaga/status/1815128527886303620\">post reads</a>, “The RNC staffer that posted this is getting executed as we speak,” referring to how the right’s criticisms of Harris have, so far, backfired. That Trump’s <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1814796045173272846\">epithet for her is “Laughin’ Kamala”</a> feels particularly uninspired when compared to “Sleepy Joe” and “Crooked Hillary” — laughing is, after all, a famously fun and good activity. The Harris campaign <a href=\"https://x.com/BMeiselas/status/1815226127121826009\">even gleefully reposted</a> a tweet advising Republicans to drop the “unburdened” jokes because “[t]hey’re going to spin that into marketing for her campaign.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What this all amounts to is a viral marketing stunt that any presidential candidate would pay millions for, but one that no strategist or ad agency could create. It’s all entirely organic, forged from the fires of a truly bizarre and unpredictable time, and the feeling that a little chaos might be exactly what American politics needs. For once, it really does seem like we can become unburdened from what has been. And perhaps Kamala Harris will be laughing all the way to the Oval Office.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Now, they hope, the party has a nominee who can take the fight to Trump — and win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These hopes are not yet supported by polling data, which currently shows Harris on track to lose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s approval rating is not good (38 percent approval, 50 percent disapproval in <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">FiveThirtyEight’s average</a>). She trails Trump by about 2 points nationally, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">on average</a>, and the <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/arizona/harris-trump-arizona/\">few</a> <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/michigan/harris-trump-michigan/\">public</a> <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/arizona/harris-trump-arizona/\">polls</a> <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/georgia/harris-trump-georgia/\">pitting</a> her against Trump in swing states nearly all show her behind, sometimes behind by a lot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, maybe those polls aren’t worth much since voters haven’t truly gotten to know Harris. Maybe she’ll wage a smart, vigorous campaign and win them over. Maybe the excitement her selection brings to the ticket will supercharge enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maybe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris also has some very real weaknesses as a candidate that could turn things the other way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Namely, she will be attacked as a San Francisco liberal elite. She will be held responsible for the Biden administration’s record rather than being able to have a clean slate. And her stint at the top of national politics has had its fair share of gaffes and reported staff turmoil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(Her race and gender will also be factors shaping how she is perceived, but they are not reasons to assume that she cannot win. And it’s worth evaluating her record, as well as her political persona, on their own terms.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has his own serious weaknesses, and it’s certainly possible that Harris could win. But she doesn’t start off as the favorite, and she has some real work to do.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris will be attacked as a San Francisco liberal elite</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement of Harris was met with tremendous excitement from Democrats’ donor base, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/harris-fundraising-biden-actblue.html\">$81 million</a> pouring into the campaign’s coffers in less than 24 hours. Anecdotally, I’ve heard tremendous optimism from people in my (educated coastal urban) circles that Harris will be a far superior candidate to Biden.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, if the presidential election was conducted among educated coastal urbanites, Harris would surely win in a walk. But in reality, a winning candidate needs the votes of other demographics too, including from some people who don’t like educated coastal urbanites very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps the biggest electoral story of the past decade has been the phenomenon of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/10/01/understanding-electorate-diploma-divide/\">education polarization</a>, in which college-educated voters have been trending increasingly toward Democrats while non-college voters have been moving more toward the GOP. These shifts were arguably decisive in tipping key Midwestern swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — toward Trump in 2016. Biden — “Joe from Scranton” — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/5/10/22425178/catalist-report-2020-election-biden-trump-demographics\">reversed them a bit</a> in 2020, just enough to eke out an Electoral College win. Notably, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/us/politics/how-college-graduates-vote.html\">Trump made significant gains</a> among voters of color without degrees that year, and 2024 polling has suggested these trends could continue.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/359620/kamala-harris-2020-president-campaign-2024-failure-lesson\">What happened last time Harris ran for president</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/362043/kamala-harris-vice-running-mate-democratic-presidential-ticket\">Who could be Harrris’s running mate?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361750/biden-drop-out-harris-endorse-polls-against-trump-democrats-dnc\">Does Harris give Democrats a better chance in 2024?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">Why is everyone talking about Harris and coconut trees?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee\">Harris’s strengths and vulnerabilities as a presidential candidate</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the reason for this, some Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html\">have argued</a>, is that their national party has lost the ability to communicate to non-college voters, that the party’s donor and staffer class are so dominated by the educated coastal elite that they no longer speak the same “language” as swing-state voters and their values have dramatically diverged from them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is extremely good at speaking the language of Democrats’ upscale voter base. That is how she rose in blue San Francisco and California politics, and that is why there was initial enthusiasm for her 2020 presidential campaign. It’s also a main reason why, after that campaign flopped, she still got picked as Biden’s running mate (Biden’s campaign was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/12/joe-biden-fundraising-394488\">similarly flooded with donations</a> after her selection).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But can she convince Midwestern swing voters she’s on their side, that she doesn’t view them as “<a href=\"https://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/\">deplorables</a>,” that she’s not some out-of-touch San Francisco liberal extremist? Can she “speak” swing voter in a convincing way? We simply don’t know yet. While she has made some campaign appearances in swing states, doing so as the nominee means she&#8217;ll be in the spotlight in a new way, with much higher stakes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris will have to defend the Biden administration’s unpopular record</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s probably unfair to put too much blame on Harris for her low approval numbers when their main cause is likely that she is part of the Biden-Harris administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if most Americans are not happy with the administration Harris has been a part of, that will be a problem for her candidacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the effort to push Biden off the ticket, there’s been a tendency among Democrats (who generally believe Biden has done a good job) to blame his political woes on his age rather than his record. They theorize that the policies have been good but there’s been a communication problem in explaining how good they are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling, though, has been pretty consistent that the American public believes the administration has handled <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/issues\">major issues poorly</a> — most notably the economy, immigration, and foreign policy, with voters <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-leads-biden-double-digits-three-key-issues-pew-research-survey\">consistently saying</a> Trump would do a better job on all three issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris was not personally responsible for policy on inflation, the border, the Afghanistan withdrawal, or the Israel-Gaza war. (Republicans have falsely called her the “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc\">border czar</a>,” when Harris was in fact tasked with the much more limited role of addressing “root causes” of unauthorized immigration abroad.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s true that Harris has staunchly defended the administration’s policies on these issues. It will be tough for her to criticize any decision (since doing so would raise the question of why she didn’t criticize it earlier). And it will be hard for her to make the case that she’d do things all that differently from Biden, considering she’s already been vice president for four years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, when a new nominee runs for president, they get to offer idealistic promises of change and break with how the incumbent has been doing things in areas where the public wants change. That will be difficult for Harris. She does not start with a clean slate; she is burdened by what has been. And the public is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx\">not happy</a> with how things have been under Biden.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris has had a tumultuous political history in national politics</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there is the question of whether Harris will be able to run an effective and successful presidential campaign. There’s an idealized, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">meme-worthy</a> image of Harris’s political appeal that has spread among Democrats eager to turn the page on Biden, but her track record at the top of national politics has been more mixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That began with her 2020 presidential campaign, which actually ended in December 2019. There is no shame in running in your party’s presidential primary and losing. Not every defeat is the candidate’s “fault” rather than a reflection of larger circumstances. A loss can position a candidate well for success next time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris’s campaign was chock-full of public missteps and reports of behind-the-scenes chaos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She had one viral moment in which she <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18932212/joe-biden-kamala-harris-desegregate-busing\">confronted Joe Biden</a> about his historic opposition to busing policy on the debate stage, but days after, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/harris-clarifies-stance-on-federally-mandated-school-busing\">she acknowledged</a> that her views on what busing policy should currently be weren’t any different from Biden’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris also <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18919494/democratic-debate-2019-kamala-harris-healthcare-policy\">struggled to answer questions</a> about her health care policy, at times seeming to support a version of Medicare-for-all that eliminates private health insurance and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/20/20813658/kamala-harris-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-2020\">at other times</a> saying she supported no such thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Internally, her campaign “became a hotbed of drama and backbiting,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/kamala-harris-2020-campaign/index.html\">according to CNN</a>, with finger-pointing leaks from rival factions constantly spilling out. She gave her sister Maya a key role, and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html\">New York Times reported</a> that “one campaign strategist said it was impossible to tell if Maya Harris was speaking for herself, as an adviser, or as her sister’s representative.” But in both of those stories, sources argued that the candidate’s own strategic indecisiveness was perhaps the campaign’s biggest problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this prevented Biden from picking her as his running mate in 2020. Then, early in his term, a similar story unfolded in the vice president’s office. In a high-profile interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in June 2021, Harris <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html\">struggled</a> to answer questions about the administration’s border policy, and claimed “we’ve been to the border” even though she had not. Afterward, she clamped down on her interview availability, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html\">reportedly</a> for fear of making further gaffes. (Amid all the scrutiny on Biden for doing few high-profile interviews, it’s worth noting that Harris hasn’t exactly been ubiquitous either.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/04/kamala-harris-staff-departures/\">story</a> after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html\">story</a> told of staff chaos in and departures from Harris’s office. A former aide offered scathing comments <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/04/kamala-harris-staff-departures/\">to the Washington Post</a>: “It’s clear that you’re not working with somebody who is willing to do the prep and the work. &#8230; With Kamala you have to put up with a constant amount of soul-destroying criticism and also her own lack of confidence. So you’re constantly sort of propping up a bully and it’s not really clear why.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be sure, Donald Trump’s staff drama in his campaigns and White House was far more intense (and it didn’t prevent him from winning in 2016). And reports of feuding in Harris’s office <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/12/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-party/index.html\">have lessened</a> in the past year or so; perhaps Harris has found advisers with whom she is more comfortable. But now she’s suddenly back in the spotlight, and the pressure is on. So now the question is will she rise to the challenge, overseeing and implementing a strategy and team that can win?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris is the underdog — but she<em> could</em> win</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this means that Harris absolutely cannot win.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problems above may be serious challenges for her campaign. And yes, she currently trails in the polls. But challenges can be addressed and polls can change. The election is more than three months away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s opponent, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/\">is also unpopular</a>. Democrats hope she can lean on her past as a former prosecutor to “prosecute” the case against him. Trump’s performance in the first debate was no great shakes; he may compare unfavorably to Harris in another — if he agrees to do it (and if he doesn’t, she can criticize him for that).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris will indeed energize the liberal base, and perhaps she’ll be more appealing to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/05/nx-s1-4987296/young-voters-biden-gaza-inflation-abortion-trump-genforward-poll\">young voters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/30/biden-black-voters-00160520\">Black voters</a>, who Biden has struggled with. She clearly has more energy and ability to campaign than Biden has had to this point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if the past month should tell us anything, it’s that the future of politics is never set in stone.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "As Democrats unite around Vice President Kamala Harris as their likely new nominee, their public mood is absolutely jubilant.

Democrats appear to be rallying around Biden’s preferred successor, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee\">Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, and it seems likely that she’ll be the presidential nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here are seven questions answered about what needs to happen before Harris can become the nominee, what an open process for selecting Democrats’ next presidential candidate might look like, and what’s next for Harris and her party.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) <strong>Will Harris automatically replace Biden as the Democratic nominee?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is not officially the Democrats’ nominee; the endorsement of the Democratic Party’s leader isn’t enough. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has acknowledged this and said that she intends to <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1815122383415529963\">“earn and win this nomination</a>.” While there is still technically a chance that she will not become the nominee, she has already locked in endorsements she needs to make it unlikely that anyone will credibly challenge her. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She has been endorsed by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-50-democratic-party-us-state-chairs-back-harris-sources-2024-07-21/\">all 50 Democratic state party chairs</a>, party leaders including <a href=\"https://x.com/axios/status/1815439766155874376\">former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, and many of her would-be Democratic rivals.

That means the nominee may be selected before nearly 4,000 delegates gather at the convention beginning August 19. Typically, delegates formally vote for the winner of the party’s primaries to be the official nominee at the convention — a process that recently played out at last week’s Republican National Convention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These delegates are party loyalists — everyone from poll workers to elected officials — and are allocated to every state or territory by the party. They are pledged to the candidate who wins their state’s primary, but they can theoretically deviate from that under the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/07/12/biden-delegates-good-conscience-convention/76c735d2-4092-11ef-83bf-e35a32077d3e_story.html\">DNC’s rules</a>, which state that they “shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden won over 3,800 of those delegates in the Democratic primary. They will now be released and allowed to vote for whichever candidate they wish. As of Monday afternoon, Harris had already secured the endorsement of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/ap-dnc-delegate-survey/\">1,1152</a> of the 1,986 delegates she would need to win the nomination.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) <strong>How will DNC delegates choose a nominee to replace Biden?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">State delegations will need to decide among themselves who they will back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, of those that have convened in the hours since Biden announced he was dropping out, many seem to be coalescing around Harris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When elaborating on their reasoning, many delegates have cited the fact that voters in their state <a href=\"https://x.com/edewittNH/status/1815192248209830243\">already backed the Biden-Harris ticket in the Democratic primary</a> and that she is qualified to carry the torch forward. In that sense, they see themselves as keeping the will of Democratic voters, but they are not directly soliciting new input from voters — at least not formally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4) <strong>What happens at the Democratic National Convention?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before Biden dropped out, the DNC had <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360917/biden-trump-harris-dnc-delegates\">planned a virtual roll call</a> to lock up the nomination before the convention. The DNC adopted the virtual procedure during the pandemic when the roll call — which would normally happen in person at the convention and in which delegates formally announce their votes and select their nominee — had to happen remotely.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats may now decide to hold a similar meeting before the convention and, if a majority of delegates support Harris, her nomination would be secured. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If not, then the matter could go to a technically open convention, which hasn’t happened since 1968. In every election since 1968, the convention has been about rallying around the nominee, rather than selecting them. But Harris has already secured the endorsements of so many delegates that it seems unlikely she would face any real competition at the convention or that an open convention would be nearly as contentious as 1968 was.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5) <strong>What is an open convention?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An open convention simply means one in which delegates hash out who the nominee will be. That’s a process more akin to how presidents used to be picked, but one that fell out of style following a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24034712/iowa-caucuses-history-first-gop-primary-2024\">Democratic convention meltdown in 1968</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since then, the process has been: Every state has a primary, many of them fairly early in the presidential cycle, and then the convention is held to certify the will of voters through a ceremonial nomination process that energizes the party ahead of Election Day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That can’t happen this time, but something like it might. An open convention doesn’t seem likely at this point, given how quickly Harris has rallied delegates in her favor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, on the off chance it does happen, here’s how an open convention would work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big thing to know is the process would unfold with delegates voting on the convention floor for the candidate they support as the nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A candidate would need a majority of the pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. If no candidate achieves this majority, then the convention would move to additional ballots, where delegates continue to vote until someone emerges as the winner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/open-convention-democrats-biden-drop-out/\">749 superdelegates</a>, who are high-profile party leaders ranging from members of Congress to former presidents. If they voted in a block, they could quickly help end the process by coalescing around one candidate (presumably Harris). However, they cannot vote on the first ballot at the convention. They participate in voting only if the convention goes to a second ballot or beyond.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6) <strong>What is the timeline for this process?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s up in the air for now, but the DNC’s meeting on Wednesday will be livestreamed. The rules committee is expected to lay out a timeline around then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7) <strong>So, can Kamala Harris go ahead and campaign?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris can start campaigning immediately. Indeed, she has already hit the ground running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out\">draw from Biden’s $240 million in campaign cash</a> because she was already on the Biden-Harris ticket. Unless they could self-fund their campaign, any other Democrat would face a steep uphill battle to counter the kind of resources currently behind Harris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DNC might not be able to officially support her until she secures the nomination, but that creates an imperative for the party to act quickly in deciding on a nominee. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Following Judge Beverly Cannone’s declaration of a mistrial, the prosecution immediately vowed to pursue a retrial; the second trial is <a href=\"https://people.com/karen-reads-new-trial-date-set-8681424\">currently scheduled</a> to begin in late January 2025. That likely means heightened public interest and further entrenchment of the bitter camps in this case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prosecution alleges that Read, a successful finance analyst and adjunct professor who’s far from the “typical” murder suspect, killed her boyfriend, 46-year-old Boston police officer John O’Keefe, in the early, snowy morning hours of January 29, 2022. According to prosecutors, Read, who stood trial for second-degree murder and manslaughter, deliberately backed into O’Keefe with her SUV while she was intoxicated, then drove home, leaving him lying in the cold. O’Keefe <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/karen-read-trial-john-okeefe-death-what-know-rcna155905\">died from</a> blunt force trauma and hypothermia. But at trial, things were anything but clear; <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-juror-unanimous-verdict-not-guilty/\">reports indicate</a> the jury would have unanimously acquitted Read on charges of murder and leaving the scene, but were torn on the lesser charges, with a “soft” 9-3 split in favor of conviction for manslaughter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among the main pieces of evidence in the state’s favor: Read herself asking various witnesses, “Could I have hit him?” the next morning, after awakening and returning to the house to look for him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read, on the other hand, alleges that she’s been framed, in a spiraling conspiracy that began with a party full of witnesses lying about what happened and soon encompassed the entire Boston Police Department (BPD) and the prosecutor’s office. While from one standpoint, Read’s defense may be grasping at straws in its attempt to paint the case as a frame-up, from another, it’s the kind of police work Bostonians — and those in other cities across the country — have come to expect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The trial has developed from what initially seemed to investigators like an open-and-shut case into a reckoning with a criminal justice system the public no longer trusts.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The murky facts of the case</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read claims that after she and O’Keefe spent until <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/10/karen-read-murder-trial-day-9-a-full-day-of-new-witnesses/\">around midnight</a> drinking at a local bar, she dropped O’Keefe off to hang out at the home of retired BPD officer Brian Albert. Several people who were either members of the BPD or affiliated with the local justice system were also at the house, but no one who was there corroborates her story. Not one of them says they saw O’Keefe enter the building; instead, they all claim they had no idea O’Keefe had even arrived at the house until his body was located outside of it in the snow the next morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read, however, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZvaqbbul6o\">maintains</a> that she watched O’Keefe go into the house before she left the scene. She alleges that O’Keefe must have been injured inside the house, that the partygoers staged the crime scene to look like a hit-and-run, and that they have lied about it ever since. Her defense argues that the injuries O’Keefe sustained resulted from a physical fight and a dog attack from a German shepherd mix Albert owned.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The defense alleges the investigation was hindered from the start by a failure to treat the Albert house as a possible crime scene and a failure to treat the witnesses as possible persons of interest; <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/karen-read-officer-death-boston-officer-testimony-298b2aa70e1b6d8b13cc556daf3b4b0c\">two</a> of the primary investigative team members also have <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-day-13/3371005/\">personal links</a> to the witnesses. Further undermining the police were the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/police-red-plastic-cups-collect-204315489.html\">bizarre methods</a> they used, including using leaf blowers to clear away snow (and potentially evidence) at the crime scene, and using <a href=\"https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-items-police-used-scene-john-okeefes-death-canton-shown-court/L7ZEE2HGAVEU5NKMINUYB6KJWQ/\">solo cups and grocery bags</a> to collect evidence. Add to that a parade of unprofessional conduct and comments from officers, particularly from a lead investigator <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/\">who was fired</a> immediately after the mistrial, and the case has morphed into a genuine public scandal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the investigation and the widely publicized trial, a highly vocal contingent of supporters from Boston and beyond have made Read into a true crime cause célèbre; one <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/809459493961162/\">Facebook group</a> supporting her has over 50,000 members. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/351238/serial-true-crime-podcast-criminal-justice-adnan-syed\">a decade of thriving interest in true crime</a>, trial-watchers are hyper-vigilant to potential injustices and the shortcomings of law enforcement. In the eyes of many, the case has become a referendum on corrupt cops — a subject Bostonians <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/investigations/cdl-bribery-scheme-is-one-of-several-recent-misconduct-cases-plaguing-mass-state-police/3263475/\">know</a> all too well after decades of police misconduct ranging from <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/mass-state-trooper-ordered-to-falsify-records-cleared-of-wrongdoing/1959608/\">cover-ups</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/ex-head-of-mass-state-police-union-gets-prison-for-fraud-racketeering/3042305/\">kickbacks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read’s relentless conspiracy defense has been driven by incendiary star lawyer Alan Jackson, a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2013-feb-06-la-me-jackson-20130207-story.html\">former prosecutor</a> turned defense attorney who’s defended both <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24144453/harvey-weinstein-overturned-conviction-explained-eliza-orlins-molineaux-rule-sandoval\">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/3/16602628/kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-allegations-house-of-cards\">Kevin Spacey</a>. O’Keefe, the victim, has been fully overshadowed by the conversation around the case, with Read’s supporters <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-aidan-kearney-turtleboy-canton-massachusetts/\">allegedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.courttv.com/title/okeefe-family-reportedly-being-harassed-by-read-supporters/\">harassing</a> his family members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This polarization outside of the courtroom seems to have been reflected in the jury. After deliberating for less than a week, the jury tried repeatedly to declare themselves deadlocked to Judge Cannone, sending her notes to that effect. “We find ourselves deeply divided by fundamental differences in our opinions and state of mind,” a note from the day of the mistrial <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-deadlocked-jury-note/3415285/\">read</a>, citing “deeply held convictions that each of us carry, ultimately leading to a point where consensus is unattainable.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A deadlocked or hung jury results in a mistrial, after which the prosecution has to decide whether to retry the case. In this case, the prosecution seems intent on a retrial — despite the many, many problems with their arguments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The prosecution’s case is a circumstantial mess</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite presenting over 70 witnesses at trial, the prosecution’s primary evidence against Read remains largely circumstantial — meaning there’s very little direct or physical evidence backing their theory of what happened — and Read’s defense has offered up alternative theories for much of it. The timeline of the evening goes like this: After leaving a bar in Canton, Massachusetts, Read — whose blood alcohol content was likely <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/\">over</a> the legal limit — drove O’Keefe to Albert’s house. There, she either saw him safely inside or backed over him in the snow. In either event, she left the scene and drove home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Afterward, she left him an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-27/\">angry voicemail</a> declaring, “John, I fucking hate you.” Throughout the night, <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/20/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-thursday-june-20/\">Read called</a> O’Keefe and numerous other people. Early the next morning, she met up with two friends, including major prosecution witness Jennifer McCabe, who is also Albert’s sister-in-law, and drove back to Albert’s house, where they discovered O’Keefe in the snow. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/\">According to witnesses</a>, Read repeatedly asked whether O’Keefe could have been hit by a snow plow, or whether she could have hit him. Multiple first responders <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-massachusetts-murder-trial/\">also testified</a> to hearing Read repeatedly exclaiming that she hit him, though none of them <a href=\"https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/court-video-updates-karen-read-murder-trial-continues-with-more-first-responder-testimony/CINVO2VGPJCVDF6JDAPI3VJ6PU/\">noted this</a> in their <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/karen-read-trial-day-2-witness-testimony-continues/3354128/\">initial reports</a> from the scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This alleged repeated refrain of, “Could I have hit him?” and “I hit him,” was one the prosecution <a href=\"https://www.wcvb.com/article/i-hit-him-prosecution-quotes-testimony-in-closing-argument-for-karen-read-case/61367569\">leaned on heavily</a> as an argument for guilt. However, per witness accounts, Read also appeared to have no clear idea what had happened to O’Keefe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What concrete evidence the prosecution did offer was hotly contested inside as well as outside the courtroom. One crucial piece: a broken taillight. An investigator who interviewed Read at her parents&#8217; house that night <a href=\"https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html\">reported</a> seeing “some damage” to the right rear light of Read’s SUV; he testified that it was allegedly “cracked and a piece was missing.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly three weeks after O’Keefe’s death, the state’s lead investigator, Michael Proctor, <a href=\"https://www.courttv.com/title/scientist-compares-plastic-tail-light-pieces-in-karen-read-trial/\">allegedly located</a> more fragments of a tail light at the crime scene and transported the evidence to the crime lab. <a href=\"https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html\">Prosecutors say</a> they found minute traces of O’Keefe’s DNA on those fragments, as well as tiny particles from the tail light on some of O’Keefe’s clothes. Yet the defense hammered home the enormous delay in locating what would have been an incredibly significant piece of evidence, as well as the unreliability of evidence suddenly unearthed by Proctor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s because Proctor has multiple personal ties to both the victim and the witnesses. In texts he sent a day after the investigation began, he used a <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/\">misogynistic slur</a> to refer to Read, made it clear he thought Read’s guilt was obvious from the beginning, and even <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-live-stream-michael-proctor/\">texted</a> his sister that he hoped Read would kill herself. The defense alleges Proctor helped frame Read for the murder, deliberately damaging her tail light in order to claim the damage was caused when she hit O’Keefe with her car. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.wcvb.com/article/karen-read-trial-mirrored-video-evidence-impact/61041808\">a mysteriously altered video</a> of Read’s car that purportedly showed the damage made it all the way to trial before the defense pointed out that the image was misleadingly reversed — a “mirror” video with the tail light in question inverted from its actual position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It doesn’t help any of these optics that Proctor’s sister <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/\">texted him</a> that Albert’s wife Julie wanted to send Proctor “a gift” after the investigation was over. Proctor protested on the stand that none of these texts impacted the integrity of the police investigation, but given Monday’s mistrial, some jurors may have disagreed with him. They evidently weren’t alone: State police announced that they had <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/\">fired Proctor</a> immediately after the mistrial based on “information about serious misconduct [that] emerged in testimony” — an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/10/19/21523030/police-unions-misconduct-accountability-brutality-massachusetts-reform-violence\">extraordinarily rare move</a> on their part.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other facts of the case that on their surface might have supported the prosecution proved murkier on closer inspection. O’Keefe died of blunt-force trauma from a skull fracture and hypothermia, according to the medical examiner. He also had <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/19/metro/karen-read-trial-what-does-the-forensic-evidence-say/\">gashes on his arms</a> that seemed unlikely to have been made from a car impact. The defense alleged these resulted from a dog attack on O’Keefe inside the house. O’Keefe also <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/karen-reads-boyfriend-john-okeefe-had-no-broken-bones-doctor-reveals\">lacked</a> many of the injuries you’d expect to see from a car impact, such as broken bones or significant bruises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prosecution’s witnesses are also controversial. In addition to Read&#8217;s former friend McCabe, who had ties to both O’Keefe and the Alberts, the party attendees included several people that Read’s defense argued should have been investigated by police before taking the stand. Among them: Brian Higgins, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who’d been <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/05/24/karen-read-trial-brian-higgins-flirty-texts-kiss/\">sporadically flirting</a> with Read in the lead-up to O’Keefe’s death, and Albert’s son Colin, who as a teenager had made <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-murder-trial-day-13/\">violent threats against other teens</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of the witnesses who were at the party, including McCabe and the Alberts, exchanged a litany of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-irresolvable-tragedy-of-the-karen-read-case\">phone calls to one another</a> throughout the time O’Keefe supposedly lay on the lawn, per phone records. Several later <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/why-so-many-butt-dials-who-called-who-and-when-in-the-karen-read-case/3384232/\">testified</a> that the calls were “butt dials,” placed randomly and by complete mistake. As circumstances go, it’s eyebrow-raising, to say the least.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The defense’s evidence is equally unreliable</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite all the problems with the prosecution’s case, the strongest evidence for the defense is likewise fully debatable. One of the defense’s key witnesses was a veteran snowplow driver who made multiple trips past the Alberts’ house during the time O’Keefe was allegedly wounded in the snow, yet <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-28/\">claimed</a> he saw no body lying anywhere on the lawn. However, snow impedes visibility, even with a bright snowplow light, and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/\">eyewitness testimony</a> is notoriously unreliable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another piece of crucial evidence that many Read supporters consider a “smoking gun” for the defense has also been fully debunked by prosecution analysts. At issue: <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-day-16-jennifer-mccabe/\">Two searches</a> McCabe made on her cellphone at some point during the early morning hours surrounding O’Keefe’s death, including a misspelled query, “Hos long to die in cold.” The prosecution claims, and McCabe testified, that she made the searches around six in the morning when she and Read found O’Keefe lying in the snow. The official cellphone records for the search, however, show the <a href=\"https://x.com/bostonherald/status/1793566054066569408\">timestamp</a> for the search at 2:27 am.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The implication is that if McCabe searched for this then, she was part of a conspiracy to stage the scene and frame Read. But McCabe claims she merely opened that tab on her phone browser at 2:27 am, left it open, and searched the phrase hours later, after she and Read found him together. Multiple data analysts for the prosecution <a href=\"https://whdh.com/news/state-police-troopers-digital-forensic-expert-testify-as-karen-read-murder-trial-continues/\">corroborated</a> this interpretation of the cellphone data. Still, the defense scored a point in their favor by <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/21/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-friday-june-21/\">noting</a> that their expert witness, who argued the search occurred at 2:27, arrived at his conclusion by using a method developed by one of the prosecution’s witnesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other findings that leaned toward the defense included O’Keefe’s fitness tracker app, which showed him taking about 80 steps around the time Reed claimed she dropped him off. Yet here again, nothing about the timeline or O’Keefe’s activity is clear or corroborated by witnesses. The defense’s argument that O’Keefe was attacked inside the house, including by the family dog, is also speculative and unsupported by much evidence — which they claim is because the police never properly investigated. A medical expert <a href=\"https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-will-judge-allow-testimony-doctor-who-believes-okeefe-was-attacked-by-dog/67PPY2IWJ5DZTMVTK46CLMGEOE/\">testified</a> on the stand in support of the dog bite theory, but forensic bite mark evidence is incredibly unreliable and has been more or less <a href=\"https://www.todaysrdh.com/the-unreliability-of-bitemark-evidence-implications-for-forensic-odontology-in-legal-proceedings/\">fully debunked</a>, at least in cases involving humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So where does all of this leave us?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Corruption at the core</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ironically, outrage for the police’s conduct in this case has united Bostonians across political lines, with <a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/04/as-jurors-are-empaneled-at-karen-reads-trial-her-supporters-gather-at-a-distance.html\">community activists</a> joining the likes of local conservative pundit <a href=\"https://wrko.iheart.com/featured/the-howie-carr-show/content/2024-06-20-1270-the-howie-carr-radio-netw-meatball-morrisseys-revenge-messages-against/\">Howie Carr</a>. Meanwhile, hundreds of Read supporters traveled from <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/free-karen-read-supporters-murder-trial-dedham-court/\">across the country</a> to protest for her freedom outside the courthouse. They sometimes clashed with O’Keefe’s family and their&nbsp;supporters, who <a href=\"https://www.wcvb.com/article/tensions-run-high-outside-courthouse-as-jury-deliberates-karen-read-case/61456283\">argue</a> Read’s defense has turned a clear case of murder into a distorted media circus and fueled unfounded accusations of conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The mistrial means that the narrative of the case has also expanded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the one hand, popular resistance to the idea that a successful, articulate white woman could commit such a brutal murder might be fueling a good deal of the support for Read — which speaks to lots of assumptions about how we view class, privilege, and who gets to be seen as a victim. We’re accustomed, after all, to seeing women like Read in the role of the victim,&nbsp;no matter that she is the one on trial here. When it comes to true crime, the media <a href=\"https://jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/sites/jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/files/2022-11/True%20Crime%20and%20Danger%20Narratives-%20Reflections%20on%20Stories%20of%20Violence%2C%20Race%2C%20and%20%28In%29justice%20.pdf\">gives more attention</a> and sympathy to attractive middle-class white women than it does to male victims, much less victims who are poor or people of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Boston police are famously corrupt, with a long history of <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/1027/abos.html\">bribery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/retired-boston-police-captain-found-guilty-overtime-fraud-scheme\">fraud</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022-03-16/reforming-the-boston-police-has-been-a-hard-fought-uphill-series-of-battles-over-the-last-50-years\">racial bias</a>. The Read case is being compared to another possible homicide involving a <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/24/metro/sandra-birchmore-death-stoughton/\">horrifying allegation</a> of police conspiracy in nearby Stoughton, but this isn&#8217;t just a regional issue. American cities are frequently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/26/9036859/compstat-police-corruption\">beset</a> by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/8/4/23820288/six-former-mississippi-police-offers-plead-guilty-assault\">actual</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/2/16961146/baltimore-gun-trace-task-force-trial\">proven</a> police <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd\">corruption</a>. Boston isn’t unique. What does feel unique is the amount of public attention and scrutiny being given to the role of potential corruption in such a high-profile trial. It all adds up to what may well be a hopelessly irreconcilable pursuit of truth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, July 22, 3:40 pm:</strong> This story was originally published on July 3 and has been updated with the date for Karen Read’s new trial in 2025.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Sorry — actually it starts with the context of what came before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re an active internet denizen, you might already know what I’m referencing: a viral clip of Vice President Kamala Harris delivering a speech while repeating a question that she says her mother often posed to her: “‘You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if you’re fortunate enough not to live online, this is your guide to catching up on all the Kamala Harris memes. Many have been percolating for months (or even longer). Now that President Joe Biden has announced he will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention\">step off the Democratic ticket</a> and endorse Harris as his preferred presidential nominee, the memes are everywhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The coconut line is more than a year old: from a swearing-in ceremony that Harris led in May 2023 in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. But it’s also a stand-in for how the vice president is often perceived in pop culture, in mainstream media, and online: as a bit of a punchline, someone lacking serious power and with a perplexing political track record, and as the closest we’ll get to recreating Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s character in HBO’s <em>Veep.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president.

The surge in Harris memes after Biden&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">disastrous debate</a> performance was<strong> </strong>a symptom of the angst and uncertainty many Americans were feeling as the country and the Democratic Party navigated yet another crisis. Now, it appears to be a more earnest excitement and bewilderment by the internet&#8217;s denizens as the Democratic Party moves to nominate the first woman of color to be a major party presidential nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, to guide you through this discourse, I’ve rounded up a few of the most popular memes, starting with the foundational one.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>“Coconut trees” and the context of what came before</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the vice president referred to her mom’s question about falling out of a coconut tree, she was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JWR29RT5sw\">recounting a lesson</a> about the importance of history. Speaking to government appointees who would work on economic and education equity for Hispanic Americans, she emphasized that their task would be to aid not only young people, but also their parents, grandparents, teachers, and communities, “because none of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And she <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-swearing-in-ceremony-of-commissioners-for-the-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-hispanics/\">continued</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the takeaway is clear enough, something that’s been said for centuries: No person is an island.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it was her delivery that turned it into a meme: in a joking voice, with exaggerated hand and arm gestures, and with a signature Kamala Harris laugh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, social media users and right-wing accounts <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree\">accused</a> her of behaving strangely: “Obviously drunk,” one <a href=\"https://x.com/Rifleman4WVU/status/1656441274906320896\">viral tweet</a> said, while others used clips of the speech to describe being intoxicated or inebriated (which itself is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slimjosa/status/1808303666203697643\">another Harris meme</a>).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Being “unburdened by what has been”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Around the time of the most recent return of the coconut tree clip, another of Harris’s quotes began to circulate: not a memorable one-off, but a catchphrase she uses over and over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was a <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1310607188566724610\">go-to line</a> during her 2020 presidential primary campaign and into the general election as Biden’s running mate: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And thanks to a <a href=\"https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811\">Republican Party supercut</a> of all the times Harris has used the phrase in speeches, interviews, and appearances, the phrase went viral again. “Four straight minutes of ‘what can be, unburdened by what has been.’ It’s incredible. I had no idea she used it this much,” one Republican staffer <a href=\"https://x.com/thejcoop/status/1806867772988625316\">said</a> as he reshared the clip in the aftermath of the first presidential debate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The literal meaning of this catchphrase varies from speech to speech, but it’s often used in the context of Harris’s trailblazing career, marking historic firsts as a woman of color in elected office and carrying the weight of history, or as a call to arms to dream bigger and leave the past behind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a way, this quote contradicts Harris’s coconut tree line. As one <a href=\"https://x.com/Sturgeons_Law/status/1807513289330450566\">X user</a> put it: “How are you supposed to exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you AND be, unburdened by what has been at the same time? Waiting for her 3rd great revelation that synthesizes these two.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The “significance of the passage of time”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speaking at an <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?518860-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-affordable-broadband-access\">event in Louisiana</a> to announce millions of dollars in funding for broadband access, Harris referenced touring a library and reflected on historical inequities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We were talking about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. When you think about it, there is a great significance in the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She repeated the phrase a few more times, as noted in a clip widely <a href=\"https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1808533077271990424\">shared online</a>, and especially by right-wing users in the last few days.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The wheels on the bus </strong><strong><em>do</em></strong><strong> go round and round</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When seeing her campaign tour bus for the first time in 2019 during the Democratic presidential primaries, another video of Harris being a little awkward was shared on social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the camera pans 180 degrees around her, she walks across a lawn and onto the bus as she giggles and sings “the wheels on the bus go round and round,” slightly <a href=\"https://x.com/drmistercody/status/1808229682825122190\">off-key</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The vice president does impressions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More recently, clips of Harris showing another kind of less polished persona have also reappeared online: one from the ceremonial swearing-in of senators in January 2023, when <a href=\"https://x.com/_natemorris/status/1610652197968089088\">Harris imitates</a> Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet’s deep booming voice, and another from 2019, when she <a href=\"https://x.com/GraduatedBen/status/1808276737005916267\">imitates</a> her husband’s parents’ voices <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAPOKDV-nY\">during an interview</a> at the 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Y in New York City.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>There are plenty more</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You might remember other classic Harris deliveries — or you might be encountering them for the first time:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-did-it-joe\">“We did it, Joe.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/findareaction/status/1588718308060168193\">“I love Venn diagrams.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/TheMemesArchive/status/1557191149424713728\">“I love good news.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How she <a href=\"https://x.com/CapehartJ/status/1595526310335586305\">seasons a turkey</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1794818668200608070\">“Do not come.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s stint as vice president has often been pretty unremarkable, but it has provided a rich vein of memes, in part because she can be an awkward communicator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s part of what fueled critical media coverage of her during the first year of her tenure, and which led the White House to largely sideline her during the first half of the Biden presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other Kamala memes are rooted in the hokey nature of a lot of modern political speech: derived from aphorisms and pseudo-philosophical diction in the hope of echoing something like former President Barack Obama’s oratory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the first female, Black, and South Asian vice president, Harris was always doomed to receive an extraordinary amount of scrutiny and bias — and emphasized her persona as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuEZcAgOQs0\">“joyful warrior”</a> in part to combat some of those stereotypes. The joyful warrior, it seems, is sometimes a goofy one too. Harris delivers many of these lines in a genuinely funny way, with an affect unlike many politicians (described sometimes as just <a href=\"https://x.com/Chelsea_Fagan/status/1591478294444400640\">vibing</a> along).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, all this talk about being KHive pilled, or coconutpilled<strong>,</strong> especially from people who were skeptical or critical of the vice president just a few weeks ago<strong> </strong>speaks to the uncertainty of this moment. Plenty of people were wondering whether Biden would still be the Democratic nominee by the end of the summer. They’re meme-ing their way to a new celebration of Harris — unburdened by what has been. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Update, July 22, 2:50 pm ET:<em> </em></strong><em>This story was originally published <em>on July 3</em> <em>in the aftermath of the first 2024 presidential debate </em>and has been updated to include news about Joe Biden dropping out of the race and Kamala Harris becoming the likely Democratic nominee.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

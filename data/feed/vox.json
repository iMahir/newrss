At the same time, it’s very much about one specific thing: the human obsession with tornadoes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their destructive power. Their unpredictability. Their elusiveness. What isn’t endlessly fascinating about a 300-mph, five-minute long wind storm capable of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/7/30/20746792/tornado-alley-twister-us\">cataclysmic destruction</a>? And because of that collective fascination with cyclones — and perhaps the human fascination with the nearly 30-year-old original movie and Hollywood’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22890147/scream-5-matrix-4-legacyquel\">love of a franchise</a> — Universal is releasing a follow-up, <em>Twisters</em>, on July 19.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In honor of <em>Twister</em> and <em>Twisters</em>, I sought out an expert to further shed light on the human-tornado-<em>Twister</em> dynamic. Finding a tornado to interview was difficult, but I did speak to <a href=\"https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/geography-meteorology/about-us/facultyandstaff/calldavid\">Dave Call</a>, a storm chaser since the ’90s and professor at Ball State University’s geography and meteorology program. Call is currently writing a memoir about his storm chasing experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Call explained to me, there are a lot of factors that have and haven’t changed storm chasing in the 28 years since<em> Twister</em>’s release, but the main thing to know is that while the chase to find them might be easier, the actual causes of tornadoes are still as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22465340/tornado-science-how-do-they-form-mystery\">unpredictable and mysterious</a> as they’ve ever been.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be clear, storm chasing is dangerous. The material in this story is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute professional advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Dave. I must know. Have you seen </strong><strong><em>Twister</em></strong><strong>? Did it have any significant impact on you and storm chasing?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I want to say it came out after my first or second year in college. So of course we had to go see it. And meteorology majors, my friends and I, enjoyed poking fun at some of the weather shenanigans that took place in the movie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What were the “weather shenanigans” that you thought were funny?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is more like insider baseball, but for starters: these crazy tornadoes. Tornadoes themselves are actually pretty rare. It’s also unusual how all these people could amazingly survive all these deadly tornadoes. Like, [if you’re in the middle of a tornado] the building’s not gonna get <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlzxlWzqtvk\">blown <em>away</em> from you</a>. You’re gonna get flattened by the building or the cows and things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2571_D038_00298RV2_CROP.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.5936325236149,100,82.81273495277\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A still from &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;/em&gt; which may feature some zany weather shenanigans divorced from how dangerous and scary tornadoes actually are.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You mentioned that you’ve been storm chasing unofficially since the ’90s — around when </strong><strong><em>Twister</em></strong><strong> first hit theaters — and officially at Ball State since 2008. Can you tell me about your experience?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I came to Ball State, they asked if I could teach the storm chasing class that my predecessor developed. And I thought, sure, why not? I love to travel. I like the weather. And now I&#8217;ve done it 19 times, and we’ve covered close to 130,000 miles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Are you and your class looking for tornadoes specifically?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We are looking for tornadoes, but tornadoes are random freaks of nature. Most tornadoes last less than five minutes. If you see a tornado, it’s obviously a big rush. It’s exciting and amazing. But I always have to tamp down expectations because if you go out there only to see tornadoes, you’re going to end up being very disappointed — we’re often at the mercy of the bigger weather pattern. In roughly about half of our trips, we’ve seen a tornado.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re also out there learning a lot more about how thunderstorms work, and students get a great chance to forecast and figure out what storms are going to do in a situation where stakes are relatively low. I’m also going to make sure we don’t, you know, get ourselves killed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>That’s a good goal! What’s the scariest experience you’ve had?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several times we have been caught in torrential rain and visibility goes to near zero.&nbsp;Imagine the heaviest rain you’ve experienced, then double the intensity. Driving is dangerous and we have lost awareness of where the tornado may be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But you asked for a specific moment, so here’s a story: In June 2012, we were in the Oklahoma panhandle.&nbsp;A rotating storm was to our northwest, so we went to the west to get a better look.&nbsp;As we approached, it developed a wall cloud — a precursor to a tornado&nbsp;— but also turned to the southeast.&nbsp;Suddenly we were in danger. Because the storm had turned, heavy rain was now behind us, and we couldn’t go back the way we came. In front of us was a rotating wall cloud!&nbsp;Our only option was to skirt the wall cloud as we went west to the next paved road south, into Texas.&nbsp;Those were some very tense minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2012texas.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The storm professor Dave Call mentioned as being one of the scariest in his storm chasing career. | David Call/Ball State\" data-portal-copyright=\"David Call/Ball State\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do you have any safety tips?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before going on our storm chasing trip, students must score over 80 percent on a safety quiz!&nbsp;Here are my five most important tips:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Never chase at night.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Never chase near cities or forested areas.&nbsp;You can’t see anything, you can’t move quickly, and you could be hit by debris.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Never chase on interstates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Never chase alone. Corollary: chase with someone with experience. It’s dangerous to look at the radar, read the map, and look at the storm while trying to drive!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Always have at least one escape route​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s been the biggest change in storm chasing since you’ve been storm chasing?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Technology has really made it much easier for anybody to go out and chase storms. Nowadays, anybody can go out with radar on their phone and try to position themselves to see a tornado. You could spend 10 to 15 minutes poking around online and learn enough about how supercell storms are structured to figure out how to chase one yourself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I don’t know if chasing storms is really for me [Ed note: It isn’t.], but it sounds like it’s a matter of data and information.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you went out storm chasing in the ’80s or early ’90s, it was all basically visual storm chasing. If you really wanted to know what was going on, you’d have to pop into a weather service office somewhere, or have somebody in an office somewhere that you could call into and ask what the weather looks like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, I want to say it was in the 1990s, you started to be able to get some satellite feeds of weather. These were expensive and you needed special equipment, but at least now you could get radar information in your vehicle. You still might have to go to the Weather Service, or go to a library to find the internet to get weather data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first year I went out in 2008 [with Ball State], we had a satellite feed of weather information, and we actually stopped at the library several times to get weather information. Then the year after that, we went ahead and got a mobile hotspot and we could look at weather information on our laptop. But of course, the problem was that the cellphone network 15 years ago was sparse if you had the wrong carrier or you were in the wrong area. And keep in mind, a lot of times these storms are in pretty rural areas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in the last 15 years, the cellphone networks have greatly improved and you have all this stuff on your phone. The original software we were using back in the late ’90s, early 2000s — the startup cost to get into storm chasing could be pushing four figures. Well now, if you have a phone and you buy an app, you’re talking maybe $10. So it’s so much easier to get that radar information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Are there any other game changers?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Navigation. In 2008, we were using paper maps. I mean, there’s that line in the <em>Twister</em> movie&nbsp;about rolling the maps. GPS has gotten better and you can immediately see where you are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>It sounds like tech is the great equalizer. Like anyone can do storm chasing and it’s super popular — maybe more popular than the time after the original movie. But it also doesn’t seem like there’s a strict “storm chaser” label anymore.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing I talked about early on in my book is about storm chasing in general and how there’s a lot of people that are out there observing storms and doing different things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I mean, there’s weather researchers, and there’ll be some professors or research scientists who may be professors or government — it all gets a little confusing — but they’re out there. But then there’s also people like me that are teaching classes. There are journalists that are covering it as part of their job. There are weather spotters, and then just people doing it because they find it cool, like the people who hike to the tops of mountains or try to get to every country in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I want to talk about those weather researchers. The original movie centered on storm chasers and the lack of data they had about tornadoes. Is that still the case some 30 years later? Are tornadoes still a big mystery to us? What questions do we still have about them?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m trying to give you an answer without going too far beyond what I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ll say this: We know a lot more about tornadoes and how they work. We know a lot more about how tornadoes form. But one of the challenges we still have is figuring out which thunderstorms will produce a tornado and which ones won’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By comparison, hurricanes don’t take us by surprise. We have giant satellites. And as we’ve seen with [Hurricane] Beryl, they may rapidly intensify or weaken but they occur over a relatively long period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tornadoes are so brief. We’re getting better at answering that question, but the challenge is that we’re getting to the edge of what we can easily measure. Being able to get the data we need to unlock them is hard because it’s a very tiny scale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>It sounds like trying to hit a moving target, while you yourself are moving too. It also sounds like a problem from the original movie: Tornadoes are still very unpredictable and getting immense amounts of data of this random, fleeting thing is very difficult.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, it’s the age-old mystery and question surrounding meteorology. So much of it all is in those subtle details. Which is ironic because in a sense, that’s the most important thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the Greensburg tornado, <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/ddc/greensburgfiveyear\">which leveled the Kansas town in 2007</a>, was three miles south, it would have just been another tornado. It would have been an intense one, but not [one that caused so much destruction].&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is that the reason why humans are still so crucial in meteorology and storm chasing?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A good example would be flying. Autopilot is great, but what about when it really matters: take-off, landing, or bad weather?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I hate to admit it, but a computer can do as good a forecast as I can and, many days out of the year, your weather app is gonna get you a reasonably good forecast. But the days when it matters — the days with tornadoes, the days when there’s a potential blizzard about to hit New York City, the days when there’s a hurricane that’s going to come ashore — those are the days when you need meteorologists.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can see these things, these big ingredients coming together, and then downscaling all that to individual storms, and then individual tornadoes at specific times at specific locations. The devil is in the details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>In recent years, we’ve heard about the link between </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous\"><strong>climate change and extreme weather</strong></a><strong>. Does climate change have an effect on storm chasing or tornadoes?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To get thunderstorms, you need a bunch of different factors to come together. Climate change modifies some factors in favorable manners and unfavorable manners. How climate change may affect the number of storms, the intensity and the severity of storms, and the location of storms — those are all things we’re still trying to figure out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was just something that came out, I want to say it was in the last couple of months, a paper that suggested that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/10/weather-tornado-alley-east\">tornadoes are shifting eastward in the country</a>, out of the Plains and more into sort of the Mississippi Valley. That would actually make storm chasing a little harder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where the research gets sort of messy because you’ve got a bunch of things all changing at once. But the fact is that if storms move out of the Great Plains, that would be bad for storm chasing because it’s much easier to chase when you have open landscapes with relatively few trees, few hills, and few people.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2154180071.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The aftermath of a tornado that touched down on May 22, 2024, in Greenfield, Iowa. As advanced as meteorology tech has become, predicting tornadoes is still difficult. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Scott Olson/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Anecdotally, there’s some talk among storm chasers that the seasons these days aren’t as good as they used to be, and I’m not going to speculate on whether that’s true or not. But yes, climate change may affect where storms occur and when they occur, and make it harder to chase storms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The good analogy with climate change is that it’s sort of stacking the deck. I do an example with my students in class where I take a deck of cards, and I pull out a few of the black cards. Now guess what? When you start turning over cards, you get a lot more red cards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>So climate change isn’t necessarily directly related to the result. It’s not making you pull diamonds or hearts. But it’s changing the circumstances which can make pulling diamonds and hearts happen more frequently.&nbsp;That makes sense to me, a person who is not well-versed in meteorology.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More generally speaking, one of the great difficulties with climate change and figuring out how it affects weather is that weather itself is highly variable. If anything, the number of tornadoes in this country hasn’t really increased. In fact, the number <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-experiencing-tornado-outbreaks-despite-fewer-tornado-days/story?id=110110803\">has been decreasing in recent years</a>. Is that because of climate change, or is that some broader cyclical pattern?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Teasing out climate change amidst all the noise makes it difficult to assess. But once we get more years and more data points, we can start to say these things more confidently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>My last question: Are you going to see </strong><strong><em>Twisters, </em></strong><strong>Dave?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, I’m gonna go watch the movie. If nothing else, my students and everyone who knows me are going to ask my opinion of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Maybe journalists too!</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s my answer: I’ll do it for scientific purposes.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

According to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/13/democrats-biden-concerns-00167915\">Politico</a>, no more than four of the caucus’s 50 Democrats said they were committed to sticking with Biden as their party’s nominee. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By many accounts, a large majority of Democrats on the Hill believe that Biden has little hope of defeating Donald Trump and that a different candidate would have a better chance. The Capitol Hill reporters Heather Caygle and Jake Sherman <a href=\"https://x.com/heatherscope/status/1810684842205729203\">claim</a> that they haven’t spoken to a single congressional Democrat “who privately says they think Biden is capable of running and beating Trump at this point.” Unnamed “senior Democrats” have told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/07/15/can-trump-pivot-and-can-biden-run-out-the-clock-00168222\">Politico</a> they’re convinced the president will lose the election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then a 20-year-old man <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates\">nearly assassinated Trump</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The former president’s near-death experience has rendered some Democrats even more pessimistic about Biden’s chances. And yet, Saturday’s tragic events have also led many to give up on persuading him to step aside.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The precise rationale for this surrender varies between lawmakers. Democrats who spoke with the Washington Post’s <a href=\"https://x.com/FaceTheNation/status/1812518504811163888\">Robert Costa</a> said, in his summary, “it’s time for the country to stick together, and that means Democrats sticking together as well.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Jonathan Chait <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-democratic-partys-strange-attraction-to-defeatism.html\">notes</a>, this argument is incoherent. It is unclear why a shocking act of violence — committed by a young person with no discernible political motive — compels Democrats to change their behavior. If the concern is unifying the nation, it seems counterproductive to line up behind a president with a <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">38 percent </a>approval rating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless, the impulse to prioritize the pursuit of unity over victory is informed by fatalism: Many Democrats have decided that the attempt on Trump’s life has made him unbeatable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A senior House Democrat told <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/14/house-democrats-biden-trump-rally-shooting\">Axios</a> Sunday, “We’ve all resigned ourselves to a second Trump presidency.” A veteran Democratic consultant echoed this new conventional wisdom in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-fret-political-fallout-trump-rally-shooting-rcna161789\">NBC</a> News the same day, saying, “The presidential contest ended last night.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Democrats are certain to lose no matter whom they nominate, then why bother with the uncomfortable, divisive task of trying to persuade your party’s president to forfeit the nomination?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this defeatism is rooted more in Democrats’ own cowardice than objective reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We do not yet have much polling data taken after the assassination attempt against Trump, but there’s no reason to assume that the Republican’s brush with death will secure him a durable surge in support. America is a deeply divided country, and voters’ views of Trump are generally deep-seated at this point. The defining feature of this year’s polls has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360521/trump-shooting-polls-political-impact-2024-election-election\">their relative insensitivity</a> to (even extraordinary) events. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s criminal conviction cost him only about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/354234/trump-conviction-polls-voters\">1 percentage point</a> in polls taken immediately afterward, and this shift dissipated in the ensuing weeks. Biden’s catastrophic debate performance shaved only about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360521/trump-shooting-polls-political-impact-2024-election-election\">2 points</a> off his margin. Maybe Saturday’s assassination attempt will prove to be the one thing capable of totally upending the race, but there’s no reason to presume it will. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if there is a large shift in polls this week, such a change is likely to revert toward the long-running average over time. Four months is an eon in the American news cycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the polling data taken through the end of last week suggests that the Democratic Party is in okay political shape. It’s only Joe Biden who is not. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When asked which party they would like to see running Congress, voters currently <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/\">favor</a> the Democrats over the Republicans by 0.6 points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average. In battleground states, Democratic Senate candidates are consistently outperforming Biden. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/15/us/elections/times-siena-poll-pennsylvania-toplines.html\">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> released Monday found the president trailing Trump by 3 points in Pennsylvania, while Democratic Sen. Bob Casey leads his Republican challenger David McCormick by 11 points. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, a fresh set of <a href=\"https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/documents/Times_SAY24_20240712_state_poll_results.pdf\">swing-state surveys</a> from YouGov found Trump leading Biden by 7 points in Arizona, 2 points in Michigan, 4 points in Nevada, 5 points in Wisconsin, and 3 points in Pennsylvania. In those very same polls, Democratic Senate candidates led Republican ones in all of those states by 7 points or more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"ro\" dir=\"ltr\">The same YouGov Senate polls:<br><br>Arizona -🔵Gallego +8<br>Michigan -🔵Slotkin +9<br>Nevada -🔵Rosen +7<br>Pennsylvania -🔵Casey +12<br>Wisconsin -🔵Baldwin +7 <a href=\"https://t.co/sjlVhi8UXT\">https://t.co/sjlVhi8UXT</a></p>&mdash; Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/1812906012862783653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 15, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some Democrats believe that only Kamala Harris could realistically replace Biden and that she would make no stronger a candidate than the president, even in his diminished state. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think this view is mistaken. For one thing, we’re in uncharted territory; no one can be fully certain of what would happen if Biden stepped aside. More importantly, though, there is good reason to think that Democrats could improve their prospects by replacing Biden with Harris. The vice president is currently polling at least as well against Trump as Biden is: In RealClearPolitics’s <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">polling average,</a> Harris trails Trump by 2 points while Biden <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden\">trails</a> him by 2.7 points.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris also has a <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">lower</a> disapproval rating <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">than Biden</a>. It’s conceivable that her numbers are currently depressed by her association with him. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most critically, Harris is not in conspicuous cognitive decline. An overwhelming majority of voters do not <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/359362/biden-dropout-2024-undemocratic-primaries-voters\">consider her too old to serve</a>. She is a competent public speaker. All of these qualities differentiate her from Biden. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s boosters may cite his relatively small polling decline since the debate as evidence that he’s still viable. After all, as I wrote above, the significance of even extraordinary campaign events tends to dissipate over time. But this reasoning is premised on a conceptual error. Biden’s problem is not a bad debate, it&#8217;s more the sad reality his debate performance revealed: He is no longer capable of reliably achieving even bare competence when communicating with the public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an Oval Office address Sunday night, Biden proved unable to successfully execute a short speech, even while reading from a teleprompter. The president aimed to say that “in America, we resolve our differences at the ballot box” instead of “with bullets.” Instead, he said that “we resolve our differences at the battle box” — then, evidently trying and failing to correct himself, he continued, “You know, that’s how we do it, at the battle box, not with bullets.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By itself, the president accidentally suggesting that America’s political conflicts should be resolved in some sort of ultimate fighting arena would be of little consequence. But Biden’s flub underscores his campaign’s fatal flaw. A bad debate will fall out of the news, but a candidate’s increasingly limited capacities for effective communication will not. Biden’s decline will constrain his capacity to convey favorable political narratives while perpetually introducing new negative news stories spotlighting voters’ top concern with his candidacy. The president’s Oval Office address Sunday and recent press conference gave him a rare chance to ingratiate himself and his party to a large national audience. Due to Biden’s limitations, these functioned less as opportunities to exploit than hazards to survive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this said, Democrats who still have faith in Biden aren’t the problem. It is the lawmakers who believe that their party would do better if he stepped aside — but are doing nothing to bring that about — who are most derelict in their duties. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such Democrats may tell themselves there’s no point in pressuring Biden to step down since their party is doomed either way. But this is a rationalization for cowardice, not an unblinkered appraisal of reality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Accepting a second Trump administration as inevitable is not rational, given the available data. And doing so is not moral, given the stakes of keeping an illiberal reactionary out of power. Democrats have a path to victory. Some would simply rather avoid personal risk or discomfort than take it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The AR-15 — an exceptionally deadly weapon capable of firing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/ar-15-damage-to-human-body/\">several rounds at high rates of speed</a> — and AR-15 style weapons have been used in recent years to kill scores of people and injure hundreds more in mass shootings in <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/20/uvalde-shooting-police-ar-15/\">Uvalde, Texas</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/us/buffalo-mass-shooting-guns-suspect/index.html\">Buffalo, New York</a>; <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dayton-shooter-used-ar-15-pistol-smaller-version-of-popular-rifle-11565045046\">Dayton, Ohio</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html\">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/14/17013596/parkland-florida-high-school-shooting\">Parkland, Florida</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/06/12/orlando-nightclub-shooting-about-20-dead-in-domestic-terror-incident-at-gay-club/\">Orlando, Florida</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans could take action to make it harder for people to obtain these weapons, if they wanted to. There’s even a precedent for it: In 1994, Democratic President Bill Clinton, with the help of Congressional Democrats and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/us/politics/congress-assault-weapons-ban.html\">small but essential block of Republican lawmakers</a>, enacted the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750656174/the-u-s-once-had-a-ban-on-assault-weapons-why-did-it-expire\">Federal Assault Weapons ban</a>, barring certain kinds of semi-automatic weapons (including the Colt AR-15) along with high-capacity magazines. To get the regulation to pass, lawmakers agreed that it would expire in 10 years unless renewed by Congress. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Politics around gun ownership became more polarized, and the provision expired without renewal after 2004. Today, introducing another federal ban has become <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-08/newsom-calls-for-constitutional-amendment-on-gun-control\">a top priority for several Democrats</a>, following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown Connecticut in 2012. Organizations <a href=\"https://www.everytown.org/solutions/assault-weapons/\">working to reduce gun violence</a> agree with them; polling suggests that a majority of Americans would approve of a ban, too. According to one Fox News poll last year, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-poll-majority-us-supports-ban-on-assault-weapons-2023-4\">61 percent of Americans</a> would support legislation restricting the weapons commonly referred to as assault rifles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Opponents of assault weapons bans point out that the vast majority of American gun homicides are committed by handguns, not so-called assault rifles — which is true. But policymakers and safety advocates focus on the AR-style weapons precisely because of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/ar-15-damage-to-human-body/\">how much damage</a> they’re able to do to multiple people, and how quickly they can do it, along with the fact that they’ve been used in several recent mass shootings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even after an assassination attempt on the former president this weekend, it’s highly unlikely that modern-day Republicans will do anything to try to prevent people from obtaining these guns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, hardly anyone expects them to bring up guns in the coming days. To the extent that Republicans are assigning blame, it’s mostly to Democrats. Despite the fact that officials still haven’t released any information on the shooter’s possible motive, GOP Sen. J.D. Vance (Ohio), now Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">running mate</a>, wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1812280973628965109\">on X</a> that Democratic rhetoric “led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorTimScott/status/1812294854350635361\">said</a> that Democrats’ “inflammatory rhetoric put lives at risk.” Utah Sen. Mike Lee <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2024/07/13/mike-lee-calls-government-control/\">called</a> for “government control, not gun control,” arguing that too much centralized power inevitably led to political violence (or something).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it wasn’t always this way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Republicans have been essential to passing gun safety legislation in the past</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It might be difficult to imagine now, but the last time a gunman got this close to assassinating a president, it resulted in some of the most significant gun safety legislation in American history. A small but powerful contingent of Republicans was crucial to advocating, and ultimately voting, for the law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was March 30, 1981, when John Hinckley Jr. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/360585/reagan-trump-assassination-attempt-1981\">shot President Ronald Reagan</a> outside of a Washington DC hotel, injuring Reagan and three others. Reagan suffered a punctured lung, but survived after undergoing emergency surgery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His press secretary, James Brady, was more gravely injured. After being shot in the head, Brady survived but was partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. When Brady died, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/james-bradys-death-ruled-homicide-by-dc-medical-examiner/2014/08/08/686de224-1f41-11e4-82f9-2cd6fa8da5c4_story.html\">his death was ruled a homicide</a> resulting from the gunshot injury.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After the shooting, Brady and his wife, Sarah, both high-profile Republicans, got involved in a nascent campaign to prevent gun violence. They connected with the <a href=\"https://www.bradyunited.org/about-us/our-history#:~:text=Brady%20Background%20Checks%20would%20now,Bill%20was%20only%20the%20beginning.\">National Council to Control Handguns</a>, which Sarah eventually took over in 1989, and began meeting with lawmakers in order to build support for legislation that would require prospective gun buyers to undergo background checks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hinckley, the man who shot Reagan and Brady, had been arrested <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/20/us/john-hinckley-jr-fast-facts/index.html\">months before</a> the assassination attempt for bringing guns to an airport, and had a history of mental illness. Setting up a background check system that screened people who weren’t supposed to have firearms — including people convicted of felonies — could help prevent others from suffering from gun violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first iteration of what became the Brady bill was introduced in 1987. Even in a less polarized time, the bill faced National Rifle Association and Congressional opposition, stalled out, and died in committee. In 1993, after a nudge from President Clinton to Congress, then-Rep. Chuck Schumer re-introduced the bill and began working for its passage in Congress. By the end of the year, the Bradys were at the White House watching Clinton sign the law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Brady bill expanded those who were barred from owning guns to include people convicted of domestic violence and those dishonorably discharged from the military. It required all federally licensed gun dealers to run a check before selling a gun to someone. And it established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which helped those dealers perform the background checks, and which now provides policymakers and law enforcement with a rough idea of how many people are currently buying guns. A year later, when members of Congress moved to pass the assault weapons ban, the Bradys <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1991/01/gun-control-199101\">were major supporters</a>, helping the ban to pass, over the opposition of some pro-gun Democrats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Bradys were Republicans, and gun owners. They were motivated not by partisanship but by their experience as gun violence survivors who wanted to prevent others from going through what they did. While the law establishing background checks ultimately didn’t go as far as many would have liked, it established an important mechanism for firearms sales, one that today is exceedingly popular among the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, polling shows that expanding background checks is supported by upwards of <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/343649/american-public-opinion-gun-violence.aspx\">90 percent of the public</a>. And while the current laws contain <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/background-checks-curb-gun-violence/story?id=78693323\">loopholes</a> that allow far too many people to get around the restrictions, according to the <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/bcft1920.pdf\">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>, 4.4 million background checks since Brady’s passage have resulted in a denial of sale. In other words, they blocked sales to people who weren’t legally allowed to own a gun.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It’s not a coincidence that the US has this many guns</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not a coincidence that the US has this many guns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even with those curbs, the United States has the highest rate of civilian firearm ownership on Earth, with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/26/world/us-gun-culture-world-comparison-intl-cmd/index.html\">at least 120 guns per 100 people</a>, and hardly any restrictions on their sale or access. The saturation of guns in the United States was created through decades worth of advocacy and lobbying efforts by pro-gun organizations like the National Rifle Association, and it was built by Republican allies in Congress and in the White House, who have staunchly and consistently stood in the way of any legislation that would restrict people from acquiring guns, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/us/politics/senate-obama-gun-control.html\">in 2013</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/12/03/senate-democrats-to-force-gun-control-votes-in-the-wake-of-the-san-bernardino-shooting/\">2015</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/us/politics/gun-vote-senate.html\">2016</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/house-passes-gun-control-background-check-bill-trump-pledges-to-veto.html\">2019</a>, and too many other times to mention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The presence of so many guns has led to a sense of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23310544/moms-demand-action-shannon-watts-gun-control-sandy-hook\">cynicism</a> that gun laws could even be effective, but we didn’t end up as the only nation with more guns than people by accident.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A country with this many guns, and this level of deep polarization, is a nation <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360428/trump-assassination-attempt-pennsylvania-shooting-politics\">vulnerable to political violence</a>, just as we experienced this past weekend. As the shootings of Trump, former <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/132783213/arizona-shooting-rampage-congresswoman-others-shot\">Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/us/steve-scalise-congress-shot-alexandria-virginia.html\">Republican Rep. Steve Scalise</a> make clear, leaders from both parties are at risk of becoming victims because of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The dark irony is that you are likely to hear only one party speak directly about the weapons that make leaders so vulnerable to assassination attempts. Time and time again, Republicans have gone out of their way to avoid criticizing the instruments that make this political climate so potentially dangerous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The details of how the Brady bill and assault weapons ban came into existence matter. They undermine the notion that the politics around gun ownership have always been hopelessly deadlocked and always will be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our recent history shows us that breaking through the partisan stalemate is possible. But it requires that both parties fully grasp the ways in which we are all vulnerable to gun violence — even the former president of the United States.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

J.D. Vance, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 15, 2024. | Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In one of the more interesting moments of the first night of the Republican National Convention, South Carolina’s Sen. Tim Scott claimed that former President Donald Trump surviving Saturday’s assassination attempt was <a href=\"https://x.com/DanScavino/status/1813015302940020859\">nothing short of a miracle</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Our God still delivers, and he still sets free. Because the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle, but the American lion got back up on his feet,” Scott said, following up the sermon with a roar into the microphone. The crowd roared right along with him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Scott spoke, you could hear the crowd’s energy rising — as you could basically any time anyone mentioned Trump or the attempt on his life. But as a general rule, the programming devoted to the night’s main theme of economic policy was also its most flaccid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As much as the various speakers bemoaned inflation, virtually none of them had much of an idea for what to do about it. The closest thing to a policy rallying cry, “no tax on tips,” remained <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tips-taxes-nevada-0fc5fa0fb7bdcf963757c748c01bfbe9\">more of a slogan than an actual policy</a>. The most electrifying speech of the night, from Teamsters President Sean O’Brien, didn’t actually endorse Trump or the Republican platform —&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://x.com/daveweigel/status/1813041725629153716\">divided the audience against itself</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In short, Monday night’s events mostly pointed to a party remaining hyper-fixated on the deification of Donald Trump —&nbsp;and largely uninterested in what he might do in policy terms. But does that mean the Republican Party of 2024 stands for nothing?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not so fast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Republican Party is in the midst of a Trumpian makeover, working to meld elements of its old identity, like tax cuts and deregulation, with its new populist attitude on issues like trade. Putting this together in anything like a coherent package is hard to do, especially at a big public event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the GOP does have some ideas on how to do it. And if you read two key documents in tandem —&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform\">RNC’s platform</a> and the Heritage Foundation’s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise\">Project 2025</a> —&nbsp;you can begin to glimpse the contours of a second Trump term.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where Trump’s ideas will come from</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A party’s convention platform amounts to a promise to voters, and politicians actually <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/11/27/9801800/politicians-keep-campaign-promises\">do tend to keep their policy promises</a> (or at least try to). In <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1065912918772681\">a 2018 paper</a>, political scientist E. J. Fagan found that the issues in the president’s platform are disproportionately likely to produce legislation and committee hearings (at least when the winning presidential candidate’s party also controls Congress).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why the written GOP platform is so important —&nbsp;it gives us a sense of what the next four years would look like under Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On one level, the document is somewhat farcical. Coming in at just 16 pages, far less than the <a href=\"https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/why-party-platforms-matter\">50- to 75-page historical average</a>, it’s riddled with bizarre capitalization choices seemingly designed to mimic Donald Trump’s social media posting style. And many of its alleged policies are every bit as vague as the on-stage programming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On foreign policy, for example, the platform announces that “Republicans will strengthen Economic, Military, and Diplomatic capabilities to protect the American way of life from the malign influences of Countries that stand against us around the World.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet at the same time, the document is directionally quite clear: It tells you the big-picture aspirations Republicans would actually try to make reality when in power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On immigration, it calls for the “largest Deportation Program in American History.” On trade, it proposes an across-the-board tariff on all foreign-made goods. On democracy, it calls for punishing “those who have misused the power of Government to unjustly prosecute their Political Opponents” —&nbsp;a thinly veiled threat to open a criminal investigation into both President Joe Biden and the prosecutors who have indicted Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The platform, in short, ratifies Trumpism: turning the cornerstones of his public rhetoric into the officially sanctioned Republican Party policy. Free markets and individual liberty are out; “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/17/20696543/national-conservatism-conference-2019-trump\">national conservatism</a>” is in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, the thinness of the document means that it’s not always clear how this vision is meant to be translated into action. And that’s where outside parties come in —&nbsp;most notably, the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for a second Republican term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The now-infamous document puts meat on the platform’s bones: It details a set of proposals for how to take the RNC’s vague Trumpy principles and turn them into actual, concrete policy. In essence, it is serving as the policy shop for a party uninterested in doing its own homework.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A big reason Project 2025 is so salient is because the *actual* Trump campaign has essentially zero policy apparatus and the ‘platform’ is just Trump Truth Social posts, strung together,” as MSNBC host Chris Hayes <a href=\"https://x.com/chrislhayes/status/1811067764477677768\">wrote on Twitter/X</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, the connections between the two are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/09/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation/\">fairly direct</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Russ Vought, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-trump-loyalists-could-make-the-president-even-more-powerful-607353cc\">influential author</a> of a Project 2025 chapter on executive branch staffing, also <a href=\"https://gop.com/press-release/rnc-trump-campaign-announce-leadership-for-2024-republican-national-conventions-platform-committee/\">served as the policy director</a> in the committee drafting the 2024 platform. The Heritage Foundation, which published Project 2025, is <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/09/project-2025-think-tank-heritage-foundation-signs-on-as-an-rnc-sponsor/74337029007/\">a lead sponsor of the RNC festivities</a> —&nbsp;with its banners <a href=\"https://x.com/SykesCharlie/status/1811194778085941662\">hanging from the entrance hall</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So while it might be hard to discern an agenda from the Republican National Convention itself, there’s a deep and well-developed policy plan behind the scenes. It’s far more fleshed out than anything Trump brought to the Oval Office in 2016, and this time, there’s a team ready to implement it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

You’ve undoubtedly seen it: It is in newspapers, in memes, on T-shirts. Former President Donald Trump, surrounded by Secret Service agents, face streaked with blood, raising a fist into the sky. A man defiant in the face of potential death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A lot of people say it’s the most iconic photo they’ve ever seen,” <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/grateful-defiant-trump-recounts-surreal-assassination-attempt-at-rally-im-supposed-to-be-dead/\">Trump told the New York Post</a>, of the picture, taken immediately following an attempt on his life at a July 13 rally. “They’re right and I didn’t die. Usually you have to die to have an iconic picture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Trump has an iconic image,” agrees <a href=\"https://www.depts.ttu.edu/comc/faculty/faculty/ebucy.php\">Erik Bucy</a>, a professor of strategic communication whose research focuses on political imagery. “One for the ages, that is instantly recognizable. These only come around once in a while.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bucy studies political communications to analyze the way people who aren’t highly engaged with the news make sense of things. For low-information voters, who tend to be undecided, political images are a powerful shorthand for expressing who key political figures are and what they aim to do. So I called Bucy up to ask him to talk through Trump’s iconic gunshot photo with me and try to figure out what an image this powerful might communicate to the electorate. Our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Let’s start off just diving right into the Trump photo itself. What do you think that it communicates when you look at it?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It communicates resiliency in the face of crisis, and a certain kind of instinctual strength, but also an instinct about performance and maximizing the moment from a media point of view.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s bloodied. He’s got to be in an initial phase of shock. And yet he still realizes, “Wait, there’s a media opportunity here, and that above all else has to be kind of leveraged before I even get off the stage. Who cares if there’s other shooters?” Which there might have been.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s pretty remarkable from that point of view. I doubt many politicians or public figures would have had that presence of mind. Just that boldness to make the most of it visually. That shows you how he’s oriented and why he’s remained in front of our screen for the past nine years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>D</strong><strong>o you think that for an average viewer looking at this picture, they think first about the almost animal, instinctual media savvy there? Or are they thinking about the idea of resilience in the face of violence?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No, they’re seeing that American symbolism. They’re seeing the blue sky. They’re seeing him defiant despite having just been injured, being surrounded by dedicated guards and Secret Service members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I think that the fundamental takeaway is: This is a powerful person who’s got a lot of determination and — and you wouldn’t think this of Donald Trump, but — a lot of courage in the face of real threat.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2161511186.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.738259990588,100,78.523480018824\" alt=\"Several Australian newspapers sit in stacks on a wooden shelf with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on a sign above it.

It must be fake.” So can you speak a little to why this seems to have been </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/360669/trump-shooting-staged-conspiracy-theories-hoax\"><strong>a surprisingly prevalent response</strong></a><strong> from a lot of people?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is our conspiracy-oriented, hypermediatized age, which brings into question images that we know, once they’re captured and presented and published, can be easily manipulated. Whether it’s by Photoshop or whether that’s by traditional editing techniques or AI, these days it’s very easy to manipulate an image.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet we have the video and we have the real-time commentary and we have all the other triangulation that happens around the event to confirm that this actually happened in real time. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/07/politics/photographers-trump-shooting-cnnphotos/\">We have articles that explain</a> it was a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, his name was Evan Vucci, who got underneath and risked his own life and safety to get the shot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s nothing staged or Photoshopped or faked about it, but I can understand how a narrative is going to be pieced together. Because it seems like nothing was really happening on the Trump side [as we were] watching <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">the slow disintegration of [President] Joe Biden’s campaign and ability as a politician</a>. And then suddenly he has this moment right before the convention. In the timing of it, and the fact he survived it, and there were bullets whizzing past and none of them got to him, I can see why people would be a little bit suspicious about that. But nobody’s going to take that risk — “Go ahead and start shooting into a live scene with snipers on the roof and what, we’ll hope we get a good campaign photo out of that?” It’s just too great a risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I can understand where it’s coming from. Because it is going to help Trump in the short term. There’s a rally-around-the-flag effect. He’s a former president. He’s the symbol. That’s why <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/4924/bush-job-approval-highest-gallup-history.aspx\">George W. Bush’s poll numbers went into the 90s after 9/11</a>. It’s the same phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I want to take a step back now and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>look at this moment in the context of some of the research that you do. Can you lay out how politicians generally use imagery to communicate with the public?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Public performance is about communication of competitiveness, of strength. Particularly in relation to another competitor, which Trump is constantly evoking. It’s about social dominance: achieving it, maintaining it, and sustaining it. Trump is exceptional at achieving and maintaining this dominance relative to anyone next to him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now in the case of the photo, he’s actually showing defiance. The gestures indicate a kind of determined upending or determined pushing back against a force that’s out to get you, a kind of a David and Goliath scenario, which he’s created narratively.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s constantly moving his hands, pointing, gesticulating. Some of his wacky gestures make sense, some don’t. But he’s showing a couple things there. A, he’s <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/agency-political-theory\">agentic</a>, which means he’s very active, and he’s exuding strength through movement. He’s really good at this behind a podium and on a stage and in front of an audience. The audience seems to give him strength and energy. B, by pointing and gesticulating and punching and pumping your fist, that’s overt defiance, which is one of the two big categories of gestures that we look at. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We look at affinity, which is open-palm, waving, welcoming. You kind of relax. It can also be like, “Okay, you’ve dominated me. I give up.” And we look at defiance. Defiance is, “You can’t get me. I’m coming. Whatever you throw at me, I’m gonna stand tall.” And that’s what he’s doing here. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So on a very fundamental level, however you’re evaluating Trump, whatever side politically you’re on, however sophisticated, you see this portrait of strength. For Democrats, it’s in the person that you don’t want to have it. For Republicans, and particularly Trump supporters, it’s in a manner that channels the very ideal that you have of this guy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s lifting himself out of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/30/13572256/2016-trump-culture-war-alt-right-meme\">the meme world</a> and out of the Photoshop world where they would portray him as <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/history-donald-trump-superman.html\">Superman</a> or they portray him as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXND8KDIOg0\">Hulk Hogan in the ring with CNN</a>. And now he really is a survivor. He’s defiant. He is this kind of ubermensch. He’s this guy who can just make it happen and is somehow stronger than the ordinary person. It conveys to him leadership capacities on a very fundamental, primal level, and that’s where he operates his best skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not speaking. It’s not putting together complex arguments or thoughts. It’s a projecting not only of defiance, but what it really signals, which is social dominance. And if he’s one of two candidates in the race, he’s got it and the other guy doesn’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do you see this performance of dominance through imagery as the main valence of American politics? I see someone like [former President Barack] Obama as being very good at portraying imagery of unity and collaboration. Is that secondary to this larger issue?</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-539746540.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A young man in a gray sweater and white shirt puts up six red, white, and blue posters of Barack Obama’s face with the word “Hope” written below it.\" title=\"A young man in a gray sweater and white shirt puts up six red, white, and blue posters of Barack Obama’s face with the word “Hope” written below it.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Obama’s iconic “hope” poster pasted at the University of Texas at Austin hours prior to the 2008 presidential debate. | Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, I think it’s secondary. Communication operates on multiple levels and multiple modes. We call it multi-modalities. You’ve got verbal and written communication, and you’ve got visual and nonverbal communication. Even within that, you have facial displays and gestures with your hands, but also you have posture. You also have tone of voice and overall body orientation. So, are you slouching or you’re looking down; are you backed up against your heel? There’s any number of things you’re communicating besides the verbal message.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of estimates are that that’s where the majority of communication happens. I’ve never estimated it myself, but I’ve always found that the nonverbals and the visual communication — particularly in debates, but also in other formats, like the president speaking after a crisis event. I’ve done a lot of experiments where we’ll show some kind of threat against the US. And then we’ll show a politician acting either kind of subdued and very low-potency, I would call it, or very activated and high-potency, which is Trump’s mode continuously. And it’s usually the high-potency mode in relation to the manageable threat that gets the best response.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What it does is it reduces anxiety, and it also increases confidence towards the speaker. [For example], you have a subdued communicator like George W. Bush, in the early moments of 9/11, when <a href=\"https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/on-this-day-in-history-bush-learns-of-9-11-attack-at-sarasota-school/\">he shows up looking surprised at the Air Force base</a>. You have a threat environment that looks overwhelming and it’s just going to hell: the towers coming down in New York. That puts people into heightened anxiety, and it’s not calming at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what happened here was somehow Trump makes it look manageable. He bounces right back, so he’s performing the presidential, the leader reaction to the news action. The news action was the attempted assassination, and he’s performing in real time something I would probably set up experimentally as the strong condition of anxiety-mitigating, confidence-boosting. He just did it instinctively. So, like a lot of people, I think it’s going to help certainly in the short term. And it’s gonna hurt Biden, because I think the polling gap is going to get bigger now.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2158941059.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.756256591047,100,78.487486817906\" alt=\"President Biden, in a dark suit against a bright blue background with “CNN” repeated across it, stands at a podium speaking into a microphone.\" title=\"President Biden, in a dark suit against a bright blue background with “CNN” repeated across it, stands at a podium speaking into a microphone.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"President Joe Biden during the first presidential debate with Trump in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27, 2024. | Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Can you speak a little to the way that the imagery Biden tends to fall back on compares to what we see from Trump?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s not agenticness to it. You notice the lack of energy every once in a while. He tries to do something scripted or within a toolkit right now. He can kind of punch the air when he’s got a teleprompter in front of him and he’s confident in what he needs to be saying. But he’s not the old Joe that I grew up with on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Even running for president in 2008 and becoming vice president. He seemed already at that point like a senior statesman, but he still had a lot of energy, performed very well in the vice presidential debates and represented US interests. He was one of our better vice presidents. People knew about him and he contributed. But he’s lost a step. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So there’s nothing to compare it to. It’s almost the exact opposite of what Trump’s still able to do. Joe used to be able to do it and was very good at it. And now he will only allow himself to be seen in certain settings. He did a live press conference, but there were still some misspoken phrases and people’s names and titles he got confused. And you don’t really see him outside of the setting of a podium anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At this point, visually, Joe’s lost the election already. He just doesn’t look like a leader anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>It’s funny you’re describing it as a lack of energy. Is this where </strong><strong>the nickname </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepy_Joe_(nickname)\"><strong>Sleepy Joe Biden</strong></a><strong> comes from? Does Trump instinctively pick up on these dynamics?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-gives-new-nickname-to-nancy-pelosi-ahead-of-d-day-ceremony-shes-a-disaster/\">He did it to Nancy Pelosi, too</a>. He’ll try to exaggerate, almost like in a newspaper cartoonist way, anybody’s kind of subtle tic or literally physical situation. There was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/crooked-hillary-marco-donald-trumps-nicknames/story?id=39035114\">Little Marco</a>. He’ll take one example of one misrepresentation and suddenly [it’s] <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/22/659692611/from-lyin-ted-to-beautiful-how-trump-and-cruz-found-political-love\">Lyin’ Ted Cruz</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But his instinct when he criticizes is also very, very much at the level not of policy and not of high-minded discourse. It’s usually the level of character traits and physical putdowns around people’s situation. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/3/1/14772908/trump-disability-fda-megan-crowley\">He made fun of a handicapped New York Times reporter once</a>. It outraged people on the left.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump goes for the visual and nonverbal jugular, which is why Biden at this point just doesn’t have the stamina any more or the nonverbal presence to really match Trump’s energy. I was a little bit surprised in 2020 that Biden pulled it off the way he did, but he still had enough fortitude and pushed back [with] an agenticness to survive those two debates. In this past debate, it just wasn’t there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do you think this is the kind of image that could change the mind of an undecided voter about Trump?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve been thinking about that a lot. I think it can certainly open up a positive frame on Trump. The other frames might have been January 6, or if people have already forgotten about that, it might have been, “What is this <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">Project 2025</a> business?” or “Who is this guy that’s constantly belittling and beating up on everybody?” But Trump’s even pulled back from that now during the debate. He just let Joe be Joe for the most part.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1230468102.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.724615364015,100,78.55076927197\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Supporters of then-President Donald Trump enter the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC. | Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do think it gives credence to some of Trump’s rhetoric, which is, “I’m a victim and they’re out to get me.” Somebody was clearly out to get him. But also: “I can withstand it and I don’t know if anybody else can.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It evokes for an undecided voter some really deeper themes in American politics, which are: heroes survive. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/us/politics/theodore-roosevelt-assassination-attempt.html\">Teddy Roosevelt was shot at and he continued his speech</a>. “That’s not gonna be enough! I got the strength of a bull moose!” <a href=\"https://www.americanheritage.com/miraculous-care-providence\">George Washington was famous for not ever taking a bullet in the Revolutionary War</a>. How did that happen? It contributed to his mystique.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So now Trump’s got a mystique. And also some credence to the arguments of “I’m being victimized” or “I’m being targeted here.” Even though the rhetoric on the right has been much harsher and more violent than the rhetoric on the left. I mean, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/01/did-sarah-palin-s-target-map-play-role-in-giffords-shooting/342714/\">Sarah Palin used targets in some of her campaign advertising</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12415644/donald-trump-second-amendment-joke\">Trump said himself that “the Second Amendment people” ought to take care of Hillary Clinton</a>. Unbelievable kind of comments. But now, because he was targeted, it’s easy for him to say, “It’s all been the left the whole time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Even though </strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/after-attempt-his-life-trump-sees-moment-unity-2024-07-15/\"><strong>there’s no evidence this has anything to do with the left at all</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For somebody not paying that close of attention, only hearing little snippets and sound bites and images and watching TikToks and short videos, suddenly it looks more palatable to see Trump as a resilient figure really battling for other people, putting himself on the line and not giving in even when they come after them. I do think it has a potential to persuade some people. Not everybody. But if you’re completely undecided and a very low-information voter, it’s not going to hurt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s what we would call — these only come around once in a while — an iconic image.

One for the ages, that is instantly recognizable. It’s already been tweeted millions of times and there’s no way to forget it if you saw it. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-t-shirts-go-viral-grazed-not-dazed-legends-never-die-2024-07-15/\">It was on T-shirts within a couple hours of the event happening</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s going to be his brand now. He’s always looking for a new packaging vehicle. And it’s ironic and I’m sure the would-be assassin didn’t intend this, but basically he just gave Trump a marketing gift. Which is a really weird way of looking at it! But that’s where we are in today’s media politics, which are again hypermediatized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A moment in American political history was caught in real time that people aren’t going to be able to forget. It’s monumental in that sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s gonna encapsulate the campaign. It makes it really clear Biden doesn’t hold a candle to this force called Trump that’s out there. That doesn’t mean that things are gonna stay this way permanently, but for the next little while it’s Donald Trump’s momentum to lose. We’ll see how far that goes.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But it’s hardly a surprise given the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/15/23355813/trump-judge-aileen-cannon-special-master-order-justice-department\">repeated rulings in favor of Trump</a> given by US District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga\">been accused of partisan bias</a> in favor of the GOP and the former president. Prosecutors are expected to appeal the ruling and potentially ask that the case be reassigned to a different federal judge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After the ruling, Trump called for the dismissal of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations/23832341/trump-charges-prison-time-sentence-indictments\">other pending cases against him</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Let us come together to END all Weaponization of our Justice System, and Make America Great Again!” he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112791026080012056\">wrote</a> on his social platform, TruthSocial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In her ruling, Cannon argued that because Smith had not been appointed a special counsel by the president and confirmed by the Senate, his appointment violated the Constitution’s <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C2-3-1/ALDE_00013092/\">Appointments Clause</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Smith, a longtime government prosecutor, was made a Special Counsel by US Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to oversee the classified documents case. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 37 counts in the indictment Smith and his team eventually filed, including willful retention of national defense information under the Espionage Act and one count of false statements and representations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Smith was also appointed as special counsel in the investigation into the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. Smith later charged Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/8/1/23800704/trump-indicted-criminal-charges-jack-smith-jan-6-insurrection\">with four counts</a>, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. That case is ongoing, but after the US Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">ruled earlier this month</a> that the president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts performed in office, it’s an open question whether he can be prosecuted for his actions related to the insurrection. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cannon’s ruling, which relies on a stringent reading of the Constitution and represents a brazen break with precedent, has come under <a href=\"https://x.com/narosenblum/status/1812853541104427359\">heavy</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/steve_vladeck/status/1812849983428657512\">criticism</a> from <a href=\"https://x.com/NormEisen/status/1812855922957422821\">legal scholars</a>. Under her ruling, the appointment of prior special counsels would have also come into question, from Archibald Cox, who investigated the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation, to Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s breathtaking audacity for a trial judge who has clearly shown that she wants to delay and, if possible, get rid of this case,” said Jed Shugerman, a Fordham Law professor and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-Courts-Pursuing-Judicial-Independence/dp/0674055489\"><em>The People&#8217;s Courts</em></a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What the ruling says</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cannon writes in her opinion that the Constitution allows Congress, by law, to vest department heads — which would include Garland as the head of the Justice Department — with the power to appoint “inferior officers” such as a special counsel. But she ruled that Congress has not accepted that power, as it has passed no such law governing inferior officer selection, something that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had previously <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/clarence-thomas-special-counsel-appointment.html\">argued</a> in his concurrence in the Trump immunity case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“[I]s there a statute in the United States Code that authorizes the appointment of Special Counsel Smith to conduct this prosecution? After careful study of this seminal issue, the answer is no,” Cannon writes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cannon also ruled that, because Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional, he was not authorized to use permanent indefinite appropriations (appropriations that Congress does not authorize annually) to fund his office and conduct his investigation — meaning that he also violated the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C7-1/ALDE_00001095/#:~:text=C7.-,1%20Overview%20of%20Appropriations%20Clause,published%20from%20time%20to%20time.\">Appropriations Clause</a> of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This ruling goes against longstanding appeals court rulings, including by the DC Circuit, the most prestigious court after the Supreme Court and one that specializes in legal questions concerning constitutional and administrative law issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, the same question about the legality of special prosecutors was raised before the DC Circuit in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/robert-mueller-appointment-legal-1186701\">2019 case focused on Robert Mueller</a>. Drawing on precedent from a related case against President Richard Nixon, the court found that “binding precedent establishes that Congress has ‘by law’ vested authority in the Attorney General to appoint the Special Counsel as an inferior officer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To Shugerman, Judge Cannon is essentially saying, “I&#8217;m not bound by the DC Circuit, and I think they misinterpret this.” That, he added, shows an “astonishing level of dismissiveness.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What the ruling means for Trump and the election</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shugerman said that prosecutors have grounds to appeal and can ask that the case be sent back to a lower court — and importantly, be reassigned to a different judge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 11th Circuit appeals court has admonished Cannon before in this case for <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/11th-circuit-vacates-cannons-order-appoint-special-master-mar-lago-investigation\">ordering the appointment of a special master</a> to supervise the review of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago, which further slowed down the prosecution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“So there was already a first strike and maybe even a second strike that preceded this,” Shugerman said. “It lends more power to an appeal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the damage to the case may be irreversible. The appeals process will further delay any potential trial, almost surely past the election in November.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At this point, the outcome will be decided not by the courts but in November’s election. If Trump wins, he will likely direct his Justice Department to scuttle the case against him, and it’s not clear whether, due to the differing statutes of limitations for the various charges, any future administration could revive it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

J.D. Vance (R-OH), Donald Trump’s new choice for vice president, in the summer of 2022. I was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23271726/cpac-goes-to-israel\">covering a conservative conference in Israel</a>, and Vance was the surprise VIP attraction. We chatted for a bit about the connections between right-wing movements across the world, and what American conservatives could learn from foreign peers. He was friendly, thoughtful, and smart —&nbsp;much smarter than the average politician I’ve interviewed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet his worldview is fundamentally incompatible with the basic principles of American democracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance has said that, had he been vice president in 2020, he would have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/05/vance-trump-upend-democracy/\">carried out Trump’s scheme for the vice president to overturn the election results</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html\">fundraised for January 6 rioters</a>. He once called on the Justice Department to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/07/trump-dictatorship-retribution-jd-vance-robert-kagan/\">open a criminal investigation</a> into a Washington Post columnist who penned a critical piece about Trump.&nbsp;After last week’s assassination attempt on Trump, he attempted to whitewash his radicalism by blaming the shooting <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360557/trump-assassination-attempt-republican-response-political-violence-irresponsible\">on Democrats’ rhetoric about democracy</a> without an iota of evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This worldview translates into a very aggressive agenda for a second Trump presidency. In <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-host-abruptly-ends-interview-jd-vance-supreme-court-remarks-no-no-george\">a podcast interview</a>, Vance said that Trump should “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in the US government and “replace them with our people.” If the courts attempt to stop this, Vance says, Trump should simply ignore the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You stand before the country, like Andrew Jackson did, and say the chief justice has made his ruling, now let him enforce it,” he declares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The President Jackson quote is likely apocryphal, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23055620/supreme-court-legitimacy-crisis-abortion-roe\">the history is real</a>. Vance is referring to an 1832 case, <em>Worcester v. Georgia</em>, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the US government needed to respect Native legal rights to land ownership. Jackson ignored the ruling, and continued a policy of allowing whites to take what belonged to Natives. The end result was the ethnic cleansing of about 60,000 Natives — an event we now call the Trail of Tears.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For most Americans, this history is a deep source of shame: an authoritarian president trampling on the rule of law to commit atrocities. For Vance, it is a well of inspiration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">J.D. Vance is a man who believes that the current government is so corrupt that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets\">radical, even authoritarian steps, are justified in response</a>. He sees himself as the avatar of America’s virtuous people, whose political enemies are interlopers scarcely worthy of respect. He is a man of the law who believes the president is above it. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The authoritarian wing of the authoritarian party</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">J.D. Vance wasn’t always like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He grew up poor in Middletown, Ohio — escaping a difficult childhood to make it to Yale Law and, subsequently, to the lucrative world of venture capital. This narrative served as the backbone of his 2016 book, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, that turned into a mega-bestseller: a book that seemed to explain Trump’s appeal to America’s downtrodden. It put Vance on the national map.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Vance of <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> was very different politically. Back then, he took a conventional conservative line on poverty, describing the working class as <a href=\"https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/43/a-hillbilly-left/\">beset by a cultural pathology encouraged by federal handouts</a> and the welfare state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">2016 Vance <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-trumps-potential-running-mates-harshly-criticized-him-in-the-past\">was also an ardent Trump foe</a>. He wrote a New York Times op-ed titled “Mr. Trump Is Unfit For Our Nation’s Highest Office,” and wrote <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/04/19/americas-hitler-old-j-d-vance-message-turns-up-in-heated-senate-primary/\">a text to his law school roommate</a> warning that Trump might be “America’s Hitler.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eight years later, Vance has metamorphosed into something else entirely. Today, he pitches himself as an economic populist and cosponsors legislation with Sen. Elizabeth Warren <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-vance-bipartisan-group-of-senators-renew-push-for-legislation-to-claw-back-big-failed-bank-executive-pay\">curtailing pay for failed bankers</a>. In an even more extreme shift, he has morphed into one of Trump’s leading champions in the Senate —&nbsp;backing the former president to the hilt and even, at times, outpacing him in anti-democratic fervor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I spoke to Georgia state Sen. Josh McLaurin (D) —&nbsp;the former law school roommate who had received Vance’s “America’s Hitler” text —&nbsp;I asked him how the Vance he knew evolved into the Vance we see today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The through line between former J.D. and current J.D. is anger,” McLaurin told me. “The Trump turn can be understood as a lock-in on contempt as the answer to anger” — specifically, contempt directed at Vance’s political enemies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">McLaurin’s comments suggest that Vance’s conversion to Trumpism is genuine. I’m inclined to agree, though the timing of his MAGA conversion surely is convenient: He converted to right-wing populism just in time to run for a vacant seat in Trumpy Ohio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, whether Vance truly believes what he’s saying is secondary to the public persona he’s chosen to adopt. Politicians are not defined by their inner lives, but the decisions that they make in public&nbsp;— the ones that actually affect law and policy. Those choices are deeply shaped by the constituencies they depend on and the allies they court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it is clear that Vance is deeply ensconced in the GOP’s growing “national conservative” faction, which pairs an inconsistent economic populism with an authoritarian commitment to crushing liberals in the culture war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug\">cited Curtis Yarvin</a>, a Silicon Valley monarchist blogger, as the source of his ideas about firing bureaucrats and defying the Supreme Court. His Senate campaign was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/jd-vance-win-ohio-primary-00029881\">funded by</a> Vance’s former employer, Peter Thiel, a billionaire who <a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/\">once wrote</a> that “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s a big fan of Patrick Deneen, a Notre Dame professor who recently wrote a book <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/6/15/23734340/patrick-deneen-regime-change-review\">calling for “regime change” in America</a>. Vance spoke at an event for Deneen’s book in Washington, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054\">describing himself</a> as a member of the “postliberal right” who sees his job in Congress as taking an “explicitly anti-regime” stance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance is also an open admirer of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a right-wing politician who has systematically torn his country’s democracy apart. Vance praised <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-viktor-orban-smart-decisions-face-the-nation/\">Orbán’s approach to higher education</a> in particular, saying he “made some smart decisions there that we could learn from in the United States.” The policies in question involve using national dollars to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/01/viktor-orban-seizes-control-of-hungarys-universities\">impose state controls over universities</a>, turning them into vehicles for disseminating the government line.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a profile of Vance, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054\">Politico reporter Ian Ward</a> quotes multiple leading Republican figures —&nbsp;specifically, the leaders of the faction trying to turn these postliberal ideas into practice — saying that they see Vance as a leading advocate for their cause.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Top Trump advisor (and current federal inmate) Steve Bannon told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054\">Ward</a> that Vance is “at the nerve center of this movement.” Kevin Roberts, the president of the right-wing Heritage Foundation and the driving force behind Project 2025, told Ward that “he is absolutely going to be one of the leaders — if not the leader — of our movement.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enacting Trump’s dark ambitions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is little doubt that Vance will continue in this role if elected vice president. He would enable all of Trump’s worst instincts, and put a brake on none — deploying his considerable intellectual and intrapersonal gifts toward bending the government to Trump’s will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Trump’s first term, he faced considerable opposition from inside his own administration. People like Defense Secretary James Mattis and Vice President Mike Pence served as brakes on Trump’s most radical impulses, challenging or even refusing to implement his (illegal) directives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance’s ascendance represents the death of this “adults in the room” model. Backed by people drawn from the lists of loyal staffers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/us/politics/republican-president-2024-heritage-foundation.html\">being prepared by places like Heritage</a>, Vance would not only support Trump’s radical impulses but seems likely to spearhead efforts to implement them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He would be a direct conduit from the shadowy world of far-right influencers, where Curtis Yarvin is a respected voice and Viktor Orbán a role model, straight to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2004, Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean described himself as hailing from “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/20/uselections2004.usa8\">the Democratic wing of the Democratic party</a>.” If the GOP under Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/6/15/22522504/republicans-authoritarianism-trump-competitive\">has indeed evolved into an authoritarian party</a>, then Vance hails from its authoritarian wing.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

A series of brutal reports — on his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/10/dems-fear-biden-fundraising-cratering-00167496\">plummeting fundraising</a>, on some of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-reelection-insiders-no-path-debate-rcna161296\">his own aides losing confidence</a> in him, and on <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/07/11/what-obama-and-pelosi-are-doing-about-biden-00167520\">top party figures</a> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/10/schumer-biden-dump-donors-2024-election\">privately seeming</a> open to his ouster — buffeted him last Wednesday and Thursday. Anonymous sources told reporters that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/potentially-dozens-of-democrats-expected-to-call-on-biden-to-step-aside-after-nato-conference/\">dozens</a> more House Democrats would <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/11/biden-house-democrats-call-drop-out\">soon</a> publicly call for him to step aside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But after Biden <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360124/biden-dropout-defections-obama-pelosi\">gave a press conference</a> Thursday evening in which he answered reporters’ questions for nearly an hour, the promised flood of defections <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-delegates-good-conscience-convention-79d532219da1bdf0981ff5ff98e84002\">didn’t materialize</a>; it was more like a trickle. His competent performance there seemed to freeze things in place, leaving Democrats at an impasse going into the weekend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, Saturday evening, a shooting at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, left one rallygoer dead and injured Trump. And it had a few consequences for Biden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, it changed the subject. The media had been obsessed with Biden and the 81-year-old president’s age since the June 27 presidential debate; it was by far the biggest news story in the country. The nonstop coverage put a lot of pressure on Biden and on Democrats, but now, Trump’s shooting has knocked Biden’s fate out of the headlines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, it’s generally helpful for a president in crisis to do things that are “presidential”: to demonstrate gravitas and the prestige of the office and to seem bigger than the petty politics of the moment. So after Trump’s shooting, Biden took an above-the-fray tone, calling <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/us/politics/biden-trump-unity.html\">for national unity</a>. Plus, the weekend’s violence may raise one implication: Things are <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/14/house-democrats-biden-trump-rally-shooting\">chaotic</a> in the country right now. Do Democrats really want to add to the chaos by effectively toppling their president? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Third and most controversial, some Democrats’ instinctive reaction to Trump’s shooting has been to assume that he’ll now win the presidency and to conclude, therefore, that a messy and difficult push to replace Biden isn’t worthwhile, since Biden’s replacement would also likely lose. “We’ve all resigned ourselves to a second Trump presidency,” a senior House Democrat <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/14/house-democrats-biden-trump-rally-shooting\">told Axios</a> on Sunday in an already-infamous quote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That chain of logic is pretty obviously flawed. It’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360521/trump-shooting-polls-political-impact-2024-election-election\">far too early</a> to write off an election that is months away, so this may be mainly a justification for inertia and inaction that key Democrats already were inclined toward. But the upshot is clear: It helps Biden hang on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic National Convention is just over a month away, so Biden only needs to hold on till then. He could even lock things down sooner if the DNC chooses to ask delegates to make his nomination official early in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/democrats-virtual-roll-call-biden/index.html\">a virtual roll call</a>, a proposal they are currently mulling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, Biden’s chances of being renominated do suddenly look better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s no sure thing yet, though: He’ll still have to make it through the next few weeks without any other episodes that raise concerns about his age and health. Plus, more Democrats could simply choose to revive the rebellion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tumultuous past few weeks of American politics should remind us that unexpected events lie ahead and that nothing is certain until it happens.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The term “staged” promptly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1812275271577334257\">trended</a> on X, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awsten/status/1812256964094968289\">multiple</a> viral <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getawaykarll/status/1812258607347736886\">tweets</a> getting over 100,000 likes. Redditors <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1e2obc1/aitah_to_think_it_was_a_set_up_that_donald_trump/\">debated</a> whether it was uncouth to be suspicious that Trump was trying to drum up sympathy votes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adding fuel to the fire, eyewitnesses, online observers, as well as some media outlets, reported incorrect information about what had happened, some of it potentially incendiary. The New York Post <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/york-post-criticized-misreporting-trump-054207890.html\">claimed</a> early on that the shooter was “a Chinese man,” which only served to exacerbate burgeoning conspiracy theory narratives. One far-right activist <a href=\"https://x.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1812275712273068514\">floated</a> the conspiracy theory that the Secret Service was involved in setting up the assassination, as part of the “deep state intel community.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, as we’ve often seen before, people latched onto misidentified “suspects,” including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-rally-shooting-conspiracy-theories-flourish-online-rcna161752\">an Italian YouTuber who vlogs about soccer</a> and a Twitter troll who posted a “joke” video claiming to be the shooter soon after he was identified. It was passed around the site for hours despite his <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-fake-suspects-in-trumps-assassination-attempt/a-69658007\">assertion</a> that it was a joke. The conspiracy theories came from all corners of the ideological spectrum: the left, the right, and the politically inscrutable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many were eager to project their prior partisan assumptions onto <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates\">emerging information</a> about the shooter. He was a registered Republican, so surely the shooting wasn’t politically motivated — but he had also <a href=\"https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/trumps-shooter-gave-15-to-a-progressive?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=2510348&amp;post_id=146602664&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=60tq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">reportedly</a> made a one-off donation to a Democratic PAC, Act Blue, on the day of Biden’s 2021 inauguration, which would indicate the opposite. Even as the initial “faked” theme faded, members of the public reached for a narrative that would allow them to blame one side or the other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fortunately, the conversation shifted within hours as bystander accounts and more information about the shooter were reported in mainstream outlets. Per Google Trends, there was less than a 1 percent interest in searches for “Trump shooting staged,” “Trump shooting fake,” and “Trump shooting conspiracies” over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was a thankfully brief, but remarkable, cultural moment, one that revealed how years of extremist conspiracy theories and the growth of conspiratorial imagining have managed to distort our thinking at casual levels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Social media has both intensified moments of crisis like this and fomented misinformation about what’s actually happening.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One media analyst determined that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-assassination-biden-tiktok-misinformation-fact-check-4b7ab8e21c00aa6ef47f25ec76984fe6\">up to 45 percent</a> of all accounts across Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter that tweeted hashtags about the “staged” shooting were bot accounts made purely to fuel confusion and doubt. Modern social platforms algorithmically <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23308674/tiktok-midterm-elections-misinformation-civil-war\">amplify</a> this kind of hysteria and skepticism. Essentially, they become sites of real-time collective doubt, and then the very nature of social media reinforces that doubt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this case, the idea that the shooting could have been staged didn’t seem like a stretch for the many people on social media who pointed to what they saw as telltale signifiers: Trump’s quick recovery, the relative lack of bleeding, the perception that all of this was too conveniently timed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right-leaning extremists like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/31/18289271/alex-jones-psychosis-conspiracies-sandy-hook-hoax\">Alex Jones</a> have spent the decades since 9/11 normalizing the concept of “<a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2022/what-is-a-false-flag/\">false flag operations</a>” — that is, faked events orchestrated by nefarious actors to advance a political objective. In the social media era, it has become alarmingly common to suggest that a major event didn’t happen at all or, if it did, it was all a setup. These are ideas that would have seemed fringe a few decades ago, but in our conspiracy-theory-brained age, they seem nearly ubiquitous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if you don’t adhere to a specific conspiracy theory, you might pick up the language of distorted thinking along the way: Take the casual use of “false flag” or “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22745597/big-oil-congress-hearing-exxonmobil-bp-chevron-shell\">astroturfing</a>,” for example, or the use of “the deep state,” as though there really is such a thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also understandable if people aren’t entirely certain right now about what is real. The third decade of the 21st century has so far been punctuated by moments of collective shock or trauma, including the pandemic, numerous climate-related disasters and emergencies, and the death of George Floyd. In particular, the era of Covid and the associated rise of the anti-science and anti-vax movements has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/26/21338174/covid-19-conspiracy-theories-fauci-sinclair-plandemic\">only exacerbated paranoid thinking</a>. Moreover, as the country continues to become <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360428/trump-assassination-attempt-pennsylvania-shooting-politics\">increasingly politically polarized</a>, ideas that would’ve once seemed far-fetched to the average person <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21558524/conspiracy-theories-2020-qanon-covid-conspiracies-why\">gain appeal</a> and spread.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of our collective traumas can induce feelings of <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-things-feel-unreal-is-that-a-delusion-or-an-insight/\">derealization</a>, or the sense that the world around us is fundamentally out of balance with our own experiences or perceptions. Especially after a major shock like a political assassination attempt, when people’s reactions are unfiltered and emotions go unchecked, the world might feel more divorced from reality than usual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One positive sign that things aren’t totally dire is that the conversation seemed to shift away from the “staged” theories quickly as the public gained confirmed facts about the shooting. True, some prominent figures have continued to fan the flames of gossip, such as Matt Walsh <a href=\"https://x.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1812846407935561729\">hinting at</a> a government cover-up — but so far, those speculations seem to be staying mainly on the fringe. There are also those who still seem to be entertaining the idea that the shooting was staged, as well as a few other minor <a href=\"https://x.com/davenewworld_2/status/1812498534257619148\">conspiracy tropes</a>, but we’re still largely in the wait-and-see stage. Frankly, the fact that we still have a wait-and-see phase is heartening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, it seems the public’s collective ability to take a breather instead of immediately devolving into chaos is a boon, although it’s still the early days of the aftermath.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This weekend’s divided response only reinforces the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22301496/martin-gurri-the-revolt-of-the-public-global-democracy\">epistemic crisis</a> in which we now live, in which multiple versions of “truth” compete with each other and obfuscate reality. Bad-faith takes — with no basis in fact — have already begun to dominate the Republican response to the situation, as prominent political leaders argue that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360557/trump-assassination-attempt-republican-response-political-violence-irresponsible\">rhetoric</a> from Democrats somehow played a role in the shooting. With that ideological divide widening and partisan viewpoints holding sway, navigating these murky waters requires caution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This moment is a reminder to avoid reaching for the most extreme read on a situation before you have all the facts. After all, with so many questions still lingering about the shooter’s motivations and the stakes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360428/trump-assassination-attempt-pennsylvania-shooting-politics\">so high</a>, there’s a lot riding on our collective ability to stay rational. If there were ever a time to slow-walk to judgment, it’s now.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Steve Scalise; the Donald Trump supporter <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/cesar-sayoc-sentenced-to-20-years-for-sending-bombs-to-trump-critics.html\">who sent mail bombs</a> to more than a dozen prominent Democrats in 2018; a right-wing militia’s <a href=\"https://www.wsoctv.com/news/trending/fbi-thwarts-militia-plot-kidnap-michigan-governor/O7K7A7CZ55GJTC6TQM5DWQNL4U/\">plot to kidnap</a> Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020; the abortion rights supporter who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/kavanaugh-roske-arrest-warrant/index.html\">attempted to kill</a> Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at this home in 2022; and the QAnon adherent who attacked Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/11/14/paul-pelosi-nancy-david-depape-assault/\">while attempting to target her,</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That violence is having a clear impact on how American politics is conducted. Spending on security by House and Senate campaigns <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/18/congress-security-spending-violence-threats/\">increased by 500 percent </a>between 2020 and 2022, according to the Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nor is this just an American phenomenon: There’s been a global wave of recent assassinations as well. The UK has seen two members of parliament killed in recent years: Jo Cox, a Labour MP murdered by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-slow-burning-hatred-led-to-jo-cox-murder\">right-wing extremist</a> days before the Brexit vote in 2016, and David Amess, a Conservative MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/david-amess-verdict-terrorist-attack-ali-harbi-ali-guilty\">fatally stabbed by an Islamic State</a> supporter in 2021. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/06/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-far-right-presidential-candidate-stabbed\">survived a stabbing</a> during his campaign for president in 2018. In 2021, Haitian Prime Minister Jovenel Moïse was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57762246\">assassinated by mercenaries</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year saw the<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/10/ecuador-presidential-candidate-killed\"> killing of Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio</a>, and former <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shinzo-abe-japan-government-homicide-assassinations-8267d689b9f63d5461bddf4f880dddc3\">Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a>. In January of this year, South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-opposition-chief-stabbed-during-visit-busan-yonhap-2024-01-02/\">survived being stabbed in the neck</a>, while Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/18/1252307692/the-assassination-attempt-on-slovakian-pm-is-the-latest-example-of-violence-in-e\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/18/1252307692/the-assassination-attempt-on-slovakian-pm-is-the-latest-example-of-violence-in-e\">shot and nearly killed</a> in May. In Mexico, where political violence is rampant on a scale far beyond most other countries, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/americas/mexico-election-candidates-killed.html\">at least 36 candidates seeking offices</a> throughout the country were killed ahead of the country’s recent elections, according to the New York Times. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there are the numerous alleged plots <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy#:~:text=In%20May%202024%2C%20two%20Ukrainian,hostage%20and%20kill%20the%20President.\">targeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The growing threat of assassination</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite all that, it’s difficult to say for sure if political killings are on the rise. There’s a data problem: Assassinations are still relatively rare compared to other forms of political violence — violent protests, terrorist bombings — and attempts that succeed in killing their target, or even come close enough to succeeding, are even rarer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is some data to suggest they’re getting more common. According to the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, which includes incidents of political violence from 1970 to 2020, the <a href=\"https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?expanded=no&amp;casualties_type=b&amp;casualties_max=&amp;dtp2=all&amp;success=yes&amp;attack=1&amp;ob=GTDID&amp;od=desc&amp;page=1&amp;count=100#results-table\">number of assassination incidents around the world</a> fell dramatically from more than a thousand per year in the early 1990s to less than 100 per year in 1999, then started to creep up again, jumping to more than 900 in 2015. This trend has roughly corresponded with a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia\">global uptick in international armed conflict</a>, which also dipped through the 1990s before rising more recently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Threatened acts of violence have increased even faster. In the United States, the Capitol Police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/us-political-violence-threats-against-lawmakers\">reported 9,625 threats</a> against members of Congress in 2021, compared to just 3,939 in 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What could be driving this trend? Political violence researcher Rachel Kleinfeld of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rise-of-political-violence-in-the-united-states/#f2\">argues</a> that political violence, including assassinations, becomes more common in countries where there are highly competitive elections that could shift the balance of power, where partisan politics becomes a dominant social identity, and where there are weak institutional constraints on violence. All of those reasons fit the US now, which is why Kleinfeld suggests the country is particularly vulnerable to a surge in political violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kleinfeld also notes that a difference between today’s political violence and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2015/07/the-1970s-and-the-birth-of-contemporary-terrorism.html#:~:text=During%20the%20recent%20surge%20from,and%20184%20people%20were%20killed.\">previous periods</a> where it was common — such as the 1970s, the high point of terrorist violence within the US with more than 1,470 attacks compared to 214 in the decade following 9/11 — is that today’s perpetrators are more likely to not belong to any formal organization, but rather to self-radicalize via online engagement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Georgetown University terrorism researchers Bruce Hoffman and Jacob Ware argued in an <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2022/08/the-accelerating-threat-of-the-political-assassination/\">article</a> published two years ago that political assassination is becoming more common around the world in part to the emergence of so-called “accelerationism” — the deliberate effort to foment political chaos or societal collapse in order to accelerate political transformation — as a more prominent strategy for extremists. They write, “For extremists seeking to sow chaos and speed up some cataclysmic societal collapse, high-profile politicians provide an attractive target” because they personify the political order these extremists are trying to tear down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Previous waves of political violence happened in eras when security was more lax and politicians more accessible. Think of John F. Kennedy’s open motorcade in Dallas, which no president would think of doing today. But Hoffman and Ware also note that even as politicians and governments invest more in security, new technologies are making assassination attempts easier. Consider the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/diy-gun-used-kill-japans-abe-was-simple-make-analysts-say-2022-07-09/\">homemade gun used to kill Abe</a>, which the assassin put together with parts and instructions he found online, or the attempted assassination of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45073385\">using explosive drones </a>in 2018. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an email to Vox, Hoffman said that the attempt on Trump “does fit into the trend … where attacks on elected officials are becoming more commonplace and, dare one say, even accepted as a norm in our politically polarized/divided country.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What comes next</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Political violence is a phenomenon that tends to feed on itself. Attacks create justifications for more attacks, leading to long periods of violence, such as Italy’s infamous “<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/11/27/italians-are-still-haunted-by-the-years-of-lead\">years of lead</a>,” from the late ’60s through the ’80s, when assassinations, kidnappings, and bombings by right-wing and left-wing extremist groups were disturbingly common.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another very inconvenient fact about political assassinations is that when successful, they often accomplish their political goals, if not always in ways the assassin might intend: The murder of Abraham Lincoln and his replacement by pro-states rights Southerner Andrew Johnson utterly changed the course of post-Civil War Reconstruction. The right-wing Israeli who killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, in the wake of the historic Oslo Accords, dealt a serious, perhaps fatal, blow to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The killing of Abe <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/10/shinzo-abe-assassination-japan-unification-church-moonies/675114/\">led to a dramatic political reckoning in Japan</a> with the assassin’s primary target: the controversial Unification Church.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We still don’t know the specific motivations of the shooter who attempted to kill Trump, or what impact the event will have on the upcoming election or American politics generally. But it’s safe to say the impact, whatever the gunman’s intentions, would have been far greater if he had adjusted his aim by just a few inches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the stakes of political contests start to seem existential, and political violence of all kinds more permissible, an increase in assassination attempts — in the US and abroad — seems almost inevitable.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "“There’s no place in America for this kind of violence,” President Joe Biden said on Saturday, following the shooting at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania that left the former president hurt and killed an audience member.  But the fact is, this type of violence has a long history in American politics: Four US presidents [&#8230;]",

Bush for a second time. Adding insult to injury, Democratic nominee John Kerry lost the popular vote. The party was seemingly losing ground, after having won the popular vote in 2000 and losing the Electoral College thanks only to an exceedingly close (and contested) loss in Florida. It was a different world back then, but Democrats sensed that voters resoundingly had rejected what they had to offer —&nbsp;even while running against a Republican candidate broadly considered vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2024, life as a Democrat is pretty bleak&nbsp;in many of the same ways it was two decades ago. Ballots are still being counted after the presidential election, but the Democratic presidential nominee is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/09/politics/donald-trump-election-what-matters/index.html\">on track to lose the popular vote</a> for the first time in 20 years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That popular vote loss has forced a broader reckoning: Winning the popular vote “acted as a kind of salve: Yes, the Electoral College may have delivered Bush and Trump the presidency, but on some level, their administrations were illegitimate, unsanctioned by the popular will,” said Nicole Hemmer, a political historian at Vanderbilt University focused on media, conservatism, and the presidency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without a “but the popular vote” fallback, Democrats are confronting a harsh reality. “For the first time since 2004, this election felt like an embrace of conservatism, albeit a much different kind of conservatism than the one associated with the 2004 winner,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, as in 2004, Democrats are engaging in what can be generously viewed as introspection (or, less generously, a “circular firing squad”) to chart a new course back to power&nbsp;and assess what went so very wrong this time around. The blame for that is up for debate: It may have been the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383397/economy-inflation-2024-election-democrats-trump\">economy</a>, Democrats’ <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-common-sense-democrat-manifesto?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">embrace of “wokeness,”</a> President Joe Biden’s decision to run for a second term, the fact that many Americans actually liked <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb\">what Trump was selling</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383897/harris-lost-debate-why-trump-won\">any number of other factors</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though it may take months for what specifically went wrong to become clearer, the 2004 election and its aftermath might provide some insight into how Democrats can move forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, four years after the Bush-Kerry debacle, Democrats won the 2008 election in a landslide, with Barack Obama beating John McCain <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/2008_Election/\">by nearly 10 million votes</a> and entering the White House with massive congressional majorities at his back.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What Democrats today can learn from the party’s loss in 2004&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are obvious differences between 2004 and 2024. The aughts election was dominated by 9/11 and the Global War on Terror that followed. This year, those topics barely registered, while Trump and Biden’s respective records, the economy, and the culture wars took center stage. Further, Kerry’s campaign started with winning a very competitive primary, whereas Vice President Kamala Harris took over after Biden stepped aside and gave her his endorsement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the vibes among Democrats are similar, and what they do next may determine whether they see a revival in the 2026 midterms and the elections that follow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, Democrats took three lessons from 2004. Whether one believes those lessons apply to 2024 depends, in large part, on what one believes went wrong for Harris in her loss to Trump. But, given Democrats’ successful recovery from 2004, it’s a history lesson worth taking.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">1) <strong>They pursued a 50-state strategy</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following the 2004 loss, a popular meme rocketed around the (still somewhat nascent) internet: a map that depicted the Democratic <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/3-united-states-of-canada-vs-jesusland/\">“United States of Canada” as existing along the coasts and a Republican “Jesusland” encompassing the vast majority of land in the US</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If that seems reductive and problematic on multiple fronts, you’re not wrong, but the map, aforementioned problems aside, served in part as shorthand for pointing out Democrats’ turnout problem. Yes, Kerry had turned out 9 million more votes than Al Gore had four years before, but he still fell almost 3 million short of Bush.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That gap revealed a vulnerability for Democrats: their inability to mobilize a broad coalition in swing states and beyond that would translate into an Electoral College victory. Kerry couldn’t summon the kind of voter enthusiasm necessary to match Bush’s strong performance in rural areas and outer suburbs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To goose turnout, Democrats looked to Howard Dean, who ran a populist primary campaign but lost to Kerry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elected as chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2005, Dean became a proponent of a “50-state strategy.” The idea behind this strategy was that Democrats need to try to compete in every state, maximizing turnout in Democratic areas while cutting into Republican margins where possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This year, former DNC chair Donna Brazile, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ex-dnc-chair-howard-dean-opinion-election-1982596\">like Dean</a>, believes part of the solution could be <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/11/10/donna_brazile_trump_ran_the_50-state_strategy_democrats_used_to_talk_about_we_cant_pretend_he_won_because_hes_a_better_liar.html\">the return of the 50-state strategy</a>. They’re not alone: “We cannot run in just the few states that we need,” said Claire Potter, a professor emerita of history at the New School. “The Democrats have, in some ways, really backed off that strategy, and I think they&#8217;re wrong to have done so.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Harris campaign —&nbsp;for very understandable reasons — did not utilize Dean’s method. With only a few months to campaign, Harris <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/26/trump-harris-campaign-schedules-swing-states\">focused on swing states</a> and select demographic groups. She largely did not visit historically “safe” Democratic states. While it’s not clear that she could have stanched the bleeding in those places, there were significant rightward shifts from <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2024/11/06/trump-surge-in-blue-states-added-to-dem-house-headwinds/\">New York City to Southern California</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it’s not clear how well the 50-states theory has aged. After all, Hillary Clinton ran up the popular vote total after winning big in solidly blue states, but she got to serve as president for exactly zero days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That strategy was <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ex-dnc-chair-howard-dean-opinion-election-1982596\">later credited</a> with helping Democrats make gains in the 2006 midterms and with helping to put Obama in the White House in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And after 2024, where Democrats lost ground in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/11/05/compare-2020-2024-presidential-results/\">just about every county in the US</a>, a plan to boost the party’s popularity nationally is not one it can afford to ignore.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">2) <strong>Democrats reevaluated their messaging</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2004, Democrats didn’t have a response to the rise of the right-wing blog Drudge Report and Fox News’s consolidation around Republicans. Kerry was often cast as an elitist with an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1039572215514145753\">expensive haircut</a>, and right-wing commentators successfully turned one of his strengths as a candidate — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5069480/swift-boat-john-kerry-tim-walz-jd-vance\">his military service in Vietnam</a> — into a liability through viral attack ads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is this kind of disingenuous attack on Kerry as the Harvard boy, as somebody who&#8217;s faking having really fought in Vietnam,” Potter said. “Bush is able to play the card of being an outsider, even though he is an incumbent, even though he went to Yale, even though his father was president.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In response, Democrats sought to reevaluate their overall messaging strategy. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-all-new-dont-think-of-an-elephant-by-george-lakoff/2014/10/31/496d52f2-50b4-11e4-babe-e91da079cb8a_story.html\">influential book</a><em> </em><em>Don’t Think of an Elephant! </em>by the cognitive linguist George Lakoff served as a guidebook for reframing debates in their own terms and for explaining their policy positions by evoking values of empathy, fairness, and community without adopting the language of conservatives. They also embraced Dean — dubbed by the Washington Post in 2005 as an “outsider insurgent” who wore beat-up shoes and flew coach, spending most of his time outside of DC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2024, Democrats were again outflanked by a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/whats-news/trumps-win-highlights-a-new-media-order/dac91470-5ba5-4f05-a506-154045b1637b\">new Republican media machine</a> — this time, including the likes of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros\">Joe Rogan and Theo Von</a> — to deliver their message. Harris, for her part, declined to appear on Rogan’s podcast, reportedly for <a href=\"https://x.com/annaknicolaou/status/1856787159832994299\">fear of how it would be perceived</a> within the party.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">3) <strong>Democrats sought to become a party of ideas</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kerry campaign adviser Kenneth Baer said that, in 2024, Democrats repeated their mistake in 2004 of defining themselves as being the opposite of Republicans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;Smart people seem to have come around to the idea that you can&#8217;t just say Trump&#8217;s terrible,” Baer said, arguing that Democrats had the same issue in 2004, when Kerry spent much of his time on the campaign trail criticizing Bush instead of defining affirmative reasons to vote for Democrats. That called for Democrats to “rethink all our policies and our approaches,” Baer said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Baer went on to found the magazine <em>Democracy: A Journal of Ideas </em>as a platform for those ideas. That’s where Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), then a Harvard Law School professor, <a href=\"https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/5/unsafe-at-any-rate/\">published a 2007 manifesto</a> about how financial products like mortgages and credit cards should be regulated by the government. That idea would later give rise to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, some Democrats say the party still needs to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/democrats-debate-reverse-slide-working-class-voters-00188641\">better connect with the working class</a>, but Baer noted that there is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/11/04/what-is-the-working-class/\">disagreement about what that means</a> and whether that should involve an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/10/democrats-working-class-voters-trump\">economic or cultural approach</a>. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The limits of political strategy</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats would very much like a silver-bullet strategy that guarantees them a post-2004-esque recovery. But the truth is, political strategy and planning can only go so far. And that may be one of the biggest lessons from two decades ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The party’s return to power in 2008 was principally driven by two factors: Obama was a generationally politically gifted politician. George W. Bush was a generationally terrible president whose second term featured a bungled and deadly response to Hurricane Katrina; an even more disastrous and deadly handling of the Iraq War (the false pretenses of which came fully to light during Bush’s second term); and the 2008 financial crisis and ensuing economic meltdown.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The conditions that would collapse Bush’s support in his second term were already in place when he won reelection,” Hemmer, the political historian, said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So how Democrats do in 2026, 2028, and beyond will likely have a lot to do with Trump’s performance during his second term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/exit-polls-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X04.ZwKX.5orIonRhVE1e&amp;smid=url-share\">preliminary exit polls</a> suggest <a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/668caba1-b0ac-4458-ae96-b5d5599711cb?j=eyJ1IjoiY3VobG0ifQ.PtdAR01rZURXxVulHb887pV0qoeJURv7I59oP5vjuwo\">Trump is unpopular</a>, his proposed tariffs could be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/383884/supreme-court-donald-trump-tariffs-inflation-economy\">disastrous for the economy</a>, Democrats may mobilize against his policies as they did in his first term, and he may only have a very <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-inch-closer-us-house-majority-full-control-congress-2024-11-13/\">narrow House majority to work with</a>, potentially hampering his agenda.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If such a collapse happens, however, Democrats also have to be prepared to seize on it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Someone had set up two life-size nutcrackers on their front porch; someone else’s brownstone windows offered a peep into their living room, where a fully lit Christmas tree was already aglow inside. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But according to people all over the country, it wasn’t just my neighborhood. The early start to the most festive season seemed to be a reaction to — what else — the results of the election, which plunged many Americans into an uncanny mood they haven’t experienced since the last time Donald Trump was elected in 2016. Or, as Massachusetts social worker Dylana Becker put it: “Holiday lights because my daughter may have no fucking rights.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Becker started putting up Christmas decor on November 6th. Rachael Kay Albers, a marketing professional in Chicago, told me she “just bought a 10-foot tree, not even on sale,&#8221; with the philosophy, “Fuck it, it’s time for twinkles.&#8221; Rachel Lewis, a social media manager in North Carolina, erected an inflatable penguin on her roof that same week. “Our neighbor said, ‘Isn’t it early?’ And we said ‘No, it’s not.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much like how <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-year-that-skin-care-became-a-coping-mechanism\">interest in elaborate skincare routines exploded</a> in the wake of Trump’s 2016 election, Americans seem to be diverting their anxieties into holiday cheer, if only by sheer force. It’s not exactly a mystery as to why: In uncertain times, we seek escape and comfort, and nothing occupies a cozier or more nostalgic place in the American imagination than Christmas. Couple that with a late Thanksgiving, and people are seeing little point in waiting for the turkey to be done to put up their trees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For some, Christmas came even before the polls closed. Mia Moran, a children’s book editor in Queens, said she went shopping for Christmas pillows at Target in early November. “This year it just feels like we needed something,” she tells me. “[Christmas] is a good outlet, and also a neutral sense of pure joy. It’s not charged in any way.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@alessandrabrontsema/video/7435082293288422698\" data-video-id=\"7435082293288422698\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@alessandrabrontsema\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@alessandrabrontsema?refer=embed\">@alessandrabrontsema</a> <p>Decorating for Christmas brings me so much joy ✨🎄🎀🫶🏼 <a title=\"christmas\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/christmas?refer=embed\">#christmas</a> <a title=\"christmasdecor\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/christmasdecor?refer=embed\">#christmasdecor</a> <a title=\"holidaydecor\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/holidaydecor?refer=embed\">#holidaydecor</a> <a title=\"christmasdecorating\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/christmasdecorating?refer=embed\">#christmasdecorating</a> <a title=\"holidaydecorating\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/holidaydecorating?refer=embed\">#holidaydecorating</a> <a title=\"christmastree\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/christmastree?refer=embed\">#christmastree</a> <a title=\"christmastok\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/christmastok?refer=embed\">#christmastok</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ Carol of the Bells - Instrumental - Russell Davis &#038; Roy Vogt &#038; Michael Green &#038; Marty Crum &#038; Jeff Kirk &#038; David Angell &#038; Carrie Bailey &#038; Steve Patrick &#038; Nancy Allen &#038; Ginger Newman &#038; Sarah Valley\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Carol-of-the-Bells-Instrumental-6725338995594627074?refer=embed\">♬ Carol of the Bells &#8211; Instrumental &#8211; Russell Davis &#038; Roy Vogt &#038; Michael Green &#038; Marty Crum &#038; Jeff Kirk &#038; David Angell &#038; Carrie Bailey &#038; Steve Patrick &#038; Nancy Allen &#038; Ginger Newman &#038; Sarah Valley</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s ironic, considering the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/18/war-on-christmas-525273\">decades-long right-wing mania</a> about the supposed “war on Christmas” by the media establishment. This year, for the first time in recent memory, perhaps it’s the left who’s more fervently embracing the holiday. “When the polls close in your state, you are officially allowed to begin playing Christmas music,” <a href=\"https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh/status/1853942372733775877\">tweeted</a> First Amendment lawyer Adam Steinbaugh on the evening of the election. After it became clear Trump was winning, comedian Mike Drucker <a href=\"https://x.com/MikeDrucker/status/1854040124612628839\">posted</a>, “I’m listening to Christmas music starting tomorrow cuz fuck this shit.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-harris-election-president-campaign-christmas-b0b92b0f\">the Wall Street Journal</a>, forcing holiday spirit is a “healthy response” to election stress, one that “beats sitting there saying, ‘Oh my god, this is an existential threat to the world and I’m going to enter a doom and gloom loop,’” explained Kevin Smith, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also entirely possible that it isn’t just the election that’s caused this year’s bout of “Christmas creep,” a term that’s been discussed and debated since the 1980s. The phenomenon itself has existed far longer, however: Early Christmas sales (and complaints about them) can be <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/11/does-christmas-shopping-start-earlier-every-year-nope-the-long-history-of-early-bird-shopping-in-america.html?pay=1731703758068&amp;support_journalism=please\">traced back to the Victorian era</a>. It’s typical for customers to be annoyed by businesses using far-off holidays as marketing tools. What’s less common is for Americans to seemingly all agree, individually, that the time for twinkle lights is now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This year, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/07/presidential-election-2024-holiday-shopping-christmas-halloween\">per Axios</a>, retail experts say that holiday deals are starting early partly because of the fact that there are five fewer days between Black Friday and Christmas this year, and partly because of election uncertainty. Lowe’s, for instance, launched its holiday decor line in July, a month earlier than the year before, while Amazon moved its Prime Day up to early October.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">America’s favorite coping mechanism has always been buying stuff, and if Christmas spending is any indication, we’ve been getting steadily more anxious for years. The National Retail Federation expects the typical consumer will spend $902 on Christmas gifts and decor, up $25 from last year, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/decorating-for-christmas-early-not-too-soon-holiday-spending-joy-2024-11\">reports Business Insider</a>. Prophecy Market Insights projects that the Christmas <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/28/18106613/rent-christmas-decorations-house-of-holiday-lights\">decoration</a> industry will nearly double in the next decade, from $8.45 billion in 2024 to $13 billion in 2034.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Charles Scheland, a professional modern dancer in Manhattan, says that in addition to putting up his tree, string lights, and nutcracker statue, he’s also already started pulling his favorite Christmas music to teach in his dance classes. He says that part of that is due to the shock and disappointment of what began as a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/369267/democrats-harris-vibes-energy-2024-presidential-race\">galvanizing Democratic campaign</a>. “I really think that the joy of the Harris campaign and the optimism of that movement got people excited, and to have that so deafening crushed, people just want to get some of that joy,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also another reason for the skip from Halloween to Christmas, he posits. “Thanksgiving is a tricky holiday because it is often celebrated with extended family, and sometimes we don’t agree with our extended family. So rather than getting into the trickier holiday, we’re just jumping ahead to the next.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the years since 2020, holidays, and to an even greater extent, seasons, have become celebrations not just IRL in the form of decor and activities, but online. People on TikTok and Instagram began to document their “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/what-is-tiktoks-winter-arc-challenge-and-why-is-it-going-viral-.html#:~:text=The%20latest%20obsession%20on%20TikTok,going%20for%20early%2Dmorning%20runs.\">winter arcs</a>,” their “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22697069/meg-ryan-fall-tiktok-style-christian-girl-autumn\">Meg Ryan falls</a>,” and their <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/12/20690515/hot-girl-summer-meme-define-explained\">hot girl summers</a> as a way of marking the passage of time when it seemed like the only way to feel alive was watching someone else’s life through a screen. As I’ve <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/08/22/online-eras/\">argued before</a>, dividing one’s life into seasons and leaning heavily into seasonal aesthetics is a way of romanticizing your life while also dissociating from it, a potentially useful tool when it feels like nothing makes sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m not immune, either. After my unexpectedly festive neighborhood walk, two wines deep, I decided that I absolutely needed to make a reservation at one of those bars in Manhattan where they deck it out with festive decor for the month of December. In most respects, these are miserable establishments — the kind of bars that are overpriced and crowded to the point of sweltering, places marketed with the promise of quaintness and communal cheer but mostly exist as traps for tourists to take photos in. But in that moment, being surrounded by a million twinkling wreaths and giant red bows and exhausted holiday shoppers from New Jersey sounded like not the worst place to be. In fact, I could think of much worse things: a decaying democracy, or a man <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general\">investigated for sex crimes</a> being installed as attorney general, for instance. So screw it, it’s Christmas now. May we all find merriment where we can.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Kennedy Jr.</a> for Health and Human Services secretary — has come the question about whether even a Republican-controlled Senate will actually confirm them all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what if that’s asking the wrong question? What if Trump has no intention of asking the Senate’s permission?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the transition, Trump has made several <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113460270802936865\" rel=\"nofollow\">references</a> to his intent to use “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet\">recess appointments</a>” to get his appointees in place more quickly. This refers to a longstanding presidential power to fill jobs that typically require Senate confirmation if Congress is in recess. The Constitution included that power in an era when reconvening a recessed Congress would take months of travel time; more recently, presidents have used it to get around Senate opposition for certain picks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Trump’s references to recess appointments were vague, and it was unclear exactly why he sounded so insistent on them. The new Congress would not need to recess for some time. The Senate surely would consider his top nominees quickly. The new Republican majority would likely be deferential to most of his choices, and the Democratic minority has no power to actually block any of them. So why would recess appointments be necessary so soon?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We got a potential clue about what Trump may have in mind when the well-connected conservative legal activist Ed Whelan heard a rumor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Hope it&#8217;s wrong,” Whelan <a href=\"https://x.com/edwhelaneppc/status/1856800721397555264?s=46&amp;t=LVLwPwruc4koXd6hdIOe8Q\">wrote on X Wednesday</a>, “but I&#8217;m hearing through the grapevine about this bonkers plan: Trump would adjourn both Houses of Congress under Article II, section 3, and then recess-appoint his Cabinet.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This may sound technical, but it would amount to a massive power grab: Trump would be forcing the Senate into a recess. This would mean that, for many of the most important posts in the federal government, Trump could simply ignore the Senate, thumbing his nose at the body to impose everyone he wanted, no matter how corrupt, extreme, or controversial they are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moreover, it would mean Trump would be choosing to crash headlong into one of the biggest <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term\">guardrails</a> constraining the president’s authority: the Senate’s confirmation powers. If Trump were to try this and get away with it, Senate confirmation powers would effectively no longer exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, this remains in the rumor stage, and if it is truly something being considered by Trump, it remains unclear whether he’d go through with it. But it makes a lot of sense. It may reflect the influence of Elon Musk and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/383859/musk-trump-vance-silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley right</a> in Trump’s camp — it’s a risky, norm-shattering attempt to disrupt the way politics, governance, and presidential power work. (Musk has indeed <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855694053268169146\">been tweeting</a> about recess appointments.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It would mean starting off Trump’s term with a high-stakes showdown and certain litigation — with no one certain about exactly how things would play out.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why this recess appointment plot would be different than past recess appointment controversies</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recess appointments have been the subject of political and legal controversy in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2012, President Barack Obama was frustrated at the Republican Senate minority’s constant filibusters of many of his key nominations. (At the time, 60 votes were needed to get nominees past a filibuster; rule changes have since lowered that threshold to a simple majority.) He wanted to use recess appointments to fill some posts, but Republicans were blocking the Senate from going into recess at all. Even though nearly everyone left town, they continued to hold <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/12/09/143458518/congress-wont-recess-to-block-obama-appointments\">“pro forma” sessions</a> where nothing actually happened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So Obama decided to <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/04/president-obama-announces-recess-appointments-key-administration-posts\">just do recess appointments anyway</a>, filling three National Labor Relations Board seats and the directorship of the newly-created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The administration argued that the pro forma sessions were fake and Congress was actually in recess; therefore, Obama could do recess appointments. But the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/us/supreme-court-president-recess-appointments.html\">unanimously rejected</a> his argument, saying it was up to Congress to determine whether it was in recess.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s plan would be far more brazen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Constitution states that during a congressional session, both chambers of Congress must consent if they want to adjourn Congress for more than three days. But it also says that “in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment,” the president “may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In layperson’s terms, that would seem to say that if the House and Senate disagree on when to adjourn, the president can force them to do so. This power has <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-situation--gaetz-and-gabbard--adjournment-and-recess\">never been used</a> by the president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/14/trump-gaetz-cabinet-appointment-johnson/\">Whelan’s sources</a> in the conservative legal movement, this is the plan Trump’s team is putting together. First, Trump would get the House of Representatives under Speaker Mike Johnson to propose adjourning Congress. Then, if the Senate refused to do so, President Trump would step in, saying that because the two chambers disagreed, he’d use his power to force the Senate to adjourn. He would then make recess appointments to his heart’s content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such appointments would then inevitably be challenged in court, and the Supreme Court would eventually determine whether they were legal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whelan has gone public because he’s appalled by this idea. “It’s a fundamental general feature of our system of separated powers that the president shall submit his nominations for major offices to the Senate for approval,” he <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/a-terrible-anti-constitutional-scheme-of-recess-appointments/\">wrote in National Review</a>. “That feature plays a vital role in helping to ensure that the president makes quality picks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Trump pulled this off, it would be an utter humiliation for incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Republican senators generally — it basically would be taking a wrecking ball to the power of the Senate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The scheme would also require, as Whelan points out, the cooperation of Speaker Johnson and his House majority. But it is far from clear whether Republicans in either chamber — or the courts — have the inclination or the spine to stand up to an unprecedented power grab by Trump. And the rumors of it bode ill for other Trumpian abuses of power that will surely lie ahead.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It wasn’t a podcaster with questionable views or a libertarian businessman selling a course or any particular ideology. It was actress Sydney Sweeney, <em>Euphoria</em> star and the recent lead of the rom-com <em>Anyone but You.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following her <em>Saturday Night Live</em> hosting gig in March, two conservative outlets <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/amy-hamm-wokeness-is-no-match-for-sydney-sweeneys-undeniable-beauty\">published</a> <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boobs-are-back-thank-you-sydney-sweeney/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1709711300-2\">columns</a> heralding Sweeney as a return to conventional beauty standards of the ’90s and early 2000s — or as, Bridget Phetasy for the Spectator put it, “the giggling blonde with an amazing rack.” Both pieces<strong> </strong>postulate that, by wearing low-cut dresses and playing up her sexuality, Sweeney was inviting men to gawk at her, therefore raising a middle finger to “woke culture” and the Me Too movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sweeney hasn’t publicly aligned herself with the right in any way. (Her <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/sydney-sweeney-responds-maga-supporting-family-member-controversy-1234629337/\">family’s politics</a>, though, were the subject of controversy in 2022, which may have something to do with the right’s eager embrace of her.) Rather, her ascension as a throwback-y, hyper-feminine sex symbol has given conservatives the rare mainstream Gen Z figure on whom to project their values. For those paying close attention, the past year was rife with springboards for the conservative message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the hindsight following Trump’s reelection, it seems the zeitgeist of 2024 was a foreshadowing of his return to office and something forecasters might have considered a little more seriously. “Bro country” singers became the artists de jour, going head-to-head with female pop singers on the charts and, in many cases, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/359734/female-pop-stars-charts-billboard-rap-country-popularity\">outperforming them</a>. The buzziest new reality shows were about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/360219/dcc-dallas-cowboys-cheerleaders-netflix-judi-kelli-victoria-kalina\">Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/374143/secret-lives-mormon-wives-momtok-utah\">Mormon TikTokers</a>. Conservative films from smaller distributors, like the biopic <em>Reagan</em> and Daily Wire documentary <em>Am I Racist?</em>, made millions at the box office. Nominally apolitical podcasters and streamers, from Joe Rogan to the Nelk Boys, hosted presidential <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant\">candidates</a> and took on an increasingly political valence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a sharp turn from the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/obamacore-obama-pop-culture-kamala-harris.html\">liberal-coded pop culture of the Obama years</a> and the sort of trends that took off in response to Trump’s first presidency — comic-book movies with a progressive edge like <em>Wonder Woman</em> and <em>Black Panther, </em>social commentary films like <em>Get Out</em> and <em>Promising Young Woman</em>, not to mention <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/drag-race-inc-whats-lost-when-a-subculture-goes-pop.html\">the explosion of drag culture</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Joel Penney, an associate professor at Montclair State University, says the overall conservative feel of pop culture at the moment is, in many ways, a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23581859/me-too-backlash-susan-faludi-weinstein-roe-dobbs-depp-heard\">response to the Me Too movement</a> and the notion by its detractors that “masculinity is in crisis.” At the same time that we’re seeing Sweeney receive praise for representing “traditional” femininity, the All-American straight white “bro” is getting renewed cultural attention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s been a lot of this trying to restore these strong male role models in pop culture, whether it’s Tom Cruise in the <em>Top Gun</em> remake or these ‘bro’ podcasters and country singers,” Penney says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>2024 was all about the straight white bro&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can see this happening most visibly in mainstream music. It’s not just that country music — a Southern genre with a past and present of conservative politics — has emerged in the mainstream over the past two years — <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/\">with</a> <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/morgan-wallen-arrest-controversy-timeline-b2525290.html\">much</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political\">controversy</a>. It’s that this class of musicians — Morgan Wallen, Zach Bryan, Jelly Roll, Luke Combs, Shaboozey, and the newly rustic Post Malone — are glaringly male. Shaboozey’s unprecedented achievements in an overwhelmingly white genre add a refreshing element to this conversation. Beyoncé also released a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24115959/beyonce-cowboy-carter-country-music-explained\">successful country album</a> this year featuring Shaboozey and an array of Black female country artists.<em> Cowboy Carter</em>’s lead single, “Texas Hold ’Em,” topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, a shorter amount of time than Morgan Wallen, Post Malone, and Shaboozey’s No.1 songs this year. Nor was she recognized by the country establishment, getting completely <a href=\"https://thehilltoponline.com/2024/09/16/beyonces-cowboy-carter-receives-zero-cma-nominations/\">shut out of the Country Music Association awards</a>. Overall, it seems like country fans and the average young person, who’s <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/cmts-morgan-wallen-country-streaming-march-1235573629/\">listening to more country music</a> these days, are still more eager to hear dudes croon about beer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Outside of the charts, these country singers have also become mainstream personalities and subjects of celebrity gossip. In the span of roughly a year, Bryan went from a <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/pulling-weeds-chris-black-zach-bryan\">little-known alternative country crooner posting YouTube videos</a> to a celebrity whose personal relationships are being <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@abbzbon/video/7435029860285746474\">analyzed</a> by <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bethanysware/video/7434745300285246763\">TikTok</a> users and explained in the pages of <a href=\"https://people.com/zach-bryan-brianna-chickenfry-relationship-timeline-7866836\">People</a>. Jelly Roll and his wife, influencer and popular podcast host Bunnie XO, have also become a recognizable celebrity couple, while Wallen’s <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/07/31/entertainment/country-singer-megan-moroney-addresses-morgan-wallen-dating-rumors/\">dating life</a> and <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/04/08/entertainment/morgan-wallen-arrested-after-allegedly-throwing-chair-off-bar-roof/\">public antics</a> have become<em> </em>Page Six fodder. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1978651676.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.654292878952,100,78.691414242097\" alt=\"Zach Bryan in an all-black tuxedo posing beside a brunette in a lace corset dress.\" title=\"Zach Bryan in an all-black tuxedo posing beside a brunette in a lace corset dress.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Singer Zach Bryan and influencer Bri LaPaglia a.k.a.

There’s also the viral Florida-based father-and-son duo A.J. and Big Justice, who do food reviews at Costco. With the exception of Big Justice’s sister and mother — who’s literally referred to as the “Mother of Big Justice” in videos — this expanded universe of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pl6Dg0YB3w\">Costco Guys</a>” is made of white men and boys from Florida and New Jersey rating foods in a cartoonishly macho manner.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7390004338837523754\" data-video-id=\"7390004338837523754\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@a.j.befumo\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo?refer=embed\">@a.j.befumo</a> <p>We Bring The BOOM! 💥 Part 2‼️ <a title=\"song\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/song?refer=embed\">#song</a> <a title=\"father\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/father?refer=embed\">#father</a> <a title=\"son\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/son?refer=embed\">#son</a> <a title=\"family\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/family?refer=embed\">#family</a> <a title=\"fun\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fun?refer=embed\">#fun</a> <a title=\"bigjustice\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bigjustice?refer=embed\">#bigjustice</a> <a title=\"boom\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/boom?refer=embed\">#boom</a> 🎵 @Rj Pasin 📷 @CameraManKyle </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - A.J. &#038; Big Justice\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7390004411504167723?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; A.J. &#038; Big Justice</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They&#8217;re not explicitly expressing MAGA as a value, but they&#8217;re trafficking in spaces that have been less visible in recent years: rural and suburban enclaves, featuring white, heterosexual, male, and even &#8220;bro-y&#8221; talent that was out of vogue in recent history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One can assume that the current MAGA-coded fabric of mainstream culture correlates with a generation of young people who identify as <a href=\"https://www.theupandup.us/p/gen-z-teens-conservative-shift-gallup-data\">more conservative than their parents</a>, although Penney says the relationship between pop culture and politics is a two-way street. While the media can reflect growing opinions and interests of the moment, it can also be used to shape it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Pop culture doesn&#8217;t just emerge out of nowhere,” says Penney, who wrote the book <em>Pop Culture, Politics, and the News</em>. “We’re seeing attempts to shape the culture that are increasingly coming from the conservative media ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Conservatives carved out a space for themselves at the movies&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In March, Ben Shapiro’s media company the Daily Wire released its first theatrical movie, the “satirical” documentary <em>Am I Racist?, </em>which <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/how-the-daily-wire-engineered-box-office-hit-am-i-racist.html\">earned $4.5 million</a> its opening weekend. Currently, it’s the highest-grossing documentary of the year along with a handful of other conservative nonfiction films including the Catholic documentary <em>Jesus Thirsts: The Story of the Eucharist</em>, the Dinesh D&#8217;Souza-directed <em>Vindicating Trump</em>, and the creationist movie <em>The Ark and the Darkness</em> all making the <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/market/2024/genre/Documentary\">top 10 list</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">2024 saw other movies from conservative studios and right-wing producers make notable financial gains. Despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, the Ronald Reagan biopic, <em>Reagan</em>, starring Dennis Quaid, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/09/14/reagan-defies-negative-reviews-and-holds-strong-in-box-office-top-5/\">broke into the top 5 at the box office</a> when it premiered in August, doing particularly well with <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/09/box-office-summer-labor-day-deadpool-wolverine-afraid-1236073792/\">older, white, and Southern audiences</a>. Over the summer, the Christian media company Angel Studios also released the pro-adoption movie <em>Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trout</em>, marketed by Daily Wire+. While it made significantly less money than its <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2023/\">2023 predecessor <em>Sound of Freedom</em></a><em>, </em>which had a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/19/1188405402/qanon-supporters-are-promoting-sound-of-freedom-heres-why\">vocal fan base of QAnon supporters</a><em>,</em> its nearly $12 million worldwide earnings are still a massive accomplishment for a small Christian film with no movie stars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the performance of these movies has not bred the same immediate concern of something like <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, it does provide a potential incentive for major studios to start courting a movie-going crowd that’s felt alienated by mainstream Hollywood.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/2571_FP_00623B-3587x1500-d3275b2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=10.064120434904,0,79.871759130192,100\" alt=\"Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. \" title=\"Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones in the 2024 film &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;/em&gt;. | Universal Pictures, Warner Bros.

Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Warner Bros has yet to produce its own <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, but we’ve seen hints that Hollywood is interested in movies that at least appeal to white, Southern, and conservative audiences. American nostalgia bait came to the fore in the summer blockbuster <em>Twisters</em>. The Oklahoma-set film with a star-studded, country-infused soundtrack did <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/07/box-office-twisters-middle-america-red-states-1236016845/\">particularly well in Southern cities and theater chains</a> in middle America, outperforming initial estimations. While it’s probably most accurate to describe the film as decidedly apolitical with some patriotic markers, it does see the white, blond savior (played by Glen Powell) emasculate the movie’s other male main character, Latino storm chaser Javi (Anthony Ramos). Powell happened to produce another piece of Americana, <em>Blue Angels</em>, a look at the US Navy’s flight demo squadron, and the fourth highest-grossing documentary of 2024. He also co-starred with Sweeney in <em>Anyone but You</em>, a film released at the end of 2023 that crossed the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-anyone-but-you-crosses-200-million-poor-things-nears-100-million-mark-1235922019/\">$200 million</a> mark in early 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Penney says corporations will try new strategies and pander to different audiences, as they’ve done with Marvel and Disney’s diversity pushes in recent years, based on what they think will benefit them financially. They’re not really thinking about political impact. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That was very much the reality of capitalism at work,” Penney says. “[Disney] was trying new strategies, not because they were really, truly convinced that they were going to save the world through expanding diversity, but they were getting a sense that that&#8217;s what the audience wanted. It was a response to Me Too and Black Lives Matter and things that actually resonated with our culture to a degree.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This pendulum swing from the sort of diversity-focused art that dominated pop culture during the Obama years to what we’re seeing now is hardly unprecedented. Specifically in music, country’s popularity as a genre has historically corresponded with a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/911-country-music-songs-1221348/\">push in right-wing politics,</a> from the jingoist anthems following 9/11 to “Okie From Muskogee” during the Nixon years. Pop culture has also seen movies with conservative and/or religious themes, from<em> American Sniper</em> and <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, break the box office. If this current moment tells us anything, it’s that we’re stuck in an ouroboros of shifting political values and corporate interests. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Suffice to say, it’s not a question of whether we’ve been here before but whether we’re paying attention to what these signals all mean. With an honest look at our media landscape, were the results of the election truly that surprising?&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Matt Gaetz (R-FL), an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general\">accused sex offender known for his firm loyalty to Trump</a>, to lead the Department of Justice. (Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.) On Thursday evening, Trump announced that three other lawyers he has close personal ties to will also be nominated to top DOJ jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This means that four of the highest jobs in the Justice Department, the office that brings federal prosecutions, will be held by people whose records suggest they will advance Trump’s personal interest. Three of these four lawyers have serious legal credentials and institutional knowledge, and thus are likely to be effective in advancing those interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general-trump.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">chose Todd Blanche</a>, the criminal defense lawyer in his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24126338/trump-new-york-trial-stormy-daniels\">New York hush money trial</a> (the one where he faced charges related to money paid to keep a sexual encounter quiet), to be deputy attorney general. That’s the No. 2 job in the Justice Department. The DAG, as this position is known within the department, wields tremendous power over federal criminal prosecutions. If successfully appointed, Blanche will <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/doj/office-deputy-attorney-general#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20ODAG,organizational%20units%20of%20the%20Department.\">supervise the 93 regional US attorneys</a> who bring the bulk of all federal prosecutions in the United States. So Blanche will have a great deal of authority over who is prosecuted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Trump wants <a href=\"https://x.com/kleavittnh/status/1857199006146822425\">John Sauer</a>, the lawyer who represented him in the Supreme Court case holding that Trump is allowed to use the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">powers of the president to commit crimes</a>, to serve as solicitor general. The role <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/osg/about-office\">oversees the Justice Department’s legal strategy in the Supreme Court</a>, including arguing many of the most important cases. They also decide which cases the DOJ will appeal if the federal government loses a case in a trial court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another one of Trump’s personal criminal defense lawyers, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/trump-todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general\">Emil Bove</a>, will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general, and will hold the DAG spot on an acting basis until Blanche or some other Trump nominee is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet\">confirmed or otherwise formally appointed to the job</a>. Unlike the DAG and the solicitor general, Bove’s new role <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2024/11/14/trump-picks-legal-defense-team-for-top-justice-department-roles/\">does not require Senate confirmation</a>. So he will be able to move into this job on the first day of Trump’s second presidency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This isn’t the first time a president has tried to put one of his personal lawyers in a position of high responsibility within government. President Lyndon Johnson, for example, <a href=\"https://thinkwy.org/columns/justice-abe-fortas-life-as-a-lawyers-lawyer-and-a-greek-tragedy/\">named Abe Fortas</a>, his friend and personal lawyer, to the Supreme Court in 1965. If you know anything about Fortas’s very brief tenure on the Court, you may know that <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/cautionary-tale-abe-fortas\">appointment didn’t end well</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Based strictly on their résumés, all three men are conventionally qualified for these jobs. Both <a href=\"https://04q.7c7.myftpupload.com/betsy-wright-2/\">Blanche</a> and <a href=\"https://blanchelaw.com/emil-bove/\">Bove</a> previously worked as federal prosecutors for nine years before entering private practice. Sauer is a former law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia who <a href=\"https://fedsoc.org/contributors/d-john-sauer\">previously served Missouri’s solicitor general</a>. It’s easy to see all three joining the Justice Department without much controversy if they were picked by, say, President Nikki Haley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Trump talks often about using the DOJ to target his political adversaries and people he views as foes. An NPR report on October 22 found that Trump “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties\">made more than 100 threats to prosecute or punish perceived enemies</a>.” That includes a threat to, in Trump’s words, “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also accused former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic of the incoming president, of “TREASON” and threatened “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties\">TELEVISED MILITARY TRIBUNALS</a>.” (Which, if they were to actually happen, would presumably take place in the Defense Department’s legal structure, but could involve some DOJ personnel.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s decision to name Gaetz, a staunch loyalist, to lead the Justice Department is a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general\">cause for considerable alarm</a> if you fear the United States sliding into authoritarianism. Historically, the White House has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected\">obeyed strong norms</a> against interfering with Justice Department prosecutorial decisions, but these norms have no legal force. So someone like Gaetz could tear down this barrier altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s decision to appoint his personal lawyers to top DOJ jobs is equally concerning. Federal lawyers are supposed to represent the interests of the United States, not of any particular politician, while they work for the government. But Trump has selected three people who aren’t simply accustomed to representing his personal interests, but who have also likely collected considerable legal fees from him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blanche, Sauer, and Bove’s conventional résumés also mean that, if they use their DOJ posts to pursue Trump’s personal campaign of vengeance, they are likely to be fairly effective in doing so. As a DOJ outsider known for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/gaetz-coronavirus-gas-mask/index.html\">performative political stunts</a>, Gaetz may struggle to navigate the department’s internal bureaucracy or to resist its internal culture, which seeks to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected\">insulate prosecutorial decisions from the White House</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blanche, Sauer, and Gaetz still need to be confirmed — assuming that Trump doesn’t <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet\">use recess appointments</a> or some other method to get around the Senate confirmation process. But if Trump gets his way, his ultraloyalist attorney general will now be backed by people who know the Justice Department and the culture of elite federal lawyers quite well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

One of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383897/harris-lost-debate-why-trump-won\">emerging theories</a> is that voters felt Democrats had drifted far from mainstream concerns by focusing too much on culture issues — particularly transgender rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The GOP <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380861/trump-transphobic-anti-trans-ads-scapegoating\">weaponized transgender rights</a> on the campaign trail, pouring <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/rep-elect-sarah-mcbride-ready-push-back-second-trump-administration-rcna178980\">over $200 million</a> into ads this cycle that painted Harris as out of step. “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” blared one ad that launched in September. At rallies, Trump stoked fears with <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-false-claims-schools-transgender-surgeries-rcna170217\">lies about gender-affirming surgery</a> in schools, while <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4936727-trump-bans-transgender-athletes/\">promising to ban</a> transgender women from sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html\">Trump campaign maintains</a> that their anti-trans ads resonated not only with Black and Latino men but also with moderate suburban white women concerned about school sports. <a href=\"https://www.galvanizeaction.org/\">Galvanize Action</a>, a progressive organization focused on mobilizing moderate white women, did find that 53 percent of respondents <a href=\"https://oneforallcommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/September-2024-Tracking-Survey-Wave-5-2.pdf\">on their most recent September survey</a> believed people advocating for the rights of transgender people “have gone too far.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After the election, some Democrats echoed the concern. “I don’t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don’t think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports,” Rep. Tom Suozzi, a New York moderate, said in an interview <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/democrats-house-ny.html\">with the New York Times</a>. “Democrats aren’t saying that, and they should be.” Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts made <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/seth-moulton-trans-athletes-democrats/\">similar remarks</a>: “I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on the field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Franklin Foer, a journalist for the Atlantic and author of <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534055/the-last-politician-by-franklin-foer/\">a book on Joe Biden’s presidency</a><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534055/the-last-politician-by-franklin-foer/\">,</a> reported last week that some members of Biden’s inner circle were dissatisfied with Harris’s defense against right-wing accusations that she supported the most extreme version of transgender rights, including gender-affirming surgery for prisoners. Biden’s allies <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/biden-harris-2024-election/680560/?gift=8ABnGgCURdeDIfG_FJbid6Ip6RYlWossbV4QrslCDmk&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social\">claimed</a> the president “never would have let such attacks stand” and would have “clearly rejected the idea of trans women competing in women’s sports.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While it will take time to fully understand why voters cast their ballots as they did, one thing is already clear: Neither Harris nor<em> </em>Biden made any effort to talk about what the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/fact-sheet-us-department-of-educations-proposed-change-its-title-ix\">actually proposed</a> to do on school sports.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What the Biden administration proposed on transgender athletes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, over strong objections of activists on the right and left, the Biden administration announced a <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/13/2023-07601/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-sex-in-education-programs-or-activities-receiving-federal\">proposed change</a> to Title IX, the law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in any federally funded educational program. Their suggested change would prohibit outright bans on transgender athletes, but would permit schools to restrict transgender students from participating if they could demonstrate that inclusion would harm “educational objectives” like fair competition and the prevention of injury.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This more nuanced stance marked the first time the Biden administration took the position that sex differences can matter in school sports, something hotly disputed by leading LGBTQ rights organizations. The proposed rule also reflected <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28397355/\">research</a> that suggests sex differences emerge over time, so the standard for inclusion in high school should not necessarily be the same as that in younger grades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Contrary to the post-election grumblings from Biden allies in the Atlantic, the president has been virtually silent on his own administration’s proposal for the last 18 months. He’s never spoken about it, and it was never mentioned by any other Biden official, including in <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/?s=transgender\">any White House briefing</a> on transgender issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The White House declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said their rulemaking process is still ongoing, as they consider <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/fact-sheet-us-department-of-educations-proposed-change-its-title-ix?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=\">the 150,000 public comments</a> they received. “We do not have information to share today on a timeline,” they added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In polling, voters consistently ranked transgender rights <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx\">as a very low priority</a> compared to other issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is some evidence that Republicans&#8217; years of attacks have taken their toll on public opinion. Gallup <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx\">found in 2023</a> that 69 percent of Americans believe transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that match their sex assigned at birth, an increase from the 62 percent who said the same in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tellingly, Biden&#8217;s proposed policy on transgender athletes — allowing targeted restrictions for fairness and safety while rejecting blanket bans — would likely resonate more with average Americans than the hardline stances typically associated with Republicans, who leaned on transgender fearmongering in the midterms <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/gop-attacks-on-transgender-kids-fell-flat\">only to see their candidates flop</a>, or Democrats, who many voters perceive as having no nuance on the topic at all. Yet the Biden administration&#8217;s reluctance to clearly communicate their middle-ground position left a vacuum that Republicans were happy to fill. It&#8217;s a dynamic that political observers say has become increasingly common: Democratic leaders stake out a position but, wary of internal rifts, default to strategic ambiguity even on issues where their stances might resonate with voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The White House could have said something in the election, they could have said Democrats want rules too,” said Lanae Erickson, the senior vice president for social policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank.&nbsp;“The number one big <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/talking-about-transgender-youth-in-sports\">messaging advice from 2022 we had</a> is that Democrats want sports to be fair and athletes to be safe.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Biden administration’s proposed school sports rule in 2023 marked a shift from its first two years</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden has long stood out for his support of transgender rights. In 2012, as vice president, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/10/biden-says-transgender-discrimination-civil-rights-issue-of-our-time-147761\">he called it</a> “the civil rights issue of our time,” something <a href=\"https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1221135646107955200\">he reiterated again</a> while campaigning for his own presidential run in 2020. He named passing <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do\">the Equality Act, an LGBTQ anti-discrimination bill, a top legislative priority</a>, and on his first day in office issued a sweeping executive order that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/21/biden-executive-order-transgender-lgbtq/\">called on all federal agencies to review</a> their rules to ensure that any sex discrimination protection includes sexual orientation and gender identity, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the Biden administration prioritized LGBTQ rights, social conservatives were in the midst of shifting their focus to new cultural battles following their decisive losses on marriage for same-sex couples both at the Supreme Court in 2015 <a href=\"https://www.prri.org/research/findings-from-the-2022-american-values-atlas\">and in the court of public opinion</a>. Right-wing activists did not hide that they were searching for a new galvanizing cause to rally donors and grassroots voters. “We threw everything at the wall,” Terry Schilling, the president of American Principles Project, a social conservative advocacy group, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/politics/transgender-conservative-campaign.html\">told the New York Times</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;While their early efforts to focus on bathroom <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/5/11/11655888/daily-show-north-carolina-bathrooms\">bans backfired</a>, Schilling’s group discovered in 2019 that focusing on school sports bans appeared much more effective, even though the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had found</a> just 1.8 percent of high school students even identified as transgender.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, Idaho became the first state to ban transgender girls from school sports and within four years, <a href=\"https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/youth/sports_participation_bans\">half of all states</a> had passed similar laws, as well as laws banning gender-affirming health care. “It happened super fast. It came out of nowhere,” said Erickson of Third Way. “People weren’t prepared to deal with it because it wasn’t on the radar.”<br><br>“Athletes proved potent for them because there’s always winners and losers in sports,” added Gillian Branstetter, a communications strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union. “And that’s not a particularly new tool for the right.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In terms of policy, the Biden administration initially staked out a position that said there’s no legitimate basis to discriminate based on sex differences. In 2021, Biden’s Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1405541/dl?inline\">intervened in a lawsuit</a> filed by parents of an 11-year-old transgender girl against the state of West Virginia, affirming this view.<br><br>“[West Virginia] cannot point to any valid evidence that allowing transgender girls to participate on girls’ sports teams endangers girls’ athletic opportunities,” the department said in its filing. “Instead, the State legislated based on misconceptions and overbroad assumptions about transgender girls.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While praised by major LGBTQ groups like the Human Rights Campaign, this position obscured quieter disagreement among transgender leaders. Some questioned whether sports participation should be a top priority for the movement, while others doubted whether litigation was the best approach for advancing inclusion, given the state of public opinion. The Justice Department’s position also masked divides within the Democratic Party. Though it’s a complex topic and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/europe/paris-olympics-transgender-athletes.html\">more research is needed</a>, some existing <a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/11/577\">scientific</a> <a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/15/865\">evidence</a> suggests that transgender girls and women who do not suppress testosterone can have advantages in sports, particularly if they have gone through male puberty.<br><br>The West Virginia lawsuit wasn’t the only federal suit in the works. Happening at the same time was another case involving two transgender girls that was quickly drawing national <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/us/transgender-athletes-connecticut-lawsuit/index.html\">attention</a>. In response to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/transgender-teens-outrun-track-field-competitors-critics-close/story?id=55856294\">Terry Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/24/terry-miller-andraya-yearwood-transgender-sprinter/\">Andraya Yearwood</a> winning multiple state track titles in Connecticut, competitors&#8217; parents and the Christian right-wing legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom <a href=\"https://adflegal.blob.core.windows.net/mainsite-new/docs/default-source/documents/legal-documents/selina-soule---title-ix-complaint/selina-soule---title-ix-complaint---complaint-filed-with-u-s-doe-office-for-civil-rights-(2019-06-17).pdf?sfvrsn=4e2231c5_4\">filed</a> a lawsuit against Connecticut’s policy of including transgender athletes. Though initially dismissed in 2021, a federal judge just this month <a href=\"https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/ct-transgender-high-school-athletes-lawsuit-19896739.php\">said the Title IX case could proceed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As more of these politically charged lawsuits and bills mounted, the Biden administration announced it would be delaying its proposed changes to Title IX, despite its Day 1 executive order. Sources involved said the delay was largely understood as a political move <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/10/democrats-arent-eager-to-talk-about-transgender-athletes-the-gop-cant-get-enough-00060931\">driven by the upcoming midterm elections</a>. When the Education Department finally released its proposed school sports rule in 2023, its language represented more of a compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rule marked the Biden administration’s first time saying that sex differences can matter in school sports and schools can discriminate in some cases, while also saying schools do not have to — thus permitting blue states like Connecticut to continue with existing policy. While its <a href=\"https://x.com/AOC/status/1644123142015660032\">merits were debated</a>, the federal proposal was on the table.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The draft regulation recognizes that there are real sex differences and that these matter in competition,” <a href=\"https://law.duke.edu/fac/colemand\">Doriane Coleman</a>, a law professor at Duke University who focuses on sports and gender, told Vox. “For the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which takes the position that all sex differences are just myth and stereotype, that was a big, maybe even treasonous move.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party never talked about the school sports rule after it was proposed</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even as <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/04/25/2023/the-republican-race-to-the-right-on-transgender-issues-is-speeding-up\">conservatives barraged Democrats with attacks</a> that they were extremists on school sports, the White House and then later the Harris campaign never sought to talk about the direction they thought Title IX policy ought to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sources with close knowledge of the White House’s thinking, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Vox the administration worried that talking about the rule would have unintended consequences for transgender individuals already facing threats, and they didn’t want to give political fodder for Republicans to twist their words. So they said nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some progressive communications strategists <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/harris-trump-democrats-republicans-anti-trans-bullying-1235136920/\">warned against</a> generally staying silent on transgender rights.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wemakethefutureaction.us/\">We Make the Future Action</a> and <a href=\"https://asocommunications.com/\">ASO Communication</a> tested different strategies and found messaging that didn&#8217;t directly reference transgender people tended to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-n7e_1L4WFM6-rLf4A-uYbovrYMH9CmUkAVs4Km0lYk/edit?tab=t.0\">weaken support for progressive positions</a> among certain voter groups who were otherwise confronted with anti-trans ads. Or, put differently, saying nothing could hurt more than saying something proactive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When Democrats are silent about race or immigrants or trans people, all that conflicted voters hear are the siren songs of hate peddling from Republicans about said ‘other,’” Anat Shenker-Osorio, who led the messaging research, told Vox. “Ignoring doesn’t make the attack go away. It makes it all that voters hear about the topic.”<br><br>Erickson agreed with this critique. In addition to not wanting to get yelled at by progressive leaders on X, she said, Democrats believed they should avoid talking about transgender rights to change the subject. “I think that is so idiotic, especially when the issue is high-salience,” she stressed, emphasizing that leaders <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/talking-about-transgender-youth-in-sports\">could have focused on shared values</a> of freedom, dignity, and privacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mara Keisling, a longtime transgender advocate and founding director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, told Vox she wasn’t bothered that Harris hadn’t focused on trans people on the campaign trail and that it’s understandable Harris would prioritize issues that mattered to all voters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s more important to me who won the election than whether or not trans people are mentioned,” Keisling said. On the question of where the Biden administration was headed on school sports participation, Kiesling said she just didn’t think people would care about the process of an Education Department rule. “They used to say in politics that if you’re talking about process, you’re losing,” she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Branstetter emphasized that it’s not as if national Democrats didn’t have good models to emulate when it comes to messaging, noting that red-state Democrats like those in Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma <a href=\"https://kansasreflector.com/2023/02/13/kansas-democrats-describe-attempt-to-ban-transgender-student-athletes-as-crushing-weight/\">have demonstrated</a> clearly over the last half-decade how to stand up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/23631262/trans-bills-republican-state-legislatures\">anti-trans legislative attacks</a>. “Democrats are overestimating the electoral potency and letting themselves get lost in the issue instead of framing the opposition’s attacks within the broader fight for equality,” she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moving forward, a series of federal lawsuits — including the aforementioned Connecticut case and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/385198/supreme-court-transgender-united-states-skrmetti\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/385198/supreme-court-transgender-united-states-skrmetti\">one the Supreme Court</a> is set to <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/10/supreme-court-schedules-transgender-rights-case-for-december/\">hear in December</a> — could affect how rules, laws, and guidelines on issues of transgender rights develop. The NCAA is also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/naia-ncaa-transgender-ban-sports/index.html\">currently reviewing its own policies</a> for transgender athletes at the college level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year in <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em>, federal agencies may have far less leeway to make policy decisions of all kinds without Congress getting involved. My colleague Ian Millhiser <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab\">called the ruling</a> a “radical reordering of the US separation of powers” and “likely to be one of [the Court’s] most consequential modern-day decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coleman, of Duke Law, thinks the <em>Loper Bright </em>decision and broader changes in administrative law will mean the school sports issue ultimately gets decided legislatively, not in the courts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until then, though, the matter will likely continue to play out in politics. Democrats may be well-intentioned in seeking to avoid heated and sensitive issues, but their strategy of silence can fuel the perception that the party cannot craft politically viable solutions, and more importantly, contribute to the myth that there’s a major ongoing crisis in school sports.<br><br>“There aren’t trans athletes everywhere beating women,” Keisling said. “There are a lot of 6-year-olds and 10-year-olds who just want to play soccer with their friends.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s presidential victory, journalists and analysts have rushed to diagnose the causes of Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s defeat and the Democratic Party’s broader losses. One of the emerging theories is that voters felt Democrats had drifted far from mainstream concerns by focusing too much on culture issues — particularly transgender [&#8230;]",

Kennedy Jr. speaks alongside former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Georgia in October 2024. | Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> announced Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/368394/rfk-drop-out-2024-presidential-campaign-trump\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> would be <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1857170020427595797\">his nominee</a> to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), setting the stage for a potentially radical remaking of the nation’s health care.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy’s nomination was not a surprise. Last month, Kennedy said Trump had <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/30/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-administration-00186227\">promised him control of the department</a> and its many subagencies, which include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), and others. Trump himself <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/-trump-says-he-would-let-anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-go-wild-on-health-222810181633\">pledged</a> during the campaign to let Kennedy “go wild on health.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s a perplexing pick. Kennedy has spent <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-distorted-vaccine-science1/\">decades</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a\">spreading anti-vaccination pseudoscience</a>, and the organization he leads, Children&#8217;s Health Defense, has been one of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-pandemics-race-and-ethnicity-d140be878b1ef0c5a5cce3cfde71e69c\">foremost anti-vaccine advocacy groups</a> in the US and abroad. His work in support of a Samoan anti-vaccine group helped fuel a wave of vaccine hesitancy in the island nation, leading to a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-8b7b8506aec638b26c30a42819d96036\">2019 measles epidemic</a> that killed 83 people, most of them children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s expressed a range of other conspiracy-laden ideas about health: He says fluoride is industrial waste linked to a range of diseases, and suggested it <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science/index.html\">should be removed</a> from all US water systems. He has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/us/politics/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html\">speculated</a> that gender dysphoria may result from herbicide exposure and implied mass shootings are linked to antidepressants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy does hold other views that align with many scientists: He <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-robert-f-kennedy-make-america-healthy-again/\">traces</a> America’s high levels of chronic disease to the widespread availability of highly processed, non-nutritious food, which he and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379713003206\">nutrition policy experts</a> blame in part on broken agriculture policy. He’s railed against <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/robert-kennedy-jr-donald-trump-health-care.html\">corruption and conflicts of interest</a> in the FDA’s drug approval process that favor big pharmaceutical companies over the interests of individuals — something <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-09-15/get-the-fda-out-of-the-way-and-drug-prices-will-drop?embedded-checkout=true\">economists</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2022/11/09/book-review-drugs-and-the-fda-safety-efficacy-and-the-publics-trust-by-mikkael-a-sekeres/\">scientists</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pogo.org/investigations/in-fda-meetings-voice-of-patient-often-funded-by-drug-companies\">consumer advocates</a> agree on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No matter where a person stands on the political spectrum, they can probably find something to agree with Kennedy on<em>. </em>He is the personification of <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/\">the growing distrust of science and “the public health establishment”</a> that many Americans have felt in the post-pandemic era.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">HHS secretaries are usually seasoned bureaucrats with a lot of experience moving policy through government agencies —&nbsp;a state insurance commissioner in Barack Obama’s case or a tenured pharma executive in Donald Trump’s first term. They typically understand how science is done and what it means for a health intervention to be grounded in evidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy doesn’t have that résumé —&nbsp;far from it. Now he’ll be in charge of much of US health care, which raises the question: How much damage can he actually do in this role?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answer will depend on a few things. First, he has to be confirmed by the Senate (unless the White House attempts to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet\">circumvent</a> that chamber’s constitutional “advise and consent” powers) and Republicans have only a narrow majority. Even if Kennedy is confirmed, Trump has other important health care appointments to make — particularly for CMS, NIH, FDA, and CDC — and those people will hold sway over the administration’s health care agenda too. They could be in the Kennedy vein or, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/15/battle-lines-what-do-trumps-appointments-tell-us-about-his/\">as we have seen with Trump’s foreign policy picks</a>, a mix of the conventional and the iconoclastic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, however, Kennedy’s appointment is a watershed moment that could portend enormous changes to the American health system. Republicans in Congress will control the HHS budget, and Kennedy, if confirmed, could have broad discretion to pursue his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda with Trump’s blessing. If the Trump administration attempts to remove civil servants across the government, including the health agencies, decades of public health knowledge could be lost at the CDC, FDA, and elsewhere. It is uncertain if the Republican-dominated judiciary would step in to stop any of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s what we know about the Trump health department’s plans — and what hurdles may await them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What RFK Jr. can — and can’t — do on vaccines, briefly explained</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last 30 years, vaccines have saved the lives of more than <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/vaccines-children-saved\">1.1 million children </a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333e1.htm?_cid=mm7333e1_w\">in the US alone</a>. Over the same period, they’ve also <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/childhood-vaccines-have-prevented-half-billion-illnesses-saved-us-27-trillion-3#:~:text=The%20investigators%20found%20that%2C%20among,%242.7%20trillion%20in%20societal%20costs.\">saved</a> Americans $540 billion in direct health care costs and trillions in social costs. Routine vaccines protect American children from 16 diseases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump himself <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/366472/2024-election-donald-trump-vaccines-schools\">suggested</a> blocking funding for local schools with vaccine requirements during the campaign, though the federal government has limited authority to do so. Despite Kennedy’s long history of anti-vaccine rhetoric, he said in early November he wasn&#8217;t planning to take anyone&#8217;s vaccines away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information,&#8221; Kennedy said in an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955\">NBC News interview</a>. &#8220;So I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, a co-chair of Trump’s transition team recently said Kennedy hoped to access federal health data with the goal of proving vaccines are unsafe and <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-10-31/rfk-jr-wants-federal-health-data-so-he-can-show-vaccines-are-unsafe-trump-transition-co-chair-says\">pulling them from the US market</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s not as easy to do as it sounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Undoing the approval of an already approved vaccine would <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-314/subpart-D/section-314.150\">require</a> submitting evidence of harm that meets the FDA’s standards to prove harm, which simply <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/english/safety-prevention/immunizations/pages/vaccine-studies-examine-the-evidence.aspx\">doesn&#8217;t exist</a>. Although a Trump-installed loyalist could theoretically rewrite the FDA’s standards, that would likely lead to opposition from the pharmaceutical companies that produce these vaccines. There would be a wave of expensive and prolonged lawsuits for the federal government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Drugmakers also wield influence in Congress, which writes the law that sets pharmaceutical industry fees that cover nearly <a href=\"https://today.uconn.edu/2021/05/why-is-the-fda-funded-in-part-by-the-companies-it-regulates-2/#\">half of the FDA’s budget</a>. That law will need to be reauthorized before the end of Trump’s term, setting up a potentially vicious fight if the two sides are at odds over vaccines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is a more realistic move Kennedy could take to address his concern about vaccine side effects: He could resuscitate the National Vaccine Program Office, which monitored vaccine safety with particular rigor but was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/health/covid-vaccine-safety.html\">shuttered</a> under the first Trump presidency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although it would be difficult to pull vaccines from the American market, and Kennedy says he won’t, there are other ways he could exert influence to reduce vaccine uptake.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy could try to influence the CDC. That agency has two important roles in promoting vaccines in the US: It convenes an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to provide expert recommendations on who should get which vaccines and at what age, and it administers the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free vaccines for children in low-income families.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The advisory committee is not mandated by federal law — it is convened only if the CDC wants it to be. A vaccine skeptic appointed to run the CDC under Kennedy could either staff the committee with anti-vaccination activists or dissolve it entirely. That would mean the agency would no longer provide widely accepted guidelines for vaccination that state health departments and hundreds of thousands of clinicians nationwide now rely on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Vaccines for Children program is funded by a pot of money that Congress sets aside for the CDC every year. Kennedy could press Congress and the White House to simply cut that funding, ending the program entirely. That would leave low-income families having to pay out of pocket to vaccinate their children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy will also be ultimately responsible for two giant public insurance programs: Medicare, which covers seniors, and Medicaid, which is overseen by the states and covers low-income people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In both programs, the amount of money disbursed by the federal government is in part determined by how good of a job the states and private insurers do in vaccinating children and older adults enrolled in these programs. Kennedy could pressure the CMS administrator to eliminate that vaccination requirement, one reason Trump’s choice at CMS will be one to watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear what the timeline would be to accomplish any of these tasks; there’s no precedent for a president and HHS secretary who are so openly hostile to US public health infrastructure assuming control of it. Even if it takes a while, there’s widespread concern that giving such a platform to someone who denies vaccine science could further degrade public trust not only in the vaccines, but in the many other health recommendations and interventions that together comprise American public health and health care. Already, more isolated outbreaks of measles and other diseases that had previously been stamped out by vaccines are <a href=\"https://news.ohsu.edu/2024/09/06/measles-cases-on-the-rise-in-oregon-families-urged-to-stay-current-on-vaccinations\">occurring</a> at the same time vaccination rates are <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/headed-back-to-school-in-2024-an-update-on-childrens-routine-vaccination-trends/\">slipping</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease doctor who directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said Kennedy has had such a big platform for so long that it’s unlikely he’ll be able to scare people about vaccines more than he already has. It’s in delivering the vaccines through programs like Vaccines for Children where he could perhaps do the damage: “If he were able to disrupt that, that would be a problem.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Can RFK Jr. really remove fluoride from US water?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US began fluoridating drinking water in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm\">1945</a>. An estimated 209 million Americans now drink tap water that contains added fluoride. The intervention is considered a historic public health win: It dramatically <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/11195-fluoride\">reduces tooth decay</a> in children and also reduces tooth loss in adults.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy, however, has <a href=\"https://x.com/robertkennedyjr/status/1852812012478398923?s=46\">said</a> he would immediately advise the removal of fluoride from local water supplies. Why? Because he is exaggerating the actual risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of the fluoride and US tap water is added by water utility companies, but some tap water contains naturally occurring fluoride it absorbs from the local water table. The resulting high-fluoride tap water, which about 2 million Americans drink, contains about twice the amount of fluoride the US government recommends. According to a recent report from the US National Toxicology Program, drinking high-fluoride water <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/369470/fluoride-iq-kids-brain-development-toothpaste-water-science-study\">might be linked to slightly lower IQ scores</a> — by 2 to 5 points in some children —&nbsp;though IQ scores are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121219133334.htm\">an uncertain measure of intelligence</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, there is no indication that tap water containing normal fluoride levels poses this risk — and its benefits to children’s and adult’s dental health are immense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The decision to fluoridate water is one that happens at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html\">state and local level</a>, which is why Kennedy could only advise fluoride’s removal. However, his leadership at HHS could give an opening to anti-fluoride action at the state level, where Republican leaders are increasingly hostile to what had been <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-vaccine-skepticism-mandates-republican-platform/\">settled public health practices</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign on food and chronic diseases</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy has called for a campaign against chronic disease that he’s branded as “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-robert-f-kennedy-make-america-healthy-again/\">Make America Healthy Again</a>.” It is an ambiguous and wide-ranging platform, but the consistent theme is undoing what Kennedy sees as Big Pharma and Big Agriculture’s undue influence on what Americans eat and how they manage their health over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the ideas share the same pseudoscience as Kennedy’s views on vaccines. Kennedy recently <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737\">posted</a> on social media that the FDA had “waged a war on public health” by “aggressive suppression” of Americans’ access to raw milk, among other things. States <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/publications/research-anthology-raw-milk.html\">aren’t required</a> to pasteurize milk, but the FDA requires milk sold across state lines to be pasteurized. Despite raw milk’s risk of causing life-threatening diarrheal diseases (and now, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24158356/raw-milk-pasteurization-h5n1-bird-flu-sales-consumption-government-trust\">bird flu</a>), states can already carve out exceptions that allow their residents to drink it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of Kennedy’s ideas about food are more rooted in reality. For example, his take on nutrition’s role in chronic disease: He has correctly noted that the US has developed <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022\">a terrible record</a> on preventing diabetes, heart disease, and unhealthy weight, and places the blame <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/4891813-robert-kennedy-jr-chronic-disease/\">where nutritional experts do</a> — on permissive government policies and dietary guidelines that promote eating lots of ultra-processed foods and low levels of physical activity in schools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As part of his fight against ultra-processed foods, Kennedy recently said he wants to do away with <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4976746-robert-kennedy-potential-role-trump-administration/\">entire departments</a> at the FDA, including the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. According to <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/how-much-power-do-trump-and-kennedy-have-reshape-health-agencies\">recent reporting in <em>Science</em></a>, he could indeed pressure whoever is appointed to lead the agency to eliminate that center, which makes Trump’s choice for FDA commissioner a critical one in setting his administration’s public health agenda.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, if Kennedy wants to restrict the use of already-approved food additives, he needs <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/12/fda-commissioner-califf-trump-election-rfk-jr-public-health-food-nutrition/\">more</a> <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/26/fda-plan-assess-safety-food-additives/\">resources</a> — not fewer: The process involves rigorous reviews of data, issuing public warnings, and actively monitoring the food supply. If Kennedy succeeded in closing the food safety office, that would reduce the number of people who could be dedicated to the job, making it harder rather than easier to rein in the use of these products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other actions could be taken by the Trump administration to reduce the amount of ultra-processed food in the American food supply, but many of them would be taken outside of HHS. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) sets the guidelines that govern school lunch programs, which means much of what children eat is determined by that agency; Trump has not yet nominated a USDA commissioner. The USDA is also primarily responsible for overseeing factory farming, another industry Kennedy has <a href=\"https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2024/11/rfk-jr-and-the-make-america-healthy-again-agenda-could-impact-food-safety/#google_vignette\">heavily criticized</a> throughout his public career and pledged to target if he were to take a role in the federal government. He would likely need to work with the USDA to follow through.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy is correct that food safety regulation in the US is currently a mess, says David Acheson, an infectious diseases doctor who has led food safety efforts at both the USDA and the FDA. Meat, poultry, and egg plants are inspected daily under the auspices of the USDA, while every other kind of food production facility — including the farms whose produce is responsible for most of the food-borne illness in the US and the nation’s countless other industrial food manufacturers — are inspected by FDA inspectors at most once a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It would make far more sense to unify these functions under one agency and harmonize the frequency of food production facility inspections so none are falling through the cracks. That is the kind of organizational shake-up that could actually make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Acheson would also like to see Kennedy take on the FDA’s process for regulating supplements, which are currently subject to lax oversight <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dietary-supplements-protein-powders-what-to-watch-out-for/\">despite obvious health risks</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What happens to NIH in a second Trump term?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At a town hall earlier this year, before dropping out of the race for president, Kennedy <a href=\"https://x.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1803974935091761518\">said</a> that if elected, he’d tell the NIH to pause drug development and infectious diseases research for eight years and instead focus on chronic diseases. He also <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-kennedy-anti-vaccine-panel-conspiracies-hiv-spanish-flu-1234779689/\">pledged</a> during his own campaign for president that he would block <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/10/19/23412562/covid-omircron-gain-of-function-research-engineered-pandemic-biosafety\">“gain of function” research</a> — in which scientists purposefully make viruses more dangerous in hopes of learning how to better combat them — that has come under more scrutiny since the pandemic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apart from the fact that the NIH already spends about <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775642\">$20 billion annually</a> on chronic disease, this would be disastrous: The basic research the agency funds and conducts in its own institutes lays the groundwork for therapies pharmaceutical companies develop to treat most medical conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy has called for firing 600 of the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-replace-hundreds-federal-health-workers-nih-1984114\">nearly 19,000 employees</a> and replacing them with new ones, who presumably would be more keen to carry out his priorities. Conservatives have also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/nx-s1-5183014/trump-election-2024-nih-rfk\">floated</a> restructuring the NIH, and Trump proposed cutting its $48 billion budget during his first term.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) speaks on stage on the third day of the Republican National Convention on July 17, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let’s be clear: Not everything President-elect Donald Trump has proposed to do in his upcoming administration is a threat to American democracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384320/trump-cabinet-white-house\">Cabinet appointments</a>, like Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state or former Rep. Lee Zeldin for Environmental Protection Agency administrator, are basically what you’d expect from Republicans. You might disagree with their policies, but you can’t seriously argue they represent threats to the rule of law or democratic norms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others, like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, are troublingly unqualified and even outright dangerous — but not an immediate five-alarm fire for American democracy specifically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet at the same time, there is already clear and undeniable cause for alarm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Around the world, there are certain steps a leader takes if they want to destroy a country’s democracy, like putting loyalists in charge of law enforcement and politicizing the armed forces. Many of Trump’s early decisions fit this pattern to a T.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest red flag is the choice of arch-loyalist Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is arguably the single most powerful domestic policy agency, running everything from the FBI to federal criminal prosecutors to civil rights litigation. Gaetz has few, if any, qualifications to manage all of this — except for his vendetta against the department, as it once investigated him on suspicion of sex crimes. (Gaetz denies the allegations and the DOJ <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839\">dropped its investigation</a> into them in 2023.)<strong> </strong>His pitch for the job, <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/donald-trump-is-dead-serious-about\">one Trump insider told the Bulwark</a>, was to “go over there and start cuttin’ fuckin’ heads.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s plans for the military are similarly ominous. Two teams of reporters, at <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606\">the Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-team-drawing-up-list-pentagon-officers-fire-sources-say-2024-11-13/\">Reuters</a> respectively, have uncovered plans for a political purge of the brass — potentially including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump’s proposed secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, is a Fox News commentator and MAGA diehard who called for <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/pete-hegseths-plan-overhaul-americas-military-fire-ton/story?id=115842674\">precisely such a purge</a> in a recent book.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there’s Trump’s scheme to get his Cabinet picks in office. If the Republican Senate actually does block any of these picks, Trump has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet\">demanded the power</a> to install them through recess appointments while the chamber is out of session. If enough senators balk, Trump reportedly has put together <a href=\"https://x.com/AJentleson/status/1857081316937761089\">a complicated backup plan</a> that boils down to the House giving him the power to go around the Senate entirely —&nbsp;effectively eviscerating its constitutional advice-and-consent role on appointments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, we don’t know how many of these really bad ideas will come to pass. Trump is famous for saying things and failing to follow through. But given the enormity of the tail risk — the corrosion of American democracy — it’s critical to take what’s happening right now seriously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And that means being clear-eyed about the Trump agenda: both what’s not so scary about it, and what is.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The “authoritarian checklist” that can guide us through Trump 2.0</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The United States is not the only democracy to elect an authoritarian of late. Voters in a series of other countries —&nbsp;including Brazil, Hungary, India, Israel, Philippines, Poland, Turkey, and Venezuela —&nbsp;have elevated similarly dangerous leaders in recent elections. None of these countries are exactly like the United States, but all have some things in common that can give us guidance as to what to expect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most important similarities is that none of these country’s leaders openly campaigned on abolishing democracy. The concept remained far too popular among both citizens and elites to act like Hitler and abolish elections outright.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, they made incremental changes that would slowly but surely increase their own power while neutralizing opponents both in and out of the government. No one step marks the end of democracy, but each cumulatively makes it a little bit weaker. If this process reaches its endpoint, elections become functionally meaningless — theoretically free contests that in actuality are nearly impossible for the incumbent party to lose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Executing this strategy requires a few key moves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, would-be authoritarians need the loyalists in key government positions. No one can hollow out an entire government on their own&nbsp;—&nbsp;it’s simply too towering a task to micro-manage. So they delegate, empowering individuals with unwavering loyalty and dedication to remaking key government institutions along authoritarian lines. In India, for example, the second-most powerful position in government —&nbsp;home minister — is occupied by a man named Amit Shah, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68653573\">close friend and comrade</a> of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s since 1982.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, they need those appointees to eviscerate legal and political guardrails on their power. Independent prosecutors, government accountability offices, courts, legislative prerogatives — all of this needs to be either co-opted or eliminated. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/1/3/24022467/israel-supreme-court-judicial-overhaul-reasonableness-basic-law-overturn\">failed 2023 judicial overhaul in Israel</a>, which would have effectively stripped its courts of any ability to check Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s power, is an unusually stark example of such a move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After these first two steps have succeeded in consolidating power over the state, the authoritarian then wields it to weaken dissenters outside of government&nbsp;— with the ultimate aim of tilting the playing field on which elections take place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This doesn’t just mean obvious things, like formally restricting free speech rights, but more subtle tools, like wielding tax agencies and spurious legal investigations against critics and potential private sector rivals. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump\">is the pioneer here</a>, using something as seemingly benign as government ad spending to bring the Hungarian media under his control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through all of this, they need to be able to count on the loyalty of the security services as a last resort. In between elections, would-be authoritarians fear nothing more than popular uprisings and military coups. Stacking the intelligence community and armed forces with loyalists is the best way to ensure that coups fail (as happened <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/15/12204172/turkey-coup-erdogan-military\">in Turkey in 2016</a>) or to violently repress street protests if necessary (as happened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/06/venezuela-election-maduro-analysis\">after Venezuela’s stolen election earlier this year</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These four points — appoint loyalists, eviscerate guardrails, attack dissent, suborn the armed forces — are the key benchmarks one should use for evaluating Trump’s policies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does what he’s proposing truly further one of those objectives? If so, by how much? How likely is it to happen? And how does the threat level rank relative to other things that he’s doing?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Grading Trump’s early decisions by the checklist</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trying to assess Trump’s policies on these metrics is not some kind of academic game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those of us who care about democracy, in the press and elsewhere, need to maintain our credibility with potentially persuadable third parties — like swing voters or moderate Republican senators. Being seen as liberal hacks who call any Republican appointee a threat to democracy is a problem; so is developing a track record of crying wolf by labeling everything Trump does anti-democratic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this spirit, it’s clear what emerges as the most dangerous move of Trump’s early transition: the Gaetz pick.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is hard to imagine someone <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/04/matt-gaetz-house-republican-congress-profile/677915/?gift=zYCTBrO_7y7KHmiTPdBdgz2i_q9mnP-Ul9A5kUUNFTY&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\">more cravenly loyal to Trump than Gaetz</a>. It is hard to imagine anyone who has a more serious vendetta against nonpartisan administration of laws, since Gaetz was once the target of a federal investigation. And it is hard to imagine a more important position than attorney general — one that gives immense power both to eviscerate guardrails and to punish private sector dissenters with <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/185487/trump-maga-legal-war-slow-burn-authoritarianism\">spurious criminal investigations</a> (among other tools).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Department of Defense plans aren’t too far behind. Purging the Joint Chiefs based on political loyalty — excuse me, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-vows-fire-generals-push-wokeness-cant-woke-military\">alleged “wokeness”</a> —&nbsp;removes one of the chief barriers to Trump’s alleged desire to <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-insurrection-act-threat\">invoke the Insurrection Act</a> and deploy soldiers against protesters at home. Hegseth isn’t quite as egregious a Cabinet choice as Gaetz, but it’s hard to imagine someone who has proposed such purges and regularly praises Trump on TV standing in the way of his boss’s plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can go on down the list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The plan for circumventing the Senate’s advice-and-consent power would be extremely threatening to guardrails if it happened, but it’s unclear how likely it is to happen. Gabbard as director of national intelligence raises some troubling questions about politicizing intelligence, but she’s not as much of a Trump toady as a Gaetz or even a Hegseth. Kennedy is almost certainly a disaster for public health, but not an obvious threat to democracy, narrowly speaking. The Office of Presidential Personnel is small potatoes compared to a Cabinet post, but Trump’s decision to put <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-personnel-sergio-gor.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">his book publisher in charge of it</a> will facilitate his plans for seeding the entire government with loyalists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By contrast, there’s no reason to think appointments like Rubio or Zeldin even register on this scale. These are the kind of appointments you’d expect from any Republican, and while their policies may be terrible, they’re not an attack on our system of government. In terms of protecting our democracy, the question for them isn’t whether they themselves are a sign of authoritarian rot, but whether they would have the courage to resist it while in power (color me skeptical).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ranking these matters for more than just credibility purposes. Democracy’s defenders have limited resources and energy, especially when both chambers of Congress and the Supreme Court are controlled by Republicans. They need to prioritize which Trump appointments and policies to fight, a task made far more difficult by the deluge of daily outrages that we all remember from Trump’s first term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That requires being clear-eyed about what really is threatening and what isn’t. And at present, an objective evaluation of Trump’s early proposals should give Americans a hell of a lot to worry about.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As Donald Trump prepares to take office again, the scientific community is grappling with <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/09/trump-administration-healthcare-policy-realistic-expectations-rfk-jr/\">what his agenda means for them</a>. Scientists <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-4916564/trump-science-censorship-fears\">worry</a> that a second Trump term will stall efforts to fight climate change and eviscerate federal agencies involved in public health.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/\">Pew’s latest survey</a>, Republican confidence in science went up this year, the first increase in trust reported since before the pandemic. But the incoming Trump administration, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health\">now prominently featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, is placing science skepticism at the heart of promises to “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/11/robert-kennedy-jr-trump-maha/680612/\">Make America Healthy Again</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The belief that health care practitioners, federal agencies, and institutions of science are colluding against us is being pushed by rising GOP leaders like <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/07/calley-means-casey-means-conservative-voices-of-chronic-disease-crisis/\">conservative health influencers Calley and Casey Means</a> to stoke conservative anxieties. According to Pew, nearly two-thirds of conservatives believe that scientists should stay out of science-related policy debates. Now that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-hhs-secretary-pick-00188617\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-hhs-secretary-pick-00188617\">Trump has selected Kennedy</a> to lead <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/presidential-election-trump-health-care-abortion-medicare-rfk/\">the Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS), those conservatives may get their wish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here are three charts that make sense of America’s relationship with science today, and highlight how scientists can earn the public’s trust back.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Confidence in science is rising for the first time since early 2020 — but trust splits along party lines</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17948062/pandemic-flu-ebola-h1n1-outbreak-infectious-disease\">caught the world with its pants down</a>, and public trust in science never fully recovered. As the virus spread, the imperfect process of science was laid out for everyone to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Normally, publishing a biomedical science paper is a years-long process. The experiments themselves can take many weeks or months, depending on the nature of the project. Once data is analyzed, written up, and submitted to a journal for peer review, it can take anywhere from a few months to a few years to get published — reviewers often ask scientists to make changes or include more information, to make sure their findings are as airtight as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in the early stages of the pandemic, people were desperate for answers — and scientists stepped into the vacuum to publish <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22776428/ivermectin-science-publication-research-fraud\">rushed, sometimes error-filled papers</a> without peer review. Journalists published news articles about those pre-print studies <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23017140/media-journalists-pandemic-covid-lab-leak-coronavirus\">without effectively communicating their uncertainty</a>. Policymakers were left to make huge decisions based on limited, inconclusive, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22776428/ivermectin-science-publication-research-fraud\">sometimes downright fraudulent</a> data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But science is a messy, nonlinear process, and new data can overturn previously held truths at any moment. The scientific method involves making an educated guess about how the world works, finding a way to test that guess, and seeing what happens — basically, science is the act of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tysaiahfranklin/video/7148626782084697390?lang=en\">messing around and finding out</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In most cases, it takes many iterations of this process before the scientific community reaches a consensus (and even then, new experiments can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics\">shatter what was once accepted as fact</a>). For scientists, this is a given. “The consistency is only to the data, not your position,” said <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/person/sudip-parikh\">Sudip Parikh</a>, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem, he said, is that politics don’t work that way. “In politics, you should be consistent about your position,” Parikh said. And when you’re not consistent, as Vice President Kamala Harris discovered during the 2024 campaign, voters can punish you for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So when the government seemed to flip-flop during the pandemic — like telling people to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/3/21202792/coronavirus-masks-n95-trump-white-house-cdc-ppe-shortage\">only wear cloth masks</a> to preserve limited supplies for front line health care workers, only to later say that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/1/8/22873390/covid-19-better-masks-n95-respirator-surgical-omicron\">cloth masks aren’t very effective</a> — most people didn’t instinctively think it was all part of the learning process. They felt betrayed. And that sense of betrayal <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21364099/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-research-herd-immunity\">ultimately extended to vaccines</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The public lost trust in science for years following the pandemic. According to Pew, though Democrats’ confidence fell by a few percentage points between 2019 and 2023, they still overwhelmingly trusted scientists throughout the pandemic. Republicans’ trust, however, plummeted between 2020 and 2021, and it’s only just beginning to recover. The massive partisan divide is striking: When surveyed in October, 88 percent of Democrats said they have “a fair amount” or “a great deal” of confidence in scientists, compared to 66 percent of Republicans.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PS_24.11.14_trust_p8.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.63668349887,100,72.72663300226\" alt=\"A figure from Pew Research Center illustrates that confidence in science remains higher among Democrats than Republicans.\" title=\"A figure from Pew Research Center illustrates that confidence in science remains higher among Democrats than Republicans.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Most people agree that scientists are smart, but bad at communicating</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When asked, about 9 in 10 people, regardless of party affiliation, agreed that research scientists are “intelligent.” <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/alec-tyson/\">Alec Tyson</a>, an associate director of research at Pew, pointed out that in general, scientists “engender high levels of trust from the public in a low-trust era,” inspiring more votes of confidence than people are willing to give just about any other occupation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, while over three-quarters of Democrats believe scientists are also “honest” and “focus on solving real-world problems,” only about half of Republicans agree. On the flip side, many more Republicans than Democrats agree that scientists are cold, closed-minded, ignore moral values of society, and feel superior to others.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PS_24.11.14_trust_p13.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,29.789356308421,100,40.421287383157\" alt=\"A figure from Pew Research Center illustrating that Republicans and Democrats differ in views of research scientists’ traits, including honesty.\" title=\"A figure from Pew Research Center illustrating that Republicans and Democrats differ in views of research scientists’ traits, including honesty.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The majority of Americans surveyed also think scientists are socially awkward and bad at communicating. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Look, scientists are human,” Parikh said. “We have the whole spectrum of the population. Every personality type that’s out in the real world is in the scientific laboratory as well.” So, sure — some scientists are certainly socially awkward (and as a former scientist, I’ve both witnessed and likely contributed to this stereotype). And unfortunately, scientists rarely learn how to write for non-academic audiences or speak with the press as part of their training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are some easy steps scientists can take to improve their overall vibe. A group of scientists, including <a href=\"https://www.samanthayammine.com/\">Samantha Yammine</a> and<a href=\"https://thebrainscientist.com/\"> Daniel Toker</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/science.sam/\">@ScienceSam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/the_brain_scientist/?hl=en\">@the_brain_scientist</a> on both Instagram and TikTok), <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216625#abstract0\">ran an experiment</a> in 2019 to see whether posting selfies on social media could change people’s perception of scientists. When scientists <a href=\"https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/macroscope/scientists-who-selfie-break-down-stereotypes\">posted friendly-looking pictures of themselves</a> against a science-y backdrop, like their lab bench, viewers rated them as significantly warmer than if they had posted a picture of their lab equipment alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Parikh thinks that building long-term relationships between researchers, policymakers, reporters, and their community — whether through social media, <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships\">fellowship programs</a>, or<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22177247/citizen-science-amateur-backyard-birding-astronomy-covid-pandemic\"> citizen science</a> — can strengthen trust over time. “Science is a human endeavor,” Parikh said. “The way you build trust is by being open and honest about both the strengths and the limitations of your process.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Most Republicans don’t want scientists involved in science-related policy decisions</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pew’s survey asked respondents another big question: “If you trust scientists,” Tyson said, “what role do you want them to play in public life?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses22204/assets/federal-scientists-and-engineers/ncses22204.pdf\">According to the National Science Foundation</a>, the federal government in 2020 employed about 175,000 scientists, the vast majority of whom conduct research for the Department of Defense. Though elected officials hold final authority, scientists can influence policy decisions <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/careers/chemical-sciences/fields/science-policy.html\">by advising politicians</a>, and may work for the federal government, or nongovernmental organizations like universities or think tanks. In times of crisis, like the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists in government have the power to sway decisions that affect everyone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People were divided: About half of US adults think scientists should take an active role in science-related policy debates, while the other half thinks scientists should just stick to science. Again, there was a big partisan gap, with many more Republicans wanting scientists to stay out of policy debates.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PS_24.11.14_trust_p14.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.794820999009,100,50.410358001981\" alt=\"A figure from Pew Research Center illustrates that Americans are divided over the role for scientists in scientific policy debates.\" title=\"A figure from Pew Research Center illustrates that Americans are divided over the role for scientists in scientific policy debates.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One possible explanation, Parikh said, is that people are worried that scientists are so married to their data, they ignore everything else. During the 2020 lockdowns, for example, many people disagreed with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/16/21180629/coronavirus-new-york-city-public-schools-closed\">school closures</a> — though closing schools was <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-03-31-school-closures-may-reduce-covid-19-transmission-may-also-harm-childrens-education\">a largely evidence-based decision</a>, that evidence was limited and uncertain, and closures ultimately caused real, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23584869/covid-coronavirus-school-closures-remote-education-learning-loss-psychological-depression-teens\">lasting damage to children’s education and mental health</a>. In policy debates like that, where scientific evidence is pitted against economic reality, family values, and individual emotions, some people may worry that scientists would only consider the science.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not to say that science and data matter when it comes to policymaking — nearly all hot-button issues today, like reproductive care, climate change, and drug regulation, have science at their core. But science and data are “not the only part of the equation,” Parikh said. “That’s why we have policymakers. We have to have a discussion about what the data means.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tyson’s team has an eye on the Trump administration’s health proposals, and what they might mean for the public’s perception of science. While it’s too early to know exactly what role he will play, Kennedy has long held outright conspiratorial beliefs around <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/30/rfk-jr-trump-campaign-public-health-policy-issue/\">vaccines</a>,<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/369470/fluoride-iq-kids-brain-development-toothpaste-water-science-study\"> fluoride</a>,<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/31/trump-rfk-food-pharma-00186513\"> seed oils, and pesticides</a>, and has <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/trump-victory-upend-fda-rfk-jr-influence-vaccines-prescriptions/\">said he would</a> dramatically restructure HHS, the federal organization responsible for public health. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think we’ll be ready, a year from now, to take stock of the change in administration and see where the conversation goes from there,” Tyson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For years, science communicators believed that the gap between scientists and the rest of the population could be explained by inadequate information. This paradigm, called the “<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7506985/\">deficit model</a>,” states that if only the public were more educated about the scientific method, they would be more willing to trust scientific expertise. In this model, scientists hold crucial information that non-scientists don’t have, and sharing that information should be enough to sway hearts and minds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While that theory makes some intuitive sense, it doesn’t seem to be how humans actually work. Pew reported that, among politically aligned voters, whether someone went to college didn’t change their trust in science. It’s not about education — it’s about transparency, relationship-building, and a willingness to acknowledge when science makes mistakes. If the deficit model were an experiment, the data would suggest it’s not working.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While I don’t believe that <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/yes-science-is-political/\">science is — or should be — apolitical</a>, it ought to be bipartisan. “It’s a process for thinking,” Parikh said, “and that process for thinking is not partisan.” Parikh is cautiously optimistic that this year’s upswing in Republican confidence in science marks the beginning of the end of science’s post-pandemic slump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If we can do five point increases for three years in a row on the Republican side, we’re right back at complete bipartisanship,” Parikh said.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Every year since 2019, Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank and polling organization, has asked nearly 10,000 American adults how they feel about science. In 2019, the vast majority of people surveyed across the political spectrum were confident that scientists act in the public’s best interest. In fact, Americans placed more confidence in scientists [&#8230;]",

Skrmetti</em></a>, arguably the most important trans rights case the justices have ever heard. <em>Skrmetti</em> asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution, a question the Court has never answered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A decision against the trans plaintiffs in <em>Skrmetti</em>, moreover, could potentially upend the entire legal framework protecting Americans from gender discrimination of all kinds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A Court with a 6-3 Republican supermajority plans to hear <em>Skrmetti</em> in early December, less than a month after an election in which, according to the Washington Post, GOP campaigns “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/05/election-trans-sports-trump-campaign/\">spent at least $215 million</a> on network ads that paint trans people as a menace to society.” President-elect Donald Trump made <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-transgender-politics-61cff97a64fac581ffc5f762be4c57d3\">anti-trans rhetoric a key part of his campaign</a>, promising, for example, that if elected, he would keep “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women’s sports.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is to say: This case arrives at a moment in which the Republican Party is all in on animus toward transgender people. And, while there are strong legal arguments supporting the pro-trans rights position in <em>Skrmetti</em>, this panel of justices has shown <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/371361/supreme-court-call-republican-justices-republicans\">great deference to the general mood of the Republican Party</a> in past decisions, like when they ruled that Trump may <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">use his official presidential powers to commit crimes once he returns to office</a>. If the Court’s Republican majority is determined to reach an anti-trans result, they likely won’t let something as trivial as “the law” discourage them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, at least two of the Court’s Republicans have shown unexpected sympathy toward LGBTQ litigants in the past. In <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15591206893890926746&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em></a> (2020), the Court ruled that a longstanding ban on sex discrimination in employment prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity — declaring that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Bostock</em> was authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, who is also a Republican. So, if Roberts and Gorsuch hold to the views they expressed in <em>Bostock</em>, the two of them plus the three Democratic justices should be enough to extend at least some constitutional protection to trans people.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s at stake in <em>Skrmetti</em>?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The specific issue in <em>Skrmetti </em>is a Tennessee law prohibiting trans youth from receiving medical treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. About <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/371341/supreme-court-new-term-transgender-ghost-guns-porn-vapes\">half of states</a> have laws targeting transgender health care, but Tennessee’s is among the strictest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Court has never held specifically that discrimination against transgender people violates the Constitution, it has long held that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/9/18/20917757/justice-ginsburg-ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies\">sex discrimination does violate the Constitution</a>, ruling that “<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">all gender-based classifications</a>” are presumptively unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Virginia</em> (1996).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tennessee’s law trips over itself to classify young patients based on their gender. It declares that the law’s purpose is to “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-101-findings\">encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex</a>” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.” The law also denies certain medical treatments to patients based solely on their sex. A patient who was assigned male at birth may have testosterone prescribed by a doctor, but someone assigned female at birth may not have that treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again, the Supreme Court has already said that <em>all </em>gender-based classifications are constitutionally dubious. “All” means “all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Will that be enough to persuade these justices to strike down Tennessee&#8217;s law? The honest answer is, “Who knows?” It’s not like legal texts and Supreme Court precedents play no role in these justices’ decision-making, and they sometimes even hand down a decision like <em>Bostock</em> that cuts strongly against the Republican Party’s policy preferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are two reasons to be pessimistic about <em>Skrmetti</em>. One is that after the recent election, anti-trans voices within the Court are likely to be emboldened, and pro-trans voices may feel like they have limited political capital. The other is that, while Tennessee’s law clearly discriminates on the basis of sex, the Court has only held that laws that do so should be presumed to be unconstitutional unless — as the Court put it in <em>Virginia — </em>there’s an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for the law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is possible that this Court will hold that a ban on trans health care meets this bar.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What current law says about “sex” discrimination, explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of federal law’s core safeguards against sex discrimination emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in the ’60s, Congress started to pass laws banning sex discrimination in various venues — Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/15/21291515/supreme-court-bostock-clayton-county-lgbtq-neil-gorsuch\">prohibits such discrimination in employment</a>. Then, in the 1970s, the Court began to place constitutional limits on the government’s ability to discriminate on the basis of sex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most significant of these cases, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2528522570594071994&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Craig v. Boren</em></a> (1976), established that any government action that classifies people based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional. Again, in <em>Virginia, </em>the Court stated that “a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an ‘<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">exceedingly persuasive justification</a>’ for the classification.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The federal appeals court that heard <em>Skrmetti</em> attempted to get around <em>Craig</em> and <em>Virginia</em> by pointing to the Supreme Court’s decision in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4447817874641898447&amp;q=geduldig+v.+aiello&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,47&amp;as_vis=1\"><em>Geduldig v. Aiello</em></a> (1974). But that decision read <em>Geduldig </em>far too broadly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Briefly, <em>Geduldig</em> concerned a state-run insurance program that provided benefits to some California workers with disabilities, but not to workers whose disabilities arose out of a pregnancy. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that this exclusion for pregnant workers discriminated on the basis of sex, even though the Court wrote that “only women can become pregnant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Geduldig</em>, it should be noted, is not a particularly beloved decision. Four years after it was handed down, Congress enacted the <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/pregnancy-discrimination-act-1978\">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a>, which repudiated <em>Geduldig</em> in the workplace and forbade employers from discriminating on the basis of pregnancy. Regardless, <em>Geduldig</em>’s holding was limited. It established that the government may set up public benefit programs that exclude medical procedures “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/l-w-v-skrmetti-3\">that only one sex can undergo</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Skrmetti</em>, by contrast, involves medical procedures that both sexes can undergo. Anyone can take puberty blockers, testosterone, or estrogen. It is not physically impossible to administer testosterone to someone assigned female at birth in the same way that it is physically impossible for a person without a uterus to become pregnant.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Not all sex discrimination is forbidden</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the Court’s decisions in <em>Craig</em> and <em>Virginia</em>, it should be obvious that Tennessee&#8217;s law draws distinctions based on sex and thus can only survive if the state can offer an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for it. Indeed, if the Court were to reject that conclusion, it would do considerable violence to the legal principles governing all gender discrimination cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, even if the Court honors the <em>Craig</em>/<em>Virginia</em> framework, Tennessee’s law could potentially survive if five of the justices deem the state’s arguments for the law sufficiently persuasive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The briefs in the <em>Skrmetti</em> case paint two very different pictures of why medical professionals treat transgender patients with puberty blockers or hormones. A <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323551/20240827210326240_23-477tsUnitedStates.pdf\">brief filed by the Biden administration</a>, for example, warns that the absence of these treatments can lead patients with gender dysphoria (the medical term for the distress that can result when someone’s gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth) to “‘debilitating distress,’ ‘depression,’ ‘substance use,’ ‘self-injurious behaviors,’ and ‘even suicide.’” One <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm\">survey</a> referenced in the brief found that more than one-third of transgender high school students attempted suicide in the last 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This view, which presents gender-affirming treatments as a way to prevent suicide and alleviate the harms of gender dysphoria, is supported by briefs filed by medical and mental health groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323885/20240903123631640_23-477%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20American%20Psychological%20Association%20et%20al..pdf\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323885/20240903123631640_23-477%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20American%20Psychological%20Association%20et%20al..pdf\">American Psychological Association</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323964/20240903155151548_23-477%20tsac%20Brief%20of%20Amici%20Curiae%20AAP%20et%20al..pdf\">American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and the American Medical Association</a> — among other, similar professional organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/327730/20241008130915048_23-477%20Respondents%20Brief.pdf\">Tennessee’s brief</a>, meanwhile, presents a much more conspiratorial picture. At one point, for example, it claims that a transgender official within the Biden administration pressured the WPATH to issue inappropriately permissive guidelines on trans health care for physicians. At another point, it suggests that a major hospital in Tennessee started providing transgender health care because doing so would “make a lot of money” for the hospital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do Tennessee&#8217;s arguments meet the threshold of an “exceedingly persuasive justification”? It’s worth noting that the trial court which heard <em>Skrmetti</em>, the only court to closely examine the evidence on either side of the case, temporarily blocked Tennessee’s law during an early hearing in this case. Of course, it’s possible that a full trial will reveal that Tennessee&#8217;s more conspiratorial view of the facts is correct, but there’s good reason to be skeptical that all of the major professional organizations representing pediatricians, psychologists, trans health providers, and physicians generally are all engaged in a grand conspiracy to make more money by overmedicating transgender children.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There’s some chance the Court will hit pause on this case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is some chance that the Court will delay resolution of this case, although probably not for very long.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the lower courts, both the Biden administration and lawyers for a group of transgender plaintiffs argued the pro-trans position. After they lost in the appeals court, both the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/\">Justice Department</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/l-w-v-skrmetti/\">private plaintiffs</a> asked the justices to hear their case. Although these two petitions present similar questions, the Court decided only to grant the Justice Department’s request to hear the case — which is why the case is currently called <em>United States v. Skrmetti</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus far, the Court has taken no action on the private plaintiffs’ petition, which is known as <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/l-w-v-skrmetti/\"><em>L.W. v. Skrmetti</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ordinarily, the Court’s decision to grant one petition and not the other wouldn’t matter very much. But it is exceedingly likely that the Trump administration will reverse the Justice Department’s position on this case once it takes power in January and formally withdraw its request for the justices to hear this case. That means that if the justices want to hold on to the case past January, they will need to grant the <em>L.W.</em> petition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, none of these procedural maneuvers are likely to change much. It’s possible that the Court will delay oral arguments until all of this is resolved. But, if the justices want to resolve the issue presented by <em>Skrmetti</em>, there’s no reason why the Court can’t decide this case in its current term (which means a decision is likely in late June), regardless of how the procedural drama shakes out.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "It’s hard to imagine a worse time for the Supreme Court to hear United States v. Skrmetti, arguably the most important trans rights case the justices have ever heard. Skrmetti asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution, a question the Court has never answered. A decision against the trans plaintiffs in Skrmetti, [&#8230;]",

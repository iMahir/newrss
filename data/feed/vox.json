A <a href=\"https://x.com/DavidWright_7/status/1841327961506492463\">CNN poll</a> showed 51 percent thought Vance won and 49 percent thought Walz did (CNN didn’t offer the “tie” option).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scored purely on affect and debating technique — without regard to factual accuracy — Vance did a bit better. He stuck to his two-pronged strategy: first, to blame Kamala Harris for everything voters don’t like that has happened under the Biden administration; and second, to put a reasonable-seeming face on Trumpism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In doing so, though, Vance said many misleading or totally untrue things, such as that Donald Trump saved Obamacare, that immigrants caused the US housing crisis, and that Trump was merely peacefully discussing “problems” with the 2020 election rather than blatantly trying to steal that election from the rightful winner, Joe Biden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz’s performance was rockier, and while he had his moments — he spoke effectively about health care, abortion, and Trump’s threat to democracy — his answers were less disciplined and more scattershot. He seemed flatfooted <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/tim-walz-china-tiananmen-square/index.html\">by a question</a> regarding his past, reportedly untrue claims to have been in Hong Kong at the time of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 – not exactly the most important and pressing issue of the day, but something he probably should have prepared a better answer for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, on points, Vance may have won by a nose. But he did so in a way that is unlikely to matter very much, if at all, for the presidential contest. In general, vice presidential debates <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/elections/vp-debate-polls.html\">very rarely impact the polls</a>. And this particular debate lacked any breakout moment likely to dominate headlines for days in what’s become a very crowded October news environment (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/israel/375125/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-iran-invasion-gaza\">Middle East escalation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina\">Hurricane Helene</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/labor-jobs/375238/dock-workers-ila-usmx-shipping-supply-chain-economy-strike\">the port strike</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This debate almost certainly didn&#8217;t change the race — we may not even be talking about it for much longer — but there were some interesting moments that told us more about the candidates and the politics of 2024 as we head into the campaign’s final month.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner: JD Vance’s code-switching abilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Say what you will about JD Vance, but the man knows how to code-switch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When he attended Yale Law School and when he promoted his book <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, he knew <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/2/2/14404770/jd-vance-trump-hillbilly-elegy-ezra-klein-show\">how to sound appealing</a> to liberal elites. When he tried to cultivate the far right to win the Ohio Senate primary in 2022, he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">went all-out</a> saying absurd and offensive things (in a way that has hurt him this year, when his <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/29/nx-s1-5055616/jd-vance-childless-cat-lady-history\">remarks</a> about “childless cat ladies” resurfaced).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And on the debate stage Tuesday, he was laser-focused on sweet-talking swing voters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance didn’t engage in bomb-throwing; he wasn’t an attack dog or an edgelord. He assured viewers that he felt their pain and that their pain was all Kamala Harris’s fault. (He solved the problem of how to hold Harris responsible for Biden’s record by simply rebranding the Biden-Harris administration as the “Kamala Harris administration,” pretending she was in charge of everything all along.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When abortion came up, Vance — who <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/373485/project-2025-abortion-ban-trump-comstock-mifepristone\">said in 2022</a> that he “certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally” and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/\">said in 2023</a> that he wanted to prosecute people who sent abortion pills through the mail — took the unusual rhetorical tack of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-republicans-much-better-job-winning-back-trust-abortion-rcna173566\">admitting</a> the public didn’t trust the GOP on the issue and that he and his fellow Republicans needed to earn their trust. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For those worried about the whole “Trump tried for months to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden when he lost the election” thing? Well, let Vance set your mind at ease. Trump “peacefully gave over power on January 20th,” 2021, after all. Who cares what happened in the two months before that, anyway? The real threat to democracy, Vance claimed, was the “censorship” of Kamala Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That last pivot may have been a bit too smooth because when Walz asked Vance directly who won the 2020 election, Vance dodged again, claiming he was “focused on the future.” For anyone who remembers how Trump’s months-long campaign of lies helped cause the chaos of January 6, 2021, Vance’s answer will likely not be convincing. But this is a topic where he can only go so far to avoid angering the guy at the top of the ticket. —<em>Andrew Prokop</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Loser: The narrative that Tim Walz is a media phenomenon</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Kamala Harris suddenly became the Democratic presidential nominee and needed to perform an expedited running mate search, Walz stood out from the crowd of Democratic hopefuls by doing some compelling media appearances, including the one where he <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-walz-vp-weird-trump-gen-z-f9d718890c3ca907f42dba5934075382\">memorably dubbed </a>Republicans as “just weird.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This seemed to contrast with both Biden’s and Harris’s tendencies to be extremely cautious about doing unscripted press, and made some Democrats overjoyed that they had found a politician who was out there putting forward a message in the media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In retrospect, those strong Walz interviews were all with friendly interlocutors, not in the oppositional, high-stakes setting of a debate. Indeed, when the Harris camp vetted Walz for VP, he admitted that he was a “bad debater,” CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/tim-walz-inside-harris-vp-pick/index.html\">reported in August</a>. On Tuesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/democrats-worry-walz-vp-debate-00181732\">Politico reported</a> that Democrats were privately worried about how Walz would fare in the debate. And once the debate kicked off, some commentators watching it <a href=\"https://x.com/tyler_a_harper/status/1841300799428636805?s=46&amp;t=WDV3NvpmCLI-fO5R13Teug\">wondered</a> where the Tim Walz who was good on TV had gone. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz’s performance was not disastrous. Far from it. He seems to have come off just fine to viewers, <a href=\"https://x.com/kabir_here/status/1841321122442236140?s=61&amp;t=TQlk4x44ENcfSu3Y1ke6ew\">per CBS’s post-debate poll</a>, and he had several good moments. For instance, it was smart of him to ask Vance directly whether Biden won the 2020 election, and to call Vance’s dodge a “damning non-answer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was not exactly a masterful showing, though. Walz seemed uncomfortable in the format compared to the smooth-talking Vance, he didn’t really seem to have one overarching message that he kept returning to, and he often missed opportunities to call out Vance’s lies and misrepresentations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz’s answer on his own misrepresentation of his 1989 visit to Hong Kong — in which he talked about his Nebraska childhood for a while before concluding he “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/walz-debate-hong-kong-tiananmen-square.html\">misspoke</a>” — was genuinely bad. Fortunately for him, of all the issues that came up on the debate stage, that’s the one of least relevance to substantive issues affecting Americans today, and the least likely to affect voters’ decisions about whether to cast their ballots for Harris. —<em>AP</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner: Obamacare</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of Vance’s more remarkable lies of the night was this: Donald Trump saved Obamacare.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He said the law “was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden in health care costs” before the former president took office in 2017 and started loosening some of its rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think he can make a good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along,” the Republican vice presidential candidate said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Donald Trump supported <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed\">the Republican Congress’s effort to roll back most of Obamacare</a>, including undoing some of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/2/15523262/voxcare-republicans-preexisting-conditions\">the regulations for preexisting conditions</a> and making <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/9/15579654/medicaid-cuts-ahca\">major cuts to Medicaid</a>. It failed because of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/25/17782664/john-mccain-legacy-obamacare-repeal-thumbs-down\">John McCain</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump dramatically <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/8/16268572/trump-obamacare-navigators\">cut funding for enrollment outreach</a>. He tried to introduce <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/11/16877916/medicaid-work-requirements-trump-guidance\">Medicaid work requirements</a> for people covered by the ACA’s expansion (but was stopped by the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18263675/medicaid-work-requirements-lawsuit-donald-trump\">courts</a>). He deregulated <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/30/21275498/trump-obamacare-repeal-short-term-health-care-insurance-scam\">short-term insurance plans</a> that left people vulnerable to thousands of dollars in bills if they had a serious medical emergency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected, the ACA marketplaces <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?activeTab=graph&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;startTimeframe=10&amp;selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-states%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">covered</a> 12.7 million people. In 2020, when he lost the election to Joe Biden, they covered 11.4 million. After four years of Biden, 21.4 million Americans are getting their insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of its state counterparts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Voters have come to trust Democrats on health care <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-voters-views-of-health-policy-issues-in-context-of-presidential-campaigns/\">much more</a> over the years since the law Republicans tagged as “Obamacare” passed. More than 60 percent of Americans now say they <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&amp;aRange=twoYear\">like</a> the ACA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2010, Obamacare was <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/04/12/healthcare-vote-doomed-13-democrats-in-2010-elections\">the culprit</a> for the Democratic wipeout in Congress, but its political fortunes have turned dramatically. In 2018, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18070152/midterm-elections-2018-results-trump-obamacare-repeal\">won the House</a>, largely by running on a message that without a Democratic check, Trump’s myriad efforts to topple the law would succeed. Ever since, it has been a political asset for them against Republicans — forcing Vance to simply pretend that Trump’s health care record is different from what it is. —<em>Dylan Scott</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Loser: The moderators</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the start, Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, the CBS news moderators, made it clear they did not think it was their job to keep the candidates grounded in reality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact-check claims made by each other,” Brennan told viewers. And for the most part, the moderators allowed the candidates’ answers to go unchecked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The questions themselves were either not probing enough or poorly framed. When Brennan turned to Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign promise to build 3 million homes, for example, she confoundingly asked Walz <em>where </em>those homes would get built, not how. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And despite Trump’s continued election denial and Vance’s previous statements that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/10/vance-electors-2020-election-00178266\">he would not have certified</a> the 2020 election results, the moderators left questions about the fate of American democracy till the very end. One of the debate’s most memorable moments was when <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/375285/vp-debate-vance-walz-democracy-2020-who-won\">Vance wouldn’t answer Walz’s question</a> about whether Trump lost in 2020. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Viewers don’t have to look too far back to see how it is, in fact, possible to have good debate moderators. ABC News’ David Muir and Linsey Davis did a much better job moderating last month’s presidential debate. They fact-checked the candidates in real time — making it hard for even Trump to get away with lying — and pressed both Harris and Trump with tough questions. They also tried to avoid letting the candidates dodge questions entirely. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Luckily for O’Donnell and Brennan, they’re not going to stand out; they’re not the only debate moderators who have stumbled in the Trump era. The voters, on the other hand, are the unlucky ones.  —<em>Abdallah Fayyad</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner: A surprising amount of decency</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After nine years of increasingly toxic political discourse and six weeks of mud-slinging between the two No. 2s on the trail, it was reasonable to expect a nasty affair when Trump and Harris’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/jd-vance-trump-campaign-loyalty-e9ec0f58\">attack dogs</a> were unleashed on one another on the debate stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So it was a little shocking that Walz and Vance not only refrained from hurling personal attacks at one another, but even found common ground at many points. Midwest Nice prevailed: kind on the surface, followed by the occasional sting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Vance was criticizing Harris’s approach to the southern border, he seemed apologetic: “Tim, I agree with you,” Vance said. “I think you want to solve this problem, but I don&#8217;t think Kamala Harris does.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later on, the two would find comity over the effects of off-shoring and trade deficits. “Much of what the senator said, I am in agreement with him on,” Walz said. And after Walz mentioned his son had witnessed a shooting, Vance reacted sympathetically: “I didn&#8217;t know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting and I&#8217;m sorry about that. I want to say — Christ have mercy. It is awful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This seems to be the way the debate will be <a href=\"https://x.com/racheljanfaza/status/1841303036561326101\">remembered</a>, if at all. It made both candidates seem more normal, civil, and human than they had seemed before — a particular advantage for Vance, who came in needing to soften his image. It may have been strategic politeness, but it was notable in an era when so much politeness has been dispensed with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In snap polls of debate watchers, both Walz and Vance saw <a href=\"https://x.com/kabir_here/status/1841321122442236140\">increases in their favorability ratings</a>. Focus group respondents seem to be saying similar things. “I hadn’t seen a debate like this in a very long time,” one undecided Michigan voter told CNN’s Phil Mattingly. “They supported each other. They were kind. And it was warm and fuzzy — you could watch it without being offended.” —<em>Christian Paz</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

JD Vance at the vice presidential debate on October 1, 2024. | Michele Crowe/CBS via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the end of the vice presidential debate, Gov. Tim Walz asked Sen. JD Vance a pointed question: Did Donald Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/AccountableGOP/status/1841307376655253614\">lose the 2020 election</a>? Vance’s response: “Tim, I’m focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is a clear right answer&nbsp;— that the 2020 presidential election was in fact legitimate —&nbsp;and Vance refused to offer it. It was, as Walz immediately noted, “A damning non-answer,” one that showed viewers who JD Vance is and what he stands for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, every issue discussed earlier that night comes in second to the fundamental question of whether America’s democratic institutions deserve to endure. On that question, Vance truly is radical, and his exposure as such was the only truly important moment of the night.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many Republicans have embraced Trump’s lies about the last election. Some have done so reluctantly, but Vance has been enthusiastic. He has, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html\">fundraised for January 6 rioters</a> and said he would have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/05/vance-trump-upend-democracy/\">illegally thrown the 2020 election result to Congress</a> had he been in Mike Pence’s position at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what’s most distinctive about Vance is the degree to which he has paired 2020 conspiracy theories with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">a coterie of other anti-democratic positions and ideologies</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-host-abruptly-ends-interview-jd-vance-supreme-court-remarks-no-no-george\">a 2021 podcast interview</a>, Vance said that Trump should “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in the US government and “replace them with our people.” If the Supreme Court intervened, Vance suggested that Trump simply ignore the ruling and dare the Court to stop him. In the interview, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug\">he explicitly cited Curtis Yarvin</a> — a Silicon Valley blogger who advocates for overthrowing democracy and replacing it with a form of monarchy —&nbsp;as an influence on his views in this area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this should come as a surprise. Anti-democratic radicalism has been central to Vance’s political identity since he began running for Senate in Ohio, widely discussed since he was tapped to be Trump’s vice president earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet, it wasn’t central to the vice presidential debate tonight. The moderators left it until the very last minutes of the event, only coming up after <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-watch-vp-debate-2024/\">the debate was originally scheduled to end</a>. Despite democracy being at the core of the difference between the two candidates onstage&nbsp;— in fact, the core ideological difference between the two parties today — it was treated as an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In doing so, the moderators created an illusion of normalcy: allowing the two candidates to civilly discuss issues like housing and the deficit in a basically standard-politician manner, when in fact they disagree on an existential question about the nature of American government itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also worth dwelling on Vance’s attempt at deflection — the confusing line about Harris trying to “censor Americans from speaking their mind” on the Covid-19 pandemic — because I think it’s essential to understanding the ideological scaffolding of anti-democratic politics on the right today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are multiple theories on the right about how the Biden administration colluded with Big Tech to censor Americans, and it wasn&#8217;t exactly clear which particular one Vance was referencing. For present purposes, the details of the issue are less important than the ideological role they play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Vance and others like him, it is essential to do more than just insist that Trump was right in 2020 — to go the extra mile and say that Democrats are the true threat to democracy in America today. That argument, the claim that he and Trump are democracy’s real defenders, serves as justification for taking aggressive action to seize power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Vance proposed to “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in 2021, he didn’t sell it as a naked power grab. Rather, he positioned it as a kind of counter-offensive: a necessary response to the left’s alleged stranglehold over the “deep state” in Washington. The rallying cry of Trump’s campaign to overthrow the 2020 election wasn’t that democracy was illegitimate, but rather that Trump had been robbed of his authentic victory by Democratic cheating. Stop the steal!</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The argument that “Democrats are worse” does more than just legitimize power grabs. It also is a powerful disciplining tool for wavering Republicans, the kind that aren’t on board with Trump or Vance’s rough-and-tumble politics. If they waver or blanch, the response that Democrats are <em>more dangerous</em> helps bring them back onside — producing <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/national-reviews-biden-profile-is-anti-anti-trumpism-as-art.html\">the phenomenon known as anti-anti-Trumpism</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In just one moment, in short, the veneer of normalcy carefully built up over the past 90 minutes was punctured. Vance not only exposed the true center of his candidacy, but also some of the key ideological scaffolding underpinning the Republican Party’s turn into anti-democratic territory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was adapted from the On the Right newsletter.</em> <em>New editions drop every Wednesday.

On Tuesday, workers at 36 different ports stopped work after their six-year contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired — and depending on how long the work stoppage lasts, it could have a monumental impact on the US economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The strike affects some of the country’s biggest ports, like the<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977\"> Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. Overall, the affected ports handle about 50 percent of the imports and exports to the US. Though some of that cargo has been preemptively diverted to the West Coast, that isn’t a solution without complications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent days, it appeared as though USMX and ILA were moving forward with negotiations, with USMX requesting to extend the current contract to garner more negotiating time. ILA, though, refused the new proposal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">ILA president Harold Daggett warned Tuesday that the union was “prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the </strong>International Longshoremen’s Association? Why are its members <strong>striking?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ILA represents the approximately 45,000 workers who manage the unloading of massive shipping containers from large cargo ships. Eventually, inventory from the ships makes its way to warehouses, store shelves, and factories. The members work at ports up and down the East Coast as far north as Maine, as well as Gulf Coast ports in Louisiana and Texas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s a strike over two main issues,” Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. “One is money. Two is technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The union has demanded a significant pay raise for dock workers over the six-year life of the contract, as well as increased contributions to their retirement plan and a say in the role of automation in their industry. Some reports indicate the union asked for as much <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000\">as a 77 percent pay increase</a>; the most recent proposal from USMX offered a 50 percent increase over the life of the contract.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The biggest concern is, the dock workers do not want automated machines to be responsible for picking up, dropping off, and releasing the cargo automatically,” Wheaton said. “They would like to have a human operator there” to ensure the quality and safety of their operations — and job security. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Negotiations between USMX and ILA for a new contract stopped in June, reportedly over the use of <a href=\"https://mynbc15.com/news/local/hundreds-of-mobile-dockworkers-set-to-go-on-strike\">automation at a port in Mobile, Alabama</a>. USMX filed a complaint with the National Labor Review Board last week claiming that ILA refused to continue with contract negotiations. USMX did not respond to Vox’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shipping companies that compose USMX — all of which are based abroad — have made billions as global trade and shipping has boomed, the union argues, while worker wages have stagnated in the face of inflation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dock workers on the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/economy/port-strike-economy.html\">West Coast make about $55 per hour compared</a> with the East and Gulf Coast <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/business/us-port-workers-strike-tuesday/index.html\">average of $39 per hour</a> for experienced workers. West Coast dockworkers received an impressive <a href=\"https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract\">wage increase</a> in their most recent contract<a href=\"https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract\">;</a> they belong to a different union, the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which has long been much more radical than the ILA in terms of its politics, demands, and tactics, according to Gabe Winant, a labor historian at the University of Chicago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the ILWU workers’ big wage wins proved that it was possible to demand more — and get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the ILA hopes to achieve a similar victory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which goods will be impacted?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More than 50 percent of all goods <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/\">imported into the US using container ships</a> come in through the East and Gulf Coast ports, and nearly 70 percent of containerized exports leave through them. In the immediate term, there should be few shortages or price increases on most consumer goods; many companies have made preparations for the strike. But depending how long the strike continues, some perishable items might be more expensive or difficult to come by.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have all these perishable goods coming imported [to] the East Coast,” like blueberries, bananas, and fish from South America, Chris Tang, a professor of supply chain management at UCLA, told Vox. “We also have apparel, toys, electronics, we import through the East Coast.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The automotive industry is also likely to be impacted, as many cars and car parts are imported from Europe. “There’s still some inventories available in the car manufacturing, and as well as the car dealers, so in the short term, it is not a major impact,” Tang said. But if the strike goes on for weeks, that inventory will run out, and car repairs could become more challenging as parts shipments are delayed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the strike, there are other factors affecting global shipping at the moment, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/24113479/what-the-red-sea-ship-attacks-are-really-about\">Houthi attacks in the Red Sea</a> that have disrupted shipping since November of last year, as has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene\">extreme weather</a>. The Panama Canal has also been impacted independent of the strikes; the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html\">waterway is suffering from a drought</a>, which has created a shipping backlog there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As anyone who tried to buy toilet paper during the pandemic can tell you, we have a delicate supply chain, and when you start messing with the cargo ships, the rail, and the semi trucks, you&#8217;re toast,” Wheaton said. “You just aren&#8217;t going to get anything moved. Add to that that you just had a huge chunk of the East Coast get buried in water from the hurricane that just went through.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, consumers shouldn’t worry too much about goods becoming scarce. For now, Tang cautions people not to hoard products for fear that they’ll be absent from US shelves; that will create shortages and drive up prices independent of the strike.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How might the dockworker’s strike end?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What happens with the strike largely depends on how quickly the ILA and USMX can come to an agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Federal law gives Congress and the president the power to break strikes in certain circumstances. In this case, President Joe Biden could order dockworkers back to the ports for 80 days as USMX and the ILA continue contract negotiations through powers granted by the Taft-Hartley Act, but <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839\">he doesn’t want to do so</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tang cautions that could change the longer the strike goes on, given it could continue till the presidential election. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration will face “pressure from the consumers, from the retailers, from the manufacturers, and also the shipping companies” to take action and reopen the ports, Tang said. Some business groups are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839\">already calling on Biden</a> to send ILA members back to work. But Biden has also been largely supportive of union action, save the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/29/23484623/congress-rail-strike-biden-sick-days\">2022 railway workers strike</a>, and a number of unions are helping with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/372935/teamsters-union-harris-biden-uaw-labor-trump-endorsement-vote\">Vice President Harris’s campaign</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think that right now, President Biden is under large pressure,” Tang said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ideally, the administration won’t have to act, with ILA and USMX coming to an agreement either on their own or with US officials assisting with negotiations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The official policy of the government for more than 100 years, that the best solution is a negotiated solution,” Wheaton said. “The union won&#8217;t get everything they want, management won&#8217;t get everything they want, but you sit at the bargaining table to see what both sides can live with.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

What, if anything, did his former romantic partners, including Jennifer Lopez, know? If there are tapes, what’s on them?&nbsp;Why do people keep talking about Justin Bieber?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not a stretch to draw parallels between Combs’s case and that of notorious sex offender <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/7/20685023/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-arrested-minor-sex-trafficking-charges\">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. Copious amounts of money, a long list of powerful friends, and a culture of celebrity silence make for a potent combination that, as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/14/20803950/jeffrey-epstein-conspiracy-theories-clinton-trump-acosta\">Anna has written</a>, is “tailor-made to produce conspiracy theories.” In the wake of the arrest, amateur internet sleuths have surfaced numerous videos and photos and pored over interviews with Diddy and his&nbsp;celebrity associates in search of answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the allegations against Combs continue to pile up. After several civil lawsuits were filed against Combs late last year, another woman came forward in late September<strong> </strong>to allege <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sean-combs-diddy-lawsuit-1e2b124ba85ebf1b4f1e93c8692aab4b\">in a 26-page civil suit</a> that Combs and his bodyguard took her to the recording studio for his record label, Bad Boy, in 2001, raped her repeatedly, and recorded the assault.  After putting out a call for additional victims — and netting more than 3,000 responses — lawyers announced on October 1 that they would be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/10/01/diddy-sexual-assault-lawsuit-victims-tony-buzbee/\">filing 120 additional civil lawsuits</a> against Combs and several codefendants in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami in the following weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As court filings become public, they promise to unfurl a whole new set of allegations against Combs and offer new details on previously unknown accusations going back decades. The sheer scope of the cases and inclusion of codefendants, plus allegations that Combs used his entertainment business to lure victims, could turn Combs’s case into one of the biggest Me Too reckonings the music industry has seen.<strong>   </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through his lawyers, Diddy has repeatedly asserted that the civil claims against him are baseless, calling several of them “sickening allegations” made “by individuals looking for a quick payday.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case, too, and is currently being held in a Brooklyn jail after twice being denied bail. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has said the rapper is “going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might,” and during a court hearing argued that the so-called freak-offs — marathon sexual productions that prosecutors say involved hired sex workers and women coerced to perform sexual acts for the gratification of Combs and others — were consensual, if unconventional.&nbsp;“Is it sex trafficking?” he asked in court last week. “No, not if everybody wants to be there.” &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With so many players, civil and criminal cases, and plenty of misinformation floating around, we’re pulling together some of the most frequently asked questions about Diddy and trying to answer them — as best we can, of course, given what we know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a more detailed history of all the allegations against Diddy, check out Anna’s full explainer <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Combs accused of?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Combs is facing two kinds of cases: one criminal case brought by the federal government and several civil cases brought by individuals, each involving different accusations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Combs was arrested on criminal charges; the government alleges that he used his business enterprise to conduct criminal activity, including sex trafficking and kidnapping, and then used his power to intimidate victims and cover up the crimes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The case centers on the alleged performances with women and sex workers. The indictment alleges that Diddy often transported sex workers to perform in the sessions and taped the encounters to coerce silence from participants, using an array of employees and his business organization to facilitate the criminal activity. For all of this, they’ve charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-r-kelly-keith-raniere-prosecutions.html\">a powerful charge</a> that was originally used largely to prosecute organized crime leaders and can result in a hefty sentence.&nbsp;<br><br>It was the civil cases, however, that opened the floodgates that ultimately led to the indictment.<br><br>In November 2023, Combs’s ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, also known as the singer Cassie, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit\">filed the first explosive lawsuit</a> that exposed several allegations against Combs to the public, including that the rapper orchestrated the performances with sex workers and forced her to participate. Though she filed a civil case (which was settled by Combs within one day), Ventura’s allegations appear to be the central foundation of the federal criminal case against Combs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Four other cases were filed shortly thereafter, three by women who alleged that he raped them (in some cases drugging them), and one by a male music producer who accused Diddy of grooming him and coercing him to hire sex workers for sex. <br><br>After Combs’s arrest, a team of lawyers led by the law firms of Tony Buzbee and Andrew Van Arsdale put out a call looking for other potential victims, and announced that they would be proceeding with 120 additional civil lawsuits that would be filed in the weeks to come. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>If so many people were involved, why did it take so long for the allegations to come out?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Combs was incredibly powerful in the music industry and in American culture more generally. ​​&nbsp; He was one of the first people to blend the worlds of hip-hop, business, and luxury. His fashion label, Sean John, founded in 1998, became <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/sean-combs-puff-daddy-p-diddy-i-am-fashion\">known for high-end menswear</a>. He promoted brands of vodka and tequila and hosted exclusive <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/diddy-white-party-turns-20-pictures-hamptons-8342051/\">white parties</a> in the Hamptons with guests like Martha Stewart, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, and Jay Z.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s difficult for people to speak out about sexual assault under any circumstances, and doubly difficult when the alleged perpetrator is someone wealthy and well-connected who may have influence over their careers. Combs is also accused of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html\">running an enormous criminal “enterprise”</a> that threatened women with blackmail and violence — including using firearms to threaten victims — all of which would have made it even more difficult for anyone to come forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s on the tapes mentioned in the indictment? Will they ever come out?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several of the accusers, and the criminal indictment, allege that Diddy videotaped sexual assaults and the performances with sex workers. The accuser this week alleges that a tape made of her sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sean-diddy-combs-accuser-drugged-bound-rape-lawsuit-1235109972/\">was sold</a> and viewed by several other men.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Generally, accusers have said any tapes served as a way to ensure their silence. In court, the New York Times reported, prosecutors presented <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html\">a statement from one</a> who said, “He just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said he would expose me, mind you these sex tapes where I am heavily drugged.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why is everyone talking about baby oil? Is this real?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the odder details in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/8a5e00b3-6871-456f-b787-736298a5c2d7.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_6\">the Combs indictment</a> is that authorities say they seized “more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant” in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/entertainment/sean-combs-home-search/index.html\">searches of the mogul’s residences</a> in Miami and Los Angeles earlier this year. Prosecutors say the oil was meant for the performances, and Ventura also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html\">said in her lawsuit</a> that she was told to pour “excessive” amounts of oil on herself at these events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Possessing baby oil is not a crime, and the whole oil issue doesn’t matter very much in the context of the violent and disturbing conduct of which Combs has been accused. But a federal indictment of a public figure like Combs is meant to be read, and it’s not unusual for prosecutors to include details they know will shock people and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html\">make headlines</a>. Baby oil did the trick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are other celebrities connected to the case?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s important to note that no other person, celebrity or not, has been indicted alongside Combs in the criminal case. The civil cases filed so far<strong> </strong>do not mention any other celebrities either, accusing only Combs and occasionally those employed by him.  <br><br>But with the announcement on October 1 of the additional 120 civil lawsuits, lawyers told the media that the cases would include a number of codefendants. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/10/01/diddy-sexual-assault-lawsuit-victims-tony-buzbee/\">According to the Washington Post, </a>they claimed that those codefendants would include “members of Combs’s family, record labels, event venues and Combs’s associates,”  and that the list would include “household names.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, this is an incredibly tough question, tending to spark more rumor and innuendo than uncover any truths, as onlookers try to determine who knew what when. Indeed, Combs had many friends in high places. But pursuing the question tends to spawn misinformation, like a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/viral-justin-bieber-song-about-diddy-party-likely-ai/\">viral song about “a Diddy party”</a> attributed to Justin Bieber that experts now say was likely created by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far, a few bold-faced names who were on the guest lists at Combs’s celeb-packed “<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/09/23/celebrity-news/inside-sean-diddy-combs-wild-parties-leonardo-dicaprio-sarah-jessica-parker-j-lo-more-spotted-in-resurfaced-pics/\">white parties</a>” have <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/what-celebs-have-said-about-diddys-infamous-parties/\">come forward to say they</a> were in no way connected to any of the crimes Combs is accused of. But it’s best if we all give the conspiracy theories a rest, wait for legal filings to learn more, and let the case be handled in court. Wild speculation is only liable to exacerbate the victims’ pain.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What will happen to Combs’s businesses and brands now?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the weeks before Ventura’s lawsuit went public last November, Diddy made several media-grabbing moves, including donating $1 million to Howard University, performing and collecting a Global Icon Award at the VMAs, and throwing a high-profile birthday party for himself in London with Naomi Campbell and Idris Elba among the guests.<br><br>So much has since crumbled, not the least of which is his business empire. Diageo, the beverage brand with which Combs once partnered on vodka and tequila, quickly removed his image from its website, and the partnership broke ties after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/diddy-diageo-tequila-deleon-ciroc-3b554f9d03e007139484a6c7e0cf5bd4\">settling a lawsuit</a> over another matter this January. Capital Preparatory Schools, a New York charter school network Combs helped expand, posted a statement on the school’s website last fall saying it was cutting ties with him (though the statement was later removed). Combs also stepped aside as chair of Revolt, a TV network he helped start in 2013, and then officially <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-sell-stake-revolt.html\">sold his stake</a> this summer.

Israel has recently escalated its attacks on Hezbollah, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group\">assassinating the group’s reclusive leader</a>, Hassan Nasrallah, in a bombing in a Beirut suburb on Friday after reportedly launching a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza\">series of attacks on thousands of mobile devices</a> used by members of Hezbollah throughout Lebanon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel’s latest operations have been costly: More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest\">1,000 Lebanese have been killed, 6,000 wounded</a>, and as many as a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o\">million displaced</a> in recent weeks, according to Lebanese government officials. Hezbollah’s recent attacks on Israel — largely missile strikes — have meanwhile left at least <a href=\"https://www.jns.org/idf-probing-cause-of-sirens-in-central-israel/\">eight</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv\">people</a> wounded in the last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the two sides have fought on and off over the decades, Hezbollah has been engaged in more intense fighting with Israel since the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas last year. Hezbollah has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas/here-are-the-latest-developments-on-strikes-in-lebanon?smid=url-share\">continue its missile strikes</a> into Israeli territory until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza, where at least <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/\">40,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. Israel has shown no sign it is contemplating ending its operations, either. The country’s leaders have said they want to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/352059/why-israel-cant-destroy-hamas\">completely eradicate Hamas</a>, and Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon\">defense minister said Monday</a> that the “next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Key allies also seem unable to end the fighting. The United States reportedly had a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html\">Hezbollah-Israel peace plan that it has now abandoned</a>. While the US has publicly told Israel it should try to deescalate the situation, the US <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797\">reportedly privately offered Israel support</a> for its Hezbollah strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Iranian officials have responded to Israel’s recent attacks with a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-launched-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-rcna173434\">ballistic missile strike</a> on Tuesday. Iran’s mission to the UN suggested the country did not have further attacks in store, <a href=\"https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106\">writing on X</a> that the country’s “response … has been duly carried out,” though it added the threat: “Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here is what we do know so far about what has happened, and what’s likely to come next.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The animosity between Hezbollah and Israel is decades old; in fact, Hezbollah formed in <a href=\"https://merip.org/1982/09/the-war-in-lebanon/\">1982 in southern Lebanon</a> as a response to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/6/4/a-cosmic-stink-israels-invasion-of-lebanon-40-years-on\">Israel’</a>s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/\">disastrous invasion</a>, which killed tens of thousands of Lebanese, and subsequent decades-long occupation of that area. Hezbollah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/24/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon\">waged guerilla warfare against Israeli troops for decades</a>, and Israel finally left in 2000 following years of brutal fighting and a UN resolution requiring it to do so. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The two sides settled into a conflict that simmered until 2006. After Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two others, Israel responded with a counterattack that led to a short, bloody war in which <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/echoes-of-2006-israel-hezbollah-and-the-potential-for-regional-war/\">more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis were killed</a>.<strong> </strong>A UN-brokered ceasefire ended that conflict, but fighting continued for years — and it intensified again in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, and, starting on October 8, 2023, began firing major salvos into northern Israel, eventually displacing around <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo\">60,000 residents there</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Initially, with Israel focused on uprooting Hamas in Gaza, fighting along its northern border with Lebanon was limited to tit-for-tat strikes. But starting in September, Israel escalated the fighting significantly, first by attacking Hezbollah members and leadership with exploding electronics, then bombing Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon and the outskirts of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ever since the October 7 attack, observers have warned about the possibility that Israel’s war with Gaza might spread to encompass Hezbollah and, perhaps, the entire region. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear if that’s what’s happening now or what a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah might look like. Despite Hezbollah’s previous ability to stand up to Israeli firepower, it’s also not clear how it will fare with its communication networks disrupted by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon\">the recent pager and walkie-talkie attacks</a> — which Israel has not claimed but is widely assumed to be behind. What’s more, a significant number of mid-level and senior Hezbollah leaders were killed in that attack and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/israel/373428/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-hamas-gaza\">subsequent bombings</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What might Hezbollah’s next move be?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the Middle East. It boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained\">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. Israel <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollahs-tunnels-flexible-command-weather-israels-deadly-blows-2024-09-25/\">claims to have destroyed thousands of the group’s rockets and shells</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/natan-sachs/\">Natan Sachs</a>, director of the Middle East policy program at the Brookings Institution, says Israel may have destroyed some of Hezbollah’s precision munitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Hezbollah has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on\">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/\">digital espionage</a>. And recent Israeli attacks on Lebanese mobile devices and the assassination of Nasrallah haven’t completely wiped out that capacity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There was kind of this gleefulness about Hezbollah being completely disabled and destroyed now because all the leadership’s gone,” said <a href=\"https://x.com/phillipsmyth?lang=en\">Phillip Smyth</a>, an independent analyst focusing on the Middle East and terrorism. “That’s not how it works.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the success of recent Israeli attacks has called into question the extent of Hezbollah’s capabilities — and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html\">reportedly shaken Iranian leadership</a>. In that sense, Hezbollah may have limited options going forward, even though it had previously pledged not to relent until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Hezbollah turns out to be less capable, militarily, than I expected,” <a href=\"https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/\">Thanassis Cambanis</a>, a senior fellow and director of the think tank Century International, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cambanis and other experts believed that Hezbollah had the technology to effectively strike military targets in Israel, as well as civilian infrastructure in Haifa and even Tel Aviv, a major population center. But if it was willing and able, it seems it would have done so by now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It turns out that Hezbollah wasn’t willing to use its most powerful military options, or that it couldn’t because Israel was able to infiltrate or neutralize Hezbollah capabilities,” Cambanis said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The group’s second-in-command, Naim Qassem, sought to dispel doubts about Hezbollah’s capabilities in a speech on Monday, though he also seemed to suggest Hezbollah is currently on the defensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Israel was not able to reach our military capabilities, and what its media says about hitting most of the medium and long-range capabilities is a dream they have not achieved and will never achieve,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ\">Qassem said</a>. “We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He added that an announcement will be <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-says-choose-nasrallahs-successor-at-earliest-opportunity\">made in the coming days</a> about Nasrallah’s successor, who Smyth said will most likely be <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822451\">Hashem Safieddine</a>, Nasrallah’s handpicked heir and cousin. Safieddine currently oversees&nbsp; Hezbollah’s political affairs and sits on the council managing the group’s military operations.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Iran’s role here?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tuesday’s missile barrage is Iran’s most escalatory move since April, when the regime sent around 300 missiles and rockets toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted by US and regional partner forces, as well as Israel’s own air defenses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, Iran asserts its regional power and carries out foreign policy goals —&nbsp;primarily, antagonizing Israel —&nbsp;by funding and providing resources to a network of militia groups. Those include Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, Hezbollah.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/14/23917078/israel-hamas-war-gaza-iran-hezbollah-khamenei-lebanon\">told Vox</a> last October.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, while NATO allies pledge to defend one another from attacks, Iran has been reluctant to be actively involved in a war against Israel; a drone attack on Israeli territory in April, following the assassination of an Iranian military leader in an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, was obviously telegraphed and minimally destructive. And the July assassination of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779\">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the former Hamas leader, while he was in Tehran prompted no obvious retaliation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not to say that Iran has no appetite for conflict: “The appetite for them was quite high, to be perfectly frank,” Smyth said.&nbsp;“They just thought that they could micromanage this so that it wouldn’t get to this point. And the Israelis clearly called their bluff.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, it seems, Iran has offered a show of force — but there are limits to how far the country will go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Escalation could come, but [the Iranians] need to thread a needle,” Sachs said. That involves trying to show solidarity with Hezbollah and that Iran is capable of attack, without getting into an extended war with both Israel and the US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Israel’s Lebanon campaign a prelude to a larger ground invasion?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel’s plan for its “limited” ground invasion involves rooting out Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel to neutralize the threat to Israeli communities nearby, the <a href=\"https://wapo.st/3XO98KS\">Washington Post reported</a>. So far, the Israeli military <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share\">said</a> it has conducted “limited, localized and targeted raids” along the border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s a fear that Israel’s narrow mission could balloon into something bigger — much as it already has in Gaza, where Israel’s stated operational objective of eliminating Hamas has given way to widespread destruction of civilian life. If the conflict with Hezbollah does grow, that would likely spur fierce Lebanese resistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“An invasion of Lebanon will mobilize Lebanese as a national issue to resist, including the many Lebanese who don’t support Israel but also oppose another Israeli invasion and occupation,” Cambanis said. “Perhaps in the short term Israel can achieve some of its aims by pursuing the logic of total war, but it will only make Israel and the entire Middle East less safe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Lebanese government —&nbsp;or what passes for it, since an unelected caretaker government has been in place since 2022 — has clearly demonstrated that the country is not interested in yet another war with Israel. Caretaker <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-hold-session-elect-president-after-ceasefire-caretaker-pm-says-2024-09-30/\">Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced Monday</a> that his government is prepared to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war. That resolution would deploy the Lebanese army to the country’s south to crack down on Hezbollah and require Israel to pull out of southern Lebanon. Now that Israel has entered Lebanon, it’s unclear whether Mikati will trigger the resolution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The conflict has already taken a significant toll on Lebanese civilians and it could only get worse from here. In anticipation, Lebanon and the United Nations petitioned for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/23dd80ed-e9dd-5ee3-a552-622fbac870f6?smid=url-share\">$426 million</a> in humanitarian aid on Tuesday to help those affected in the next three months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lebanon has already struggled under decades of war and government dysfunction, as well as an influx of Syrian refugees that have stretched already-limited state capacity. Now, Israel’s bombing attacks and invasion have displaced around 1 million Lebanese from the south of the country, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o\">according to Mikati</a>, and the Lebanese government says <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-30-2024-83ea5f243688f309754ec74850de4238\">at least 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s next for the Gaza-Hezbollah-Israel conflict overall?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There seems to be no end in sight for the widening conflict, for several reasons: US unwillingness to restrain Israel by restricting weapons shipments; Hezbollah’s stated position that they will not stop attacks on Israel until a ceasefire with Gaza is reached; and the repeated breakdown of Gaza ceasefire talks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US and France did attempt to negotiate a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/lebanon-temporary-ceasefire-plan-hezbollah-israel\">21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel last week</a>, but “Israel (Netanyahu) has flat out rejected the US-French 21 day ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,” <a href=\"https://history.stanford.edu/people/joel-beinin\">Joel Beinin</a>, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University, said. As Hezbollah also frames its attacks as support for Gaza, it most likely won’t agree to a ceasefire as long as Gaza is still under attack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for the US, there seems to be almost no effort to truly restrain Israel following the failed ceasefire attempt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The United States is just not driving events,” <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/michael-wahid-hanna\">Michael Hanna</a>, director of the US program at the International Crisis Group, said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups. Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis. And ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” a spokesperson from the National Security Council told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US could, however, do more to deter escalation; <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/in-the-news/bernie-sanders-preparing-resolutions-to-block-20b-in-us-arms-sales-to-israel/\">Sen. Bernie Sanders </a>(I-VT) has introduced <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-resolution-forces-vote-arms-sales-israel-gaza_n_66f5b5a4e4b0b663235fb66d\">a resolution to block arms sales to Israel</a>, on the premise that the arms transfers violate international law, although that is unlikely to pass in Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although Lebanon is the current site of the crisis, Israeli military operations are ongoing in Gaza, where <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240711-more-than-186-000-dead-in-gaza-how-credible-are-the-estimates-published-on-the-lancet\">as many as 186,000 people may have been killed in the past year of fighting</a>, according to the Lancet, a medical journal. (Many media sources put that figure at 40,000, but an accurate count is difficult given that much of Gaza is destroyed and fighting is ongoing.) Medical infrastructure has been destroyed, and there are many reported instances of communicable disease and malnutrition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People are getting killed in Gaza daily, the humanitarian situation is dire,” Hanna said. “Life is disrupted and on hold — there are no schools, there’s no functioning society. There’s nothing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel appears to be emboldened by its victories, and Hezbollah appears reluctant to launch large-scale attacks on Israel. The US has maintained its support for Israel and is sending <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1\">more troops to the region</a>. Iran has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392\">issued some threats</a>, but hasn’t yet been much of an active participant in the fighting. All that makes it impossible to say where the war goes from here. Cambanis, however, predicts the worst.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s a dangerous and delusional march to war on Iran,” he said. “I would have liked to rely on the US government to restrain Israel, but it’s clear that the Biden administration supports Israel’s widening gyre of escalation.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — faced off Tuesday night in the first and only scheduled vice presidential debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. The stakes are high.

Vance and Walz will be onstage to talk up their candidate — and run down the other party’s. Vance has spent months hitting Vice President Kamala Harris on her record on the border and immigration. Walz, meanwhile, has hit Vance and former President Donald Trump on their opposition to reproductive rights, tying them to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">highly unpopular Project 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Follow here for the latest news news, analysis, and explainers, and sign up for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/the-election-explained-politics-newsletter\"><strong>The election, explained</strong>,</a> our pop-up newsletter about the 2024 race.</p>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/375316/vp-debate-vance-walz-abortion-health-care\">How Vance made radical Trumpism sound moderate</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/375299/vp-debate-vance-walz-winners-losers-analysis\">3 winners and 2 losers from the Walz-Vance debate</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/375285/vp-debate-vance-walz-democracy-2020-who-won\">The only moment from the VP debate that mattered</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/373954/tim-walz-piglet-factory-farming-climate\">The ugly reality behind Tim Walz’s farm-friendly image</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/368150/tim-walz-dnc-speech-accept-nomination\">Tim Walz’s DNC speech used Midwestern dad energy to sell a liberal agenda</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/366201/tim-walz-record-governor-progressive-agenda\">Is Tim Walz a progressive or a centrist — or both?</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/366195/jd-vance-tim-vance-military-record-national-guard\">How to think about the attacks on Tim Walz’s military record</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/365535/tim-walz-minneapolis-burning-riot-george-floyd-minnesota-2020-protest\">How Tim Walz actually handled the George Floyd protests in Minnesota</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/363473/jd-vance-weird-voting-parents-demeny-postliberalism\">Where J.D.

If you are local to the areas impacted by Helene, connect with established local or national charitable organizations to ensure you’re donating exactly what is needed and in the necessary quantities (usually in bulk).

(The true total could be modestly different, as some birds could’ve survived damages, and some barns could’ve been temporarily empty, as companies clear them out for a few weeks between flocks.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the nation’s largest poultry companies — including <a href=\"https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/article/15704638/us-poultry-industry-harshly-hit-by-hurricane-helene\">Aviagen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-30/hurricane-helene-halts-poultry-plants-damages-pecan-trees\">Pilgrim’s Pride</a> and <a href=\"https://www.porkbusiness.com/news/industry/hurricane-helene-shutters-poultry-plants-smithfield-did-not-suffer-material\">Wayne-Sanderson Farms</a> — suspended operations at their local facilities due to power outages in recent days. A spokesperson for Clemson University&#8217;s agriculture program told Vox that while this is a fluid situation and it is still evaluating the hurricane’s damages, 45,000 chickens died at one South Carolina poultry operation due to generator failure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Virtually all chickens raised for meat in the US are confined in these sprawling warehouses, which bear no resemblance to the small barns of America’s agricultural past. These factory farm operations often have at least several sheds, housing hundreds of thousands of birds on one site at the same time. If enough facilities are compromised during a natural disaster like Hurricane Helene, millions of animals can perish, their last moments likely frightening and painful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their deaths also threaten the economic health of farmers and the poultry industry. Georgia’s agriculture commissioner, Tyler Harper, has <a href=\"https://agr.georgia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-response/9-29-24-hurricane-helene-emergency-appropriations-letter.pdf\">requested</a> immediate federal relief for the state’s agricultural sector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When hurricanes strike factory farms, they can also flush untold amounts of animal manure into groundwater or rivers and streams, exacerbating the challenges that governments and their residents face in the wake of pounding storms.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/7Xyjx-factory-farm-animals-release-nearly-1-trillion-pounds-of-manure-annually-that-s-twice-as-much-as-humans-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.604058897911,100,64.791882204178\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hurricane Helene is the latest — but not the first — striking, high-stakes example of how our factory farming system imposes tremendous cruelty onto animals and also imperils human health. The industry has no reason to change, even after a catastrophe like this, because taxpayers cover much of the economic loss meat companies incur from natural disasters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How taxpayers subsidize factory farming’s risks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is far from the first time a hurricane has torn through the Southeast’s poultry industry. It’s happened multiple times over the last quarter-century, a period in which Big Ag has only <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/research/innovative-ewg-study-uses-ai-find-357m-poultry-north-carolinas-factory-farms\">doubled down</a> on building more, and bigger, factory farms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1999, Hurricane Floyd put much of eastern North Carolina underwater, killing an <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/ilm/floyd\">estimated</a> 2.4 million chickens, 100,000 pigs, and half a million turkeys. North Carolina pig farms store the animals’ waste in giant manure “lagoons,” and several <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/22/650698240/hurricane-s-aftermath-floods-hog-lagoons-in-north-carolina#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20flooding%20from%20Hurricane,to%20The%20New%20York%20Times.&amp;text=Hurricane%20Floyd%20forced%20North%20Carolina%20to%20make%20changes.\">overflowed</a> during Floyd, sending toxic sludge containing bacteria and viruses (including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/29/17517906/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-over\">E. coli</a>) into waterways and drinking water, <a href=\"https://climate.ncsu.edu/blog/2019/09/farmers-felt-floyds-full-force-beginning-in-onslow-county/\">according</a> to the state’s climate office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chicken factory farms store manure in giant pits or as large mounds, creating a similar pollution risk as hog farms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2016/10/25/post-matthew-water-how-bad-is-it/\">Hurricane Matthew</a> in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina\">Hurricane Florence</a> in 2018 also caused devastation in North Carolina, killing millions of chickens and thousands of pigs, both of which caused damage to some manure lagoons, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina\">“fecal soup”</a> discharge. Later the same year, Hurricane Michael <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220212232153/http://agr.georgia.gov/hurricane-michael-devastates-georgias-agricultural-industry.aspx\">destroyed</a> over 80 chicken barns in Georgia that housed more than 2 million chickens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Manure can seep into groundwater and contaminate private wells that many rural communities rely on for drinking water, a perennial concern <a href=\"https://hazards.colorado.edu/article/hogs-and-hurricanes-while-flood-water-recedes-animal-waste-pollution-doesn-t\">heightened</a> after major storms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1037412200.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729273205801,100,78.541453588399\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A flooded hog farm in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/WAM7693.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.669135487166,100,78.661729025667\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Farmed chickens died in the flooding in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite that history, the poultry and pork industries haven’t done much to mitigate the risks posed by natural disasters by, say, raising fewer animals on their farms or making major changes to how they manage the enormous amounts of manure their animals generate. That’s because US taxpayers bear much of the cost, both for the environmental cleanup and the dead chickens and pigs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When natural disasters hit a typical chicken farm, the meat company — which technically owns the chickens, not the farmer — receives <a href=\"https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/2024/fsa_lip_livestock_3_2024.pdf\">$3 per mature bird</a> from the US Department of Agriculture, about 75 percent of the bird’s market value. The farmer that supplies to the meatpacker receives just 33 cents per bird.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many chicken farmers, most of whom raise birds on a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23207301/costco-rotisserie-chicken-poultry-farming-inflation\">contract basis</a> for meat companies, are already toiling in precarious economic conditions. Hurricanes and other natural disasters can make it much worse.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The federal government also reimburses economic losses from other severe weather, like heat waves and cold snaps, and disease outbreaks. Over the last two years, a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu — known as H5N1 — has resulted in the death of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html\">more than 100 million</a> poultry birds, and the federal government has given well over <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.com/usda-has-spent-usd1-billion-fighting-bird-flu-8424034#:~:text=Since%20bird%20flu%20outbreaks%20began,Health%20Inspection%20Service%20on%20Monday.\">$1 billion</a> to the poultry industry, much of it going to the largest companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Livestock production is both a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf\">leading driver of climate change</a> and, as Hurricane Helene demonstrates, a victim of it. As global warming increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, policymakers should question the factory farming model. Instead, as a recent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">federal accounting</a> of the US agricultural system shows, we’re doubling down on it, raising more and more animals on bigger and bigger farms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In addition to all the environmental problems associated with the factory farm model, and the public health problems that it causes, at the end of the day the extreme concentration of animals is just a fundamental vulnerability,” said Chris Hunt, deputy director of the nonprofit Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “It’s a vulnerability to unexpected shocks to the system … The fact that poultry is not only concentrated on [factory farms], but is also concentrated geographically, is certainly problematic.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Hurricane Helene, the Category 4 storm that slammed the American Southeast over the weekend, has killed more than 110 people — and likely millions of chickens. Almost half of the more than 9 billion chickens farmed for meat in the US, known as “broiler” chickens, are raised and slaughtered in the region. Georgia is the [&#8230;]",

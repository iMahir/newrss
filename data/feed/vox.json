One failure mode looks like <a href=\"https://x.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1804475281836499178\">this graph</a>, famously made by Auke Hoekstra <a href=\"https://maartensteinbuch.com/2017/06/12/photovoltaic-growth-reality-versus-projections-of-the-international-energy-agency/\">in 2017</a> and updated every year, showing how the International Energy Agency has repeatedly underestimated future growth in solar power:</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GQrIr33XMAA_Gex.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.52265180484,100,46.954696390319\" alt=\"A chart showing a steep difference in predictions vs reality of solar installation growth.\" title=\"A chart showing a steep difference in predictions vs reality of solar installation growth.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Solar installations have grown about 25 percent annually, but for more than a decade, the IEA has underestimated them, often predicting that they’ll level off and become steady or even decrease going forward. This is no small error; vastly underestimating progress on solar capacity dramatically changes the picture for climate change mitigation and energy production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You saw some examples of the same failure mode in the early days of Covid-19. It’s very easy to underestimate exponential growth, especially in its earliest stages. “Why should we be afraid of something that has not killed people here in this country?” one epidemiologist <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-31/flu-coronavirus\">argued in the LA Times in late January of 2020</a>. The flu is “a much bigger threat,” wrote the Washington Post a day later, comparing how many people were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/time-for-a-reality-check-america-the-flu-is-a-much-bigger-threat-than-coronavirus-for-now/2020/01/31/46a15166-4444-11ea-b5fc-eefa848cde99_story.html\">currently infected with the flu to how many people were currently infected with Covid-19</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I hardly need to point out that this analysis badly missed the point. Sure, in late January there were not very many people in the United States with Covid-19. The worry was that, because of how viruses work, that number was going to grow exponentially — and indeed it did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;So that’s one failure mode: repeatedly ignoring an exponential and insisting it will level out any minute now, resulting in dramatically missing one of the most important technological developments of the century or in telling people not to worry about a pandemic that would shut down the whole world just a few weeks later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other failure mode, of course, is this one:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My 3-month-old son is now TWICE as big as when he was born. <br><br>He&#039;s on track to weigh 7.5 trillion pounds by age 10 <a href=\"https://t.co/S4v9gXLlrt\">pic.twitter.com/S4v9gXLlrt</a></p>&mdash; Christian Keil (@pronounced_kyle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pronounced_kyle/status/1768852493092680036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some things, like Covid-19’s early spread or solar capacity growth to date, prove to be exponential curves and are best understood by thinking about their doubling time. But most phenomena aren’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of the time, like with an infant, you’re not looking at the early stages of exponential growth but just at … normal growth, which can’t be extrapolated too far without ridiculous (and inaccurate) results. And even if you are looking at an exponential curve, at some point it’ll level out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Covid-19, it was straightforward enough to guess that, at worst, it’d level out when the whole population was exposed (and in practice, it usually leveled out well short of that, as people changed their behavior in response to overwhelmed local hospitals and spiking illness rates). At what point will solar capacity level out? That’s hardly an easy question to answer, but the IEA seems to have done a spectacularly bad job of answering it; they would have been better off just drawing a straight trend line.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There is no substitute for hard work</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think about this a lot when it comes to AI, where I keep seeing people posting dueling variants of these two concepts. So far, <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/scaling-laws-for-neural-language-models/\">making AI systems bigger has made them better</a> across a wide range of tasks, from coding to drawing. Microsoft and Google are betting that this trend will continue and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/25/microsoft-google-ai-investment-profit-facebook-meta/\">are spending big money</a> on the next generation of frontier models. Many skeptics have asserted that, instead, the <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/breaking-news-scaling-will-never\">benefits of scale will level off</a> — or are already doing so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The people who most strongly defend returns to scale argue that their critics are playing the IEA game — repeatedly predicting “this is going to level out any minute” while the trend lines just go up and up. Their critics tend to accuse them of resorting to dumb oversimplifications that current trends will continue, hardly more serious than “my baby will weigh 7.5 trillion pounds.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Who’s right? I’ve increasingly come to believe that there is no substitute for digging deep into the weeds when you’re considering these questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To anticipate that solar production would continue rising, we <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2024/06/20/solar-power-is-going-to-be-huge\">needed to study</a> how we manufacture solar panels and understand the sources of the ongoing plummeting costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The way to predict how Covid-19 would go was to <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/exponential-growth-what-it-is-why-it-matters-and-how-to-spot-it/\">estimate how contagious the virus was</a> from the early available outbreak data and extrapolate the odds of successful worldwide containment from there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In neither case could you substitute broad thinking about trend lines — it all came down to facts on the ground. It’s not impossible to guess these things. But it’s impossible to be lazy and get these things right. The details matter; the superficial similarities are misleading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For AI, the high-stakes question of whether building bigger models will rapidly produce AI systems that can do everything humans can do — or whether that’s a lot of hyped-up nonsense — can’t be answered by drawing trend lines. Nor can it be answered by mocking trend lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Frankly, we don’t even have good enough measurements of general reasoning capabilities to describe the increases in AI capabilities in terms of trend lines. Insiders at labs building the most advanced AI systems tend to say that, as they make the models bigger and more expensive, they see continuing, large improvements in what those models can do. If you’re not an insider at a lab, these claims can be hard to evaluate — and I certainly find it frustrating to sift through papers that tend to overhype their results, trying to find out which results are real and substantive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s no shortcut around doing that work. While there are questions we can answer from first principles, this isn’t one of them. I hope our enjoyment of batting charts back and forth doesn’t obscure how much serious work it takes to get these questions right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

I’m so glad to see you here. I’m Constance Grady, Vox’s book critic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Between the avalanche of new releases that come out every month and the enormous back catalog of existing books, it can be hard for readers to sort through the chaos. This is why this newsletter exists. Each month, I&#8217;ll send a handful of book recommendations, both old and new, to help you find your next great read. I’ll also include some fun pieces from around the literary world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>If you’d like to see these recommendations directly in your inbox, <a href=\"https://link.vox.com/join/6x9/optin-nextpage\">consider subscribing</a>.</strong> If you want even <em>more</em> recommendations, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/support-now\"><strong>consider becoming a Vox member</strong></a>.

Email me at <a href=\"mailto:constance.grady@vox.com\">constance.grady@vox.com</a> with your reading desires, and I might answer them in the next member email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With that, let’s get into the books.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/books/alice-munro-dead.html\">Alice Munro’s death</a> last month, I’ve been rereading <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-beggar-maid-stories-of-flo-and-rose-alice-munro/6723399?ean=9780679732716\">The Beggar Maid</a></em>, her 1987 novel-in-stories, and thinking about what a perfect book it is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The novel-in-stories form is maybe one of the most beautiful variations on the novel, and it’s a structure Munro innovated and mastered. It means a collection of short stories featuring the same characters which, when compiled into a single volume, become a long narrative about them. You might think here of Jennifer Egan’s <em>A Visit From the Goon Squad</em> or Sandra Cisneros’s <em>The House on Mango Street</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>The Beggar Maid</em> (published outside the US as <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em>), the short stories are about Rose, a bright and awkward girl growing up in small-town Canada, and her stepmother Flo, who Rose both admires and is ashamed of. You follow Rose from her clumsy childhood up to her glamorous adulthood, watching the way her life is informed by the impoverished small town she’s left behind.&nbsp;Each story in the cycle stands on its own, discrete and shining like a pearl, and then Munro strings them all together into something new like beads on a necklace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you haven’t read Munro before, <em>The Beggar Maid</em> is a good place to start. If you’d like something else to read, let’s see what we can do for you.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On the shelf</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-virgin-in-the-garden-a-s-byatt/6712380?ean=9780679738299\">The Virgin in the Garden</a></em> by A.S. Byatt</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While we’re on the subject of memorial readings! A few months ago, we also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/17/as-byatt-dame-antonia-byatt-obituary\">lost A.S. Byatt</a>, author of <em>Possession</em> and a longstanding favorite of mine. Byatt, who was also an English professor, wrote primarily bookish novels about academics. She had a deep sense of the pleasures of reading and analyzing a text, and she had an impeccable eye for writing about color. Byatt novels are always streaked with descriptions of peacock greens and deep rich crimsons and shadowy mauves, so that reading them feels like standing beneath a stained glass window.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Byatt’s best known for the Booker Prize-winning <em>Possession</em>, but the book of hers that’s been speaking to me most lately is her 1978 novel <em>The Virgin in the Garden</em>. It’s about a family of academics, all very clever and varying degrees of unhappy, who are roped into putting on a play about Queen Elizabeth I to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The great joy of it for me is Fredericka, the youngest daughter of the family, bursting with bratty joy at her own erudite intelligence. There’s no one else in fiction quite like her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fyou-dreamed-of-empires-alvaro-enrigue%2F19997322%3Fean%3D9780593544792\">You Dreamed of Empires</a></em> by Álvaro Enrigue, translated by Natasha Wimmer</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is an absolute wonder of a new novel from Álvaro Enrigue, an institution in Mexico but whose work only recently became available to English-language readers. (<em>You Dreamed of Empires</em> is Enrigue’s third book to be published in English.) It takes place over the course of a single day in 1519, when the Spanish conquistador Cortés arrives at the imperial palace of Moctezuma in what is now Mexico City.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cortés’s troops are ragged and unwashed, “provincials, nobodies, hicks,” who are fixated on “the juice of rotting fruit they bring from their own lands.” The Tenochtitláns (rendered Aztecs by the rude Spanish) are, in contrast, magnificently wealthy, at the seat of a massive empire, and lavished with such marvels as quilts, grasshopper tacos, and magic mushrooms. (Moctezuma spends a lot of his page time in this novel tripping.) We know how history ends — but in Enrigue’s playful, hallucinatory prose, it feels entirely possible for things to go in different directions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-ministry-of-time-kaliane-bradley%2F20696241%3Fean%3D9781668045145\">The Ministry of Time</a></em> by Kaliane Bradley</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Ministry of Time</em> is an unbelievably satisfying read, one I could not put down. Published just last month, it takes place in a near-future London where the British government has developed the technology to time travel. To test it, they’ve extracted people out of historical death traps and into the present moment. Our unnamed narrator is a government bureaucrat hired to help one such time traveler adjust to the present as his live-in companion. Of course they fall in love, but there’s a lot more to it than that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The narrator references <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/22/graham-greenes-dark-heart\">Graham Greene’s midcentury wartime spy novels a lot</a>, and that’s more or less the best comparison for this book. Think: smoke-filled rooms full of intrigue, hard-won camaraderie that is all the more precious for existing in so desperate a time, a protagonist who is never quite as innocent as she would like to believe herself. To that mix, Bradley adds time travel, romance, and a sophisticated exploration of the ways post-colonialism shapes our minds. I gobbled this book up in a matter of days. You will, too.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Off the shelf</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the New Yorker, Katy Waldman <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/06/17/what-covid-did-to-fiction\">explores what Covid did to fiction</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Dracula</em> is an epistolary novel, made up of dated diary entries, letters, and newspaper clippings.

In the French system, presidents depend on parliamentary majorities for major domestic policy-making; without a majority, Macron will be fairly impotent at home. If the RN has an outright majority, it can start passing parts of its far-right agenda, and Macron will have only limited tools to stop them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On one level, this isn’t surprising. The RN’s long-time leader, Marine Le Pen, has been Macron’s chief rival in the past two presidential elections. It’s clear that her party has emerged as the leading alternative to Macron’s centrism; few observers are surprised that his decision to call this parliamentary election early <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240627-french-far-right-dominates-polls-three-days-ahead-of-snap-elections\">is likely to lead to RN gains</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/macron-approval-rating-falls-to-match-previous-low\">deeply unpopular president</a> causing voters to turn to the opposition: In some ways this is just democracy as usual.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But on another level, the RN’s rise should be truly shocking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not so long ago, the party’s extremism made it anathema to nearly everyone in France. When Le Pen’s father and the party’s founder Jean-Marie made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, nearly the entire country <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/23/this-chart-shows-how-the-french-election-is-a-break-from-the-past/\">rallied against him and his party</a> (then called the National Front, or FN). He lost in a landslide 82–18 defeat, the worst showing of any presidential candidate since 1958.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even after years of Marine Le Pen softening the RN’s image, its policy agenda remains nearly as radical as it was then. The RN’s signature policy is to enact a “national priority” law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/france-far-right-national-rally-history-1972-marine-le-pen#:~:text=Marine%20Le%20Pen%20has%20kept,has%20renamed%20%E2%80%9Cnational%20priority%E2%80%9D.\">formally discriminating against immigrants</a> in housing, hiring, and public benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The real story of the 2024 election is not that voters are turning against Macron, but how the far right came to be seen as a palatable alternative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a rise fueled in large part by the RN’s canny political strategy, an extreme party doing a brilliant job of making itself seem reasonable to voters outside its base. But it’s also been fueled by the hubris and missteps of Macron, who seems motivated by a false sense that the RN was so toxic that he would inevitably triumph in a forced binary choice, just as his predecessor did in 2002.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These two forces have worked in tandem to turn the RN into the de facto leader of the opposition to an unpopular president. And now, France — like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94\">other democracies around the world</a> — is reaping the whirlwind.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How France’s extreme right mainstreamed itself</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rise of the RN can best be understood as a kind of double normalization, with each generation of Le Pens playing a distinct but crucial role.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After World War II, the European far right appeared to be a spent force. No political movement could hope to win national elections promising a Third Reich redux; those that tried found no success.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">French politics immediately after the war —&nbsp;the Fourth Republic period — was tumultuous. After a military revolt in 1958, World War II hero Charles de Gaulle took power and ushered in a new constitution. The Fifth Republic remains the system under which France operates today. After De Gaulle left power in 1969, French elections evolved into relatively stable contests between center-right and center-left blocs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jean-Marie Le Pen was the first to develop a credible far-right alternative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recognizing that the Nazis had rendered dictatorship and race hatred beyond the pale, Le Pen refocused the far right on contesting elections by attacking immigration. The argument wasn’t (primarily) that minorities were biologically inferior, just that France is under no obligation to admit culturally distinct foreigners and treat them as equals. After he founded the National Front for French Unity (FN) in 1972, the party adopted the slogan “France is for the French.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Le Pen paired this xenophobia with extreme nationalism. He was a veteran of France’s failed wars to keep colonies in Vietnam and Algeria; in one contemporary interview, he <a href=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/346813/le-pen-and-torture-in-algeria-individual-crime-or-historical-crime/\">seemingly confessed to personally torturing Algerian detainees</a> (a charge he later denied). As a politician, Le Pen defended French imperialism and railed against its diminished glory in a post-colonial era. Immigration, for Le Pen, was a kind of “reverse colonization” in which France’s former subjects were destroying its identity from within.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the FN was never an outright fascist party, it could put itself forward as something distinct from Europe’s discredited Hitlerite past. This “<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228468169_Reputational_shields_Why_most_anti-immigrant_parties_failed_in_Western_Europe_1980-2005\">reputational shield</a>,” as scholars term it, helped it make inroads into French politics in ways that neo-Nazis never could. In 1984, just 12 years after its founding, the FN managed to win 11 percent of the national vote in a European Parliament election. It soon became a model for far-right parties across the continent, which <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414003251176\">rapidly began outperforming neo-Nazi rivals.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, the FN had a clear ceiling,&nbsp;and Le Pen himself was a big part of the problem. The party’s founder has always had a habit of rhetorical bomb-throwing that kept it from making further inroads with the broader public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He has repeatedly engaged in Nazi apologia, calling the Holocaust a “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna29881495\">detail</a>” of history and <a href=\"https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/latest-news-briefs-from-the-jewish-telegraphic-agency/article_546ad744-caba-5d66-8ade-587c7becc313.html\">saying that </a>“in France, at least, the German occupation was not particularly inhuman.” In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/world/europe/07cnd-france.html\">a 2006 interview</a>, he said that “you can’t dispute the inequality of the races” because “blacks are much better than whites at running, but whites are better at swimming.” In his 2018 memoir, he defended French citizens who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/world/europe/lepen-memoir-france-national-front.html\">volunteered for the German SS during World War II</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I — like millions of other French people — grew up with the image of Le Pen as a snarling bigot with an underbite, a political bogeyman who tidily gathered up all the ugliness of France’s recent history,” journalist Nick Vinocur <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/marine-le-pen-turned-respectable-france-presidential-election/\">writes in Politico</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Jean-Marie’s daughter Marine took over the FN in 2011, she was initially perceived in much the same way. But the younger Le Pen proved a cannier operator, not only realizing that her party needed an image makeover but successfully delivering on it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-471796314.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"France&#039;s far-right political party Front National founder and honorary president Jean-Marie Le Pen gestures onstage as FN&#039;s president Marine Le Pen looks on, in Paris France, May 1, 2015. | Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of this was about language. As Vinocur reports, she shifted the party’s demagoguery away from direct attacks on Muslims and Arabs and toward dog-whistles about cultural change and terrorism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She would occasionally discipline party members who crossed her lines — including, most notably, her father. In 2015, when Jean-Marie once again got into trouble over comments about Jews and the Holocaust, Le Pen did the unthinkable: She expelled her father from the party he founded. He should “no longer be able to speak in the name of the National Front,” <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34009901\">she said at the time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2018, following a decisive presidential defeat, she changed the party’s name from National Front to National Rally. While seemingly minor, the move helped distance the party from her father’s relatively toxic brand and establish Le Pen’s independence as a political figure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the current election, she has tried to elevate candidates —&nbsp;most notably, 28-year-old party leader and proposed prime minister Jordan Bardella — who come across as normal, suit-wearing politicians rather than bombastic confessed torturers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Don’t be fooled. Experts on French politics say that Le Pen’s moderation is primarily symbolic. While she has sanded off the RN’s rough edges, she also has maintained the far-right policy core —&nbsp;most notably, the “national priority” system mandating discrimination against immigrants in public goods —&nbsp;that helped make her father’s party so toxic in the first place. During the current campaign, Bardella vowed to <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.fr/20240614/explained-what-is-le-pens-party-policy-on-dual-nationals-in-france\">ban dual nationals from holding government jobs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“From [a policy lens], there’s very little difference between what Marine Le Pen is running with and what Jean-Marie was defending,” says Marta Lorimer, a Cardiff University expert on French politics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Together, in short, the Le Pens accomplished one of the most successful political rebrandings in modern history. They created a party rooted in thinly veiled bigotry and, without significant policy compromise, turned it into something that the median French voter might actually consider supporting.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Macron’s (implicit) deal with the devil</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The RN’s recent success is not merely a story of Marine Le Pen’s political skills. Like most European far-right parties, it benefited hugely from the 2015 refugee crisis, which turned its signature issue of immigration <a href=\"https://migrant-integration.ec.europa.eu/library-document/what-do-people-europe-think-about-migrants-special-eurobarometer-survey_en\">into <em>the</em> issue across the continent</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Le Pen also benefited from the rise of Emmanuel Macron, a self-proclaimed “radical centrist” who shattered the foundations of France’s party system. In doing so, he created the perfect conditions for Le Pen’s rebranding to succeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The traditionally dominant factions of the center right and center left, today called the Republican and Socialist parties, saw themselves as rivals with a shared responsibility: guarding the republic from extremist forces that would harm it. They agreed never to share power with the FN/RN, an agreement referred to as “the republican front” or “cordon sanitaire.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Macron broke the two-party system. In 2016, he quit his position as finance minister under a Socialist president to run for president at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/8/15578338/french-election-2017-macron-le-pen-results\">the head of a party he just founded</a>, now called Renaissance. At the time, this may have seemed like an act of extreme hubris. But Macron proved far more popular than either of his mainstream rivals, and he won the most voters in the first round of France’s 2017 election. He faced Marine Le Pen in the head-to-head second round and crushed her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After winning power, Macron made two moves that would serve his short-term political interests but end up paving the way for the RN’s rise in the long run.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, Macron built his new party as a kind of centrist empire, one designed to occupy the entirety of the territory between radical right and extreme left. Containing both former Socialists and Republicans, its rise sapped the vitality from the already-weakened established parties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their decline should, in theory, have left Macron and Renaissance the only serious choice for most French voters. Certainly that was Macron’s theory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No politician, even one as “<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-jupiter-model-unlikely-to-stand-test-of-time-leadership-parliamentary-majority/\">Jupiterian</a>” as Macron, can maintain a personal majority forever. Macron has become deeply unpopular, with a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/macron-approval-rating-falls-to-match-previous-low?embedded-checkout=true\">mere 26 percent of French voters</a> approving of his current performance. It’s easy to blame specific policies, like his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65279818\">pension reform</a> and <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20181205-france-macron-abandons-fuel-tax-hike-fears-violence-new-yellow-vest-protests\">failed gas tax</a>, but it also might be plain old exhaustion. Around the world, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/06/world-elections-anti-incumbent-leaders-backlash\">incumbents are unpopular</a>,&nbsp;and Macron has been in office for seven years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So if French voters want to vote against Macron, who should they turn to? The center right is a shadow of itself. The center left has been forced into an unwieldy “new popular front” <a href=\"https://time.com/6991254/macron-bardella-le-pen-far-right-left-election/\">alliance with the polarizing and unstable extreme left</a>, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. There’s a smaller extreme-right party, led by comedian Eric Zemmour, but he’s even more radical than Le Pen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That leaves only one non-Macron option with a proven electoral track record: the RN.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s only two options for voters,” says Florence Faucher, a professor of political science at France’s Sciences Po research center. “At some point, people are going to want change from the majority of Macron.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Macron didn’t just demolish the other centrist parties. He actually aided Le Pen’s strategy of normalizing her party by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67778170\">tacking to the right on immigration</a>. “It’s not so much that the National Rally has moderated [on immigration] than that the entire political system has radicalized,” says Lorimer.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-1760913567.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729279508242,100,78.541440983517\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"French President Emmanuel Macron at a press conference after the end of the two-day European Council and Euro Summit in Brussels, Belgium, on October 27, 2023. | Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Macron has, for example, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/macron-announces-new-plan-to-regulate-islam-in-france\">said</a> that “Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world” and <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/france-emmanuel-macron-abaya-muslim-dress-ban-schools-secularism/\">banned</a> some traditional Muslim clothing in schools. (Roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/21/france-snap-parliamentary-elections-muslims-lyon-far-right-national-rally\">6 million people in France</a> practice Islam or come from a Muslim background.) Last year, he had Parliament pass an immigration bill so draconian that Le Pen hailed it as “<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/france-marine-le-pen-scores-big-win-on-toughened-immigration-bill-macron/\">an ideological victory</a>” for her party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She was more correct than it seems. Some <a href=\"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/207180/1/ZORA207180.pdf\">research on European politics</a> suggests that when parties in the center take right-wing positions, they don’t actually win over that party’s supporters. Instead, they end up normalizing far-right discourse on the topic: helping people on the fence think it must not be so weird to rail against Islam if self-proclaimed centrists are doing it and that maybe they can consider voting for the far right without being a bad person.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That appears to be how Macron’s strategy has worked out in France. His attempt to take out Le Pen’s signature issue has only made her seem more reasonable, all without persuading her base to defect to the center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“All the attempts to co-opt the far right have aided the process of normalization,” says Art Goldhammer, an expert on France at Harvard University’s Center for European Studies. “The slogan in France is that people prefer the original to the copy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It wasn’t Macron’s intent to usher in an RN-led Parliament. His actions betray a belief that the RN would always have a ceiling; that, when push comes to shove, the French people would always choose his moderation over Le Pen’s extremism when presented with a binary choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This strategy has long worked in modern France, but Macron appears to have finally found its limits. The same arrogance that powered Macron’s 2017 presidential bid has now brought France to the brink of a Parliament dominated by radicals.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They were doing this the year an Everest-sized, dinosaur-slaying asteroid smashed into what is now Mexico.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And they continued doing this as humans transformed the planet, replacing forests with farms, covering beaches with buildings, and flooding the air and water with pollution. Even on some of the most urban stretches of coastline, in North America and Asia, these creatures still appear each year to seed the next generation.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Horseshoe_Spot.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.141532949541,100,39.716934100918\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One evening during a heat wave in June, I drove to Plumb Beach in south Brooklyn with a couple of friends. It’s a beautiful spot. The water is calm and the sand is speckled with shells and tufts of tall grass. It’s also very much a city beach. Plastic takeout containers poke out of the sand. There’s a large tire in the shallows. Traffic on the Belt Parkway competes with the sound of waves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, in May and June, horseshoe crabs appear here, like magic, around full and new moons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The females, which are noticeably larger than the males, release pheromones on their way into shore to draw in suitors. One lucky male will grab onto her rear, using a pair of specialized claws, and release sperm while she lays eggs in the sand. Other “satellite” males will follow the pair around and try —&nbsp;often with successful results —&nbsp;to get their sperm in the mix too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This ancient animal orgy was on full display that evening.&nbsp;Just before sunset, dozens of the crabs — which are not technically crabs but arthropods more closely related to spiders — started coming to shore. Most of them paired up. Every few meters I saw a female the size of a dinner plate dragging along a salad-plate-size male. Some crabs were in piles. Others were in conga lines: rows of five or more individuals all attached to each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The horseshoe crabs were coated in a colorful amalgam of other sea creatures —&nbsp;barnacles, mussels, snails, and even crustaceans — as if they each had their own style. Sometimes called walking hotels, these animals are a foundation for so much life. They are ecosystems unto themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0287.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0656-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not all they support. The many eggs that horseshoe crabs lay on the beach — which can number in the tens of thousands per female — are food for more than 20 species of migratory birds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None, perhaps, rely on them more than red knots. Rotund sandpipers that sport rust-colored chests in the summer, they&#8217;re among the world’s most impressive travelers. In the eastern hemisphere, some red knots migrate more than 9,000 miles, from the tip of South America to the Arctic Circle. And they rely on horseshoe crab eggs to fuel this trip. In the spring, red knots time their journey north to align with spawning on the East Coast (and especially the Delaware Bay).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Red knots will use Plumb Beach to refuel, though I saw a different crew of egg-eaters that evening: laughing gulls, which are basically elevated seagulls. While they too are&nbsp;seagulls — a&nbsp;colloquial&nbsp;term&nbsp;that people tend to use for&nbsp;all gull species found near the sea — they have black heads and calls that sound like cackles. I watched dozens of them travel in a pack down the beach, feasting on eggs and laughing.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0525.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach.\" title=\"A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Horseshoe crabs also support billions of human lives. Their blood, made blue by copper-based proteins that transport oxygen, is a medical marvel. It quickly clots in the presence of bacterial toxins, and that has made it invaluable for sterility testing. Scientists use horseshoe crab blood to make sure medical devices, intravenous drugs, and vaccines — including those for Covid-19 — are free of harmful bacteria and safe to use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I find this all pretty remarkable: These animals, which are basically walking helmets, have been supporting life around them for hundreds of millions of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0534.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Horseshoe crab eggs.\" title=\"Horseshoe crab eggs.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an imperceivable fraction of the horseshoe crab timeline, humans have torn countless lives apart. We’ve ripped up forests and grasslands and overfished the seas, and we’re now slowly cooking the planet with carbon dioxide. Humans are fracturing the support beams of ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re even challenging the resilience of horseshoe crabs. In the last few decades,&nbsp;and especially in the 1990s,&nbsp;millions of these crabs were harvested and drained of blood. They often died afterwards. Fishermen also capture horseshoe crabs and use them as bait for eels and conch. Overharvesting caused their population —&nbsp;and the populations of some birds that depend on them —&nbsp;to crash. Red knots are federally threatened under the US Endangered Species Act, largely due to a decline in horseshoe crabs.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0342.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water.\" title=\"A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0359.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container.\" title=\"A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you glimpse these creatures on the beach, they don’t appear especially intelligent or skillful.

They’re obviously doing something right. More profoundly, they’ve helped sustain life around them. I might even suggest that we should all aspire to be more like horseshoe crabs. We should look up to these sea spiders, and try fortifying ecosystems rather than destroying them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So many important issues are at stake in the 2024 election: <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-trump-on-key-foreign-policy-issues-/7561392.html\">foreign policy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court\">reproductive rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality\">immigration</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term\">future of American democracy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But coming out of the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, one topic has crowded all those out: Biden’s performance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s rationale for agreeing to this historically early presidential debate was, in part, to try and put concerns over his age to rest. Instead, they’ve been supercharged. Multiple reports soon after the debate claimed that top Democrats were downright panicked by how Biden came off onstage. Major media outlets wrote that Biden “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/06/27/presidential-debate-live-updates/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001\">struggled</a>” and appeared “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate\">shaky</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden is the oldest president ever, and Republicans have long been trying to push an exaggerated narrative that he is senile. He didn’t seem senile on stage — but he didn’t seem sharp, either. He spoke very softly, his answers were often messy on the substance, and when he did have decent lines they were usually hampered by his halting and understated delivery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sources told NBC News midway through the debate that Biden <a href=\"https://x.com/kellyo/status/1806505436457189594?s=46\">has a cold</a>, implying his affect was a one-off fluke. The risk, though, is that voters determined after watching that he is simply not up for the job he wants to keep. This was, after all, the most prolonged look at Biden in an adversarial setting we’ve gotten in some time, and he didn’t come off well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s performance was no great shakes: He said absurd and untrue things, rambled and lost coherence. But he did it more energetically — and, more to the point, he was typical Trump, no one would be surprised by what he said or how he said it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On one level, all of the above is so shallow and superficial that I feel somewhat embarrassed to have written it. Politics should be about more than theater criticism and affect. It’s about important issues that will affect the lives of millions of people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, the question of what a relatively small group of swing voters thinks about Joe Biden’s age may well be what the 2024 election hinges on. Many Democrats think they have a winning argument against Trump on the issues, but they’re worried that Biden simply can’t make the case. So the most immediate consequence of Thursday’s debate will be a revival of chatter about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">whether Biden should even stay</a> in the race or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357739/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-nominee-whitmer-moore-newsom\">whether there’s still some other option</a> for Democrats. And that consequence makes for a pretty clear set of takeaways for the race in the wake of this debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Loser: Joe Biden</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No need to belabor the point: If the debate ends with your party debating whether you should even stay in the race, it’s pretty obvious you lost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden “age issue” is really a conflation of a few separate things. Again, there’s the exaggerated right-wing narrative that he’s senile. There are normal concerns about aging slowing people down somewhat mentally and physically. There’s the question about whether his health would hold up in a second term. There are questions about whether any of this has impaired his decision-making or governance (I don’t believe it has; it’s hard to point to an example of any administration decision that would be different if he was Joe Biden but younger).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s also a more difficult concern for Biden to rebut: that he has failed to appropriately “perform” the role of president or presidential candidate. That he hasn’t been good at seeming like he’s in command, like he’s energetic, can handle tough questioning, and is up to the job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where he failed most glaringly during the debate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For many elite Democrats, the worry about Biden’s age is mainly a meta-worry: It’s about what swing voters will think about Biden’s age. If that’s your rubric, it doesn’t matter if you think he’s doing a great job as president; what matters is what the swing voters will think. And it’s hard to believe many liked what they saw on Thursday.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner: Donald Trump</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By default, in a two-person contest, Trump won the debate due to Biden’s weakness. But his performance was not particularly impressive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As usual, Trump got sidetracked into his perennial grievances (“Russia Russia Russia,” “the laptop,” James Comey, false claims of 2020 election fraud). He lied, said ridiculous things, and dodged questions. He also missed opportunities: Biden was shaky enough that a more disciplined and savvy Republican candidate could well have embarrassed him far more — by, for instance,&nbsp;posing questions directly to him and truly throwing him off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump did benefit from the relative lack of focus on his attempt to steal the 2020 election and his recent criminal conviction. And perhaps the way he won most was that the debate seemed to normalize him: His attack on American democracy was just one issue among many, only showing up halfway through.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Loser: Substantive issues</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Look, it never seemed particularly likely that with these two candidates on stage this debate would be an enlightening and nuanced exchange about policy issues. Neither are wonks, Trump lies constantly, and every debate he has participated in ends up devolving into a mudslinging contest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, for anyone interested in substance, this debate was a truly desultory affair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On abortion, Trump accused Biden of wanting to kill 9-month-old babies and Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html#:~:text=BIDEN%3A%20I%20supported%20Roe%20v.%20Wade%2C%20which%20had%20three%20trimesters.%20First%20time%20is%20between%20a%20woman%20and%20a%20doctor.%20Second%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20and%20an%20extreme%20situation.%20And%20a%20third%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20%E2%80%93%20I%20mean%2C%20it%E2%80%99d%20be%20between%20the%20woman%20and%20the%20state.\">struggled to explain</a> <em>Roe v. Wade</em>’s three-trimester framework. On climate change, Trump bragged that while he was president the country had clean air and “H2O.” On the economy, Biden claimed Trump destroyed the economy in 2020, while Trump claimed Biden solely caused inflation and has only created jobs for migrants — all false.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The nadir was the supremely stupid exchange in which both candidates insulted each other’s golf games. “I’m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag,” Biden said. Trump responded by mocking Biden’s “swing.” Why?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner: Kamala Harris</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Back in March, Biden’s fiery State of the Union address quieted many concerns among Democrats over whether he was up to the rigors of another campaign. Now, the debate has reopened that topic of discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It will take more time (and polling numbers) to determine just how serious the damage to Biden is. Maybe mainly politics die-hards who have their minds made up were the people watching this very early debate. The media may focus on Biden’s age for a while, but attention will inevitably shift to other topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the odds that Kamala Harris ends up the Democratic presidential nominee for 2024 are, in my view, higher after the debate than they were before it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic National Convention is at the end of August. Biden won the primaries and has most Democratic delegates pledged to him, so he can’t be totally pushed out against his will. But if power players in the party tell him that he has to step down — and he listens — then Harris would be the obvious next in line.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When this scenario has been discussed, it’s often been about an “open” convention, where delegates would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html\">come together</a> to somehow choose their own nominee, as in older political eras. My guess is that this would be far too messy and impractical, and coordination and consensus-building around one option would be too difficult. There have been doubts within the party about Harris’s political strength, but if Democratic elites come to agree Biden is fatally politically flawed, they’d be more likely to roll the dice with her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, dropping Biden still seems very unlikely. But it seems less unlikely than it did Thursday morning.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Three separate times during Thursday night’s debate, CNN’s moderators asked Donald Trump if he would commit to accepting the legitimacy of the 2024 election results regardless of who won. He never did.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, Trump said that he’d accept the results if he thought they were “fair and legal and good” — while at the same time repeating the false claim that the 2020 election was shot through with fraud (a claim that the moderators let stand).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Put together, the former president was all but openly telling us that he’s ready to repeat the campaign of lies and incitement that produced a mob attack on the Capitol less than four years ago. (He did offer a rote rejection of political violence.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That all of this felt normal, even expected, shows how much Donald Trump has warped our sense of what’s tolerable in America. Here was an authoritarian spouting falsehoods, ranting incoherently about policy, issuing thinly veiled threats against democracy, and somehow we’ve come to accept it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re all so used to this behavior, in fact, that we have trouble reminding ourselves how dangerous it is. I can guarantee Trump’s comments on the election won’t be the top headline at any major newspaper in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That honor will likely go to Joe Biden’s poor performance, and I can understand why. The president of the United States barely stringing a cogent answer together for the first hour of a nationally televised debate is indeed a major story. It seems like the critics <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html\">warning about Biden’s age</a> had a point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s something quietly obscene about Trump’s naked authoritarianism falling out of the frame. It wasn’t only these few comments about election results: It was his entire performance, <a href=\"https://x.com/nytimes/status/1806527958095474702\">a cavalcade of lies</a> that betrayed a staggering contempt for the American public’s intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Thursday night, an authoritarian put his distaste for democracy on open display. Opposite him was a man who <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/01/05/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-third-anniversary-of-the-january-6th-attack-and-defending-the-sacred-cause-of-american-democracy-blue-bell-pa/\">claims to care about democracy</a> above all else but has seemed wholly incapable of considering whether there might be some tension between its future and his own ambitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blame Biden for running again. Blame the Democratic Party for failing to stop him. Blame CNN for burying the democracy questions halfway through the debate. Blame the Republicans for nominating Trump. Blame Trump, most of all, for acting the way he chooses to act — and his voters for standing by him while he does it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump reminded us tonight that he is uniquely unfit for office and hostile to our democracy. The fact that those qualities have lost their ability to shock underscores just how much the man has bent our politics to his will.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A comatose Joe Biden would make a better president than Donald Trump. And the president’s capacity to lead the executive branch is, by most accounts, far greater than his capacity to speak in coherent, extemporaneous sentences on CNN.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the idea that Joe Biden is the best possible standard-bearer for the Democratic Party this November has lost all plausibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357642/biden-trump-debate-presidential-cnn-poll-takeaways-live-coverage\">first presidential debate</a> in Atlanta Thursday night, Trump spouted an endless stream of deranged lies, painting a portrait of a nonexistent United States in which babies are summarily executed in maternity wards, undocumented criminals live in the penthouses of luxury hotels on Uncle Sam’s dime, and the world’s wealthiest nation has become “a Third World country.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Biden’s senescence spoke louder than Trump’s mendacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president spoke in broken sentences through a soft, sometimes tremulous voice (Biden’s campaign said that he had a cold). At various points, his mind failed to keep pace with his lips, causing him to abandon a half-delivered talking point or else lose his train of thought entirely. In one excruciating early moment — while trying to advertise his administration’s efforts to cap the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries — Biden said that he had been “making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I’ve been able to do with &#8230; the Covid &#8230; excuse me, with, um, dealing with everything we have to do with &#8230; uh &#8230; look &#8230; if &#8230; we finally beat Medicare.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president’s visual appearance was similarly unsettling, his skin pallid and his mouth hanging oddly agape during some of Trump’s answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This despairing spectacle — of a viciously dishonest insurrectionist turning in a debate performance that, if juxtaposed with anything but the president’s even more disjointed efforts would have seemed astoundingly rambling and incoherent — led many Democrats on <a href=\"https://x.com/JulianCastro/status/1806519938984845809\">social media</a> and in <a href=\"https://x.com/charles_lister/status/1806518997732438091?s=46&amp;t=DqqqiPqo3dK8m-7tJy5LZA\">private channels</a> to call for Biden’s replacement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those calls are now irrefutable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The case for Biden was weak even before the debate</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans currently disapprove of the president’s job performance by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">a roughly 18-point margin</a>, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average. By contrast, voters disapprove of Trump by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/\">only 11 points on average</a>, and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">Kamala Harris</a> by only 10.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When asked whether they plan to vote for a Democrat or Republican for Congress, voters favor Democrats by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/\">a margin of 45.6 to 45.1</a>. In polls of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/20/joe-biden-underperforming-democrats-polls-00164156\">battleground state electorates,</a> Democratic Senate candidates routinely run far ahead of Biden. Democrats have plenty of political challenges as a party, but Biden had even more as a candidate even before the cameras started rolling in Atlanta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president is saddled with the misfortune of presiding over the highest inflation in four decades. This does not reflect any great economic mismanagement on his part; to the contrary, he has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24134257/biden-economy-inflation-wages-interest-rate\">shepherded the US to the strongest recovery</a> of any G-7 country. Yet, across the wealthy world, more or less <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/its-not-just-biden\">every leader</a> who presided over 2022’s inflation has suffered overwhelming public disapproval. For many voters, Biden is the personification of price increases. Even if he were in his prime as an orator, there would be a case for swapping him out merely because bad luck had damaged his brand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But of course, Biden is not in his prime. He would be 82 years old at his second inauguration and 86 at the close of his second term. It strains credulity to claim that the person best suited to run the United States is an octogenarian. Were the Democratic nominee anyone else, Trump’s age — 78 —&nbsp; would be a significant liability for the Republicans. But Biden is three years older than Trump, and<em> </em>seems about a decade his senior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or so voters appear to think. In <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-americans-on-biden-age/story?id=107126589\">an ABC News poll</a> from February, 86 percent of voters said that Biden was too old to serve another term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Partly for these reasons, Biden has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/upshot/introducing-2024-poll-tracker.html\">trailing Trump</a> in polls of virtually every swing state. And in both 2016 and 2020, the polls significantly overestimated Democratic support in the Electoral College’s battlegrounds. Before Thursday night, <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">Nate Silver’s model</a> gave Trump a 66 percent chance of winning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, there was already a solid case for Biden to step aside and let Kamala Harris or some other Democrat lead the party into November’s election, even before his dispiriting debate performance. By far the most likely consequence of staying the course was America’s reelection of a corrupt and authoritarian reactionary. Rolling the dice on a new candidate was plausibly the party’s best move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, Biden went on national television and made it impossible for anyone to honestly say, “I am confident that the president will still be fit to serve in January 2029.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">It is not too late for Democrats to replace Joe Biden (with his cooperation)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no way for the Democratic Party to deny Biden the nomination at this point. But Democratic leaders could personally lobby the president to step aside and endorse his preferred successor, preempting the hazards of a contested Democratic convention in late August. Waiting months to anoint a presumptive nominee would be highly risky. Rallying around Biden’s handpicked heir now would be much less so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If one wishes to minimize intra-party strife, then Biden could simply endorse his vice president, who already functions as his default replacement. Few consider Harris to be among her party’s best political talents, but she offers far more upside than the version of Biden we saw Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Democratic leaders believe that it would be possible for Biden to endorse a more electorally formidable candidate (perhaps Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer?) without alienating key constituencies, then that might be the optimal course of action. Sticking with Biden, plainly, is not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president’s policy positions and governing record matter more than his current skills as a rhetorician. But precisely because of how much is substantively at stake in this election, Democrats cannot afford to wager it on American voters changing their minds and deciding that Biden isn’t too old for his job after watching him struggle to remember the topics of his own sentences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many aspects of Biden’s legacy are laudable. His best chance for preserving it would be to voluntarily end his presidency after one term before voters get the chance.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And the president’s capacity to lead the executive branch is, by most accounts, far greater than his capacity to speak in coherent, extemporaneous sentences on CNN.

His verbal stumbles, weak voice (the campaign <a href=\"https://x.com/axios/status/1806514229500850238\">has said</a> that he was dealing with a cold) and meandering responses to Trump’s jabs and the moderators’ questions are likely to bring up one question: Is there any way Biden could be replaced as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The short answer is, practically, there probably isn&#8217;t. All 50 states have already held their primaries, and Biden has won the vast majority of their delegates. Only Biden himself can direct those delegates to vote for someone else, as they are pledged to vote for him unless he drops out before the Democratic convention this August.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where practical and political challenges merge: Biden is the only one who can decide if he wants to drop out before the floor vote. No secretive party apparatus or individual can direct him to do it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And unless Biden has a serious change of heart after Thursday night, there are plenty of reasons that wouldn’t happen.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The real-world challenges</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first obstacle: Presidents are chosen through elections between candidates picked through a specific, organized party process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic presidential nominee is chosen in August at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where a candidate needs to win the support of the majority of the Democratic delegates. Those delegates are assigned proportionally based on the vote totals in a state’s primary (for any candidate who wins more than 15 percent of votes) and are then <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/presidential-election-delegate-selection-process-primary-caucus-9720daa8d706a4afceaa2d939f59a1b9\">“pledged” or “bound” to that candidate</a> in the first round of voting at the Democratic convention. Under this system, some other candidate would need to win more delegates than Biden in order to become the nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Biden has not just all the delegates he needs, but essentially all the delegates, period. So practically, there isn’t anyone that could be swapped in at this point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And according to DNC rules, these delegates are bound to support Biden during the first floor vote of the DNC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond the limits set by that process, there are also practical financial hurdles: Only Biden has the fundraising and money machine necessary on the Democratic side to run ads, hold events, hire staff, and, effectively, run a campaign. No other Democrat, elected or unelected, has that practical machinery in place.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Political challenges are still tricky</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At this point, it’s also politically risky for anyone to try to publicly force Biden out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic establishment has already united around Biden — endorsing him, stumping for him, and leading the party’s operations not only because he is the incumbent,<em> </em>but because it’s him specifically<em>. </em>They have deep relationships with him and are loyal to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is also where it’s important to dispel the notion that anyone could force Biden to drop out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DNC is not some omnipotent, shadowy operation that has the power, influence, or ability to crown a different party leader. Who do you think <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/jaime-harrison-picked-new-democratic-national-committee-chair-n1254292\">chose the DNC chair and vice-chairs</a>? Biden! There just isn’t a council of decision-makers who can tell Biden to drop out or choose to ditch him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The power of party elites is <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-parties-cant-decide\">often overstated</a>, and the primaries so far show the influence of voters. As unpopular as Biden might seem to some folks, he still won handily in the 2020 primary, and when given options to protest-vote in New Hampshire or select “none of these candidates” in Nevada this year, Democrats have still sided with Biden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And all the leading figures who could replace him — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, maybe even Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (let alone Vice President Kamala Harris) are all major public surrogates and supporters of Biden. They wouldn’t publicly turn on him now. And it’s not clear that they would privately try to force him out. Even at the most self-interested level, none of them has an incentive to let the other strongarm a Biden capitulation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So only Biden could make the decision to drop out. He doesn’t want to (not least because he sees himself as key to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-says-trump-wasnt-running-m-not-sure-d-running-rcna128232\">stopping Trump’s reelection</a>). And even if he did choose to, the only option that would not risk massive dissension among the Democratic base would be to choose his vice president, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>. The vice president has her own political drawbacks: She <a href=\"https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1755963760173289503?s=20\">polls</a> <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">worse</a> than Biden against Trump, has never run a successful national campaign, and, unfortunately, faces different voter prejudices because she is a woman of color.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other polls also show similarly negative results for Whitmer, Shapiro, and Newsom. They have <a href=\"https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1756003253190357282?s=20\">polled worse</a> than Biden, or are biding their time. And to bypass Harris for one of them also opens up potential ire from Black voters, without whom Democrats can’t win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Should another Democrat savior emerge, with the vocal support of someone like Barack Obama and a core of Biden-critical strategists and politicians, and should first lady Jill Biden and other Biden confidantes approach Biden and convince him to drop out, we’d likely head toward a brokered convention with multiple rounds of voting. That also opens up the chance for even more chaos and disunity among Democrats. Does that seem worth it to anyone in Democratic politics right now?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At least until Thursday night, the answer was simple: No. It’s too late.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

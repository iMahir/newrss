But the concerns about kids’ reading have been piling up for years, with educators and other commentators worrying that students can’t recognize letters, that kids’ novels are falling out of fashion, and that young people are getting into college without being able to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/\">read a full book</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I know that the pandemic took a toll on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/education/372475/math-reading-school-covid-education-learning-loss-kids\">kids’ test scores in reading and math</a>. But I also know that older generations love to complain about ne’er-do-well young folks who can’t be bothered to crack open a book. So I reached out to educators and literacy scholars to find out how far behind kids really are, and what their reading skills (or lack thereof) mean for their future as voters, news consumers, and citizens of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While kids’ reading performance has slid in recent years, some experts say <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/12/lucy-calkins-child-literacy-teaching-methodology/680394/\">the language of “crisis”</a> is overblown. In fact, reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), one of the most widely used nationwide measures of student achievement, <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/\">haven’t changed that much</a> since the tests were introduced in 1969, <a href=\"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/catherine-snow\">Catherine Snow</a>, a professor of cognition and education at Harvard Graduate School of Education, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They haven&#8217;t plummeted,” Snow said. “They didn&#8217;t even plummet during Covid. They went down a little bit.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What has plummeted, however, is how much kids read, especially outside of school. In 1984, the first year for which data is available, 35 percent of 13-year-olds reported reading for fun “almost every day,” <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ltt/reading/student-experiences/?age=13\">according to NAEP</a>. By 2023, that figure was down to 14 percent, and 31 percent of respondents said they never read for fun at all. Kids are also faring worse on <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/icils2023/international.asp\">tests that measure their information literacy</a>, including their ability to recognize reliable sources.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"Today, Explained\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A?utm_source=oembed\" allowfullscreen allow=\"clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those results are indicative of a broader problem. Kids may be learning basic literacy, but “they&#8217;re not reading in the ways that they need to read in order to be prepared for the tasks of learning and critical thinking,” Snow said. And a decline in those critical thinking skills has big implications not just for young people today, but for society as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These are our voters,” Christina Cover, a special education teacher in the Bronx who leads the <a href=\"https://seekcommonground.org/pal\">Project for Adolescent Literacy</a> at the nonprofit Seek Common Ground, told me. “These are people that are really going to be taking us into what&#8217;s next for our country and for our world.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kids’ reading scores have been (relatively) stable for decades</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The NAEP tests, administered every two years for five decades, <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/\">offer a bird’s-eye view</a> of how American kids’ reading proficiency has changed over time. After climbing through the 2000s, scores began to dip around 2012, a trend that <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/reading/2022/\">intensified with the pandemic</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That drop has educators concerned, with many calling for expanded tutoring, summer school, and other supports to help kids get back on track. At the same time, even the post-Covid numbers aren’t that far off from historical norms. In 1971, the first year for which data is available, the <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/\">average NAEP score for 9-year-olds</a> was 208 out of a possible 500. In 2022, it was 215.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be clear, those scores aren’t great. It’s also disappointing to see students losing some of the ground they gained through the 2000s, and the pandemic dealt <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/education/372475/math-reading-school-covid-education-learning-loss-kids\">very real setbacks</a>, especially for low-income students and other already-underserved groups. Teachers now have to “reach back, and maybe grab or review those previous standards” that students should have been taught in 2020 and 2021, Evelyn Rudolph, a reading interventionist at LEAD Academy, a public charter school in Montgomery, Alabama, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the story of students’ reading scores over the last several decades is one of “a very stable level of mediocrity,” <a href=\"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2024/09/harvard-reading-wars-literacy-education\">Snow has said</a>, not of sudden crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But reading for pleasure has plummeted</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the good-ish news. More worrisome — or at least more precipitous — is the decline in kids’ reading for pleasure. While there were <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ltt/reading/student-experiences/?age=13\">hints of a decrease</a> in the ’90s, the slide seems to have started in earnest in the 2010s — in 2012, 27 percent of 13-year-olds read for fun every day, compared with just 17 percent in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts aren’t exactly sure why so many kids stopped reading, but the trend coincides with the widespread adoption of smartphones, said <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/staff/staffdetl.asp?empid=698\">Ebony Walton</a>, a statistician at the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers the NAEP tests. Other hypotheses include <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/children-arent-reading-for-pleasure-according-to-new-research-heres-how-you-can-help-them-love-books-243108\">funding cuts to libraries</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/03/children-reading-books-english-middle-grade/673457/\">excessive focus on standardized testing</a> that has crowded out practices that instill a love of reading, like teachers reading books aloud to students.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever the case, the decline of reading for fun is a problem, and not just for <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/03/children-reading-books-english-middle-grade/673457/\">children’s authors</a>. “When a student reads for fun and enjoys reading outside of school, there are so many benefits that they might not even realize,” from learning new vocabulary to gaining “the background knowledge needed to approach different academic areas in school,” Cover said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The skills that students use when reading for fun — especially reading longer texts — are also the same ones they need for everything from reading car manuals to “listening to political discourse and making sense of it,” Snow said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The importance of reading skills for civic engagement has been a hot-button topic lately, with <a href=\"https://x.com/ishaantharoor/status/1854187377943515637\">Washington Post columnist Ishaan Tharoor</a> calling young people today a “generation trending toward post-literacy” that “gets its information from bits and bobs of video while scrolling.” While “post-literacy” might be a stretch, Snow and other experts are concerned that the decline in reading could make young people more susceptible to disinformation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s some evidence that this is already happening. US eighth-graders’ average score on the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/icils2023/international.asp\">International Computer and Information Literacy Study assessment</a>, which measures skills including recognizing reliable online sources, dropped 37 points between 2018 and 2023, to 482 out of a possible 700. American students fared worse on the assessment than students in most European countries, as well as South Korea and Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The decline in reading for pleasure can feel impossible to reverse, given the number of alternatives available to kids today. But experts say some simple strategies can help. For Snow, it’s about treating reading not simply as an academic skill to master, but “as a tool for engaging in important activities, like learning about things you&#8217;re interested in.” Reading can be a way to engage with the social justice issues that many tweens and teens are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/life/369953/skibidi-tweens-gen-alpha-brainrot-ipad-kids\">passionate about</a> — “but those connections are not always made in schools,” Snow said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also important to encourage students to read what they like, in the way they like, whether that’s in a book or on an iPad or other device, Cover said. More companies are springing up to create reading materials specifically for Gen Alpha audiences, like <a href=\"https://www.storyshares.org/\">Storyshares</a>, which offers books written by young people themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids “are reading in the world around them every single day,” Cover said. It’s up to educators to show them that “it&#8217;s not just something in isolation, but something that can enrich every other area of their life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I’m reading</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The accessories retailer Claire’s, a staple of many ’90s mall outings, is <a href=\"https://www.glossy.co/beauty/claires-double-downs-on-fragrance-to-target-gen-zalpha-consumers/?utm_campaign=glossydis&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=general-rss\">launching a fragrance collection</a> in an effort to appeal to what it calls “Gen Zalpha” customers. The scents, priced at $24.99 or less, include one that smells like pistachio and vanilla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schools in <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2024/11/education-policy/\">California</a> and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4988623-trump-return-colleges-universities-k-12-dei-trans-students/\">around the country</a> are racing to prepare for the Trump administration and its potential effects on undocumented and LGBTQ students.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health/385541/rfk-jr-trump-hhs-vaccines-fluoride\">Trump Health and Human Services pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> is correct that chronic diseases like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/health/rfk-chronic-diseases-children.html\">diabetes and asthma</a> are worryingly common in American children, according to the New York Times. He is wrong, however, to blame vaccines and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/369470/fluoride-iq-kids-brain-development-toothpaste-water-science-study\">fluoridated water</a> for the problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My 2-year-old and I have been enjoying <em><a href=\"https://www.littleowlsnight.com/\">Little Owl’s Night</a></em>, a very sweet board book that flips the bedtime story script by having its protagonist go to sleep when morning comes. It also includes the eerie line, “Mama, tell me again how night ends.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From my inbox</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last week, I asked about your kids’ experiences with reading, and one reader, Kelly, had an experience that might be helpful for kids who struggle with reading for fun. “Two of my four children have dyslexia, so we were a little slower to become a ‘read to yourself’ family,” Kelly wrote. “But audiobooks meant they still grew up loving reading from an early age&#8230; just in a different form.” The kids’ grandmother “introduced my then-3-year-old daughter to Peter Pan on audiobook on her iPod, earbuds attached, and my daughter was hooked,” Kelly wrote. “In the nine years since, we&#8217;ve checked out literal thousands of audiobooks on <a href=\"https://libbyapp.com/interview/welcome#doYouHaveACard\">Libby</a> — for free thanks to the Los Angeles Public Library — and my kids listen for several hours every day.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

With the newfound fame, the brothers aspired to make the world “suck less.”(Green credits their parents, both activists, for that passion.)&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-12_5fd0bf.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.232055519596,100,73.535888960808\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the intervening years, their YouTube following has grown to 3.8 million, and they have become genuine forces in global health philanthropy, organizing massive fundraising drives for their chosen causes and <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/podcast/john-green-vs-johnson-johnson-part-1/\">confronting global pharmaceutical giants</a>. These interests have inspired Green’s creative pursuits, including <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed\">the podcast <em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em></a> and its <a href=\"https://anthropocenereviewedbook.com/\">follow-up book</a>, both of which grapple with the world as humanity has made it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His next book, <a href=\"https://www.johngreenbooks.com/everything-is-tuberculosis\"><em>Everything Is Tuberculosis</em></a>, which is set to come out in March, will center on Green’s latest obsession: TB, the infectious disease that kills <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death\">more people than any other</a>. Last year, Green launched <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-advocates-pushed-big-pharma-to-cut-tuberculosis-drug-prices/\">a successful campaign</a> to pressure pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson to stop reported patent abuses that were inflating the cost of a lifesaving tuberculosis drug. He has also raised <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgQEKHBg5g0\">more than $35 million</a> for a Partners in Health project to reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone, which until <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/countries/sierra-leone/news/sierra-leones-determination-stem-maternal-and-child-mortality\">recently</a> had <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/sierraleone/maternal-neonatal-child-and-adolescent-health#:~:text=The%20maternal%20mortality%20rate%20in,in%20every%20100%2C000%20live%20births.\">the highest rate</a> of women dying in childbirth in the world. That money will help pay for a new government hospital set to open in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Green and I spoke in October about his humanitarian work, how it has complicated his awkward relationship with celebrity, and why he retains a stubborn optimism about humankind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You started Vlogbrothers with </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeAUQslfFP4\"><strong>this idea</strong></a><strong> that “We want to make the world suck less.” How do you conceptualize why the world sucks?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are ways that the world sucks that the world just sucks. This species has been around for 250,000 years; for 249,800 of those years, about half of children died before the age of 5. That just sucks. It&#8217;s completely unfair. It&#8217;s wildly unjust. But there was nothing that we could do about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ways the world sucks that most interest me are the ways the world sucks because of human-built systems, because those problems have human-buildable solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Your forthcoming book is called </strong><strong><em>Everything Is Tuberculosis</em></strong><strong>. What does that mean exactly?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128530/tuberculosis-vaccine-efficacy-solutions-tb-bcg\">Tuberculosis</a> is the deadliest infectious disease in the world. It kills <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/29-10-2024-tuberculosis-resurges-as-top-infectious-disease-killer\">about 1.3 million people</a> every year. It&#8217;s gonna kill over 100,000 people this month. All of those deaths are needless because we&#8217;ve had the cure to tuberculosis since the mid-1950s.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-13_626ff4.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,27.710962259551,100,44.578075480898\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What does it mean to live in that world? What does it mean to live in a world <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/28/17914344/tuberculosis-united-nations-funding-india-china\">where the deadliest infectious disease</a> has been curable since my father was born?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It means that we&#8217;re doing an extraordinarily poor job of distributing resources. Our systems of marshaling and distributing resources have obviously failed in this case. It&#8217;s clearly a human-built problem that has a human-buildable solution, which is encouraging to me. We are the cause of tuberculosis, which also means that we can be the cure of tuberculosis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I say in the book title that everything is tuberculosis, I really do mean it. Tuberculosis radically shaped American geography. It&#8217;s the reason that cities like Pasadena and Colorado Springs and <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/life/2015/07/20/ashevilles-growth-began-th-century-tb-treatment/30408281/\">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, exist. It&#8217;s the reason <a href=\"https://www.historicsantafe.org/imported-products/chasing-the-cure\">New Mexico</a> is a state. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wddYMBNv40o\">one of the reasons World War I happened</a>. It radically reshaped almost everything about our lives. It&#8217;s been this quiet force throughout human history that&#8217;s pushing us this way and that, that we often don&#8217;t notice, but it&#8217;s a really, really profound force in human history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I just listened to </strong><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-humanitys-temporal-range\"><strong>your podcast episode about humanity’s temporal range</strong></a><strong>. I&#8217;ve more than once heard you describe how your existence would be completely unrecognizable to somebody who lived a couple of centuries ago.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why is it so challenging for us to remember that context, the long history that has created the world in which we now live?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, in the dreary grind of daily living, as I think <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-penn-warren\">Robert Penn Warren</a> called it, it&#8217;s really hard to remember historical context because we&#8217;re busy trying to pay the mortgage and trying to make sure our kids get to school on time and trying to get them to eat some breakfast before they go. I feel that too. Believe me, I struggled to get my kids to eat breakfast this morning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s so easy to feel hopeless in our current moment. I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s unusually prone to despair. Maybe I&#8217;ve been fighting this for a long time, which is why I&#8217;m so focused on it. Part of the reason we feel despair is because we don&#8217;t see long-term change when we&#8217;re just looking at crisis after crisis after crisis after crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I try to contextualize my life and the world and our place in that world, I feel more hopeful because I see more examples that give me cause for hope. In the last 30 years, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24100883/child-mortality-rate-worldwide-united-nations\">we&#8217;ve reduced child mortality by over 50 percent</a>, the fastest decline in human history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, the last 30 years have sucked terribly. Both of these things are true at the same time and holding those competing ideas together is really challenging, but I also think it&#8217;s essential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You&#8217;ve touched on something I wanted to ask you about, that I think about a lot. I have three kids under the age of 6. They are ignorant of all of the world&#8217;s problems.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">God bless you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Something that we talk about at Future Perfect is </strong><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/fifty-six-percent-of-young-people-think-humanity-is-doomed/\"><strong>the perception among a lot of young people that the world sucks</strong></a><strong>, that it&#8217;s getting worse, and that it could end catastrophically, maybe even pretty soon, whether that&#8217;s because of climate change or some other existential risk.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What do you hear from your audience about their outlook on humanity&#8217;s future and how do you respond to their concerns? How do you resolve that tension for yourself?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of the people I hear from feel very hopeless and very scared, and they do feel like the world sucks and is getting worse. In important ways, they&#8217;re right, and I think it&#8217;s really important to acknowledge that they&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to have my high school graduation ruined by a global pandemic. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to see <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24113340/biden-housing-2024-election-campaign-renters-tenants-mortgage\">housing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/2023/10/6/23903808/student-loan-payments-debt-budget\">education</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/17/21024614/us-health-care-costs-medical-prices\">health care</a> all become progressively less affordable than they&#8217;ve ever been. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to grow up in the world that they&#8217;re growing up in.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-14_2e9677.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.343144408008,100,51.313711183984\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, they don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to grow up in a world where 12 million kids die every year before the age of 5, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24100883/child-mortality-rate-worldwide-united-nations\">whereas now fewer than 6 million do</a>. When I talk to young people about this, I try not to minimize their concerns because I think their concerns are real. Climate change is a catastrophe and it has the potential to be a catastrophe beyond our current imagining. There are profound and growing inequities in our world today. That&#8217;s all real.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But at the same time, it is also true that people have been predicting the end of the world since the moment that they realized the world might end. By the end of the world, of course, I don&#8217;t mean the end of life on Earth. Life on Earth will be just fine without us — arguably, from its perspective, better. I mean the end of humanity in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m very afraid of that. It&#8217;s my biggest fear because I think we are good news or have the potential to be good news. It&#8217;s my biggest fear because I think we&#8217;re the most interesting thing that ever happened to this planet. It&#8217;s my biggest fear because I love humanity and I think we&#8217;re worth fighting for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What exactly is the human endeavor?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We started out, as I think somebody once put it, as an animal of no consequence. Now we know approximately what&#8217;s keeping the stars apart and approximately how far away our star is from our planet. We know that we&#8217;re on a planet and we know that we can read <em>Hamlet</em> anytime we want. We can listen to Billie Holiday records and communicate with the dead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s a pretty impressive series of accomplishments to me and I think it&#8217;s worth celebrating. That&#8217;s what I mean by the human endeavor: the overall attempt by each member of our species to take care of each other and to push us forward in our knowledge and understanding of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I find our ability to make art everywhere all the time, no matter what, really fascinating and really encouraging. My son and I were just on a tour of World War I battle sites last week, and we saw all of this so-called trench art, which is art that was made in the trenches by soldiers on both sides of World War I, often taking exploded shells and carving onto them beautiful sunrises or landscapes or portraits. Some of these works of art are astonishing and nobody made those works of art hoping to get rich. Nobody made those works of art hoping to find an audience of millions of people. They made those works of art because there was value in the making and value in the sharing even if it was only sharing it with your buddies in the trenches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Last year, </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMhgw5SW0h4\"><strong>you targeted Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong></a><strong> for its patent practices and artificially inflating prices for life-saving treatments. That is a different tactic than encouraging people&#8217;s curiosity, empathy, and optimism. When is confrontation the right approach?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I really dislike any form of confrontation, including confrontation with big pharmaceutical companies that have a lot of power and employ a lot of nice people. I find that very stressful.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-15_56ecba.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.924216878161,100,68.151566243677\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But when Doctors Without Borders and Partners in Health and Treatment Action Group were all reaching out saying this is a huge problem and it&#8217;s making it really difficult for us to get the medicine to the people we need to get it to, I felt like I had to listen. I&#8217;m a big believer in listening to people who know a lot more than I do. That&#8217;s kind of the foundational concept of my philanthropy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ll be honest, I tried to have some private conversations [with Johnson &amp; Johnson], and they didn&#8217;t go anywhere. So then I felt the only conversation I can really have is a public conversation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was thinking about the people I&#8217;ve known who died of drug-resistant tuberculosis and feeling angry on their behalf, feeling frustrated by the systemic failures on their behalf. Maybe that gave me a little more strength of conviction than I might otherwise have had.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What is your project with Partners in Health in Sierra Leone?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our project is centered around the maternal mortality crisis, which is also a child mortality crisis because children are much more likely to die or otherwise experience serious disability and serious illness if their mothers die in childbirth. At the time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfpXgkKTwmg\">we started this in 2019</a>, Sierra Leone had the highest maternal mortality rate in the world. About 1 in 17 women could expect to die in pregnancy or childbirth, which wasn&#8217;t that different from the rate we would have seen 500 or 5,000 years ago. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the arguments that Partners in Health and our community wanted to make is that there are no excuses for not expanding access to maternal health care. That means not just in Sierra Leone — it means everywhere. But our hope is that this project could provide a blueprint for how to do that with more community health workers, with more nurses, and also ultimately with a world-class maternal care center at Koidu Government Hospital. That is where the lion&#8217;s share of the money that we&#8217;ve raised so far will go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the first time, there will be a neonatal intensive care unit. There will also be adequate operating theaters for emergency C-sections. So many people die in Sierra Leone for want of an emergency C-section, or they die because they have high blood pressure, or they die because of hemorrhaging after giving birth. All things that are very treatable in rich countries and that should be treatable no matter who you are or where you live.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Five years ago, when </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfpXgkKTwmg\"><strong>you were announcing your and Hank’s initial $6.5 million donation to Partners in Health</strong></a><strong> for the Sierra Leone project, you said you were trying to take lessons that you had learned from earlier philanthropic ventures and apply them to this effort in Sierra Leone. Now that you&#8217;ve had five more years of experience trying to stand this up, what else have you learned?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest thing I&#8217;ve learned is that when you get community buy-in, things go much better than when you don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of the people building the Maternal Center of Excellence are women. Most of the welders, the masons, the steel workers. But they all had to be trained. I had no idea about the complexity of that. That was something that never crossed my mind, that you&#8217;re going to need to train up a workforce alongside building a hospital. Now that turns out to be an amazingly good investment because those people now have skills that they&#8217;re going to take with them the rest of their lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People from rich countries or especially rich individuals kind of come into a community thinking that they have the solutions, which generally means that they don&#8217;t really understand the complexity of the problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How do you know when your work is effective?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We&#8217;re obsessed with quantifying the good that we&#8217;re doing, with testing it, with making sure that we can evaluate kids and making sure that we know that they&#8217;re learning what we think they&#8217;re learning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The risk is that it&#8217;s easy to conflate what is important with what is easily measurable. We need to be very careful not to apply what&#8217;s easily measurable and assume that it is therefore what&#8217;s most important.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-16_066c51.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,20.364516447693,100,59.270967104613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The obvious way that we measure the success of this project is by how many kids are surviving childbirth and how many mothers are surviving childbirth. But I also think you need to look at what, if anything, is the overall effect on reducing poverty. Is it improving educational access? Because we know that kids are more likely to be in school if their moms survive childbirth, but we haven&#8217;t yet proven that lower maternal mortality will lead to higher educational attainment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I want to look at that through a 20- or 30-year lens, not through a three- to five-year lens. I&#8217;m pretty tired of health care interventions that attempt to prove something in 18 months or with a three-year grant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What do you think is the biggest blind spot people today have that future generations will look back on and think, “What were they doing?”</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think there are a lot of ways that people in the future will look back on us and think, “How did they do that?” The way that we think, “How did they let everybody smoke on airplanes?” The way that we treat non-human animals, especially the animals that we consume as meat, will be one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ways we distribute resources and build systems will be another. I hope people of the future will be absolutely astonished that within a single country, depending on your zip code, your life expectancy <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/health/life-expectancy-by-county-study/index.html#:~:text=Life%20expectancy%20at%20birth%20differs,medical%20journal%20JAMA%20Internal%20Medicine\">could vary by 25 or 30 years</a>. I think people will be astonished that there were places where health care systems were so robust that someone like my brother could get diagnosed with cancer and be in remission within six months and other places where somebody diagnosed with that same cancer would be dead within six months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What advice do you have for ethically minded people who are trying to figure out how to contribute to this project of improving humanity?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, it&#8217;s so easy to get overwhelmed and have decision paralysis. There are so many problems and there are so many people trying to address them and it can be so <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17924288/future-perfect-explained\">hard to know who&#8217;s addressing them most effectively</a> or what the problems beneath all the other problems are. And that&#8217;s okay. I think it&#8217;s okay to pick a problem and trust that other people are going to be addressing other problems with the same passion and interest that you&#8217;re addressing yours.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-17_6642d6.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.228963271358,100,63.542073457285\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don&#8217;t labor under the delusion that tuberculosis is the biggest problem in the world or that it&#8217;s the only problem that we should be paying attention to. I just think it&#8217;s one that we should be paying attention to and it&#8217;s the one that I happen to pay attention to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My second piece of advice would be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23627382/progress-climate-change-poverty-global-health-doom-industrial-revolution-vaccines\">don&#8217;t listen to the doomsayers</a>. Don&#8217;t buy into the people who are telling you that none of this matters because it&#8217;s all worthless anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s a really compelling ethical argument in some ways because it&#8217;s so simple, it&#8217;s so straightforward. “This is all dumb.” “None of it matters.” “We should give up” is chef&#8217;s kiss from the perspective of wanting to have an explanation that has extraordinary explanatory power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem with despair, of course, is that it&#8217;s untrue, like any super-simplistic worldview. Fight against despair and believe that together we can make the world better for each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Please do not judge me: I love U2, and therefore I love Bono. I think he&#8217;s a notable example of how perilous this transition can be from pop-culture curio to being an actual expert who can influence even more influential people.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, I think about Bono a lot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Okay, there you go. How have you managed that transition?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I want to approach it with real humility because you can do so much unintended damage when you have a lot of power and when you have a really loud voice. It&#8217;s so easy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My brother described it to me once as having a giant robot suit. I have this giant robot suit and it makes me super powerful. But when I walk around, it&#8217;s really easy for me to step on houses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ve been given a lot of power, and I don&#8217;t think that I should have it, to be honest with you. I think that our social order gives way too much power to celebrities, even like seventh-tier celebrities like myself. It freaks me out and I think we should be freaked out by it. I just try to remember that I&#8217;m very, very rarely the smartest person in the room.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do you see a unifying thread across your work, from </strong><strong><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em></strong><strong> to </strong><strong><em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em></strong><strong> and Vlogbrothers to the maternal health project in Sierra Leone?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m trying to make the case that humanity is worth it. That humanity is worth the trial and travail and suffering and injustice and oppression, the catastrophe and horrors that we visit upon ourselves and each other. That, despite all of that, it&#8217;s a blessing to be here and humanity can be good news. I really believe that. I don&#8217;t know that we are good news, but I think we can be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don&#8217;t want to sound too pretentious about it, but I need to make that case for myself as much as I need to make it for anybody else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What do you mean by that?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m very prone to desperate hopelessness, and I need every morning to be able to make the case to myself that it&#8217;s a good idea to get out of bed and go on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You talk about resiliency being one of humanity&#8217;s defining traits.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I love how resilient we are. We&#8217;re so underrated as a species, Dylan. It drives me crazy. Does anybody think raccoons would be better at having this kind of power? Does anybody think dolphins would be better at having this kind of power? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/06/health/evidence-puts-dolphins-in-new-light-as-killers.html\">Have you read about dolphins?</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which is not to say in any way that we aren&#8217;t terrible. I want to be clear that I&#8217;m very pissed off. I&#8217;m infuriated by humanity&#8217;s many failures. What kind of insanity is it to have the deadliest infectious disease in the world be something that we&#8217;ve known how to cure for 75 years? That&#8217;s monstrous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s just that we rate ourselves so lowly. There&#8217;s a lot to recommend about us.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

One thing led to another, and I had spent less than I’d planned on a nicer watch than I thought I could afford. The catch: It was refurbished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The “r” word used to be a bad one in the gadget world. A decade ago, to many people, refurbished meant used, scuffed, and maybe a little bit broken. Secondhand devices didn’t always have the best reputation. However, as <a href=\"https://pirg.org/campaigns/right-to-repair/\">the right to repair movement</a> has pushed consumer technology companies to make their products easier to fix, a new crop of marketplaces for used and refurbished goods has captured the attention of anyone who either loves a deal or cares about the environment, or both. And these cheaper options are better than ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You may have heard of <a href=\"https://www.backmarket.com/en-us\">Back Market</a>, a Paris-based refurbished marketplace that promises to sell you “tech that’s better for the planet.” Then there are more specialized sites, like <a href=\"https://www.gazelle.com/\">Gazelle</a>, which primarily sells refurbished phones and laptops, and <a href=\"https://vipoutlet.com/\">VIP Outlet</a>, which specializes in refurbishing retail returns. <a href=\"https://www.decluttr.com/\">Decluttr</a> sells old CDs and DVDs alongside refurbished tablets and gaming consoles. Even big retailers, including Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and Best Buy, are in the refurbished marketplace game now, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prices and warranties vary, based on what you&#8217;re buying and when, but no matter where you shop, purchasing secondhand <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/refurbished-iphones-market-apple-sales-slump-android-cell-phones-cheaper-2024-10\">comes with a certain cachet</a>. It’s the sensible thing to do, according to Lucas Gutterman, director of the Designed to Last Campaign at the US PIRG Education Fund.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s not a bad thing for people to buy new phones,” Gutterman told me. “It’s just the idea that we should buy them every year, every other year — that seems like it&#8217;s way too much for the environment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We certainly can’t make an infinite amount of devices with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7031243/china-grip-rare-earth-metals-supply-weakening\">the finite number of rare earth metals</a> on this planet. And extending the lives of phones already on the market comes with huge upside. A <a href=\"https://labo.societenumerique.gouv.fr/en/articles/environmental-impact-of-smartphones-what-benefits-of-reconditioning-relate-to-nine/\">recent study</a> from the French government claimed that buying a refurbished phone instead of a new one avoids the extraction of 180 pounds of raw materials and emitted 50 pounds of greenhouse gasses. Put differently, buying the refurbished device over the new one lowers the overall environmental impact by as much as 91 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taking the refurbished route wasn’t always framed as a way to fight climate change. The practice grew out of corporate IT departments&#8217; constant need to supply machines to employees in the early days of personal computers. If an employee left the company, rather than buy a new computer, IT wiped their machines, repaired it if needed, and then assigned it to a new employee. It didn’t take long before a cottage industry emerged to sell used but restored devices to consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That industry is now huge and getting bigger every year. The number of used and refurbished smartphone shipments <a href=\"https://www.telecoms.com/mobile-devices/used-smartphone-market-shipments-topped-300-million-in-2023\">grew nearly 10 percent</a> from 2022 to 2023, while the number of new smartphone shipments declined by over 3 percent, according to the market intelligence firm IDC. That adds up to the secondary market for phones being worth about $65 billion in 2023, and it&#8217;s expected to grow to nearly $110 billion by 2027.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These big numbers reflect an industry that’s gone from mom-and-pop shops selling fixed-up laptops to multiple mainstream marketplaces where millions of people buy everything from phones and computers to watches and video game consoles. The competition between those marketplaces also means that quality and customer experience is vastly improved. Now, refurbished gadgets often come with the same long warranties, trade-in options, and payment plans as new devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One surprising thing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The logistics of online shopping <a href=\"https://earth.org/online-shopping-and-its-environmental-impact/\">comes with a significant carbon footprint</a>. However, the original manufacturing process for devices like phones are much more significant. Shipping a phone in a 1-pound package 500 miles <a href=\"https://consumerecology.com/carbon-footprint-of-package-shipping-transport/#:~:text=The%20carbon%20footprint%20of%20a,0.98%20kg%20CO2e.\">produces</a> about 1.3 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions. Manufacturing an iPhone 16 Plus, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/iphone/iPhone_16_and_iPhone_16_Plus_PER_Sept2024.pdf\">according to Apple</a>, produces 110 to 167 pounds of emissions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, the latest devices tend to have fewer new features that would make upgrading worthwhile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People are less excited about getting another camera lens on their phone or getting a new button on the side of the iPhone,” Gutterman said. Spending less on a refurbished phone and feeling better about your environmental impact is just a better choice for a growing number of people, he explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The refurbished market is also more transparent than it’s ever been. It all starts with a gadget that ended up in the inventory of a refurbisher or original equipment manufacturer. Often, it’s simply a device <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apple-and-the-carriers-want-your-old-iphone-4279cc8d\">that someone else traded in</a> or sent back for a warranty or insurance claim. Both refurbishers and manufacturers refurbish these kinds of devices by wiping them, fixing any hardware issues, repairing any cosmetic damage, cleaning them, and boxing them back up. (This can happen several times over the lifespan of a product.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then the device goes on the market. Most marketplaces also give you options to buy items in different conditions, from poor to premium, at different prices. Some devices sold on the secondhand market are actually new, too. Cleland explained to me that some of the inventory that ends up in the refurbishers’ hands includes products that were sold and returned but never used.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s thanks, in part, to the boom in online returns, especially since the pandemic, which has led to a liquidation market <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddbb2nPwC-c\">worth hundreds of billions of dollars</a> that’s finding new homes for all kinds of secondhand goods, from furniture to construction equipment. For phones and tablets, there’s even a <a href=\"https://www.ctia.org/news/ctia-updates-wireless-device-grading-standard-to-help-extend-the-lifecycle-of-pre-owned-wireless-devices\">standardized method for grading the condition of used devices</a> to streamline the process of reselling and refurbishing them. It all adds up to better, cheaper secondhand goods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s estimated now that anytime a new iPhone comes out, it&#8217;s going to have at least three different users over its lifespan, because it&#8217;s going to get either traded or dropped and then resold,” <a href=\"https://www.ctia.org/news/blog-member-spotlight-meet-sean-cleland-of-b-stock-solutions\">Sean Cleland</a>, vice president of mobile at the marketplace B-Stock Solutions, told me. “Like, back in the day, people would just put their old phone in the drawer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you zoom out, what’s happening with refurbished phones and other electronics is a shining example of what a circular economy can do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A circular economy aims to keep products in use as long as possible through refurbishing, repairing, and recycling <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/5-opportunities-circular-economy\">to conserve resources</a> and open up new economic opportunities. While the term has been around since the late 1980s, the circular economy concept has gained popularity in recent years. The European Union even adopted a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en\">circular economy action plan in 2020</a> that set forth a number of policies and strategies to promote sustainable development. These government incentives have perhaps helped marketplaces such as the Back Market to thrive in France and across Europe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Going circular and finding ways to reuse the old inventory to create new things, I think, is necessary,” Cleland said. “As resources dip but consumer demand increases, you’ve got to figure out a new way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">American companies are embracing the circular economy model as well. Amazon now has Amazon Renewed, which launched in 2017 and features the same fast shipping you get with other Amazon products as well as a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4ZAA22U35N373NX\">90-day free return policy</a>, which goes up to one year for some premium products. Meanwhile, eBay offers a <a href=\"https://pages.ebay.com/refurbishedprogramwarranty/index.html\">two-year warranty</a> on certified refurbished products, which are delivered like new, as well as one year on lower-grade used goods. Walmart Restored similarly has a <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/help/article/walmart-restored/1cd5cc0c3cef40c79a4b2305890b1370\">one-year minimum warranty</a> on premium refurbished goods, and 90 days on everything else. Target sells items refurbished by the original manufacturer with a <a href=\"https://www.target.com/c/target-refurbished-pre-owned/-/N-l6d4n\">six-month minimum warranty</a>. Back Market’s warranty is <a href=\"https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/legal/warranty\">good for one year</a> across the board.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Warranty is only one factor to consider when choosing where to buy refurbished goods, says PIRG’s Gutterman. You should avoid buying refurbished items that aren’t designed to last, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/9/16/23875582/apple-airpod-repair-battery-right-to-repair-act\">like Apple AirPods</a>, as well as bulky items like TVs, which can be easily damaged. You should also make sure manufacturers still support software updates on older devices. Here’s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphone-models-compatible-with-ios-18-iphe3fa5df43/ios\">a list of iPhone models</a> that support the latest iOS 18 software, for instance. (You can find more tips in this recently updated <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/fixed-for-the-holidays/\">guide to buying — and gifting — refurbished products</a> that Gutterman co-authored.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re like me, you might just want to find the best deal. My Apple Watch battery is starting to fail, so I’m actually thinking about <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/watch/repair\">getting it repaired</a> or getting a new one. Since the market for refurbished gadgets has blown up so much in the past few years, I have more options to upgrade than I did a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as much as I’d like to try the new features, it might feel better to trade mine in, let it find its way to a new owner, and live a little longer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story was also published in the Vox Technology newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here</a></em></strong><em>&nbsp;so you don’t miss the next one!</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Her music has been nearly inescapable in the last year, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGd4efgdPA\">from a sultry feature</a> on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/354634/charli-xcx-brat-album-review\">Charli XCX’</a>s “Guess” remix to the emotive “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW8VLC9nnTo\">What Was I Made For</a>” for the blockbuster <em>Barbie </em>movie. But arguably one of her biggest — yet under-recognized —&nbsp;achievements is making caring about animal welfare more accessible <em>… </em>and cool<em>.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-06_758c61.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,28.917038546681,100,42.165922906638\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A vegan of almost a decade, Eilish has dedicated a large portion of her career to improving the music industry’s sustainability, as well as encouraging her fans to consider plant-based diets. While she grew up vegetarian and had never eaten meat, she understands what it means to give up something you enjoy: Dairy was a fixture in her family’s life. “With dairy, my God, did I love cheese and milk,” <a href=\"https://lamag.com/music/billie-eilish-december-cover-story-growing-up\">she told Los Angeles Magazine</a><em> </em>in 2023. “I was very, very against going vegan. [Then] my mom went vegan, then my brother, then my dad. I was the only one not vegan for years.”<br><br>The shift came as she learned about the horrifying consequences of the meat and dairy industries. Researchers estimate that animal agriculture is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline\">between 15 and 20 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions and takes up more than a third of the planet’s <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/global-land-for-agriculture\">habitable land</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics\">The factory farm system</a> brutally kills more than <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/billions-of-chickens-ducks-and-pigs-are-slaughtered-for-meat-every-year\">80 billion</a> land animals a year, as Future Perfect has long reported — animals that are crammed in tiny cages, forced to endure cruel abuses, and generally never go outside. It also takes a toll on the communities living near factory farms. One <a href=\"https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/nc-residents-living-near-large-hog-farms-have-elevated-disease-death-risks?h=nl\">study</a> found that in eastern North Carolina — a major <a href=\"https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Poultry/brlmap.php\">chicken</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=108733\">pig</a> factory farm state —&nbsp;residents who live near these farms experience higher rates of kidney disease and infant mortality compared to other rural residents. Workers, too, face higher risks of exposure to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362271/factory-farming-climate-movement-public-health-pandemics\">potential new viruses</a>: So far, sick workers account for nearly all of California’s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/us-news/california-bird-flu-general-news-230d0b315960ed895b62525806f4cde9\">cattle-to-human transmissions of bird flu</a> in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;Once you know that kind of thing and you see it, it&#8217;s really hard to go back,&#8221; Eilish said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVpAp3A8Ed8&amp;t=106s\">2021 video interview with Vogue</a><em>.</em> &#8220;And now, even though I have lots of friends that eat dairy and meat and I don&#8217;t ever want to tell anybody what to do, I just can&#8217;t go on in my life knowing what&#8217;s going on in the animal world and like, not doing anything about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Celebrity advocacy often boils down to raising awareness, which can be effective, especially when you have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/billieeilish/\">120 million Instagram</a> followers and a sold-out 83-stop world tour. Eilish, the first singer born in the 21st century to have a single top the Billboard 100, also has a palpable Gen Z<em> </em>je nais se quoi when talking about animal rights. She’s relatable. When she went on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDr4ITrp7YI\">YouTube talk show <em>Hot Ones</em></a><em> </em>(where guests are challenged to eat spicy chicken wings) five years ago<em>,</em> she joked about growing up with the internet and bad talent shows, all while noshing on very spicy (vegan!) chicken nuggets and without making a big deal about the swap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Vegans have a reputation of being incredibly annoying,” she told <a href=\"https://lamag.com/music/billie-eilish-december-cover-story-growing-up\">Los Angeles Magazine</a>. “And a lot of the time, they are. Sorry. Because you know why? Nobody wants to be told what to do … I want it to be clear that I’m not preaching.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Eilish’s work for animals also extends far beyond just speaking up about the conditions in <a href=\"https://www.speciesunite.com/news-stories/billie-eilish-speak-out-against-horrendous-animal-agriculture\">factory farms</a> or <a href=\"https://www.idausa.org/campaign/wild-animals-and-habitats/latest-news/media-release-billie-eilish-wants-to-save-abused-memphis-zoo-pandas/\">zoos</a>. She subtly nudges her fans to make more environmentally friendly choices by spotlighting her <a href=\"https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/billie-eilishs-favorite-restaurants/\">120 favorite vegan restaurants</a> in tour cities, ensuring that <a href=\"https://store.billieeilish.com/pages/sustainability?srsltid=AfmBOoowSYB0Txl1Vj058dMjCXQl4Z3lbRT-1bTmJVBm3owPFPMnzBGf\">plant-based meals are available at every venue</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/billie-eilish-sustainability-eco-friendly-initiatives-mom-1235642455/\">limiting her merch drops</a> to focus on affordable, sustainable options.

The fashion industry&nbsp;— from wool to leather to down —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.collectivefashionjustice.org/non-humans\">maims and kills billions</a> of animals for clothing and footwear every year. There’s also a pervasive <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24008053/wool-marketing-environment-sustainable-claims-sheep-animal-cruelty-fast-fashion\">misconception</a> that fabrics like leather and wool are merely byproducts of meat production, rather than co-products that make up a meaningful share of animal agriculture’s profits. The problem has only accelerated with the normalization of hyperconsumerism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.speciesunite.com/news-stories/billie-eilish-launches-vegan-nike-air-force-ones\">Eilish worked with Nike</a> to create the first vegan leather Air Force 1 sneakers, made with 18 percent recycled materials. More notably, when Eilish was a co-chair for the Met Gala in 2021, she pushed for designer Oscar de la Renta to permanently stop using fur — otherwise she wouldn’t work with them. They did.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That was really important to me,” <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/billie-eilish-sustainability-eco-friendly-initiatives-mom-1235642455/\">Eilish told Billboard</a>. “It’s tough as a person who loves fashion. I’ve tried to be a big advocate of no animal products in clothing and it’s hard. People really like classic things. I get it, I’m one of them. But what’s more important: things being original or our kids being able to live on the planet and them having kids?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To Eilish, veganism isn’t a diet. It’s a way of interacting with the world. Change can be as small as opting for a mushroom burger at a concert or as big as changing an entire business model. In a culture increasingly shaped by celebrity tastes and influence, Eilish stands out as one who is using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzeWc3zh01g\">her power</a> for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

By the time the film was released in 2023, Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin&#8217;s nuclear saber-rattling had thrust atomic anxieties back into public consciousness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The timing was coincidental, but it highlighted precisely why Nolan&#8217;s recent work matters: He creates true blockbusters that force audiences to grapple with humanity&#8217;s most profound existential challenges.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Nolan_01_8a0d1a.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=27.269010416667,0,45.461979166667,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Oppenheimer</em>, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24093819/oppenheimer-oscar-winner-nuclear-war-christopher-nolan-los-alamos-manhattan-project-academy-awards\">won both Best Picture and Best Director</a> in 2024, represented the culmination of Nolan&#8217;s long-running artistic exploration of how scientific advancement can simultaneously fulfill humanity&#8217;s greatest hopes and create its most terrible dangers. The film chronicles J. Robert Oppenheimer&#8217;s journey from brilliant theoretical physicist to &#8220;father of the atomic bomb,&#8221; capturing both the intoxicating intellectual achievements of the Manhattan Project — what Oppenheimer himself <a href=\"https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/j_robert_oppenheimer_159316\">called</a> the “technically sweet” — and the moral horror of unleashing nuclear weapons on the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;Part of the intention of the film is to reiterate the unique and extraordinary danger of nuclear weapons. That&#8217;s something we should all be thinking about all the time and care about very, very deeply,&#8221; Nolan <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-07/an-extended-interview-with-christopher-nolan-director-of-oppenheimer/\">told</a> the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists<em> </em>last year. But beyond just raising awareness, the director aimed to strip away decades of dry policy papers and arcane philosophical frameworks that have normalized the existence of nuclear arsenals quite literally capable of destroying the world. In <em>Oppenheimer</em>, Nolan renewed the terror at the heart of these weapons viewed through the eyes of those scientists who oversaw their terrible birth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This focus on making existential risk real and immediate rather than abstract has been found throughout Nolan&#8217;s recent work. His 2014 film <em>Interstellar</em> envisioned humanity&#8217;s desperate search for habitable planets as environmental catastrophe renders Earth increasingly uninhabitable. 2020’s <em>Tenet</em>, released in the teeth of the Covid pandemic, explored themes of technological knowledge that, once uncovered, cannot be put back in the box. (And even if you struggle, as I initially did, with <em>Tenet</em>’s non-linear chronology, you can appreciate how great stars John David Washington and Robert Pattinson <a href=\"https://variety.com/video/tenet-costumes-jeffrey-kurland/\">look in those suits</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His films refuse to paint scientists as either heroes or villains, instead showing them as brilliant but fallible humans wrestling with the consequences of their discoveries — consequences we all now have to live with. But <em>Oppenheimer</em> represented his most direct confrontation yet with how scientific progress creates unprecedented moral burdens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The film’s pivotal moment — the moment that initially inspired Nolan to begin the project — comes when Oppenheimer&#8217;s team at Los Alamos <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/11/23827500/trinity-site-oppenheimer-nuclear-missiles-christopher-nolan-manhattan-project\">realizes</a> there was a small but real possibility that the first nuclear test might ignite the atmosphere and destroy all life on Earth. After some debate — with Matt Damon’s brusque Gen. Leslie Groves playing the shocked audience surrogate — they proceed anyway. &#8220;That struck me as the most dramatic situation in the history of the world,&#8221; Nolan told the Bulletin. &#8220;That&#8217;s a responsibility that nobody else in the history of the world had ever faced.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What makes Nolan&#8217;s treatment of these weighty themes remarkable is his insistence on tackling them through the lens of mass-market entertainment rather than niche documentary. He employs the cutting edge of big-budget filmmaking — from practical effects to IMAX cameras — to make abstract dangers feel immediate and real. For <em>Oppenheimer</em>, he even <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/christopher-nolan-claims-his-nuclear-explosion-film-oppenheimer-has-zero-cgi-shots-101688805750030.html#:~:text=Nolan%20confirms%20there's%20no%20CGI,of%20New%20Mexico%20in%201945.\">refused</a> to use computer graphics for the nuclear explosions, believing that only practical effects could convey the genuine terror such weapons should inspire. And audiences’ reactions <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/oppenheimer-movie-trinity-test-christopher-nolan-audience-reaction/\">proved him right</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-28_87c7bd.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.944126436126,100,52.111747127747\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The approach has proved remarkably effective at reaching audiences that might otherwise tune out discussions of existential risk — and as someone who has <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/bryan-walsh/end-times/9780316449618/?lens=hachette-books\">written a book</a> on precisely that subject, I can tell you that’s no easy feat<em>. Oppenheimer</em> earned over $950 million globally while sparking <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/news/hollywood-voices-sound-alarm-on-nuclear-threat-as-oppenheimer-sweeps-the-academy-awards/\">meaningful public discourse</a> about nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The director&#8217;s greatest concern now is how easily society can normalize even the most terrible risks, and why it is so important to fight back. When he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlJXZzSLIjA\">accepted</a> a BAFTA award for <em>Oppneheimer</em>, Nolan told the audience, “Our film ends on what is a dramatically necessary note of despair, but in the world all kinds of individuals and organizations have fought long and hard to reduce the number of nuclear weapons.” Still, he continued, “of late, that has gone the wrong way,” as the nuclear arms control regime <a href=\"https://time.com/6334258/putin-nuclear-arms-control/\">teeters on collapse</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through films that marry entertainment with ethical weight, Nolan has emerged as one of Hollywood&#8217;s most effective voices for keeping humanity&#8217;s greatest challenges squarely in the public consciousness. He reminds us that existential risks aren&#8217;t just abstract policy issues — they&#8217;re profound human dramas that demand our attention and moral consideration. In an era when many choose to look away from humanity&#8217;s gravest threats, Nolan insists we look directly at them, in all their terrifying scope and complexity. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

All of it is enough to make a person freeze with fear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is a flip side to this terror.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-25_fa8280.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,2.3133016084326,100,95.373396783135\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such an all-consuming problem inherently requires innovative solutions and adaptations of epic proportions. So here’s another exercise: Close your eyes and think, what could a world that hasn’t just taken the climate crisis seriously but also risen to the challenge look like?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Envisioning a better future in the face of serious climate threats might seem like lofty daydreaming, especially when we take into consideration our <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23864312/climate-change-stocktake-cop28-dubai\">world</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/373316/plastics-microplastics-humans-water-environment-health\">leaders’</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22434172/us-cbd-treaty-biological-diversity-nature-conservation\">inaction</a>. But Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist and climate policy wonk, has spent much of her career dreaming and coming up with climate solutions — and she knows that nihilism and avoidance won’t get us anywhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In her recently published book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645855/what-if-we-get-it-right-by-ayana-elizabeth-johnson/\"><em>What If We Get It Right?: Visions of Climate Futures</em></a><em>, </em>Johnson tackles how we can transform our ways of being, thinking, and doing to stop the worst of climate change. She expertly intertwines her conversations with scientists, artists, and activists to create a practical and accessible guidebook for a more just future brimming with possibilities — a salve for even the most environmentally anxious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Peril and possibility coexist,” she writes in the book. Of course, she’s well aware of just how big of an environmental mess our world is in, but you won’t catch her dwelling on the worst-case scenarios for long. “We’re pretty fucked,” Johnson said in her September <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374637/climate-ayana-elizabeth-johnson-what-if-we-get-it-right-gray-area\">interview</a> on Vox’s <em>The Gray Area</em>, “but there’s a lot we could do to have a better possible future.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"What if we get climate change right? by The Gray Area with Sean Illing\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP1736669009\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Johnson is particularly adept at speaking to those who know the climate crisis is real but have the instinct to bury their head in the sand at the thought of such a massive existential crisis.<strong> </strong>Though she is frank about the state of our world’s environmental health, she speaks and writes with an energizing clarity — whether it’s conversing with climate advocates for her <a href=\"https://ayanaelizabeth.substack.com/podcast\">book tour</a> or breaking down big environmental questions as a co-host of the podcast <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/episodes\"><em>How to Save a Planet</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s Johnson’s understanding of our instinct to flee the climate problems that has made it essential for her to explore the possibilities to address it and take action that goes beyond protesting or voting. These are important measures, Johnson believes, but also broad ones that aren’t necessarily fine-tuned to our individual experiences, skills, and interests. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Johnson, a Brooklyn native who calls the ocean her love before it became her career, that looked like co-founding <a href=\"https://urbanoceanlab.org/\">Urban Ocean Lab</a> (UOL) in 2018. The nonprofit think tank specializes in researching coastal cities in the United States — places that <a href=\"https://urbanoceanlab.org/resource/coastal-cities\">one in five Americans call home</a> and are often vulnerable to some of the worst environmental disasters — and developing equitable, pragmatic policy recommendations for these regions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One such recommendation is UOL’s <a href=\"https://urbanoceanlab.org/climate-readiness-framework\">climate readiness framework</a> for coastal cities. It’s a comprehensive collection of over 70 actions that coastal communities can apply to better adapt to current and future climate risks, such as working with community-based organizations to strengthen disaster preparedness plans and developing home relocation programs for low-income residents and people of color living in climate-vulnerable places.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Johnson_01_193dc5.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.097077749844,100,73.805844500311\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Caribbean region in particular has a special place in Johnson’s heart — her late father hailed from Jamaica, whose <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2021/06/conservation-solutions-in-paradise-jamaicas-oracabessa-bay-fishing-sanctuary/#:~:text=The%20increase%20in%20pollutants%20like,Photo%20by%20Gladstone%20Taylor.\">waters have suffered from pollution and overfishing</a>. “To me, ocean conservation is in part about cultural preservation,” she writes after reflecting on her father’s life between Jamaica and New York City. “We are losing something more fundamental than a meal: a way of life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It makes sense that Johnson has also worked to improve the waters surrounding these islands. Prior to founding UOL, she led an ocean management policy project called the Blue Halo Initiative at the Waitt Institute, where she served as executive director. Starting in <a href=\"https://www.waittinstitute.org/blue-halo-barbuda\">Barbuda</a> in 2013, Johnson focused on engaging with the community, interviewing hundreds of fishers and residents to develop policy recommendations for better preserving the waters and the species within it. Just a year later, the <a href=\"https://www.blueclimateinitiative.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/Johnson%20et%20al%202020%20-%20Barbuda%20ocean%20zoning%20-%20Marine%20Policy%20(1).pdf\">Barbuda Council signed into law</a> a set of ocean zoning policies to protect underwater ecosystems and ensure sustainable fishing. These efforts were soon replicated in Montserrat and Curaçao.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Johnson’s reverence for the ocean and the career she’s made out of it has made its way into the American political sphere, too. Back in 2019, the Green New Deal, a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">set of proposed progressive climate policies</a>, was supported by left-leaning candidates up and down the ballot. Johnson had just one issue with it: It left out our seas almost entirely. “I was feeling bummed about the ocean getting short shrift in the Green New Deal Resolution — just a single, vague reference to the ocean,” Johnson wrote in <em>What If We Get It Right?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That summer, Johnson co-authored an op-ed in Grist about this <a href=\"https://grist.org/article/the-big-blue-gap-in-the-green-new-deal/\">big blue gap</a> and what solutions to fill it with. Within that year, Johnson was contacted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign to help write what would become the <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/blue-new-deal\">Blue New Deal</a>, an official policy platform for the Warren campaign. It was an extensive list of actions, like expanding marine protected areas, building climate-smart ports, and holding Big Agriculture accountable for water pollution. When Johnson later met Sen. Warren, she wrote in <em>What If We Get It Right? </em>that “[Senator Warren] told me it was the plan that got the most excited mentions in her selfie lines.” And while Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination and the election, his administration became the first to put out a federal <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ocean-Climate-Action-Plan_Final.pdf\">Ocean Climate Action</a> plan — which included similar elements to the Blue New Deal — after dozens of businesses and organizations (including UOL) pushed the White House to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a lot of studies that show engaging with nature helps our physical and mental well-being, so it’s not surprising that conserving our environment is important for many people. One word that Johnson often uses and embodies is “biophilia”: a love for nature and life, and in her words, “a powerful driving force for conservation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With this in mind, I have one more exercise for you: Think of moments you’ve felt biophilia. Maybe you once walked through a lush forest, swam in a pristine lake, or witnessed snow-capped mountains up close. Perhaps you’ve encountered one of the millions of amazing creatures that inhabit these ecosystems. But how can one hold onto this sense of biophilia if much of our ways of life are destroying the very essence of it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s all the more reason not to let our worries immobilize us and instead try to get it right, just as Johnson has done. Her wide-ranging expertise on climate policy; deeply empathetic and inclusive lens for climate solutions; and her unwavering, contagious biophilia has made her a bold visionary to follow in the climate space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How apt that a lover of the ocean is making waves. <em>—Sam Delgado</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

I spoke with Dragsdahl last month to find out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-02_667825.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.298751892013,100,79.402496215975\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His secret, it turns out, is diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dragsdahl and his vegetarian society colleagues spent years building a coalition of farmers, scientists, and organic food advocates, emphasizing shared values — sustainability and food innovation — instead of differences, like the merits of vegetarianism. This big-tent approach appealed to politicians, including not just members of left-wing parties but also politicians on the right, one of whom called the country’s plant-based action plan an “intelligent idea,” according to Dragsdahl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That, I think, shows the fact that we and other stakeholders have somehow managed to mainstream this,” he told me. “There are still ideological battles and clearly we’re not done, but we have to a large extent managed to get many people to see that this should also be a part of Danish agriculture and that it should be stronger. That there’s actual potential in this. That there’s no need to fight over more plants.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My conversation with Dragsdahl has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What role does meat play in Danish society?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s really a centerpiece of food culture, of Danish culture. There are many social events, whether it&#8217;s football events — people will have their hot dogs — and when they&#8217;re grilling in the summer.<s>&nbsp;</s></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apart from food culture … Denmark is a very agricultural nation. We are the most cultivated country in the world, <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.ARBL.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true\">together with Bangladesh</a>, in terms of the [percentage of the] surface of the land being cultivated, because the country is very flat, so you can say it&#8217;s suitable for this.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Rune_01_dfb536.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=25.37890625,0,49.2421875,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even though the country might be suitable, you can over-cultivate it. And that is the problem — we have severe <a href=\"https://eng.mst.dk/nature/biodiversity#\">biodiversity loss</a> here, severe eutrophication. … So it&#8217;s definitely damaging the local environment here. But for many decades, it has been difficult to do anything about it because at least some people have felt we are an agricultural nation. It&#8217;s in our blood, that&#8217;s who we are. And livestock is an integral part of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So there are things here, both culturally but also politically. And there’s this universal pride for people — that <a href=\"https://dairynews.today/milkypedia/country/dk/\">Danish dairy, Danish butter</a>, is being exported to the whole world… But also, of course, <a href=\"https://www.pig333.com/latest_swine_news/leading-european-pork-exporters-to-third-countries_20205/\">bacon and pork products</a>. But that has been increasingly questioned in the last 10 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What happened to lay the groundwork for the plant-based action plan?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2019, we got the idea to start something we call the <a href=\"https://vegetarisk.dk/english/#our-work\">Danish Network for Plant Proteins</a>. You make such a network, really, to make people feel welcome no matter where they&#8217;re from. … We had hard-hitting scientists, we had inspiring startups, we had interesting content — but always in a friendly and warm and pragmatic tone. And that meant that even the farming association [the Danish Agriculture and Food Council] attended. They later came back to us a month later and told us that they liked our approach. We don&#8217;t agree about scaling down livestock production, but they did agree that we could work together on how to look more into plant-based [food production] to diversify Danish agriculture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When they did that, it almost immediately eliminated any opposition from a large part of the political spectrum. So maybe some of the resistance in the right wing became neutral, and some of the hesitance among the parties in the center of Danish politics became slightly positive. And that was extremely helpful because you move the entire playing field. And then, of course, the parties which are even more progressive on the center and center-left wing, they can push even harder for it and get the middle parties on board without the right wing making a big fuss about it. And the farmers’ association was definitely important for that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think we have really successfully been insisting that plant-based is both the whole foods plant-based and the processed [foods] and everything in between. And by insisting on that, we&#8217;re getting less opposition between the people who just want everything to be home-cooked and believe children should be taught how to cook their own vegetables again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These solutions are both needed, and there [are] also places in between. There might be processed products that imitate meat but that are processed in milder ways. I think many of the Danish startups in this space are actually trying to find these kinds of solutions. So that has been a way to get many different kinds of people on board.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What kind of plant-based projects have been awarded funding?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far, around <a href=\"https://plantefonden.lbst.dk/Media/638578408946707699/Tilsagnskatalog_2023_Fonden_for_Plantebaserede_F%C3%B8devarer.pdf\">35 projects</a> have been granted [in each of two rounds].&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-04_f1fce6.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.290649562807,100,51.418700874386\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the first round, the Hospitality School of Copenhagen got funding for a vegetarian chef&#8217;s degree. They got the funding for developing a curriculum that the government could then approve as acceptable for a new chef&#8217;s degree — which does not have any meat — and that degree becomes part of the government system, so it becomes a formal government education. But they could not have done it without getting funding to develop the curriculum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the second round, some [agricultural] schools applied for funding for developing a curriculum on legumes, but also to teach the professionals in the kitchens at the farmer schools how to include more legumes in the foods eaten by the young farmers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What else should people know about Denmark’s efforts to build a more plant-based food system?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Denmark is not paradise. [People] will have this excuse — they&#8217;ll say, “This is just Denmark, Denmark is always ahead on everything.” But that&#8217;s not the full story. And I think that&#8217;s the important part to be told here. This happened in the country with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/03/embarrassing-denmark-forced-to-u-turn-on-meat-ban-for-state-canteens\">largest livestock production per capita</a> and with a very powerful livestock lobbying sector. So when we can succeed on that in Denmark, there will be pathways to that in other countries. And for me, that is a really important message that we should not give up — that there is actually hope.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Climate scientists agree on at least one necessary change to our food system: People, especially those in rich countries, ought to be eating more plants and fewer animals.&#160; Globally, livestock production accounts for some 15 to 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and accelerates a host of other environmental problems, from deforestation to freshwater depletion [&#8230;]",

But <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/shannon-vallor\">Shannon Vallor</a>, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, thinks there’s a better metaphor: AI, she says, is a mirror.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-08_9e8fcb.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,22.353256268035,100,55.29348746393\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23777171/ai-animals-rights-cruelty-transhumanism-bostrom\">a parrot is another mind</a> —&nbsp;not exactly like ours, but a sentient mind nevertheless. A large language model like ChatGPT is not. It reflects back to us our own images, words, and whatever else we’ve put into its training data. When we engage with it, we’re a lot like <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Narcissus/\">Narcissus</a>, the mythical boy who sees his beautiful reflection in the water and becomes transfixed by it, thinking it’s another person.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In her new book <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ai-mirror-9780197759066?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><em>The AI Mirror</em></a>, Vallor argues that it’s our tendency to misperceive AI as a mind — and to think it may even have the capacity <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/7/23708169/ask-ai-chatgpt-ethical-advice-moral-enhancement\">to be more moral than us</a> because it’s more “objective” and “rational” — that poses a real existential risk to humanity, not anything the AI itself might do.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I talked to Vallor about what exactly she thinks that risk is, what she believes it’s doing to human agency, and how it feeds into <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/25/18682583/biohacking-transhumanism-human-augmentation-genetic-engineering-crispr\">transhumanism</a>, the movement that says humans should proactively use technology to augment and evolve our species. Here’s a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You’re not the sort of person who’s kept awake at night by fears that AI will become a conscious mind that maliciously decides to enslave us all. But you do argue that there is a real existential risk posed by AI. What is it?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The risk I talk about is existential in the philosophical sense of really striking at the core of human beings and our ability to give meaning to our existence. One of the fundamental challenges of being a human being, but also the thing that we often treasure, is that we are not locked into a set of reflexes or mindless responses — that we can, in fact, use cognition to break away from our habits and the social scripts we&#8217;re accustomed to, and choose to move in new directions. We can choose new moral patterns for society, new political structures or norms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At every point in human history we see moments where individuals or communities chose to alter the pattern. But that requires confidence in ourselves, in one another, in the power of human agency to do this. And also a sort of moral claim on our right to have that power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing I hear in every country that I travel to to speak about AI is: Are humans really any different from AI? Aren’t we at the end of the day just predictive text machines? Are we ever doing anything other than pattern matching and pattern generation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That rhetorical strategy is actually what scares me. It&#8217;s not the machines themselves. It’s the rhetoric of AI today that is about gaslighting humans into surrendering their own power and their own confidence in their agency and freedom. That’s the existential threat, because that&#8217;s what will enable humans to feel like we can just take our hands off the wheel and let AI drive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>And in some quarters the rhetoric is not only that we can, but that we </strong><strong><em>should</em></strong><strong> let AI do the hard thinking and make the big decisions, because AI is </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence\"><strong>supposedly more rational, more objective</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Exactly — and that you’re somehow failing to be efficient, that you’re failing to cooperate with progress, that you&#8217;re failing to enable innovation, if you don’t go along with this.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-09.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.2196341606716,100,83.560731678657\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>When you write about this loss of confidence in human agency, you draw on the existentialists, who argue that there’s no intrinsic meaning in life —&nbsp;it’s something humans need to choose how to create. You especially draw on José Ortega y Gasset, a Spanish philosopher of the early 20th century, and his notion of “</strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/history-as-a-system-and-other-essays-toward-a-philosophy-of-history-jose-ortega-y-gasset/8725566?ean=9780393001228\"><strong>autofabrication</strong></a><strong>.” Why is that a key idea for you in the context of AI?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ortega thought about the core problem of human meaning, which is that we have to make it ourselves. And that&#8217;s what he meant by autofabrication, which literally just means self-making. He said that this is the fundamental human condition: to make ourselves over and over again. The job never stops, because our cognitive equipment has the ability to take us into a realm of self-awareness such that we can see what we&#8217;re doing and actually decide to change it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That freedom is also, from an existential standpoint, kind of a burden, right? Autofabrication is something that takes a fair amount of courage and strength, because the easier thing is to let someone else tell you that the script is final and you can&#8217;t change it, so you might as well just follow it, and then you don’t have to burden yourself with the responsibility of deciding what the future looks like for yourself or anyone else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what that rhetoric around AI is telling us is to surrender our human freedom, and to me that’s such a profound violation of what is good about being human. The idea that we should give that up would mean giving up the possibility of artistic growth, of political growth, of moral growth —&nbsp;and I don’t think we should do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>One of the ways this rhetoric shows up is in the field of “machine ethics” —&nbsp;the effort to build </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/7/23708169/ask-ai-chatgpt-ethical-advice-moral-enhancement\"><strong>moral machines that can serve as our ethical advisors</strong></a><strong>. </strong><strong>Transhumanists are especially bullish about this project. The philosopher Eric Dietrich even </strong><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242929339_Homo_sapiens_20_Why_we_should_build_the_better_robots_of_our_nature\"><strong>argues</strong></a><strong> that we should build “the better robots of our nature” — machines that can outperform us morally — and then hand over the world to “homo sapiens 2.0.”</strong><strong> What’s your read on that?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ve been skeptical about the moral machines project, because it usually ends up just trying to crowdsource moral judgments [and train AI on those human intuitions]&nbsp;—&nbsp;but the whole point is that the crowd isn&#8217;t always right! And so it&#8217;s a very dangerous thing to crowdsource moral judgments. If you were using a crowdsourced moral machine that was aggregating moral judgments in Nazi Germany, and then tried to automate decisions elsewhere with that, you would be contributing to the expansion of a morally criminal enterprise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Crowdsourcing does seem like a problematic approach, but if we&#8217;re not going off what the general population thinks, what are we doing instead? Are we proposing following a few philosopher-kings, in which case there may be concerns about that being undemocratic?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think there always has been a better route, which is to have morality remain a contested territory. It has to be open to challenge. Understanding what it is to live well with others and what we owe to one another — that conversation can&#8217;t ever stop. And so I&#8217;m very reluctant to pursue the development of machines that are designed to find an optimal answer and stop there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Right —&nbsp;just operating within what people say about moral norms today seems very different from what you call “standing in the space of moral reasons.” Spell out what you mean by that.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-10_13c285.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.380742431996,100,47.238515136008\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The “<a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674251557\">space of reasons</a>” was a concept developed by the philosopher Wilfrid Sellars. It&#8217;s the realm in which we can explore each other’s reasons for believing something, where we can justify and seek justification from one another. Other philosophers later adapted his idea of the logical space of reasons to be able to think about the moral space of reasons, because we do this in morality too: when we make moral claims upon one another, especially if they&#8217;re new and unfamiliar, we have to justify them. Our reasons have to be accessible to one another, so we can figure out what we jointly recognize and accept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think if we had a truly moral machine, it would be able to stand in that space with us. It would be able to articulate reasons and appreciate our reasons, and negotiate those reasons with us in a way that wasn&#8217;t just mirroring the consensus that we&#8217;d already reached. Because any machine that&#8217;s just going to mirror the familiar moral pattern can get into trouble if we end up in a situation where the environment has changed or is new in some way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>This reminds me of a particular virtue you write about a lot: </strong><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/\"><strong>practical wisdom,&nbsp;or phronesis</strong></a><strong>, to use the ancient Greek term. What is that and why is it so crucial?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aristotle <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/\">wrote</a> that we build up the virtues, like honesty, by practice and habituation. Lying is much easier and gets you what you want, but once you get in the habit of telling the truth, you can actually build up a character where being truthful is what comes easily, and you might even have to struggle in the rare case when you need to tell a lie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are moments where relying on those habits that you&#8217;ve built up can actually lead to harm, because something in the situation is new, and your old habit might not be well adapted to the current situation. Wisdom is the intellectual virtue that allows you to recognize that and change your cultivated response to something better. For example, in the civil rights movement, people were able to say: normally, following the law is the moral thing to do, but right now we realize that it isn’t, and in fact civil disobedience in this context is morally necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-11_e05008.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,20.224063919009,100,59.551872161981\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Practical wisdom is built up by practice just like all the other virtues, so if you don&#8217;t have the opportunity to reason and don&#8217;t have practice in deliberating about certain things, you won&#8217;t be able to deliberate well later. We need a lot of cognitive exercise in order to develop practical wisdom and retain it. And there is reason to worry about cognitive automation depriving us of the opportunity to build and retain those cognitive muscles. That’s the risk of <a href=\"https://bhaven.org/uploads/3/4/0/3/34038663/vallor2015_article_moraldeskillingandupskillingin.pdf\">intellectual and moral deskilling</a>. It’s already happening and I think we have to resist it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>When I try to give a charitable read on the transhumanist trend we&#8217;re seeing, I think the core emotion underlying it is </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea\"><strong>shame about the human condition</strong></a><strong>. And after two world wars, the use of nuclear weapons, a climate crisis, and so on, it kind of makes sense that humanity would be feeling this shame. So I can psychologically understand how there might be an impulse to run away from all that humanness and move toward machines we think will be more objective, even though I don’t agree with it. And I think the place where I struggle is, how do we know to what extent it does make sense to transform ourselves using technology, without sinking into a profound anti-humanism?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a kind of emptiness in transhumanism in that it doesn’t know what we’ve got to wish for, it just wishes for the power to create something else —&nbsp;to create freedom from our bodies, from death, from our limitations. But it’s always freedom from, but never freedom for. Freedom for what? What is the positive vision that we want to move toward?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a deep optimism I have about the human condition. I think morality is not just driven by fear — it’s driven even more by love, by the experience of mutual care and solidarity. Our very first experience of the good is being cared for by another, whether that’s a mother or father or nurse. To me everything else is about just trying to pursue that in new and more expansive forms. So for me there is a freedom <em>for</em>, and it’s rooted in what it is to be a human animal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Could there be other creatures who are better than we are? I actually think that’s a question that doesn’t make sense. Better than what? They might be better at being what they are, but I think morality is rooted in a particular form of existence that you have. We exist as a particular kind of social, vulnerable, interdependent animal with a lot of excess cognitive energy. All those things factor into what it is to be moral as a human. For me, this abstraction — the idea of some pure universal morality that creatures who are completely unlike us could somehow do better than we can —&nbsp;I think that just fundamentally misunderstands what morality is.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He read the autobiography of 19th-century Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, which recounted how the famous researcher spent nights hunched over tissue samples in his basement, unraveling the mysteries of the brain as part of a grand quest to help humanity. The romantic depiction of a scientist’s life captured young Yuste’s imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-18_404076.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.741452850473,100,74.517094299054\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there was music. Yuste played the piano and dreamed of being a great composer. So he signed up to study at the Royal Conservatory of Music. In parallel, he entered medical school.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He didn’t realize it then, but his two great loves would end up intertwining: He did become a professional piano player —&nbsp;except that the piano is the brain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Imagine that the brain is like a piano keyboard,” Yuste, now a neuroscientist at Columbia University, told me. “Every neuron is a key. And with light, we can play the keys.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yuste is referring to a method called <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190703150458.htm\">optogenetics</a>, which he’s used on mice as part of an effort to understand how the brain produces perception and behavior. It involves making a genetic change to neurons,&nbsp;usually by infecting them with a virus that makes them responsive to light. Then you can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6747687/\">use a laser to activate specific neurons</a> in the visual cortex of the mouse’s brain. That causes the mouse to see things that aren’t really there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When you activate the neuron with light and make it fire, this is what we call ‘playing the piano,’” Yuste told me. The phrase is now used in scientific papers as a shorthand for the technique. When he pioneered it on mice a decade ago, he was shocked at how easily he could manipulate their visual perception. Whenever he made images artificially appear in their brains, the mice behaved as though the images were real.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“From the point of view of science, it was fantastic, because we finally broke into the brain —&nbsp;we broke the code that the neurons are using,” he recounted. “During the day, we were super happy, congratulating each other in the lab. But at night, I didn’t sleep.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was the first inkling he had that he’d one day need to be involved in creating laws to stop people from manipulating each other’s brains. He’d created the mouse version of the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/\">movie <em>Inception</em></a>. And mice are mammals, with brains similar to our own. How long, he wondered, until someone tries to break into the human brain?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That was when I had my <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/22/23803380/j-robert-oppenheimer-oscar-winning-film-nuclear-weapons-manhattan-project-christopher-nolan\">Oppenheimer moment</a>,” Yuste told me, referring to the nuclear physicist who <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/19/23799375/oppenheimer-movie-trinity-test-atomic-bomb-ethics-existential-risk\">helped design the nuclear bomb</a>. “You know like in the movie, when Oppenheimer looks at the first nuclear reactor and says, ‘Holy moly, look what I’ve done,’ and you can see his face turning sour?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, Yuste had a strange connection to Oppenheimer. Every morning, when the neuroscientist walked into his office on Columbia’s Morningside campus, he gazed out the window. It looked out onto a historic piece of the Manhattan Project: the <a href=\"https://news.columbia.edu/news/seen-oppenheimer-learn-about-columbias-role-building-first-atom-bomb\">very building</a> in which American scientists first prototyped the nuclear reactor during World War II.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The view from his window kindled his own horror at what he’d built —&nbsp;and sparked his resolve to make sure the tech is properly regulated. After all, the physicists who built the bomb included many <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/204/bernstein.html\">who would go on to lobby</a> the US government and the United Nations to regulate nuclear energy. That led to the 1957 <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/about/overview/history#:~:text=The%20Agency's%20genesis%20was%20U.S.,the%20International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency.\">establishment</a> of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which still helps keep nations from blowing each other up with nuclear bombs.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-19_743762.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,19.70356835159,100,60.59286329682\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, in 2017, Yuste <a href=\"https://ntc.columbia.edu/ethicalguidelines/\">gathered</a> around 30 experts to meet at Columbia, where they spent days unpacking the ethics of neurotechnology. He wasn’t worried about forms of it that need to be surgically implanted in the brain —&nbsp;those are medical devices, subject to federal regulations. But he worried about the unregulated, noninvasive neurotech increasingly coming out on the consumer market, which records your neural data (like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22727109/enlightenment-technology-neurofeedback-brain-stimulation-psychedelics\">Muse meditation headband</a>, which uses EEG sensors to read patterns of activity in your brain). That can then be <a href=\"https://www.perseus-strategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FINAL-Consumer-Neurotechnology-Report-Neurorights-Foundation-March-2024-3.pdf\">sold</a> to third parties and used to find out if someone has a disease like epilepsy even when they don’t want that information disclosed. Perhaps it could even be used one day to identify individuals against their will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as Yuste’s mouse experiments showed, it’s not only mental privacy that’s at stake; there’s also the risk of someone using neurotechnology to directly manipulate our minds. While some neurotechnologies only aim to “read” what’s happening in your brain, others also aim to “write” to the brain — that is, to directly change what your neurons are up to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The group of experts convened by Yuste, now known as the Morningside Group, published <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/551159a\">a <em>Nature</em> paper</a> later that year making four policy recommendations, which Yuste later expanded to five. Think of them as new human rights for the age of neurotechnology:</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">1. Mental privacy: You should have the right to seclude your brain data so that it’s not stored or sold without your consent.<br><br>2. Personal identity: You should have the right to be protected from alterations to your sense of self that you did not authorize.<br><br>3. Free will: You should retain ultimate control over your decision-making, without unknown manipulation from neurotechnologies.<br><br>4. Fair access to mental augmentation: When it comes to mental enhancement, everyone should enjoy equality of access, so that neurotechnology doesn’t only benefit the rich.<br><br>5. Protection from bias: Neurotechnology algorithms should be designed in ways that do not perpetuate bias against particular groups.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Yutse_01_f76689.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.369311522329,100,51.261376955341\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Yuste wasn’t content to just write academic papers. “I’m a person of action,” he told me. “It’s not enough to just talk about a problem. You have to do something about it.” So he connected with Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer who has represented clients like the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi. Together, Yuste and Genser created the <a href=\"https://neurorightsfoundation.org/\">Neurorights Foundation</a> to advocate for the cause.<br><br>They soon notched a major win. In 2021, after Yuste helped craft a constitutional amendment with a close friend who happened to be a Chilean senator, Chile <a href=\"https://fpf.org/blog/privacy-and-the-rise-of-neurorights-in-latin-america/#:~:text=Chile%3A%20The%20first%20country%20to,integrity%E2%80%9D%20and%20neurodata%20in%202021.\">became</a> the first nation to enshrine the right to mental privacy and the right to free will in its national constitution. Then the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul <a href=\"https://neurorightsfoundation.org/brazil\">passed</a> its own constitutional amendment (with a federal constitutional amendment in the works). <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N3AH6D6/\">Mexico, Uruguay</a>, Colombia, and Argentina are considering similar laws.<br><br>As for the US, Yuste has advocated for neurorights at the White House and in Congress. He knows, though, that change on the federal level will be a grueling mountain to climb. In the meantime, there’s an easier approach: States that already have comprehensive privacy laws can amend them to cover mental privacy.<br><br>With Yuste’s help, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24078512/brain-tech-privacy-rights-neurorights-colorado-yuste\">Colorado became</a> the first US state to take that path, passing new legislation this year that amends its privacy law to include neural data. California has followed suit, passing legislation that brings brain data into the category of “sensitive personal information.”<br><br>If US federal law were to follow, neural data would fall under the protection of HIPAA, which Yuste said would prevent practically all of the potential privacy violations he’s worried about. Another possibility would be to get all neurotech devices recognized as medical devices so they would have to be approved by the FDA.<br><br>Ultimately, preventing a company from harvesting brain data in one state or even one country is of limited use if it can just do that elsewhere. The holy grail would be international legislation.<br><br>So, Yuste has been speaking to the United Nations, with some modest success so far. After meeting with Yuste, Secretary-General António Guterres mentioned neurotechnology in his 2021 report on the future of humanity, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/content/common-agenda-report/\">“Our Common Agenda.”<br><br></a>In his most ambitious dreams, Yuste wants a new global treaty on neurorights and a new international agency to make sure countries comply with it. He imagines the creation of something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, but for brains. It’s a bold vision from a modern-day Oppenheimer.&nbsp; <em>—Sigal Samuel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

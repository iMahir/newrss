The weather was unusually cold, but she was determined to harvest her first water potatoes, a small wetland tuber that’s one of the tribe’s key traditional foods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The smell of smoke and drying elk meat filled the air along the shore of Lake Coeur d’Alene, where the tribe set up food booths and educational stations. She waded into the frigid water barefoot to dig for the small tubers, while back on land, tribal members cooked them in a traditional pit bake, where elk, camas (a flowering plant with edible bulbs), and other locally harvested foods are layered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">James, who grew up in Portland, Oregon, and spent summers and school breaks on the reservation, was excited to take part in the harvest for the first time after moving to the reservation after college. But something was wrong: Early-season snow dampened the harvest, and although it was only a light dusting, tribal leaders spoke during the opening prayers about how unusual the conditions were. It had been a dry summer, and the water potato harvest was bad, something that has been happening more and more in recent years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I know that this isn’t supposed to be how it is,” James said. “Deep down within me, I&#8217;m like, ‘This just doesn’t feel right.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After their land in northwest Idaho was carved up by 1909 <a href=\"https://www.cdatribe-nsn.gov/#:~:text=Allotment%20Act,-1909&amp;text=For%20a%20time%20the%20Coeur,find%20new%20ways%20to%20prosper\">federal allotment policies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/documents/cour_dalene_final_wetland_program_plan_december_2017.pdf\">Western agriculture, and logging</a> thatback persists on some level today, the Coeur d’Alene Tribe lost a massive amount of acreage and, with it, their ability to manage the land and maintain balance between environmental protection and economic development. Salmon and trout disappeared from the streams. Fires became more frequent and powerful. Water potatoes and other key plants like camas, once staple foods for tribal members, started to disappear. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, extreme drought is making the situation even worse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this is part of a reinforcing cycle of land degradation and climate change that the Coeur d’Alene Tribe has been fighting for decades. It’s a fight that James has now joined as one of the tribe’s first climate resilience coordinators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To protect their land and community, the Coeur d’Alene are in the middle of an ongoing, multi-decade effort that relies, in part, on elder knowledge to restore an important wetland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tribe is bringing back beavers and salmon, restoring native grasses, and repairing stream channels. Collectively, those efforts are designed to restore balance to the landscape, make it more resilient to future climate change by fostering interconnected ecosystems, and, tribal members hope, one day allow them to rely again on important ancestral foods like the water potato.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’ve been living off of the foods that are on our land for thousands upon thousands of years,” James said. “Reconnecting with that food reconnects us with our land.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Bring back the water potato, help the climate</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the country, ecological restoration is increasingly seen as a key part of the fight against climate change, and wetlands provide an especially important service in an era of global warming: They absorb carbon from the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the Coeur d’Alene tribe, a healthy wetland signifies a way to curb rising temperatures that will provide the basis for the return of a rich food source and a traditional way of life. That a wetland serves as the lynchpin means that the tribe is taking on the restoration of an ecosystem that is especially threatened as the world’s climate trends hotter and more arid. Because wetlands are areas where water is at or near the surface for large parts of the year, severe bouts of drought made more common by climate change threaten their existence.<br><br>According to the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2024-03/continued-decline-wetlands-documented-new-us-fish-and-wildlife-service-report\">US Fish and Wildlife Service,</a> more than half of the wetlands in the lower 48 states are gone, and the rate of loss is only accelerating. Between 2009 and 2019, an area of vegetated wetlands in the US the combined size of Rhode Island disappeared. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s an overarching effort underway to help these imperiled landscapes. The 2022 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/priorities/investing-americas-infrastructure/ecosystem-restoration\">included $1.4 billion</a> for ecosystem restoration and resilience, while President Joe Biden also <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/5/7/22423139/biden-30-by-30-conservation-initiative-historic\">signed</a> an executive order setting a national goal to conserve at least 30 percent of the country’s lands and waters by 2030. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Coeur d’Alene aren’t alone in their focus on restoration, but they’re especially good at it. And their uniquely patient, humble approach could serve as a model for other communities working to restore the environment and prepare for climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tribal knowledge and expertise is especially important for restoration because Indigenous people are the ones who know what the land was like before it was degraded and what techniques will help restore it. The thread that ties it all together is traditional food, like the water potato. These cultural foods build connections between people and land and act as an especially tangible measuring stick of the impact that those connections can have on the environment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">James says that camas, for example, grows better when it is regularly harvested.<strong> </strong>But because so much Coeur d’Alene land is now owned by non-Indigenous people, tribal members often don’t have access to camas fields, and some that have been unattended for years are now suffering.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We need these foods, but they also need us to flourish and to grow and get better,” she said. “If we do these things right and we focus on restoring our relationship and restoring our connection with our culture, sovereignty, and traditions, then that’s going to have lasting effects.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>An environmental restoration — and a cultural one, too</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the Coeur d’Alene reservation, soil health and biodiversity have declined, the water temperature is rising, and extreme weather like heat waves and drought are increasingly frequent. But the tribe’s restoration work is beginning to pay off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the summer of 2022, an <a href=\"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/jul/13/an-adult-chinook-is-swimming-in-hangman-creek-for-/?utm_campaign=Rockies%20Today&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#:~:text=Pacific%20NW-,An%20adult%20chinook%20is%20swimming%20in%20Hangman%20Creek%20for%20the,2022%20at%2011%3A25%20a.m\">adult salmon swam in Hangman Creek</a> for the first time in around 100 years. Two years after the tribe released juvenile salmon into the creek, and after an arduous journey out to the Pacific Ocean and back, the tribe welcomed salmon back to the creek for the first time in generations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Ralph Allan Jr., the tribe’s fish and wildlife program manager, it was the culmination of 20 years of work that began with long days of fieldwork like planting trees. Now, he’s leading the department as it prepares to bring salmon back to the reservation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Allan is also working to plant the seeds for a new generation of restoration advocates. He has led an internship program to get college students out in the field and three tribal members are currently enrolled in fish and wildlife degree programs. At the water potato harvest, Allan makes sure that department staff are working with the youth, showing them how to harvest the potatoes and pulling the kids out of the mud when they get stuck. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This cultural and community work is part of the tribe’s restoration effort. Allan worries that the tribe’s younger generation is not as connected to the land as he was growing up. “We&#8217;re not just reintroducing the species of salmon back to our people,” he said. “We&#8217;ve lost that cultural connection to the salmon as well, so we&#8217;re reintroducing a whole culture of salmon.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/AP958799959283.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"North Idaho College students Destiny Calvin, left, a Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe member, and Taylor Abrahamsson, a Coeur d’Alene Tribe member, react after digging water potatoes from the mud at Heyburn State Park near Plummer, Idaho.\" title=\"North Idaho College students Destiny Calvin, left, a Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe member, and Taylor Abrahamsson, a Coeur d’Alene Tribe member, react after digging water potatoes from the mud at Heyburn State Park near Plummer, Idaho.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"North Idaho College students Destiny Calvin, left, a Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe member, and Taylor Abrahamsson, a Coeur d’Alene Tribe member, react after digging water potatoes from the mud at Heyburn State Park near Plummer, Idaho. | Shawn Gust/Associated Press\" data-portal-copyright=\"Shawn Gust/Associated Press\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While salmon are a priority, they are just one piece of a complicated, interconnected ecosystem the tribe is working to restore. Take <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/23333298/beaver-dams-ecosystem-climate-change-cooling\">beaver dams</a>. Dams raise the water table, extend the area along the banks of a river or lake that more animals and plants can inhabit, and keep more water on the landscape. All of this makes the area more welcoming to salmon and other wildlife, but also makes the landscape more resilient to drought and extreme heat because wetlands absorb and retain water that is released during drier periods, explains Tyler Opp, the tribe’s wetlands coordinator. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vox wp-block-embed-vox\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Why beavers matter as the planet heats up\" src=\"https://volume.vox-cdn.com/embed/1ea6aec5a?autoplay=false&#038;loop=true&#038;placement=article&#038;player_type=youtube&#038;tracking=article:middle\" allowfullscreen allow=\"encrypted-media;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The beaver dams also support clean, cold-water habitats for salmon, but to do that, they need trees. Since 2019, the tribe’s environmental programs department has planted over 18,000 trees from about a dozen different species, and plans to plant another 4,000 by 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tribe has used beaver dam analogs — man-made approximations — to encourage beavers to return and posts to reinforce existing beaver dams. Gerald Green, a wildlife biologist for the tribe, says they are currently supporting about seven beaver dams in the creek. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trees, beavers, salmon, water — they’re all part of a cyclical, interdependent system the tribe is trying to restore and support. Cajetan Matheson, natural resource director and a tribal council member, says that addressing climate impacts or restoration goals one by one will not work. “Everything is really related to each other,” Matheson said. “You can&#8217;t just clear-cut a mountain and say, ‘Oh, now we&#8217;ve defeated the fire problem.’ There&#8217;s way more to it than that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These projects take time. Tyler Opp says that even though the scale of the work that needs to be done can be overwhelming, the tribe’s approach helps keep things in perspective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By keeping longer-term goals in mind, like bringing salmon back, which could take decades, the tribe avoids Band-Aid solutions. The whole tribal government buys into this approach, year after year and generation to generation, and although the tribe is limited by funding and capacity, like many public agencies, this commitment allows them to focus on projects that will contribute to achieving that long-term vision. Despite the constraints, the tribe can unify behind a shared vision of the future, based on their collective history, knowledge, and appreciation for the land. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The tribe is able to prioritize things on a far longer time scale than state and federal agencies,” he said. “The tribe doesn&#8217;t have to think in terms of the next budget cycle for getting work done. All of [the things we are doing] are done for future generations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Almost everyone I talked to in the Natural Resources Department credits that perspective to Felix Aripa, a tribal elder who <a href=\"https://ictnews.org/archive/coeur-dalene-historian-world-war-ii-vet-walks-on\">died in 2016</a>. He is seen as instrumental in setting the tone for the tribe’s restoration work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even Aiyana James, who never had the chance to meet him, says she’s listened to old tapes of Aripa. He was an early proponent of using beavers as a restoration partner and helped with things as straightforward as pointing out where a stream used to flow so that the technicians could use that as a guideline to restore the course rather than starting from scratch or guesswork. “The ultimate goal for anybody that works here in the Fish and Wildlife Program is to leave a legacy the way that Felix Aripa left his legacy and his mark on the program,” Allan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before he passed away, Aripa helped Matheson and others put the tribe’s traditional seasonal calendar on paper. The calendar, which is based on seasonal indicators like tree sap rather than months and days, includes detailed information about foods, ecosystems, plants, animals, and human activities. “As we&#8217;re thinking broadly about how we approach restoration, it&#8217;s the framework that we can use,” Laura Laumatia, the tribe’s environmental programs manager, said. “It represents millennia of knowledge.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So while the tribe is proud of their progress, they are still working for the future. “I think it&#8217;s nice to work for 20 years in the same place because you do see some changes happening,” Laumatia said. “But we know that the fruits of our labor are really going to be 70 years from now.” </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Politicians have been sounding the alarm for decades, saying that the program — which helps retirees, people with disabilities, and their families stay afloat — is quickly running out of money. So what’s actually at stake?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Social Security is a pay-as-you go system, so taxes collected from today’s workers are spent on current beneficiaries. But because the workforce hasn’t grown as fast as the number of baby boomers entering retirement, there’s more being taken out of Social Security than being put in. The federal government relies on <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/understanding-the-social-security-trust-funds\">trust funds</a> to fill the gaps, but those reserves are projected to be entirely depleted by 2035, according to the <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33028\">Congressional Research Service</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t mean that the government won’t have any money left. But if Congress doesn’t do anything before those reserves are gone, the government will only be able to honor 83 percent of the scheduled benefits, which means that most, if not all, recipients of Social Security will see their household incomes fall. (By 2098, the government would only be able to cover <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33028\">73 percent</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That outcome would be disastrous for many. Since it was established in 1935, Social Security has been a hugely successful welfare program, and each year, it helps <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/374488/ending-poverty-america-policy-choice\">more than 20 million people</a> stay above the poverty line. It has never before been unable to pay out scheduled benefits. But if Congress doesn’t act, the number of Social Security beneficiaries who live below the poverty line <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/if-social-security-runs-out-money-poverty-among-older-adults-and-people-disabilities\">could increase by more than 50 percent</a> by 2045, disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic families.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this is inevitable, and lawmakers will eventually have to do something to address the shortfall. The question is what.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Democrats and Republicans have proposed</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Congress has no choice but to raise revenue, make cuts to the program, or some combination of the two. Democrats have called for raising taxes and, in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-warren-sanders-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-expand-social-security-by-2400-a-year-and-extend-solvency-for-75-years\">expanding benefits</a>, while Republicans have mostly <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/06/social-security-line-half-billion-dollar-cut-house-gop-funding-bill/397722/\">advocated for cuts</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, however, the GOP has promised that it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKeYcFk3bTQ\">won’t cut people’s benefits</a>. Over the years, Donald Trump, for example, has advised <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-warns-us-house-republicans-not-touch-social-security-medicare-2023-01-20/\">his fellow Republicans</a> that trying to gut Social Security is bad politics (though he’s also called the program’s disability insurance <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/clinton-disabilities-speech/500954/\">“a racket”</a>). &nbsp;On the campaign trail this time around, <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare\">he’s promised</a> to neither “cut one penny from Social Security” nor raise the retirement age, as many Republicans have proposed doing in the past.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Trump’s promises don’t add up to an actual plan. He <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare\">proposed reducing spending</a> on Social Security in each of his annual budgets while in office. And despite his promises, he has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/politics/trump-entitlements-social-security-medicare/index.html\">suggested that he’s open</a> to Social Security cuts this time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also recently proposed cutting taxes on Social Security payments. That might sound good because people will net more money when they receive their benefits. But the reality is more complicated. The <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare\">poorest households wouldn’t see any change</a> under that plan because Social Security benefits for those making below $32,000 are already untaxed, while the richest recipients would be more likely to see a tax cut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For her part, Vice President Kamala Harris has, like other Democrats, promised to preserve Social Security benefits, <a href=\"https://kamalaharris.com/issues/\">vowing to shore up the program</a> and make sure it stays solvent. She promises to do so by <a href=\"https://kamalaharris.com/issues/\">making</a> “millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris’s plan is light on the details, and isn’t exactly clear how the federal government will be able to raise enough revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What might Social Security reform actually look like?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no way around it: Lawmakers have to raise taxes on many families, including those who aren’t millionaires. Right now, any income that someone <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/maxtax.html\">makes above $168,000</a> is not taxed for Social Security. That means that higher earners pay a smaller share of their income toward funding Social Security than lower- and middle-income earners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People are shocked to learn that rich people don&#8217;t pay taxes above” the cap, said Monique Morrissey, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To address this, President Biden has tried to reintroduce the Social Security tax on <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/3/6/biden-social-security\">income above $400,000</a>. That weird formula simply boiled down to politics: Biden pledged to not raise taxes on any household making less than $400,000. But it creates what some experts call a doughnut hole — a pile of untaxable income between the cap and $400,000, and on its own, that’s <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/3/6/biden-social-security\">not enough to fill</a> the anticipated budget shortfall. But if Democrats are serious about raising revenue for Social Security, they should start considering raising taxes on everybody. It might not be as unpopular as they fear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Democrats really need to lose that pledge” of not raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, Morrissey said. “People are happy to pay more in taxes when it’s something that they see is concretely benefiting them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, polls show that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx\">the majority of Americans</a> support raising taxes to ensure they receive Social Security benefits, and only 31 percent would opt for making cuts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A modest payroll tax increase for Social Security would have little impact on most households and would greatly benefit the program. Moreover, Congress ought to consider expanding the categories of income that get taxed for Social Security, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/if-social-security-runs-out-money-poverty-among-older-adults-and-people-disabilities\">including investment income</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Raising taxes, however, is not an easy task, especially when those taxes are targeted at the wealthy. And if Congress fails to raise enough revenue, then it has to start looking at cuts to benefits. “It’s perfectly reasonable to think about solving a problem with some mix of revenue increases as well as benefit reductions,” said Gopi Shah Goda, director of the Retirement Security Project at the Brookings Institution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a cost-saving measure, benefits don’t have to be reduced across the board. If Congress lifts the cap on taxable income, for example, it doesn’t necessarily have to increase the maximum benefit that’s paid out to those who contribute the most into the system. And some of the additional revenue from the new taxes could be targeted to expand benefits for those —&nbsp;like surviving spouses or children —&nbsp;who rely on Social Security the most to stay out of poverty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, a program like Social Security should ensure that none of its recipients fall into poverty, especially because those who are retired or disabled have limited sources of income. That’s certainly a program worth spending more money on — and <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx\">the majority of Americans agree</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>I’d like to hear from you</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After the first issue of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/within-our-means-newsletter-us-poverty-politics-solutions\">Within Our Means</a>, several readers reached out to talk about the relationship between disability and poverty, and how programs like Social Security fall short.

He studies how new ideas about the mind can provide insight into human well-being.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prediction is clearly useful: Being able to anticipate the future helps us strategize in the present.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But too much predictive power is usually the stuff of dystopian sci-fi stories, where being creative and unpredictable are the hallmarks of humanity, while the power of prediction —&nbsp;like the trope of an all-knowing algorithm — is cast as the weapon of technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet, one of the latest big theories in neuroscience says that humans are fundamentally creatures of prediction, and not only is creativity not at odds with that, but it actually goes hand in hand with improving our predictive power. Life itself, in this view, is one big process of creatively optimizing prediction as a survival strategy in a universe otherwise tending toward chaos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Miller’s work starts with this big idea known as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/the-mind-expanding-ideas-of-andy-clark\">predictive processing</a>, which says that your experience of the world is like a dream — a simulated model constructed by your brain. We’re not observing the world through open windows in our skulls. Rather, in our brain’s pursuit to plan, survive, and achieve our goals, it has learned how to guess what the world is actually like based on incoming sensory data. Those predictions are always uncertain, at least to a degree, which is why the goal of predictive processing is often <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/predictive-processing\">described</a> as minimizing that uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But an optimal relationship with uncertainty calls for a balance. Through a predictive lens, Miller argues, uncertainty can help us snap out of harmful loops, like depression or addiction. And in general, it turns out that one of the best ways to become healthier, more adaptive creatures is to regularly expose ourselves to different kinds of uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Miller’s work goes on to use this idea to explain the value of everything from art and horror movies to meditation and psychedelics. In each case, we’re brought to “the edge of informational chaos,” where our predictive models begin to break down. Surprisingly, he sees creativity and optimizing our predictive powers as complementary forces that help sustain life itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So I invited Miller as the next guest for <em>The Gray Area</em>’s series on creativity to discuss the paradox of how we humans survive thanks to prediction but need chaos in order to thrive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“All of life is this resistance to entropy,” Miller said. “As the universe expands and entropy is inevitable, life is that single force that’s defying that gradient.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity. Listen to the full </em>Gray Area<em> interview <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/your-mind-needs-chaos/id1081584611?i=1000672316807\">here</a>.</em></p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"Your mind needs chaos by The Gray Area with Sean Illing\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP6945048568\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, I&#8217;m looking out my window and I see a particular scene and, naively, it seems to me like the light is coming in from the outside, into my body, reaching my brain, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seeing. What you&#8217;re telling me is actually what I&#8217;m seeing is the model being predicted by my brain. What happens, though, when the light actually does get passed through my body? Am I experiencing that at any point, or when do we switch from experiencing our predictions of the world to raw sensory data?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Probably never. That&#8217;s just not what you&#8217;re built to do. And actually you don&#8217;t need access to it. What you need is the driving signal from the world to be making sure that the models that you&#8217;re generating are elegant, sophisticated, and tracking real-world dynamics.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This does get dizzying the more you think about it. But this is a huge claim: that my experience of the world is not a direct experience of objective reality. It is my brain&#8217;s best guess of the world outside of my skull. How early-stage is predictive processing as a theory?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, not that early. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s irresponsible to say that it&#8217;s the preeminent theory today in all sorts of communities, computational <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(23)00411-X/abstract\">psychiatry</a>, computational psychology, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.13138\">neuroscience</a>. I mean, if it&#8217;s not the foremost theory, it&#8217;s adjacent. So I guess it&#8217;s a mix. It&#8217;s younger than the other, it is the new kid on the block in a way, but it&#8217;s a very popular new kid and very exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You wrote a paper about how this predictive framework can explain a lot about what makes us humans happy. So tell me about that. What is the predictive account of happiness?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The human system starts predicting for one reason or another that the world is some way. And then the trouble looks like when that prediction becomes strong enough and divergent enough from the way things actually are. So we call it sticky — it has a sticky quality to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just think about depression. You&#8217;ve installed the belief for whatever reason that you just can&#8217;t fit with the world, that either it&#8217;s because you are not good enough or the world isn&#8217;t good enough. But for some reason you can&#8217;t resolve this difference between the way that you want the world to be and the way the world actually is, either because of something on your side or something on the world’s side. One thing that marks depression is that that belief persists even if the conditions were to change. Even if you were to change the situation entirely, there&#8217;s a sticky quality to these pathologies.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So let me ask you then about swinging back to the positive dimension, happiness in particular. That&#8217;s a picture of depression and psychopathology and mental illness. So what does this predictive framework say about the feeling of happiness itself?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, I&#8217;m going to say two things. There&#8217;s a difference between momentary subjective happiness and well-being, like having a good life.&nbsp;Just in case anybody doesn&#8217;t know what these are, the momentary subjective being well-being is like hedonic well-being. That&#8217;s just the feeling good stuff.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow &nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is that like pleasure?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Exactly. Overall well-being doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s exactly identical with that because to have a really rich, meaningful, good life may mean you&#8217;re in pain quite a lot. Momentary subjective well-being is a reflection, at least in part, of predicting better than expected. So we have this idea that valence is that good or bad feeling that comes as part of your embodied system telling you how it&#8217;s going. So when you feel good, that&#8217;s your body and nervous system and brain telling you, “I&#8217;ve got it. Whatever&#8217;s happening right now, I&#8217;m on top of it. I&#8217;m predicting it for us. I&#8217;m predicting it well. I&#8217;m managing uncertainty really well.” And when you feel bad, that&#8217;s an indicator: “I don&#8217;t understand something here.”</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How does creativity fit into this story?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think a starting point for thinking about creativity using this model is to start by maybe showing a puzzle. Why would a predictive system that looks like it&#8217;s trying to reduce uncertainty be attracted to situations and indeed make those situations where it&#8217;s bumping into uncertainty? Like why do we build roller coasters? Why do we go to horror movies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the answer is that too much certainty is a problem for us, especially when that certainty drifts from real-world dynamics. So in order to protect our prediction engine, our brain and nervous system, from getting into what we&#8217;ve called the bad bootstrap, that is from getting very, very certain about something that&#8217;s wrong, it really behooves us to occasionally inject ourselves with enough uncertainty, with enough intellectual humility to be uncertain about your model enough that you can check to see whether or not you&#8217;ve been stuck in one of these bad bootstraps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you&#8217;re with me to there, then we have a wonderful first-principles approach to thinking about the benefit of creativity and art, especially provocative art that calls you to rethink who you are. Because as far as we&#8217;ve seen, the research just keeps pointing in this direction, anything that gets you out of your ordinary mode of interacting with the world so that you can check to see how good it is or how poor it is, is gonna be a benefit for us. It&#8217;s gonna protect us from those bad siloed opportunities. I think art does that, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can go somewhere, see something grand, see something beautiful, see something ugly and horrible. If you let yourself be impressed by it, it can be an opportunity for you to be jostled out of your ordinary way of seeing the world, which would let the system check to see whether or not it&#8217;s running optimal models or not.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So it sounds like you&#8217;re likening creativity to this injection of the right kind of uncertainty into our experience of the world. And in your <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2022.0425\">paper on horror movies</a>, you used a term that I think captures a lot of this. It&#8217;s a thread that seems to run through everything so far: art, creativity, horror movies, even meditation and psychedelics. You wrote that the brain evolved to seek out the “edge of informational chaos” — a place where our predictive models begin to break down, and in those uncertain zones, we actually have much to learn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It sounds to me like this edge of chaos actually explains at least one perspective on why art, why creativity, why play, why all these things benefit us. Because that edge is a really healthy place to be. So I wanted to ask you about this framing of the edge of informational chaos and why that&#8217;s a place that our brains would want to go.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Where are we gonna learn the most? If you are a learning system, and this is amazing, right from the lab, we see that animals and us, we get rewarded, not only when we get fed and watered and sexed, we get rewarded when we get better information. Isn&#8217;t that amazing to acknowledge?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you get better information, my system is treating it like I&#8217;ve been fed. That&#8217;s how important good information is for us. And in fact, in lots of situations, it&#8217;s more rewarding for us than the food itself because one bit of food is one thing. Information about how to get food over time, that could be much, much more important. So where do we learn the most?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, we don&#8217;t learn where our predictive models are so refined that everything is just being done by rote. And we&#8217;re not learning the most way out in deep volatility, unexpected uncertainty environments. That&#8217;s like where not only do you not know what&#8217;s going on, but you don&#8217;t know how to get to knowing what&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s why we sometimes have culture shock if we move somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So where do we learn the most? We learn at this Goldilocks zone, which is that healthy boundary between order and chaos, right at the edge where our predictive models necessarily break down. And the hope there is that in breaking down, new, better models are possible.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We&#8217;ve talked about how art and creativity can bring us to that edge of chaos, but you&#8217;ve also said elsewhere that meditation can do a similar kind of thing. Which is confusing at first because meditation looks pretty different from watching a horror movie. In meditation, I&#8217;m sitting there very quietly, in what looks like the opposite of chaos. So how do you understand what meditation is doing in this predictive framework, and how does that relate to creativity and these beneficial kinds of uncertainty?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This idea is common now, especially, in the West, that meditation might be more about relaxation, or maybe addressing stress. But that’s not the meat of the program. The center of that program is a deep, profound, and progressive investigation about the nature of who we are and how our own minds work. It’s a deep investigation about the way our emotional system is structured and the nature of our unconscious experience. What are we experiencing? Why are we experiencing it? What does that have to do with the world?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then we can adjust, progressively and skillfully, the shape of who and what we are so that we fit the world better, so that we are as close as possible to what’s real and true, so that we can be as serviceable as possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, you can do everything that we’ve been talking about, including all the stuff that psychedelics do for the predictive system, all the stuff that horror and violent video games do, you can do it all contemplatively, in a way that’s better for you.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So you’re saying that one way to find that thread that puts meditation and horror movies in the same vein of practice is thinking about meditation and psychedelics as injecting uncertainty into our experience of the world. Is that the common currency there?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;ve got it. Absolutely.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Oshan Jarow</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let me ask you this. After this whole story we&#8217;ve unpacked, there&#8217;s still a tension that leaves me a little bit uncomfortable. It feels like we&#8217;re saying that creativity is just kind of an input or a means toward juicing the powers of prediction. And part of me pushes against that. It almost feels reductive, right? Is creativity really just this evolutionary strategy that makes us better predictive creatures? Does that make creativity feel less intrinsically valuable?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because when I think about creativity, at least in part it doesn&#8217;t just feel like a tool for survival that evolution has honed. Sometimes it feels like it’s that which makes life worth living, that it has intrinsic value of its own. Not as a tool for the predictive powers in my brain or the algorithms or whatever. So I&#8217;m curious if you feel this tension at all, and how you think about creativity being framed in the service of prediction.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Mark Miller</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So two things. One, even though we are excited by this new framework, I don&#8217;t think we need to be afraid of it being overly reductionistic. I mean, in a way, it&#8217;s radically reductionistic. We&#8217;re saying that everything that&#8217;s happening in the brain can be written on a T-shirt, basically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the way that it actually gets implemented in super complex, beautiful systems like us, it shouldn&#8217;t make us feel like all of the wonderful human endeavors are simply explainable in a sort of overly simplified way. I don&#8217;t have any worry like that. I think if it turned out that life was operating over a simple principle of optimization —&nbsp;that&#8217;s the most beautiful thing I&#8217;ve ever heard, first of all, that all of life is about optimization. All of life is this resistance to entropy. That&#8217;s just what it is to be alive, is just your optimal resistance to entropy. As the universe expands and entropy is inevitable, life is that single force that&#8217;s defying that gradient. That&#8217;s so beautiful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two, when it comes to art, I want to even be careful to say that art is only about finding this critical edge. I think that&#8217;s one really interesting way of thinking about it. It&#8217;s one way that we&#8217;ve been thinking about it, if you consider movies and video games as forms of art also.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another central reason that this kind of system might benefit from artistic expression that we didn&#8217;t cover but that&#8217;s completely relevant for our discussion is that art creates this wonderful opportunity for endless uncertainty and uncertainty management. And not very many things do that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as you progressively create dancing, painting, singing, whatever, the enthusiasm of that literally being in the spirit of that creative endeavor, is you managing uncertainty in a new and remarkable way that it&#8217;s never been done before in all of existence through all time. Nobody has ever encountered and resolved that uncertainty in particular. So it should be endlessly rewarding, fascinating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No wonder we find it so beautiful. It might be by its very nature the purest expression of uncertainty generation and management. That would make it intrinsically valuable for an uncertainty-minimizing system like us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/your-mind-needs-chaos/id1081584611?i=1000672316807\">Listen to the rest of the conversation</a> and be sure to follow</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea\"> The Gray Area</a><em> on</em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\"> <em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"> <em>Spotify</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793\"> <em>Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

She knew it would inflict a wretched amount of emotional and monetary damage.<strong> </strong>For now, we don’t know Milton’s total devastation, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/hurricane-milton-live-updates-florida-aftermath-thursday/75599239007/\">but as it stands</a> at least 14 people are dead and 3 million people are without power. Milton also spawned “dozens” of tornadoes across the state, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-tornadoes-florida-deaths-climate-change-oceans-f197c258022c189c6ce8bc59dc88223e\">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/IMG_6732.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,28.801234458347,100,42.397531083306\" alt=\"A woman holding a Siamese cat wearing a crocheted bonnet with bunny ears.

And I didn&#8217;t make it lightly,” she told me, “But you know, if I can be of service in terms of entertainment on the internet? So be it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Calloway isn’t the only Floridian evacuation refuser who’s posting through it. On TikTok in particular, there are plenty. There’s the woman who told her followers that she was instructed to have enough food and water for three days and has decided that she will have “<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__/video/7423331321398988078\">some kind of barbecue</a>” (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__/video/7424308233575222571\">she posted </a>that she was safe on Thursday evening). There’s a Floridian celebrity who goes by the name “<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/lt-dan-tiktok-hurricane-milton-sailor/75602596007/\">Lt. Dan</a>” who safely rode out the storm on his boat. And then there’s the woman who did not want to <a href=\"https://x.com/offbeatorbit/status/1843851943434961039\">leave her gigantic concrete house</a> because she wanted to “save” it and partly because her staying would, in her words, “piss” liberals off. (Her account now shows up as “<a href=\"https://x.com/alex_abads/status/1844573838694064482\">banned</a>” on TikTok.)  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People defying evacuation orders isn’t a new phenomenon. But getting millions of views on TikTok for doing so is. So why are these people staying? And why are they posting?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The psychology behind staying and posting through a hurricane</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most important things to know about StormTok is that having the ability to leave and deciding to stay behind is a choice that most people who <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/377365/hurricane-milton-helene-evacuation-cost-expensive#\">do not evacuate don’t have</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The real story is that most people who don&#8217;t evacuate can&#8217;t evacuate. Evacuation is expensive,” <a href=\"https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/geography-meteorology/about-us/facultyandstaff/calldavid\">Dave Call</a>, a meteorologist and storm chaser based at Ball State University, tells me. Call explains scenarios in which people can’t take off from work, can’t afford hotels, don’t have reliable transportation, and can’t afford meals. Factors like not being able to speak English and being an undocumented immigrant also affect those contingency plans. Evacuation isn’t a feasible option for these people, and we rarely see their stories, Call stresses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Being able to stay and share what’s happening is essentially a luxury.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Call chases tornadoes, and he explains that there’s a slight difference between what storm chasers do and what these hurricane posters are getting at, even if they’re both technically documenting storms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These people are different from tornado chasers because they aren&#8217;t driven by a desire to see exciting weather, but by other factors,” Call says. “They may not comprehend the scale of a hurricane. Some have put their lives into their home and feel that it is safe enough. There’s also overlap between these folks and those who drive through flood waters, refuse to shelter in storms, drive recklessly, etc.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What Call is getting at is that there is a multitude of factors that goes into the psychological decision of staying in place and sticking out a hurricane like Milton. <a href=\"https://com.miami.edu/profile/barbara-millet/\">Barbara Millet</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Miami, echoes that sentiment. Part of Millet’s research has focused on disaster communication and how the public understands the <a href=\"https://news.miami.edu/faculty/stories/2022/11/that-uncanny-coneresearchers-want-to-erase-the-uncertainty.html\">dangers and risk of hurricanes</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Evacuation decisions are complex. They&#8217;re multifaceted and they&#8217;re personal. There&#8217;s no single reason, but rather a combination of factors that really influence individuals and families,” Millet tells Vox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She explains that these factors range from money to past experiences with hurricane evacuations to uncertainty about the forecast, to the perception that being at home might be safer. Disaster fatigue, the exhaustive process of rebuilding, the lack of trust in lawmakers and officials, and everything in between can affect someone’s decision not to obey evacuation protocols. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Maybe all these reasons don&#8217;t apply to any one given person, but there&#8217;s certainly a combination of them that influence people&#8217;s decisions to — or not to — evacuate,” Millet adds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s a reassuring aspect to these extremely viral videos of people hunkering down and ignoring evac orders, it’s that the reasons and motivations they’re citing line up with research. Scientists know that factors like expenses and lack of trust in officials are why people don’t evacuate and have been figuring out better ways to address those concerns. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The reasons that they were giving are the same reasons that turn up in most of our surveys. None of the stated reasons were a surprise in those videos,” says <a href=\"https://humanecology.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/cara-cuite/\">Cara Cuite</a>, an associate professor at Rutgers University who studies risk and emergency communication. What caught Cuite and her colleagues by surprise was how popular the videos became. They wondered if that engagement could be another driving force in people’s decision-making.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Seeing these videos raises the question of whether there is a counterproductive incentive to stay and not evacuate in the form of driving engagement to people&#8217;s accounts,” Cuite adds. “We don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s happening, but it certainly raises that question.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In that same vein, what worries Millet and Call is that people posting their refusals to evacuate and garnering millions and millions of views in the process could be one of those factors that may sway <em>someone else’</em>s decision from evacuating to staying put. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Social media provides official information to be communicated to a larger group of people, but it also allows for unofficial information and misinformation to be communicated, and that&#8217;s what worries me most,” Millet tells me. “Misinformation and how that impacts people&#8217;s ability to take decisions, actions that they need to take.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why people are turning the hurricane into content&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Calloway’s decision to stay wasn’t prompted by a lack of information. She explained that she had been following Milton and all the news surrounding the storm but that mitigating factors like her inability to drive and her desire to care for older neighbors kept her staying put. She also details that her experience evacuating in 2022 for Ian also shaped her decision. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I decided the right thing for me and my immediate community was to stay,” Calloway told me. “They&#8217;re my first priority.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She explains that she had previously honored evacuation protocols for Hurricane Ian in 2022, fleeing to her mother’s house inland in Northport, Florida, and ended up needing a military rescue anyway. She added that she’s on the third floor of her concrete condo and that she has hurricane-proof windows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She does admit that with all these posts, she is hoping to promote her latest project (“I’m going to be trapped inside for two days anyway — let&#8217;s sell some books. That’s sort of my attitude.”) which happens to be a book about <a href=\"https://carolinecalloway.com/products/elizabeth-wurtzel-and-caroline-calloways-guide-to-life\">survival</a>. Judging by the many posts about whether or not Calloway would survive the hurricane, ironic admiration for Calloway’s insistence on promoting her new book, and the attention her posts from Milton’s eye have garnered, she successfully provided the internet with some form of entertainment. She’s also no stranger to the dangers of misinformation, including <a href=\"https://x.com/jackfromohio/status/1843755693058535758\">rumors</a> of her living on the ground floor of her condo, which she says were made up by a “fucking idiot who’s blind.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not lost on Calloway that there’s a certain schadenfreude or a grim morbidity from people online watching her post, that much of this attention was glibly predicated on her possible demise. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__/video/7423331321398988078\" data-video-id=\"7423331321398988078\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@angeyb__\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__?refer=embed\">@angeyb__</a> <p>We was instructed to have enough food an water for up to 3days <a title=\"hurricanemilton\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hurricanemilton?refer=embed\">#hurricanemilton</a> <a title=\"tampa\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tampa?refer=embed\">#tampa</a> <a title=\"florida\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/florida?refer=embed\">#florida</a> <a title=\"viralvideo\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viralvideo?refer=embed\">#viralvideo</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - ANGEYB__\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7423331294289546030?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; ANGEYB__</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The way the stubborn stayers on social media are consumed and recirculated speaks to both society’s rubber-necking and many viewers’ judgments about the posters’ reality. That these Floridians had the money and resources to leave and chose to stay rubs people the wrong way, but it also gets them very invested. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can’t help but be curious about the implied <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/20/18226699/jenna-jameson-keto-diet-weight-loss-photos-before-and-after\">before-and-after picture</a> of it all. Some want to see if the lady’s concrete house gets wrecked or the woman having a barbecue in the wake of a storm surge realizes amid standing water that burgers and dogs are the last thing on her mind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also the fact that, as Call, the meteorologist and storm chaser, points out, it’s simply hard to comprehend living in the destructive aftermath of a hurricane. Parts of Florida are still soaked from Helene, and it’s unclear how many days or even weeks Milton will leave the swaths of the state without electricity. Milton is going to strain Florida in ways that TikTok can’t capture. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Rebuilding from a hurricane is measured in years,” Call says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the part we don’t see and that won’t get millions and millions of views. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

You might have dependent family members who can’t leave due to disabilities or other health-related reasons; you might not have reliable transportation to get to a safer area, and what’s more, no gas to get there. Sometimes, you simply refuse to leave your home and everything you own behind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also the reality of just not being able to afford it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a 2021 <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/documents/news-items/spa-hurricane-survey-results-2021.pdf\">University of South Florida survey</a>, over half of the state’s residents said that finances would impact whether they evacuated from a hurricane or not, with almost 43 percent saying they had under $1,000 for emergencies. People escaping both Hurricane Milton and Helene — a Category 4 hurricane that heavily impacted the southeastern US in late September — report <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cnn/video/7423539550137371934\">spending</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/DissentFu/status/1843373698243539317\">hundreds</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/bulkpricing/status/1843734482698023161\">if not</a> <a href=\"https://weartv.com/news/local/helene-evacuees-face-high-costs-as-they-seek-refuge-in-northwest-florida\">thousands of dollars</a> to get to safety. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Connie Vickers, 63, typically resides about an hour outside of Asheville, North Carolina. It cost her about $5,000 to book the first available Airbnb she could find to evacuate from Hurricane Helene. She considers herself fortunate — she could pay that out of pocket, with the hope that her insurance would cover some or all of the cost. “I’ve been thinking about the socioeconomic differences,” she tells Vox. She knows that others aren&#8217;t able to pay these high costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Terrifyingly, anecdotes of people seeing <a href=\"https://x.com/silverfang09/status/1843638806840520771\">outrageous</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813\">flight</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/hurricanetrack/status/1843482275490787568\">hotel</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/KellDA/status/1843458416070783099\">rental car</a> prices have spread like wildfire on social media in the lead-up to Hurricane Milton’s landfall as a Category 3 storm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6\">one woman in Southwest Florida</a> has been explaining why it’s so difficult to leave home with six children and four dogs. Many shelters <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/disability/evacuations-and-shelters/shelter-information/sheltering-with-pet/\">don’t accept pets</a>. “I would have to book an Airbnb or something,” she says in <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6/video/7422814373627940139\">one video</a>. “I can’t afford to do that.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Flights, hotels, or gas can be pricey — if they’re even available</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The longer someone waits to evacuate, the costlier evacuation is likely to be. One <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264879191_Is_It_Time_to_Go_Yet_Understanding_Household_Hurricane_Evacuation_Decisions_from_a_Dynamic_Perspective\">2011 study</a> estimated that evacuation costs for a Category 3 hurricane could increase from $454 about three days before expected landfall to $526 mere hours before landfall, which is about $632 to $732 in today’s dollars. While the cheapest one-way flight from Tampa to Atlanta in mid-November can be had for just $39, according to Google Flights, on October 8, the cheapest the search engine showed was $321. The cheapest one-way ticket from Tampa to NYC, usually available for $45 to $90, was $458.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plane tickets are priced dynamically, typically shooting up during busy travel periods and when you’re booking last-minute. A United spokesperson told Vox that the airline had implemented fare caps this past Sunday. “Since then, the average price for a one way, economy class ticket to our hubs from affected Florida markets was below $500,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. They also noted that the <a href=\"https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813/photo/1\">viral screenshots</a> of $1,000-plus fares from Tampa to St. Louis included two stops. By early Tuesday, though, it was hard to find any nonstop flights from Tampa. <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/delta-waiving-fare-differences-capping-fares-new-bookings-ahead-milton\">Delta</a> and <a href=\"https://skift.com/2024/10/09/airlines-cap-fares-during-hurricane-milton/\">American Airlines</a> have also capped fares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether these tickets actually existed is also a different matter — going directly to airline websites often showed that there were actually no available flights, since airports were closed and many flights had been canceled. By Tuesday, when many <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/09/florida-hurricane-milton-evacuation-orders-flood-zones-mandatory-list-map-orlando-counties-shelters/75588425007/\">evacuation orders</a> were just going into effect, options were increasingly limited — and costly — for Floridians in the path of Milton. Many airports were <a href=\"https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/airports-close-and-flights-are-cancelled-due-to-hurricane-milton/3438303/\">closing down</a>. As of Wednesday, FlightAware data showed that 90 percent of flights out of Tampa International Airport were canceled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rental car locations were either running out of cars or shutting down for safety as of Tuesday, and <a href=\"https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=tampa&amp;fuel=1&amp;method=all&amp;maxAge=0\">according to GasBuddy</a>, a site that helps people track prices and availability at nearby gas stations, fuel was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/business/hurricane-milton-florida-gasoline-shortages/index.html\">scarce</a>. Finding a place to stay is an uphill climb, too. At the time of writing, many hotels in <a href=\"https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/panama-city/hurricane-milton-evacuees-fully-book-panama-city-hotels/\">Northwest</a> <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/10/07/booked-up-tallahassee-hotels-see-influx-due-to-hurricane-milton/75555745007/\">Florida</a> had filled up. While there are free shelters available across Florida counties where evacuation orders have been issued, as well as free <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/Updates\">shuttle services</a> or other <a href=\"https://www.wptv.com/weather/hurricane/need-transportation-heres-how-you-can-get-a-ride-to-a-local-shelter-or-to-safety\">free transportations options</a>, not everyone may be in an area where they can access them. There are also several reasons why people choose <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/10/09/evacuating-privilege-why-some-stay-behind-when-hurricanes-strike\">not to go to a shelter</a>: They may not be sure exactly where it’s located, whether it’s full, or may not be able to bring their pets. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Being poor and having few job protections makes it harder to escape a storm</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People with the least money are also often <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050132/\">least likely to be able to escape</a> a natural disaster. They are less able to leave work in advance to beat traffic or book lodgings and flights before they’re all sold out, and in the long term, less able to permanently move to an area at lower risk of hurricanes — yet another example of how it can be <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-cost-of-being-poor-is-rising-and-its-worse-for-poor-families-of-color/\">more expensive to be poor</a>. The Gulf Coast faces some of the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4022458/\">highest poverty rates</a> in the US, and the combination of extreme poverty and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600389/\">higher rates of poor health</a> (often due to racial inequality and environmental factors) leaves residents in this region <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-part-of-the-u-s-will-suffer-most-from-climate-change/\">especially vulnerable</a> during disasters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carson MacPherson-Krutsky, a research associate at the Natural Hazards Center at University of Colorado Boulder, is currently studying the factors that motivate people to evacuate and shelter — or not — for hurricanes and tornadoes. “A huge one is resource constraints,” she tells Vox. “You have to have lodging wherever you&#8217;re going. You may need to have social support, potentially, if you want to stay with family and friends who are outside of the area. You have to have the ability to leave your job.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even in ordinary times, hotel and flight prices can be tough to stomach. Average hotel prices in the US have <a href=\"https://lodgingmagazine.com/j-d-power-2024-nagsi-study-shows-travelers-are-paying-more-for-hotel-rooms/\">risen this year</a>; across the country, it has become increasingly common to pay <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/average-hotel-room-prices-data-a0afa164\">upward of $200 per night</a> for a room. The cost of buying a car, maintaining it, and having insurance for it has also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/your-money/car-ownership-costs-increase.html\">gone up precipitously</a> in the past few years. Then there are the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/23641875/food-grocery-inflation-prices-billionaires\">higher food prices</a> to consider. If you’ve evacuated to temporary lodgings and don’t have a stove, eating out can quickly become costly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over a quarter of Americans had <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/select/americans-checking-account-balance/\">less than $500</a> in their checking account last year, according to a CNBC Select survey, and over half of Americans have less than $1,000 saved for emergencies. A <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/hurricane-irmas-coming-what-an-average-family-spends-and-does-to-prepare\">Fox Business report from 2017</a> estimated that hurricane preparation and evacuation could cost an average family as much as $5,000; a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/18/multimedia/hurricane-florence-motel-evacuees.html\">New York Times report</a> from 2018, when Hurricane Florence ravaged North Carolina, cites one family having to cough up over $2,000 to evacuate. It can be prohibitively expensive to survive a storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For some, the risk of lost wages or other <a href=\"https://x.com/HorrorGorl/status/1843684304385143005\">consequences</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@officialladdyyg/video/7423010068448382254?_r=1&amp;_t=8qPCtDRp5ac\">of missing</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1fyyp5z/usa_what_to_do_because_were_being_forced_to_work/\">work</a> may have influenced their <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2022/09/hurricane-ian-workers-rights-laws.html\">decision to stay put</a>. During Hurricane Helene, a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/05/us/tennessee-impact-plastics-factory-helene/index.html\">factory called Impact Plastics</a> in Erwin, Tennessee, allegedly told employees to continue working despite flood warnings in the area. The company denies that it discouraged employees from leaving, saying in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_DzP__-9kg\">video statement</a> last week that they had been told to leave “at least 45 minutes before the gigantic force of the flood hit the industrial park.” It’s currently being investigated after 11 workers went missing, at least <a href=\"https://www.wcyb.com/news/local/bodies-of-5-of-6-impact-plastics-employees-swept-away-by-flood-recovered\">five</a> of whom have since been found dead.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How the government — and some companies — are trying to help</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To ease some of the costs of evacuation, the state of Florida has <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/07/governor-ron-desantis-suspends-tolls-to-assist-hurricane-milton-evacuations/\">suspended road tolls</a> and has encouraged hotels to <a href=\"https://frla.org/news-release/frla-works-with-state-of-florida-to-encourage-reduced-costs-at-hotels-for-milton-evacuees/\">waive pet fees</a>. Uber, which famously came under fire for <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/uber-reaches-agreement-with-n-y-on-surge-pricing-during-emergencies/\">surge pricing</a> in New York during Hurricane Sandy, is giving people fleeing Milton <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/\">free rides to shelters.</a> Major US airlines, including <a href=\"https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/travel/trip-planning/travel-alerts.html\">United</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/travel-alerts.jsp\">American</a>, and Delta are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/hurricane-helene-disrupting-travel-fliers-need-know-rcna173505\">waiving some fees</a> if you need to rebook a flight. A few hotels have also been offering “distress rates” for evacuees, with <a href=\"https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/10/08/myrtle-beach-resorts-offer-discount-those-evacuating-hurricane-milton/\">one Myrtle Beach resort</a> charging as little as $39 per night before taxes, and rooms at an <a href=\"https://www.wftv.com/news/local/rosen-hotels-resorts-reduces-pricing-hurricane-milton/WEDJTZ47IFE6JP6XNOI2VBMRKE/\">Orlando area hotel chain</a> starting at $69 before taxes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The supply-and-demand explanation for why things like flights and hotels can cost more during emergencies is that a lot of people are trying to snap them up at the last minute. That doesn’t mean it’s in a company’s best interest to hike prices, especially when people have been airing their sticker shock online. In some cases, it could even be illegal price gouging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Price gouging is different than a normal market increasing prices,” says Teresa Murray, director of the Consumer Watchdog office at the Public Interest Research Groups. It usually needs to occur during some kind of emergency, and only applies to essential goods. One clear example of price gouging, according to Murray, happened during the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/5/12/23068472/baby-formula-shortage-2022-why\">baby formula shortage</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/how-to-report-price-gouging-after-a-natural-disaster/\">37 states</a> have some sort of anti-price gouging law in the books. Florida’s anti-price gouging law doesn’t kick in unless an official state of emergency has been declared, which Gov. Ron DeSantis did <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/\">this past</a> <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/\">weekend</a>. If the price of food, water, or gas, for example, “grossly exceeds” the average prices seen in the 30 days before the state of emergency, that’s illegal — but it’s not clear what “grossly exceeds” exactly means. <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters#2C\">Some states</a> set a price increase threshold, such as anything more than 10 percent above normal prices. The Florida attorney general’s office has urged residents to <a href=\"https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-moody-extends-price-gouging-hotline-following-declared-state-emergency\">report any price gouging</a> they see; it was already <a href=\"https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/florida-attorney-generals-team-investigates-price-gouging-amid-hurricane-season/\">investigating potential price gouging</a> after receiving hundreds of complaints during Hurricane Helene. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg <a href=\"https://x.com/SecretaryPete/status/1843464151324389620\">said on X</a> that the Department of Transportation is “keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton” to ensure there’s no price gouging, and the department is now <a href=\"https://x.com/petemuntean/status/1843740317494964379\">in touch with airlines</a> about the issue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, Murray adds, we see a lot of <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/after-a-hurricane-or-tropical-storm-watch-out-for-repair-scams-price-gouging-unsafe-generator-use/\">price gouging</a> — whether it’s water, food, or supplies needed for clean-up and repair, like chainsaws — happening in the aftermath of a disaster. With Milton, too, we might see more of it occurring as recovery efforts begin. “It’s just unconscionable that some companies might be taking advantage of this crisis by jacking up their prices,” Murray says. “We&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s lives here.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They’re working on building machines that could outstrip human intelligence and unleash a dramatic economic transformation on us all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has basically told us he’s trying to build a god — or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd9ba2f6-f509-42f0-8e97-4271c7b84ded\">“magic intelligence in the sky,”</a> as he puts it. OpenAI’s official term for this is artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Altman says that AGI will not only <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/03/exclusive-openai-sam-altman-chatgpt-agi-google-search/\">“break capitalism”</a> but also that it’s <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/machine-intelligence-part-1\">“probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.”</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a very natural question here: Did anyone actually ask for this kind of AI? By what right do a few powerful tech CEOs get to decide that our whole world should be turned upside down?&nbsp;   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll\">As I’ve written before</a>, it’s clearly undemocratic that private companies are building tech that aims to totally change the world without seeking buy-in from the public. In fact, even leaders at the major companies are expressing unease about how undemocratic it is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jack Clark, the co-founder of the AI company Anthropic, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23794855/anthropic-ai-openai-claude-2\">told Vox</a> last year that it’s “a real weird thing that this is not a government project.” He also <a href=\"https://importai.substack.com/p/import-ai-337-why-i-am-confused-about\">wrote</a> that there are several key things he’s “confused and uneasy” about, including, “How much permission do AI developers need to get from society before irrevocably changing society?” Clark continued:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Technologists have always had something of a libertarian streak, and this is perhaps best epitomized by the ‘social media’ and Uber et al era of the 2010s — vast, society-altering systems ranging from social networks to rideshare systems were deployed into the world and aggressively scaled with little regard to the societies they were influencing. This form of permissionless invention is basically the implicitly preferred form of development as epitomized by Silicon Valley and the general ‘move fast and break things’ philosophy of tech. Should the same be true of AI?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve noticed that when anyone questions that norm of “permissionless invention,” a lot of tech enthusiasts push back. Their objections always seem to fall into one of three categories. Because this is such a perennial and important debate, it’s worth tackling each of them in turn — and why I think they’re wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Objection 1: “Our use is our consent”&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">ChatGPT is the fastest-growing consumer application in history: It had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\">100 million active users</a> just two months after it launched. There’s no disputing that lots of people genuinely found it really cool. And it spurred the release of other chatbots, like Claude, which all sorts of people are getting use out of — from journalists to coders to busy parents who want someone (or something) else to make the goddamn grocery list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some claim that this simple fact&nbsp;—&nbsp;we’re using the AI! — proves that people consent to what the major companies are doing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is a common claim, but I think it’s very misleading. Our use of an AI system is not tantamount to consent. By “consent” we typically mean informed consent, not consent born of ignorance or coercion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the public is not informed about the true costs and benefits of these systems. How many people are aware, for instance, that generative AI sucks up so much energy that <a href=\"https://time.com/6987773/ai-data-centers-energy-usage-climate-change/\">companies like Google and Microsoft are reneging on their climate pledges as a result</a>? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, we all live in choice environments that coerce us into using technologies we’d rather avoid. Sometimes we “consent” to tech&nbsp;because we fear we’ll be at a professional disadvantage if we don’t use it. Think about social media. I would personally not be on X (formerly known as Twitter) if not for the fact that it’s seen as important for my job as a journalist. In a recent <a href=\"https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/gen-z-social-media-smart-phones/\">survey</a>, many young people said they wish social media platforms were never invented, but given that these platforms do exist, they feel pressure to be on them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if you think someone’s use of a particular AI system does constitute consent, that doesn’t mean they consent to the bigger project of building AGI.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This brings us to an important distinction: There’s narrow AI — a system that’s purpose-built for a specific task (say, language translation) — and then there’s AGI. Narrow AI can be fantastic!<strong> </strong>It’s helpful that AI systems can perform a crude copy edit of your work for free or let you write computer code using just plain English. It’s awesome that AI is helping scientists better understand disease.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it’s extremely awesome that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22045713/ai-artificial-intelligence-deepmind-protein-folding\">AI cracked the protein-folding problem</a> — the challenge of predicting which 3D shape a protein will fold into — a puzzle that stumped biologists for 50 years. The Nobel Committee for Chemistry clearly agrees: It just gave a Nobel prize to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03214-7?utm_source=Live+Audience&amp;utm_campaign=3ea6e2da1a-nature-briefing-daily-20241009&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_b27a691814-3ea6e2da1a-50070192\">AI pioneers</a> for enabling this breakthrough, which will help with drug discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that is different from the attempt to build a general-purpose reasoning machine that outstrips humans, a “magic intelligence in the sky.” While plenty of people do want narrow AI, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll\">polling shows that most Americans do not want AGI</a>. Which brings us to …</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Objection 2: “The public is too ignorant to tell innovators how to innovate”</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s a quote commonly (though <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/28/ford-faster-horse/\">dubiously</a>) attributed to car-maker Henry Ford: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The claim here is that there’s a good reason why genius inventors don’t ask for the public’s buy-in before releasing a new invention: Society is too ignorant or unimaginative to know what good innovation looks like. From the printing press and the telegraph to electricity and the internet, many of the great technological innovations in history happened because a few individuals decided on them by fiat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that doesn’t mean deciding by fiat is always appropriate. The fact that society has often let inventors do that may be partly because of technological solutionism, partly because of a belief in the “great man” view of history, and partly because, well, it would have been pretty hard to consult broad swaths of society in an era before mass communications — before things like a printing press or a telegraph!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And while those inventions did come with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-victorians-had-the-same-concerns-about-technology-as-we-do-60476\">perceived risks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23178764/florida-us19-deadliest-pedestrian-fatality-crisis\">real</a> harms, they didn’t pose the threat of wiping out humanity altogether or making us subservient to a different species.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the few technologies we’ve invented so far that meet that bar, seeking democratic input and establishing mechanisms for global oversight <em>have</em> been attempted, and rightly so. It’s the reason we have a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and a Biological Weapons Convention — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/23510633/arms-control-bioweapons-convention-nukes-ukraine-putin\">treaties that, though it’s a struggle to implement them effectively, matter a lot</a> for keeping our world safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s true, of course, that most people don’t understand the nitty-gritty of AI. So,<strong> </strong>the argument here is not that the public should be dictating the minutiae of AI policy. It’s that it’s wrong to ignore the public’s general wishes when it comes to questions like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364384/its-practically-impossible-to-run-a-big-ai-company-ethically\">“Should the government enforce safety standards before a catastrophe occurs or only punish companies after the fact?”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender\">“Are there certain kinds of AI that shouldn’t exist at all?”</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Daniel Colson, the executive director of the nonprofit AI Policy Institute, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll\">told me</a> last year, “Policymakers shouldn’t take the specifics of how to solve these problems from voters or the contents of polls. The place where I think voters <em>are</em> the right people to ask, though, is: What do you want out of policy? And what direction do you want society to go in?”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Objection 3: “It’s impossible to curtail innovation anyway”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there’s the technological inevitability argument, which says that you can’t halt the march of technological progress —&nbsp;it’s unstoppable!</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/1/20887003/tech-technology-evolution-natural-inevitable-ethics\">a myth</a>. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23621198/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-china-ai-safety-technology\">there are lots of technologies that we’ve decided not to build</a>, or that we’ve built but placed very tight restrictions on. Just think of human cloning or human germline modification. The recombinant DNA researchers behind the Asilomar Conference of 1975 famously organized a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/455290a\">moratorium</a> on certain experiments. We are, notably, still not cloning humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or think of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. Adopted by the United Nations against the backdrop of the Cold War, it barred nations from doing certain things in space —&nbsp;like storing their nuclear weapons there. Nowadays, the treaty comes up in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/21/18224984/arecibo-message-aliens-kids-contest-seti-meti-extraterrestrial\">debates about whether we should send messages into space</a> with the hope of reaching extraterrestrials. Some argue that’s dangerous because an alien species, once aware of us, might conquer and oppress us. Others argue it’ll be great — maybe the aliens will gift us their knowledge in the form of an Encyclopedia Galactica! </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Either way, it’s clear that the stakes are incredibly high and all of human civilization would be affected, prompting some to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/6/20680228/aliens-survey-seti-meti-scientists-extraterrestrial-message\">make the case for democratic deliberation</a> before intentional transmissions are sent into space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the old Roman proverb goes: What touches all should be decided by all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is as true of superintelligent AI as it is of nukes, chemical weapons, or interstellar broadcasts.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And while science and math are involved in its creation, there is something undeniably mystical about it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Laraaji is a 80-year-old pioneer of so-called New Age music and someone who’s been sitting on the fringes of the music world for decades — though, last year, he joined Andre 3000 onstage in Brooklyn. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When he was young, Laraaji experimented with acting, including a role in the landmark experimental film <em>Putney Swope</em>, and spent time in the 1960s standup comedy scene. After that, he became interested in spiritual communities, discovered the autoharp, and devoted his life to making music. He’s been a truly prolific artist ever since.<br><br>I recently invited Laraaji on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about music, meditation, spirituality, and the therapeutic power of laughter.

You&#8217;ve done standup comedy. You&#8217;ve done acting. Obviously, in the end, you gave yourself over to music. Did the experience of acting and doing comedy make you a better musician? Or is it just creatively a totally different thing? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s the same thing, Sean. It&#8217;s wherever I choose to open and give expression to. I&#8217;m practicing the art of surrendering and spontaneity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a lousy musician. I&#8217;m too in my own damn head.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I say observe your body language when you have your next orgasm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don&#8217;t think anybody — including myself — wants to see that!</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Seriously, look at your breath. Look at your body language. Look how focused you are into surrendering to this energetic expression. And I see some of that expression carried over into the way people sing pop music, rock music. They get into the more orgasmic, passionate level of release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think of yourself as primarily an improvisational musician for those reasons?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I depend more on improvisation than I do on set scores. I find that improvisation is aligned with what I call my spiritual belief that every moment is new. And to trust that what I need in this moment is here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musicians always talk about that, feeling more like a conduit than an author. Is that what it&#8217;s like for you on stage?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, and it&#8217;s magical and mystical and a transportive place because you&#8217;re somehow beyond linear time flow. You&#8217;re in the midst of local time, but you&#8217;re also witnessing an unbroken, constant present time. It&#8217;s speaking through me and it&#8217;s speaking as me. I&#8217;m sound, I&#8217;m space, I&#8217;m timelessness. This is like music I can dream up. Part of my art is knowing when to get out of the way, how to set up a musical flow or a musical event, and then to step to the side of it and let it speak through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You also sing but it feels like part of the music, like there&#8217;s little distinction between the instruments you&#8217;re playing and what&#8217;s coming from your voice. Do you think of your voice as another instrument and not something separate?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, I do like doing everything at the same time. Spontaneous, unified flow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Create a flow with several instruments at the same time, using the voice without calling the mental process into linear thinking. And using a voice as an emotional expressional instrument. That&#8217;s what I’ve been exploring, especially with meditation or deep contemplation of contacting altered planes of conscious present time. And so to talk about it is to take the mind out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there&#8217;s sounds of passion, passionate immersion. The voice can be used to express witnessing inside of an awe-inspiring perception. So the whole body becomes the voice and the breath and the movement and become a conduit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Invented or improvisational language can be the evidence of a person or practitioner in total immersion, total submission, getting involved with a total perception that&#8217;s beyond linear description. So the brain is given a vacation, and in that vacation or place, it might be freed up to have an alternative space-time experience. And that might be the message the artist wants to convey, that there is an alternative way of being conscious here and now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have heard you talk about music as a tool for total presence. Why do you think music has that kind of effect on us?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Music generated or channeled by the right musician or artist? The artist is in a state of contemplation or meditation or a suspended time awareness. And in the languaging that occurs with their instrument, their interaction with their instrument and with their voice can convey this repurposing of the human instrument, repurposing it from a conveyor of local human-based emotion to a conduit of exalted emotion, direct perception inside this timeless present moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s always available. Certain sounds. Drones can do that. Music that&#8217;s very spontaneous, that can pull the mind out of linear thought, could allow the perceiver, the listener, to suddenly directly notice the reality of eternal time and the infinite space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sound can point to the invisible and sound can suggest the flowing of energy, the flowing of blood, the flowing of breath. It can suggest the integration of seemingly separate and discordant. In the case of a harp, all 36 strings are vibrating at the same time and producing this synergetic tonal event. So, as you say, that sound can throw a suggestion. It can point to the invisible, it can point to the transcendent. It can direct the emotional body out of heaviness so that a lightness, a more ethereal resonance can be directly witnessed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once we start talking and using words, we&#8217;re already in the world of ideas and abstractions. But music is more primary than that, right? It touches something in us that existed before we invented words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes. Music might be able to say more than what speech can say. My general mode of operation is to prepare before a performance or recording through just dropping into a refined sense of the meditative field. Do some yoga postures, some breathing exercises, some positive affirmations, and then sculpt this field or point to this transcendental field and let it transmit itself into a sound repetition through me. When this happens, I tend to call it a sound bath. A celestial sound bath. It’s an immersion experience. And once again, here we&#8217;re away from the words and we&#8217;re into the pure impacting force of sound.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you actually find a meaningful distinction between music and meditation, or is it all just different manifestations of the same practice?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My ultimate answer is that they&#8217;re one and the same, meaning that in the moment of deepest meditation, I consider meditation to be the highest romance and that romance is the highest meditation. This meditation is simultaneous with music. It couldn&#8217;t be separated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When did laughter become such an important thing for you?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It shifted the energies of the bullies in my neighborhood when I was young to use humor. I wouldn&#8217;t be so afraid of their presence when I could use humor. And in church, we use humor because it could get so boring. And because I was in the right place to use it, we&#8217;d use it to get other peers to laugh in the middle of a serious sermon. But I notice the power of laughter to alter, to break the sense of rigidity and separation. I began writing scripts in high school and doing situation comedies for talent shows because I enjoyed seeing people lose it to laughter. The family I grew up in, the uncles, aunts, the cousins all were laughter friendly, so laughter was always on the menu. I can&#8217;t remember even a funeral where laughter was outlawed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You really do see it as a transformative force?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, after doing standup comedy I decided to let standup comedy go for a while and just focus on music. It was a book by Rajneesh, Osho Rajneesh, that helped me to realize that I could access the laughter experience without doing comedy, and that I could guide other people into the laughter zone and enjoy the deliciousness of laughter without using humor and at the sacrifice of something. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And now, through laughter — play shops, I call them — we use laughter to get people into the play zone and to get them into contact with their inner child and to get them into deep relaxation. Yeah. And I really enjoy laughter now because it can come up out of people without it having to be nervous. Yeah, the entire body can get involved. The entire breath can be open, and it&#8217;s getting sweeter and more delicious every time I do one of these. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So laughter is another way to transcend the thinking mind?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes. Rajneesh pointed out that when you&#8217;re laughing, really involved with laughter, that you or us or whoever is laughing is not thinking, they&#8217;re not involved in the thought process of linear thought. That may be so if you&#8217;re into pure, open laughter. If it&#8217;s a nervous laughter where you&#8217;re mindful of a threatening situation, that would be a different situation. But real, full body, cathartic laughter, you&#8217;re releasing faster than you can think. So there&#8217;s no thought process processing what it is that&#8217;s being released. It’s just a yummy, open, nurturing release. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;ve been a professional musician for decades, performing all over the world. You&#8217;re entangled with the business and the commercial side of music. I guess I just wonder how you navigate that element, of being a professional musician and being a spiritual person at the same time?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, I did many years ago get that unless I integrate my spiritual nature, I would never be totally happy, content, or experience resolution because I can&#8217;t get it from the physical world. I&#8217;m not hating the physical world, but things in the physical world are temporary and constantly we&#8217;re reminded that things come, they stay, and then they leave. And some things are just too beautiful for us to accept that they&#8217;re ever going to leave. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I grew to understand that behind the world that is changing, there is this spiritual field that if I learn how to embrace it constantly, even while I&#8217;m embracing my outer wealth, that when the outer wealth shifts, I&#8217;m not bent out of shape because I&#8217;m still connected to this inner spiritual platform that doesn&#8217;t get bent out of shape when the outer world shifts. So for me, staying constant and staying with my spiritual practice allows me to be more playful and less fearful of the physical world, and less fearful of change and less fearful of losing. And so I find that the spiritual side helps me to be more present, more experimental, and more risk-taking with my musical expression.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ve also heard you say that you think our core spiritual problem is our misidentification with our bodies. What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m not going to do this. I wouldn&#8217;t think of doing this to you, Sean. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wait, what are you going to do to me?!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would amputate your leg. Your feet. You&#8217;re still there. Your torso. You&#8217;re still there. Your arms, your elbows. You&#8217;re still there. That&#8217;s just a head. And you&#8217;re still there. Your ears and nose goes. You&#8217;re still there. Your lips and tongue. God is still there. Suddenly your head disappears. But you&#8217;re still there. And you&#8217;re saying to yourself, wait a minute. I thought I was that body. Look. I&#8217;m timeless. I&#8217;m invisible. I&#8217;m wingless. What do I do with this? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I believe that identification with the physical body, which is birth, that lives and dies, and we get attached to it, and we get sentimental with it. And we try to enjoy its five senses, and we forget, or we don&#8217;t access the joy that we can have, the more expansive joy we can have through the infinite self that is always here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps your buddies have had an epiphany through the use of certain ceremonies. Where you&#8217;re suddenly in another sense of present time and space, a different sense of expansiveness, a different sense of how time is unfolding, slower or not at all. And to have this experience is to be taking advantage of a different form of body. The deepest sense of happiness and joy I feel comes from having an intimate, communing experience with my eternal present time-self. The spiritual presence which is always here, always everywhere. It just needs to be totally present, to dig it in, to catch it and to wear it and to behold it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;re 80 years old. You&#8217;ve been making music for over 40 years. You&#8217;ve lived such an interesting life as an artist and a contemplative. As you sit here now, today, what is your spiritual mission? What gets you out of bed every day?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ll go through what I have to do the moment I get out of bed. Usually what gets me up is a sense of a daily agenda, which is different every day. Something that I&#8217;m going to do that day that I&#8217;m going to really enjoy, whether it&#8217;s music, performance, or designing, new tuning or getting to know a new piece of equipment, or sitting for an extra period of time in meditation, either in lotus position in my house or going for a walk in Central Park or Riverside Park and sitting on a bench in the sun, getting into meditation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What keeps me enthusiastically involved in life and passionately involved with life is the sensation of an eternal non-human intelligence that&#8217;s generating this thing called creation and is allowing me to participate in it and to co-witness and to co-collaborate with it. And then in the midst of this, it is remaining invisible and remaining infinite. And I&#8217;m feeling it through my connection with it. And so it&#8217;s not so much what I&#8217;m getting out of bed for, but as I&#8217;m getting out of bed there’s this sense of conscious improvisational collaboration within the divine alternating intelligence. But when I&#8217;m doing tours and I&#8217;m put in a nice, beautiful hotel, I&#8217;ll happily get out of bed for the breakfast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-cynicism-is-bad-for-you/id1081584611?i=1000668856931\"><em>Listen to the rest of the conversation</em></a><em> and be sure to follow</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea\"><em> </em><em>The Gray Area</em></a><em> on</em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\"><em> </em><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"><em> </em><em>Spotify</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793\"><em> </em><em>Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But when I traveled to wine country last year, it was to observe a side of Sonoma that few outsiders know about: a dead-of-night animal rights <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2023/06/13/perdue-chicken-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-dxe/\">protest</a> at an industrial chicken slaughterhouse, located within a stone’s throw of a gastropub, an organic bakery, and a major vegan cheesemaker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">Processing Meat newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">here</a> for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>’s biweekly newsletter from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\">Marina Bolotnikova</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\">Kenny Torrella</a>, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Have questions or comments on this newsletter?</strong> Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Run by a subsidiary of the poultry giant Perdue, which raises hundreds of thousands of chickens on factory farms across Sonoma, the slaughter plant typifies the unusual politics of agriculture in this part of the country, where a cultivated image of gentle, humane farming sometimes sits uneasily alongside an increasingly consolidated agriculture sector. The county has also seen a recent influx of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/09/animal-rights-california-sonoma-farms-00162034\">new residents</a> fleeing rising housing prices in San Francisco, a longtime center of animal rights activism and utopian thought.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The region’s rural heritage and progressive politics will collide next month when Sonoma County residents vote on a first-of-its-kind ballot measure that could banish Perdue’s chicken facilities, along with all other large factory farms. The <a href=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/measure-text\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/measure-text\">proposed law</a> — which would cap the size of animal agriculture facilities and phase out all large factory farms in the county within three years — faces long odds. If successful, it could reshape the face of farming in the county and set a precedent that has terrified agricultural interests in California and across the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Known as <a href=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/\">Measure J</a>, the proposal has produced fierce debate in the county over the environmental, public health, and animal welfare impacts of modern animal agriculture. It’s <a href=\"https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/sonoma-county-measure-j-factory-farming-campaign-contributions/\">poised</a> to generate the highest campaign spending of any ballot measure in Sonoma County history, with about $2 million in contributions made for and against — the vast majority of which has been spent by industry in <a href=\"https://www.noonmeasurej.com/\">opposition</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measure J is one of a pair of local ballot initiatives this fall seeking to abolish industrial animal agriculture. In Denver, a historic center for the Western livestock trade and still an important hub for the US sheep industry, voters will decide next month whether to <a href=\"https://proanimal.org/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-ban/\">ban slaughterhouses</a> in the city. The measure’s passage would shut down a lamb slaughter plant that butchers <a href=\"https://csuredi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REDI-Research-May-24-Denver-Slaughterhouse.pdf\">up to 500,000</a> lambs per year, accounting for between 15 and 20 percent of all US lamb meat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both measures face opposition from their respective political elites, including the local Democratic Parties in Denver and Sonoma and the entire Sonoma County Board of Supervisors. While some prior farm animal welfare ballot measures — like California’s historic 2018 animal welfare law, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721488/prop-12-scotus-pork-pigs-factory-farming-california-bacon\">Proposition 12</a> — have been more limited in scope, aiming to incrementally improve horrific factory farm conditions, the Sonoma County and Denver measures are more clearly perceived as bans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The measures are easily perceived as negative, as snatching things away from people — and they put proponents in the awkward position of trying to persuade voters to effectively abolish an industry, at least locally, on which they depend for abundant cheap meat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s already famously expensive to live in California in part because it’s <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-144156645\">difficult</a> to build housing, and some Sonoma residents may roll their eyes at Measure J as yet another bid to make it <a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/california/californias-business-cost-remains-expensive-new-study-says/\">prohibitively expensive</a> to do business in the Golden State.&nbsp;But industrial animal agriculture —&nbsp;a sector that exacts <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws\">immense costs</a> on the public in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, strain on local resources, disease risk, and animal suffering — makes a more worthy target for a ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In principle, there’s a lot of sense in capping the size of factory farms. Measure J&#8217;s proponents are betting that progressive Sonoma County, better known for its tasting rooms than its slaughterhouses, can push California — and the nation — in that direction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Animal cruelty in a farming paradise</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measure J, advanced by a <a href=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/\">coalition</a> of animal rights, environmental, and public health groups known as the Coalition to End Factory Farming, would require farms <a href=\"https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sector_table.pdf\">classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency</a> as large “concentrated animal feeding operations” (known as CAFOs) to either downsize or shut down within three years. The proposal is similar to a farm reform <a href=\"https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-reintroduces-bill-to-reform-farm-system-with-expanded-support-from-farm-labor-environment-public-health-faith-based-and-animal-welfare-groups\">bill</a> introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) that would phase out large CAFOs by 2040.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sonoma doesn’t have the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">mega factory farms</a> found in the Midwest or South, or elsewhere in California, that pack together millions of chickens or several thousand cows in one place. But it does have big industrial farms that employ standard factory farm methods.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/unnamed.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.469063017877,100,63.061873964245\" alt=\"Graphic from a video showing how many animals a farm needs to house to be considered a large CAFO.

Dairy operations of 700 or more mature dairy cows are classified as large CAFOs, while chicken farms can house up to 125,000 birds before being considered large CAFOs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The trend is toward mergers and toward ever-increasing sizes in animal agriculture,” Woody Hastings, a Sonoma County resident who works in climate policy and supports Measure J, told me. Hastings has worked with environmental justice organizations in California’s Central Valley, a far more CAFO-dense, ultra-productive agricultural region where residents <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/classes/es196/projects/2022final/SallstromE_2022.pdf\">are afflicted by</a> air and water pollution and terrible odors. “What I learned in my work in the Central Valley is seeing how bad things can get if there is no cap on the size,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Reichardt-Crowding-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.8176599344147,100,92.364680131171\" alt=\"Dozens of white ducks inside a shed on a wire floor.\" title=\"Dozens of white ducks inside a shed on a wire floor.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A duck CAFO in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Hugging-Chickens.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,1.1762443385637,100,97.647511322873\" alt=\"Chickens on a dirt floor, with one chicken leaning its head on the shoulder of another one\" title=\"Chickens on a dirt floor, with one chicken leaning its head on the shoulder of another one\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Chickens at a CAFO in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Animal farming industries have <a href=\"https://sonomaunitedvote.org/\">mobilized</a> an all-out war against Measure J, pushing social media campaigns, TV ads, and a direct mail blitz, at times making exaggerated claims about the measure’s potential to wipe out all animal agriculture in the county or cause a <a href=\"https://www.noonmeasurej.com/faq\">dramatic spike</a> in food prices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One direct mailer sponsored by Western United Dairies (WUD), a dairy trade group, claimed the measure would shut down “more than 60 organic dairy farms” — but there are only 50 dairy farms of all categories in the county, according to the most recent USDA <a href=\"https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2022/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_2_County_Level/California/st06_2_011_011.pdf\">data</a>, and most of them don’t meet the threshold to be affected by Measure J. “We do not differentiate between any dairy farming operations,” WUD told me in a statement, adding that they were concerned that Measure J would affect all dairy farms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The measure is written in a confusing way, and there’s been uncertainty&nbsp;in the county about&nbsp;its scope,&nbsp;with some arguing that it could be construed to include farms that are smaller than large CAFOs.&nbsp;The measure says that it would phase out both medium and large CAFOs, but because the definition of a medium CAFO requires that it directly discharge manure into surface water, no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/chicken-farms-dairy-factory-animal-activists-farmers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">known farm</a>&nbsp;in the county, based on EPA data, meets the EPA&#8217;s standard to be a medium CAFO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the opposition to Measure J has centered on Sonoma County’s dairy industry, which has been declining in recent decades and has almost entirely <a href=\"https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/business/north-bay-dairies-shift-to-organic-milk-production-seeking-higher-income-a/\">converted</a> to organic, pasture-based operations because they command higher retail prices, according to Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at UC Davis. Although the measure wouldn’t affect consumer prices much because grocery stores would simply stock more milk from elsewhere in the region, Sumner said, it is<em> </em>likely to reduce significantly how much milk is produced in Sonoma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s left some Sonoma voters asking: Why punish dairies that are doing things better than the vast majority of the US dairy industry? Measure J “threatens what is probably one of the best progressive dairy environments, certainly in California, probably in the country,” Roy Smith, a small farmer in Sonoma County, told me.&nbsp;“Yes, there are compromises that are made, but if we wanted to improve the well-being [of animals], I would suggest that more dairies reopen here, and close the ones that are low-welfare in Wisconsin.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No dairy farm in Sonoma is as big as America’s biggest <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">mega-dairies</a>, and it’s undoubtedly true that cows with access to a pasture have it better than those raised on conventional factory farms. But organic dairies can still qualify as <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/organic-concentrated-animal-feeding-operations-dairy-usda-factory-farms\">CAFOs</a>. Most of Sonoma’s milk cows are still concentrated on farms that are very large, and large-scale dairy production of any kind is hard to justify on environmental and animal welfare grounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether they’re raised organic or conventional, ruminant grazing requires a lot of land and water — the latter increasingly scarce in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23655640/colorado-river-water-alfalfa-dairy-beef-meat\">parched American West</a> — and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf\">produces significant greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Organic dairy CAFOs, including some in Sonoma, share some of the characteristics of conventional ones, like the use of manure lagoons — giant pools of animal waste that pollute air and water and can harm human health. And, organic or not, the dairy business model depends on repeatedly impregnating dairy cows and taking away their newborns (highly social animals that are then generally forced to live alone in small hutches) to extract the cows’ milk, keeping them alive just as long as they remain productive.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/DJI_0109.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.70421724872,100,78.59156550256\" alt=\"Aerial view of several rows of hutches used to individually house dairy calves.\" title=\"Aerial view of several rows of hutches used to individually house dairy calves.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Dairy calf housing at a farm in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/DJI_0090.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.5164754795709,100,86.967049040858\" alt=\"Aerial view of cows on a farm that looks like a feedlot (without pasture).\" title=\"Aerial view of cows on a farm that looks like a feedlot (without pasture).\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A dairy farm in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A recent Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/alexandre-farms-treatment-of-animals/677980/\">investigation</a> into one of the nation’s most celebrated organic dairies, a few counties north of Sonoma, found pervasive animal cruelty, including some techniques that were unique to the organic model. (Because milk from cows that have ever received antibiotics can’t be marketed as organic, cows can be denied them even when they really need them for a painful disease or injury.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my experience writing about the livestock industry, it’s often the worst factory farms that set the bar for how we talk about animal agriculture, allowing other producers — including organic facilities — to appear idyllic by comparison. We rarely frame the conversation around what animals truly deserve: Does it really make sense to mass produce another mammal for its milk, separating mothers from babies, all for a product that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools\">isn’t nutritionally necessary</a> and that climate scientists <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf\">say</a> is so high in emissions that we have to scale it down?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measure J, a blunt instrument for shrinking a bloated industry, offers one possible answer: We have to make less of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Slaughterhouse zero</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Denver, meanwhile, the proposed slaughterhouse ban, led by the advocacy group <a href=\"https://proanimal.org/\">Pro-Animal Future</a>, looms like a “black cloud” over the US sheep industry, as one sheep feedlot employee <a href=\"https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/21538-lamb-processors-fate-in-question-as-denver-voters-weigh-slaughterhouse-ban\">put it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last 50 years, American lamb farming has <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?country=~USA\">declined precipitously</a>; the Denver slaughterhouse that would be shut down by the ballot measure, run by top lamb producer Superior Farms, is one of relatively few important facilities remaining.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the measure passes, it&#8217;s possible that some producers will be able to send their animals to be slaughtered elsewhere or that a new slaughterhouse will open outside Denver limits. Or, Sumner told me, the measure could hasten the death of the lamb industry altogether. Not many investors are saying, “Gee, I think I&#8217;ll go into the lamb slaughtering business,” he said. “Mostly they look for something that’s growing, and nobody thinks the lamb business is growing.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pro-Animal Future, much like the coalition campaigning for Measure J in Sonoma County, sees the ballot initiative as a means to start civic conversations about building a more humane, planet-friendly food system, without making people feel like the only option available to them for making change is to go vegan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lamb industry, particularly an industrial slaughterhouse, is a reasonable target for such a reckoning: Most people rarely eat lamb — making them perhaps more sympathetic to them as animals — while slaughterhouses are, pretty much invariably, sites of terrible violence. The per-serving climate impact of sheep’s meat is also <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-protein-poore\">significant</a>, second only to beef.&nbsp;The Superior slaughterhouse, under the name Mountain Meadows, was also recently <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-settlement-superior-farms-resolves-chemical-risk-violations-north-denver-facility\">fined</a> by the EPA for Clean Air Act violations, and has been <a href=\"https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?company=Mountain+meadows+lamb\">fined</a> multiple times for labor violations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This week, the Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/\">published</a> findings from a recent <a href=\"https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-exposed-superior-farms-investigation-reveals-shocking-violence\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-exposed-superior-farms-investigation-reveals-shocking-violence\">undercover investigation</a> into conditions at the Superior slaughterhouse, including gruesome footage of partially eviscerated, thrashing lambs hanging upside down on the slaughter line, with one lamb appearing to lift its head and open its mouth, and injured lambs who are unable to walk being thrown, dragged, and kicked toward slaughter. It also documented what appears to be the use of <a href=\"https://ambrook.com/research/livestock/judas-goats-slaughter-meatpacking-wildlife-control\">“Judas sheep”</a>: sheep who live at the slaughterhouse and have been trained to greet incoming truckloads of lambs and lead them to slaughter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Superior Farms spokesperson Bob Mariano told me in a statement that “nothing included in the footage we have seen is evidence of extreme violence, animal cruelty, or halal violations [the slaughterhouse is halal-certified]. This is yet another example of proponents of the slaughterhouse ban misunderstanding or misrepresenting standard, legally compliant parts of the slaughter process in an attempt to shock voters and influence an election. This is not the first time our workers have been attacked by activist groups falsely claiming that illegally obtained footage shows things that it simply does not.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Paddle.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.1196789549376,100,93.760642090125\" alt=\"Aerial view of sheep in a metal chute coming out of a truck and into a building.\" title=\"Aerial view of sheep in a metal chute coming out of a truck and into a building.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Lambs being unloaded from a truck at the Denver slaughterhouse. | Courtesy of Direct Action Everywhere\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of Direct Action Everywhere\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The investigation’s findings echoed a recent Denver Post <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2024/10/06/denver-slaughterhouse-ban-ordinance-309/\">op-ed</a> by Denver resident Jose Huizar, who worked at the slaughterhouse decades ago: “Someone has to wield that knife — over and over,” he wrote. “Spending your day slitting throats, stepping in guts, ripping the skin from the spasming bodies of animals who were alive moments ago — it’s hard to go home to your family after that.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The slaughterhouse, located in Denver’s low-income, majority nonwhite neighborhood of Globeville, <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/november-ballot-measure-threatens-to-shut-down-denvers-only-slaughterhouse-160-jobs-on-the-line\">employs</a> about 160 people — people who don’t want to lose their jobs. Like Measure J, the Denver ballot initiative directs local government to prioritize people whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the measure in workforce training programs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Our hope is not just to stick it to this one slaughterhouse, but to draw a connection to the fact that this is how the industry is run generally,” Olivia Hammond, an organizer for Pro-Animal Future, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Woody Hastings, the Sonoma resident, compared the fight against factory farming to oil and gas phase-outs: Just as we need to transition away from fossil fuels, we know we need to scale down industrial animal agriculture. We also know there will be economic impacts to such change that ought to be distributed fairly, and workers who lose their jobs ought to be treated with dignity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The anti-factory farming movement has a long way to go in convincing the people of Sonoma County and Denver to see industrial animal agriculture the way they do fossil fuels.&nbsp;And without meaningful change in either the underlying demand for meat and dairy, or in nationwide regulation of CAFOs, isolated local initiatives are, for now, likely to only shift production elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But should even one of the ballot measures succeed next month, political leaders might be persuaded that their constituents care enough about farm animal issues to create momentum for further reform. Win or lose, though, animal advocates will still face the wearying task of trying to bridge the public’s cognitive dissonance about where our meat comes from and channel it productively into politics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was featured in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\"><em>Processing</em>&nbsp;<em>Meat</em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.

But residents who are cleaning out waterlogged homes and businesses have another challenge to their recovery, one that hasn’t let up — viral disinformation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the rumor that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750. False, <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response\">according to a fact-checking page</a> the agency has set up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What about the one that says FEMA is blocking private planes from landing in affected areas to deliver supplies? Also false.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These rumors have turned political, with some Republican politicians, including former President Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund\">repeating them to large audiences</a>. As FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/weather/hurricane-milton-disinformation-fema.html\">said recently</a>, the swirl of misinformation is “absolutely the worst that I have ever seen.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Misinformation is not uncommon in disasters. They come on fast. People see things that don&#8217;t end up being true,” <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/juliette-kayyem\">Juliette Kayyem</a>, a crisis management expert at Harvard who served as the assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, told <em>Today, Explained</em>’s<em> </em>Sean Rameswaram. “I think in many ways what we&#8217;re experiencing now is purposeful lying.” Kayyem is also the author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Never-Sleeps-Learning-Disasters/dp/1541700090\"><em>The Devil Never Sleeps: Learning to Live in an Age of Disasters</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get your podcasts, including <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL3RvZGF5LWV4cGxhaW5lZA==\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A\">Spotify</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/today-explained\">Stitcher</a>.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9404903345\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For people who may have missed this disaster of facts, can you just tell them what&#8217;s going on?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you look on social media, at the atmosphere of response, there&#8217;s a lot of false facts about how the Biden administration is responding, about basic disaster response capabilities and rules. They are then amplified by, in particular, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and create their own reality that then has to be shot down by already-overburdened first responders, emergency managers, and FEMA, which has put up a rumor page on their website just to combat this crap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One example is Donald Trump consistently saying that the money that should go to Americans who are impacted by the disaster was all used for housing illegal immigrants. Not true. There was a separate line item to support migrants and sheltering that Congress passed. That money was sent to FEMA to administer, but it wasn&#8217;t replacing disaster management funds. It didn&#8217;t even overlap. It&#8217;s just the same entity distributing these funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This creates a false division between the immigrants, who are not getting this money, and Americans, who might be mad that the money that they want for disaster relief is not available. They demoralize emergency managers and volunteers. They put them at risk. I have talked to people at FEMA about what&#8217;s happening on the ground. They are deploying people in larger numbers because they&#8217;re worried about what the reaction will be. Most importantly, it&#8217;s confusing victims about what they should do, what they have access to, and what&#8217;s available to them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;re saying that Donald Trump is perpetrating some of this misinformation. Where is he doing it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At his rallies; on social media. Recently at a rally, he suggested that resources weren&#8217;t going to red states, that more Republicans were dying. There&#8217;s just no factual basis for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What&#8217;s interesting is you&#8217;re seeing Republican governors push back on that narrative, saying that they are <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/10/08/biden-call-may-have-calmed-desantis-harris-pre-storm-dustup/75568059007/\">getting the resources they want</a>. They know that they have to work with the federal government to protect their citizens and begin these recoveries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most obnoxious, disgusting rumors being amplified out in the communications space involves whether FEMA would take your home. FEMA has a process where they can buy your home. It&#8217;s a very small program. It&#8217;s if you, the homeowner, and FEMA agree on a fair market value and you don&#8217;t want to live there anymore because it&#8217;s been flooded four years in a row, and this is a rational transactional decision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This narrative that they&#8217;re going to take your home — what does that do? Well, it makes people very nervous about leaving their home. And so you hear people now saying,<em> </em>“I&#8217;m not going to leave, because if I leave my home, the government&#8217;s going to take it.” Those are the real-world impacts of all of these lies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And you&#8217;re saying this is being amplified not only by other Republican politicians, but by the owner of Twitter?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes. He is probably the biggest amplifier of disinformation, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1842246865234128978\">retweeting things that are clearly false</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What they&#8217;re trying to do is create divisions in communities in two ways. One is the divide between the citizen and government, which has always been a tactic by that wing of MAGA-ism. Then also [there’s the divide] between citizens and their neighbors. That creates chaos, confusion, and divisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think why you&#8217;re seeing such a concerted pushback by GOP governors, but also by FEMA and others who are calling this out, is because they know it can harm their response capabilities. I should say this is being done at a time when we&#8217;re seeing our very communication networks under stress. Communications are down. It&#8217;s hard to communicate with people. And so they have that vacuum being filled by this noxiousness of which has life-and-death consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Back during Hurricane Sandy, I distinctly remember social media being useful for people. It was useful for people going through Sandy, it was useful for government agencies to get out information. Is that era of social media being a helpful tool in a disaster over?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s over. Elon Musk broke “Disaster Twitter.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Twitter&#8217;s moment of birth, the moment that its founder realized its benefit, was during a minor earthquake in San Francisco. It had been just one of those other social media platforms. But it was that real-time, authenticated information that was flowing in people&#8217;s feeds that the leadership at Twitter began to take its responsibility in a disaster very seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You had an entire system, including the government relying on Twitter to amplify good information, and that whole system is down. This is the first domestic disaster where that is entirely clear, that Twitter is broken across the board for disaster management.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is the mis- and disinformation around Milton as bad as that we saw after Helene?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You saw it more online than, say, from political leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You saw much more aggressive government [and] FEMA pushback on that. They were sort of ready now. Helene was — I think they were sort of caught [by surprise]. So you saw just a lot of outreach, a lot of push back on the misinformation and even from [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis, who pushed back on some of that.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think this makes an agency like FEMA more prepared for the next hurricane and for the next storm, if you will, of misinformation?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, I think it will, on the misinformation and the lies front. I think it&#8217;s just going to be part of your emergency management plan. You&#8217;re going to push back on the rumors in a very formal way. It used to be done, but it was very piecemeal. I saw language coming out of FEMA spokespeople, which I&#8217;d never seen before, essentially just calling out the lies, in particular on social media. So they&#8217;re using the language, the sort of freewheeling language, of social media, which I think is important, rather than the sort of more formal language of government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think from the hype around Milton, there was this sense that, like, it could destroy Tampa. And it&#8217;s early yet, but I don&#8217;t think that happened. Do you think that sort of confirms and fuels this misinformation engine after an event like this?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, it will be viewed as overreach, as “the government&#8217;s incompetent, it doesn&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing.” I think the next evacuation will be harder if you don&#8217;t see the kind of damage and the kind of death that everyone was worried about. This is something that&#8217;s common, it has a name: the preparedness paradox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you are ready, you get houses ready, you get communities ready, you get them to evacuate, and the thing comes through and the damage is less than you were worried about — that&#8217;s why you wanted the evacuation. That&#8217;s why you wanted the houses to be ready.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People will say, “What were you so worried about in the first place?“ In other words, the government&#8217;s reaction, which may have minimized harm and damage and death, may very well, paradoxically, be viewed as the government&#8217;s original assessment was wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Could FEMA be doing a better job during Helene and now Milton?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s hard for me to know right now. In some ways, FEMA&#8217;s biggest challenge is going to be recovery. How quickly can they deploy resources?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Helene, the biggest lesson learned is how we communicate risk to Americans who may not view themselves at risk. Looking back, the only warnings that were given were a flood warning given to communities where there could be a flood. That is likely because people remember the soil was very saturated from rains in the days before. And I wonder if, in hindsight, flood warning — does it get people to move? Maybe we should think about how we communicate risk, especially because we&#8217;re getting these events that don&#8217;t really have historical precedent.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s not only Netflix trying out an interesting format — the show debuted live on May 3 and played out over the past week in a series of six nightly live episodes — but it also feels like Mulaney soft-launching a side gig.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As the host to a motley crew of Los Angeles natives and town-invading comedians, Mulaney seems to be testing the waters for what kind of comedy his audience wants from him now. His 2023 confessional special <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/john-mulaney-baby-j-netflix-comedy-review.html\"><em>Baby J</em></a> won an Emmy for outstanding writing and delved into his recent struggles with sobriety, but it brought mixed reviews from critics — <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/tv/2023/04/26/john-mulaney-baby-j-netflix/\">some of whom</a> seemed <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a43695876/john-mulaney-baby-j-netflix-comedy-review/\">skeptical at best</a> that Mulaney had done enough to bare his soul for the rest of us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After a rough few years for Mulaney, such cynicism about the comedian seemed to be the prevailing sentiment. In particular, 2021 saw him enter rehab for drug addiction. Shortly after his release, it became clear that Mulaney had <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/03/07/entertainment/john-mulaney-ex-anna-marie-tendler-memoir-going-to-end-him/\">chosen to end his marriage</a> to his then-wife of six years, Anna Marie Tendler, and begun a relationship with actor Olivia Munn — the timeline of which has been described as “<a href=\"https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1226287/john-mulaney-cheat-annamarie-tendler-olivia-munn/\">tight</a>.” No sooner had Mulaney filed for divorce than <a href=\"https://www.thelist.com/1545186/john-mulaney-olivia-munn-cheating-rumors-explained/\">rumors</a> of an affair leaked, followed by news that Munn was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The scandal hit the public unusually hard in a pandemic-era culture that clung to its heroes, and Mulaney’s transgressions spawned both intense backlash and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22663143/john-mulaney-olivia-munn-pregnant-parasocial-relationships-kylie-jenner\">intense discourse</a> about whether our parasocial relationships have gotten too warped. The period severely damaged Mulaney’s relationship with his core audience, once full of people who responded to his idealistic charm. Those folks didn’t seem to move on easily — not even by April 2023, when Mulaney, through <em>Baby J</em>, proffered a way forward via the more traditional route: a redemptive confessional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jump ahead to May 2024, and perhaps, if attempt one didn’t totally set a clear path forward for the comic, attempt two will: enter, an intentionally random daily comedy talk show built around the threadbarest of excuses. The show’s raison d’être: LA is weird. The solution: gather an unexpected bunch of funny people and locals together to talk about how weird LA is. The host: a comedian famed for his own likable random weirdness.</p>\n\n<p>Mulaney seems to be covering his bases. “We are only doing six episodes,” he explains in the introduction to <em>Everybody’s in LA</em>, “so the show will never hit its groove.” If this flops, it’s fine. Mulaney jokes that he doesn’t know why he’s doing the show, which functions as a side event for Netflix’s elaborate LA comedy festival, <a href=\"https://www.netflixisajokefest.com/\">Netflix Is a Joke</a>. “I need structure,” he says, a non-justification that also doubles as a subtle reminder for some viewers that we’re looking at a person who has a history of addiction and is presumably in recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That’s about as deep as this show gets, however; though we do get some gestures to sociocultural topics like environmentalism and the incessant problem of LA traffic, they’re handed to us in the guise of, for example, a coyote wrangler or a gonzo helicopter journalist. Mulaney features famous comedians, yes, but also everyone from hypnotherapists to former OJ Simpson prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/2/25/11105096/marcia-clark-oj-simpson\">Marcia Clark</a>. (And really, what could be more LA than that?) In between conversations, Mulaney features pretaped sketches from more guest comedians and <em>Daily Show</em>-style comedy correspondents. As if that’s not chaotic enough, he also has call-in guests. At one point during episode five, a seismologist sits quietly by while a caller recounts being awakened by an earthquake while sleeping in the nude. These probably aren’t the talk show beats you’re used to.</p>\n\n<p>Mulaney’s one-week fling with the city also works out well for Netflix. Despite trying on and off for years <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/business/media/netflix-talk-shows.html\">to make Netflix talk shows a thing</a>, and despite intermittently bringing David Letterman back to do one-off long-form interviews, the platform has never nailed the format before this. The nightly show seems to be making a small impact; it’s currently hanging around at No. 10 on the Netflix US Top 10 shows for the day, and it’s moved up and down the chart for most of the week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Not a bad beginning; the beginning of what<em>,</em> exactly, remains somewhat unclear. Netflix could also be using this show as a pilot entry for similar themed efforts from other temporary hosts — in other words, more <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/10/1250386835/netflix-john-mulaney-everybodys-in-la-tom-brady-roast\">appointment TV</a>. It certainly seems that the entire week, beginning with Katt Williams’s live standup special <em>Woke Foke</em> and the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/live-netflix-comedy-specials-tom-brady-roast-katt-williams.html\">jarringly uncomfortable</a> <em>Roast of Tom Brady</em>, was an experimental make-or-break week for Netflix and live programming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps Netflix will do this again next year during its next comedy fest; perhaps in a few months, Mulaney will move to another quirky American city with another quirky band of guests. It’s an interesting concept: What would this type of series be like if it took both it and the city it’s in a little more seriously? What would viewers make of it if we didn’t know as much about the city itself as we’ve absorbed about Los Angeles from decades of cultural osmosis? I’m not saying <em>Everybody’s in Boise</em> is the way to go, but I am saying I’d probably watch it for the local color.</p>\n\n<p>Whether this is enough to restore Mulaney to the top of the comedy world seems equally uncertain. The main charm of the show, all told, has less to do with the assemblage of guests than watching Mulaney’s effortless wrangling of them. Night after night, Mulaney embraces all the awkwardness of live comedy, and it doesn’t always embrace back: Often the guests are hostile; the sketches don’t always land; the callers are too eager to grandstand. Mulaney sidesteps it all like it’s Dance Dance Revolution and he knows this particular song by heart. As a host, he’s fab.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the idea of Mulaney as a talk show host on an ongoing basis feels like a net loss rather than a gain. Sure, he <em>can</em> bring together comedy titans and make sure they don’t run over an hour, but he’s probably fit for better things. If the dominant criticism of <em>Baby J</em> was that it coasted too lightly over Mulaney’s self-recrimination, then <em>Everybody’s in LA</em> directs his talents entirely outward; it’s intentionally lighthearted, deliberately shallow. There’s meaning in the edges, but that usually has little to do with why we love Mulaney himself. The arguable best moment in the series, in fact, doesn’t involve Mulaney at all, but rather a pretaped segment in episode two that reunites core members of the LA punk scene. They sit around reminiscing, then write a silly punk song together on the fly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s fun, it’s poignant. But it’s not as fun or poignant as Mulaney himself can be when he’s alone onstage with only his flaws and a thousand people willing to laugh at and then forgive them. If <em>Everybody’s in LA</em> brings his audience closer to a suspension of hostilities, then it will have been well worth it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 10th, 2024: </strong>Updated with news of John Mulaney’s upcoming talk show for Netflix. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

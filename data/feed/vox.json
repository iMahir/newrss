As I write this, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/prediction-model/president/\">the Economist</a> gives Donald Trump a 56 percent chance; <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/\">FiveThirtyEight</a> gives him a 51 percent chance; <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">Nate Silver</a> gives him 53.1 percent. That’s not exactly 50-50 but it’s pretty close.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this year, a different way of judging the odds has become more popular than ever: prediction markets. These are real-money markets where people can bet on the ultimate victor of the presidential election, among other elections and events, from politics to sports to movies. While academic-sponsored markets like <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7456/Who-will-win-the-2024-US-presidential-election\">PredictIt</a> and the <a href=\"https://iemweb.biz.uiowa.edu/about-iem/what-is-the-iem/\">Iowa Electronic Markets</a> have been around for a while (decades in the latter case), two major new markets have emerged this cycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One is <a href=\"https://kalshi.com/markets/pres/presidential-elections\">Kalshi</a>, the first non-academic prediction market to be officially legal in the United States <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/betting-on-us-congress-elections-outcome-green-lit-by-judge?sref=qYiz2hd0\">after the company beat regulators in court</a> who tried to block it from allowing betting on elections. Right now, their market, with over $50 million bet in total, indicates that Trump has a 59 percent chance of victory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Kalshi is comparatively tiny next to <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024?tid=1729535865279\">Polymarket</a>, an all-crypto market accepting bets from all over the world. It’s presidential market has over $2.3 billion invested and counts <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1843132050242777187\">Elon Musk</a> among its fans. (Technically, Polymarket disallows Americans from betting on it, but <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joearvis7/how-to-use-polymarket-in-the-united-states-8a891dde1a91\">any moderately tech-savvy person</a> with a virtual private network can get around that. As of Wednesday, it has started <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-22/polymarket-cracks-down-on-us-bettors-ahead-of-presidential-election\">cracking down on US trading</a> a bit.) Right now, it claims higher odds for Trump than anywhere else: 61.9 percent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like a lot of <a href=\"https://comments.cftc.gov/Handlers/PdfHandler.ashx?id=34702\">economists</a> and <a href=\"https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=73748\">political scientists</a>, I’ve long been a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/11-1-2022/torres-leads-election-bet-push/\">big fan</a> of prediction markets. They provide a useful complement to polling by summarizing conventional wisdom about candidate odds, and also function as a tax on bullshit. There’s a lot of cheap talk in political punditry, and I’m generally of the belief that if you say things like <a href=\"https://x.com/rabois/status/1842160857121214808\">“Trump will definitely win Florida by 8 points,”</a> good etiquette requires you to bet money on that proposition. Making the bet means you’re putting your own money behind your prediction, and if you have to do that, you’re probably going to make fewer garbage predictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But these markets haven’t had a test like 2024 before, and seeing them operate with billions behind them is giving us a sense of how they’ll work at scale — including to what extent they can be manipulated to produce a certain outcome. The big question: Can we trust these things?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prediction markets for beginners</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People have been betting on elections for centuries. Henry David Thoreau memorably noted in <a href=\"https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/uprising1313/files/2017/10/Civil-Disobedience-by-Henry-David-Thoreau.pdf\">“Civil Disobedience”</a> how often betting accompanied voting. The economists Paul Rhode and Koleman Strumpf have studied <a href=\"https://users.wfu.edu/strumpks/papers/BettingPaper_final(JEP_Resubmit).pdf\">presidential election markets in the US that ran at large scale from 1868 to 1940</a>; &#8220;betting activity at times dominated transactions in the stock exchanges on Wall Street,&#8221; they find. In 1916, the peak year of these Wall Street markets, betting reached $290 million in today’s dollars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These markets do not work like typical sports gambling. Your neighborhood bookie (or, these days, FanDuel or DraftKings) sets odds on her own, obviously consulting what other bookies are setting but fundamentally deciding for herself what to charge. When you bet with her, you are betting against them, not against other bettors, and a good bookie will set odds such that they consistently profit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polymarket, Kalshi, PredictIt, and other prediction markets are genuinely <em>markets</em>: rather than betting against the house, you are buying “shares” that pay out if a particular event happens in the future. The market sells the shares to start, but then the trading is done between traders, not between traders and the house. The market-maker exists to broker transactions. That means odds can change much more quickly and fluidly than with a normal bookie. It’s more like a <a href=\"https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/basics-trading-futures-contracts#:~:text=A%20futures%20contract%20is%20a,exchange%20in%20the%20United%20States.\">futures contract</a> than a sports bet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This structure does mean you have to be careful looking at these numbers. When you look at a site like Polymarket, it’s tempting to look at the headline numbers (hmm, 61.7 percent for Trump) and assume that this represents what bettors on the site think the odds of a Trump victory are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What it really means is something like that, but a little bit subtler. As the pseudonymous finance blogger <a href=\"https://quantian.substack.com/p/market-prices-are-not-probabilities\">Quantian</a> explains, the real purpose of a prediction market is to reach an equilibrium at which the price of a “share” in a given candidate matches demand for those shares. This equilibrium can mean the price exactly matches what people in the market think the probability of that candidate winning is, which is what you’d want the price to be if the markets are to be useful for forecasting. But those two can also diverge, especially if the market is restricted in various ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, economists Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz have found that, in practice, prediction market prices are <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp06-11bk.pdf\">close to participants&#8217; aggregated beliefs</a>, and you can set a kind of confidence interval and be reasonably sure that participants&#8217; beliefs are within it. Zitzewitz notes that this is more of a problem with markets like PredictIt, which caps how much investors can put in at a relatively low level. Those rules can lead to major mispricings because they make it much harder to bet against low-probability events. “In a prediction market where you don&#8217;t really have those constraints,” Zitzewitz noted in a phone call, “then we&#8217;re much more likely to get a price equal to some average of beliefs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, be careful to never equate prediction market prices with polling results, as one since-corrected New York Times article did:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These units are not comparable <a href=\"https://t.co/cLnOM0GWE1\">pic.twitter.com/cLnOM0GWE1</a></p>&mdash; Thomas Woodside 🫜 (@Thomas_Woodside) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thomas_Woodside/status/1846598628158181763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polls do not give you a &#8220;chance of winning&#8221;; for that you need an actual model like FiveThirtyEight’s, the Economist’s, or Nate Silver&#8217;s.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do betting markets work?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The basic <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-market-faq\">theoretical case</a> for betting markets is the same as the case that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp\">normal markets are efficient</a>. If shares of, say, Nvidia are mispriced, then you can make money by betting the price will move. In a market where millions of people leveraging trillions of dollars are all acting that way, there probably won’t be too many obvious mispricings. Any ones that once existed are quickly exploited by some investors to make money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s a nice theory, though one challenged by the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2024/5/14/24156725/meme-stocks-gamestop-reddit-amc-blackberry-wallstreetbets\">emergence of “meme stocks”</a> whose prices seem totally out of whack with their actual value. The better case for prediction markets is that they’ve worked well in practice. Wolfers, Zitzewitz, and Erik Snowberg reviewed the evidence in a <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18222/w18222.pdf\">2012 paper</a>, and it’s fairly compelling. When it comes to forecasting economic outcomes (like economic growth or inflation), “macro derivatives” (a kind of prediction market for these outcomes) do as well or better as surveys of professional forecasters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A paper by David Rothschild looking at <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/73/5/895/1868587\">markets during the 2008 presidential and Senate elections</a> found that early in the election, prediction markets were significantly more accurate than polls; closer to the election, they were roughly equal. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1574072207000807\">2008 paper</a> by a team at the Iowa Electronic Markets, the longest-running prediction market in the US, found that the average error of polls (1.91 points) was higher than for markets (1.58), even late in the cycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of companies have also adopted internal prediction markets to help make decisions. Zitzewitz and Bo Cowgill <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43869468\">examined markets</a> at Google, Ford, and an anonymous third company. These markets covered topics like “demand, product quality, deadlines being met, and external events.” Zitzewitz and Cowgill then compared the markets to the predictions of internal experts; the average error of the markets was 25 percent smaller.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a very different context, economists Anna Dreber, Thomas Pfeiffer, Johan Almenberg, and Magnus Johannesson <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1516179112\">set up prediction markets</a> where psychologists could make bets on whether specific pieces of psychology research would replicate when other researchers tried to reproduce it. They found that the markets were effective at predicting which studies would replicate and outperformed simple surveys of experts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Economists Lionel Page and Robert Clemen marshaled evidence from <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2012.02561.x\">nearly 1,800 prediction markets</a> for a 2012 paper. They found that markets looking a year or more in the future were deeply flawed; they usually didn&#8217;t have enough traders to generate a price or they had systematically biased prices. But markets became increasingly well-calibrated as they got closer to the event in question. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Note that presidential elections are maybe the hardest context for judging prediction markets. If a market is “well-calibrated,” then, when looking at all the dozens or hundreds of markets it’s run, markets where an outcome has a 70 percent probability should see that outcome occur 70 percent of the time; markets where it has 20 percent odds should see that a fifth of the time; and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To do that kind of analysis, you need a lot of markets and predictions. Presidential elections are one-offs, and aside from the Iowa markets, there haven’t been modern election-betting markets going back for more than a handful of elections. Polymarket, for instance, is only on its second presidential cycle, so we have no way of knowing if it, specifically, is well-calibrated in predicting presidential elections specifically. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are the markets being manipulated?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So prediction markets are fairly accurate in general. Why are some people so opposed to them, then?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the US, the main opposition to betting markets like Kalshi has come from a handful of Democratic senators led by Jeff Merkley (D-OR). “Billionaires and large corporations can now bet millions on which party controls the House or Senate and then spend big to destroy candidates to protect their bets,” <a href=\"https://www.merkley.senate.gov/merkley-ruling-to-allow-betting-on-u-s-congressional-elections-is-a-disaster-for-democracy/\">Merkley bemoaned</a> after the court ruling allowing Kalshi to operate election markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The story of the “French whale” on Polymarket seemed to give credence to these fears. About four accounts on the market (Fredi9999, PrincessCaro, Michie, and Theo4) have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/betting-election-pro-trump-ad74aa71\">pumped</a> about <a href=\"https://x.com/Domahhhh/status/1848569365639115084\">$45 million</a> into bets on Trump since the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11ac92f4-02e4-4313-99b8-264182b74b4b\">beginning of September</a>. That’s not a ton in the scheme of a market of over $2 billion, but it’s enough to raise eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times have written about it, but the best reporter on the topic is the pseudonymous <a href=\"https://x.com/Domahhhh/\">Domer a.k.a. JustKen</a> (he uses a shot of Ryan Gosling in <em>Barbie</em> as his avatar), another major Polymarket trader who was curious just who he was betting against.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Domer did some digging and <a href=\"https://x.com/Domahhhh/status/1846597997507092901\">linked the four accounts to a Frenchman named “Michel;”</a> it seems like they were being controlled by <a href=\"https://x.com/fozzydiablo/status/1846369866091319743\">the same person</a>. “My best guess is it is a wildly risky-loving uber-wealthy Frenchman who is pretty damn sure that Trump is going to win,” Domer concluded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it could also, in theory, be an uber-wealthy Frenchman who is trying to manipulate the market to make Trump’s odds go higher. This is an often-hypothesized problem with prediction markets: someone could rush in with money to boost a particular candidate’s odds, which could then lead to media coverage and public perceptions that think the candidate is a favorite, which could in turn make them the favorite.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The nature of the markets is that if you do this on one market, you will probably have effects on all markets. If Polymarket gives Trump 65 percent odds and Kalshi gives him 55 percent odds, you can make risk-free money by buying Trump at Kalshi and Harris at Polymarket; if you only have to spend 55 cents to get a dollar if Trump wins, and 35 cents to get a dollar if Harris wins, then you can spend 90 cents to get a dollar if either Trump or Harris wins (and there’s basically 100 percent odds that one of them will win). This is called <a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/arbitrage/\">arbitrage</a>, and it tends to close gaps between the markets over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A common argument from supporters of prediction markets is that they’re resistant to this kind of manipulation. If someone injects a huge amount of money into a market to make it look a certain way and that appearance is at odds with the underlying reality, then <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0335.2008.00734.x\">there’s money to be made taking the other side of that bet</a>. That’s especially true on sites like Kalshi and Polymarket, which have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/susquehanna-starts-trading-desk-for-event-contracts-on-kalshi\">larger investors</a>, like hedge funds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If I think Harris has a 60 percent chance of winning and Polymarket thinks it’s 35 percent, I’m not going to sink my life savings into Harris contracts. Sure, that bet is profitable in theory, but there’s still a 40 percent chance that I lose everything. But hedge funds exist more or less entirely to make bets like that, and have much deeper bankrolls and risk tolerances. That means they can help prevent manipulators from swinging markets. Sure enough, around 10 pm ET on Tuesday a single trader ​(<a href=\"https://polymarket.com/profile/0xf0f6d93188725b881fc9b75b94b4424db5f58ac6?tab=activity\">Ly67890</a>) bought over $2.1 million in “Harris wins” shares, indicating that at least one counter-whale has emerged to take the other side of the bet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Past attempts to manipulate markets have tended to end badly for the manipulators. In 2012, a <a href=\"https://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-romney-whale.html\">“Romney whale”</a> who spent heavily trying to prop up Mitt Romney’s odds in prediction markets wound up <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WB-40584\">losing $4-$7 million</a>. 2008 saw a <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/manipulating-the-future/\">similar attempt to prop up John McCain’s odds</a>, which led to a crackdown from the now-defunct market Intrade. In Domer’s words, “those people got BTFO” — blown the fuck out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rhode and Strumpf, the economic historians, have <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00325.pdf\">done the most careful academic investigation of manipulation</a> I&#8217;ve seen, and found, &#8220;In the cases studied here, the speculative attack initially moved prices, but these changes were quickly undone and prices returned close to their previous levels. We find little evidence that political stock markets can be systematically manipulated beyond short time periods.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s impossible to know whether French traders are actively trying to manipulate the market, or simply have a genuine belief that Trump will win and are putting huge amounts of money behind that belief. I asked Rajiv Sethi, a professor of economics at Barnard College, Columbia University, who writes a newsletter on prediction markets, what could explain the markets giving higher probabilities than models like FiveThirtyEight or Silver. “There are two possible explanations,” he told me. “Markets could be absorbing information faster than models. They see stuff that could be moving the models, so the price rises, and then the model adjusts a couple of days later. … There’s an alternative explanation that the market just adds a premium to the model.” That is, the traders could just be a bit more pro-Trump than the models overall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s very very hard to know in real time which of these views is right. Sethi has put together <a href=\"https://rajivsethi.substack.com/p/forecasting-mechanisms-another-update\">some very preliminary evidence</a> by creating virtual traders who buy and sell shares on prediction markets based on what the models from FiveThirtyEight, Silver, and the Economist are saying. None of these traders, he finds, made money; all lost money, by about the same amounts on Polymarket, and by a larger amount for Silver than other models on PredictIt. &#8220;Does this mean that models are performing poorly relative to markets? Tentatively, yes,&#8221; Sethi writes. &#8220;But this could change quite dramatically—in either direction—over the next few days.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The real promise of prediction markets</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In some ways, I find presidential elections the most boring use case for prediction markets. Such elections are probably the single event for which we have the most popular interest in and information around predicting. We already have polling and very sophisticated polling-based forecasts that tell us a lot about the race. The website <a href=\"https://www.pollyvote.com/\">Pollyvote</a> has a very nice rundown of the literally dozens of forecasts available based on polls, models like FiveThirtyEight’s and Silver’s, political scientists’ models, and so on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do we really need prediction markets on top of those? Maybe not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the general idea of using markets to predict hard-to-predict events has merit outside an election context. Synthesizing information from a diverse array of sources is hard, and prediction markets show a lot of promise at that task.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take natural disasters. Events like hurricanes, typhoons, and earthquakes have huge humanitarian and economic effects, and while we have some statistical models that can predict them a bit, these don’t exactly provide actionable guidance for businesses, residents, insurance companies, and other people with a stake in disaster-prone regions. <a href=\"https://predictions.substack.com/p/003-natural-disaster-forecasting\">Getting decent markets in place</a> could help businesses prepare for supply-chain disruptions and give residents a strong signal that they need to get the hell out, or at least invest in more resilient housing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The issue is that betting on where is going to have a hurricane next, and how bad it’s going to be, feels a bit ghoulish (though it’s not really any more ghoulish than the odds that actuaries have to sort through every day). It’s certainly not fun, like betting on sports or the presidential election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I fear that means that the most high-value prediction markets might wind up not only not making their brokers money, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/351473/people-bet-on-sports-why-not-on-anything-else\">will have to be subsidized</a>: insurance companies, say, would pay for a market where meteorologists help sort through hurricane odds, or the National Institutes of Health could subsidize a market where medical researchers bet on the results of clinical trials, giving them a better sense of which drugs seem most promising and worth investing in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To date, prediction markets have been driven by two main forces: a sober-headed assessment of ways in which they can be a useful tool to understand the world and pure degenerate gambler instinct. As someone with a bit of the latter, I totally get how it’s fun. But if prediction markets are going to be of real social value, we need more of the sober force driving things as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Who’s going to win the presidential election? My answer, as a journalist writing about politics who gets asked this a lot, is always, “It’s a coin flip.” That’s certainly what forecasting models based on polling suggest.

Is the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22700348/venom-2-review-tom-hardy-michelle-williams\">greatest comic book movie love story</a> — a man standing in front of a symbiote asking to be loved — finally done?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Going by the events of the movie, it’s a yes to all three. But <em>The Last Dance</em> has two post-credits scenes that leave open the smallest possibility that this might not be the end of the alien’s superhero era.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/spoilers_below.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=39.551567944251,0,20.896864111498,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the film, Brock and Venom — the alien symbiote with whom the reporter shares a body — are hounded by a villain named Knull (CGI actor extraordinaire Andy Serkis). Knull is apparently some kind of awful, terrible evil — a being draped in shadows with startlingly white hair — that’s trapped in a world of eternal darkness. The only thing that can free him is a codex (which looks like a little glowing, swirling gem), which, because this is ostensibly a movie about Venom, is actually part of Venom’s body. Knull sends unkillable alien creatures called xenophages after Venom and Eddie, with the intent of killing one or both and bringing back the codex so Knull can unleash destruction and despair upon the universe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Venom and Brock are on the run after the events of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22698513/venom-2-let-there-be-carnage-post-credits-scene-tom-holland-spider-man\"><em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em></a>. They’re hiding out in Mexico, but after Venom eats some men, they decide to try to build a new life for themselves in New York City. Venom tells Eddie that he wants to see the Statue of Liberty, in large part because Eddie explains how she welcomes anyone who needs America’s shelter and protection. (Yes,<em> Venom: The Last Dance</em> actually functions as an allegory for immigration reform featuring a literal undocumented alien.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because of Knull and his xenophages, as well as interference from the American military,&nbsp;the pair never make it to New York. Instead, they’re stuck at Area 51, where things look bleak for Venom. In the symbiote’s last stand, he absorbs Knull’s murder beasts and douses himself in corrosive acid — the only thing strong enough to dissolve the xenophages. Venom’s final act is sacrificing himself for Brock and Earth, and as he and his attackers die, so does the codex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the movie’s final scene — after an extended Eddie and Venom montage — Eddie visits New York City and gazes at the Statue of Liberty. It’s&nbsp;a sight that he knows Venom would have loved. And this folks, is the end … or is it?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Venom: The Last Dance’</em>s credits scenes leave the door cracked for future symbiotes</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first of <em>The Last Dance</em>’s credits scenes is a short one. Knull appears on screen again, proclaiming that Venom has died and that he is coming to take over the universe! Will he? Well, Knull’s return will largely depend on how much money this film makes. If it does rake in some cash — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/26/18112408/venom-box-office-china-822-million\"><em>Venom</em> movies do particularly well overseas</a> — Knull could be back. But if Knull returns, wouldn’t this point to the return of Venom as well? You can’t have a villain without a hero! That’s not how superhero movies work!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lately, the once-solid, surefire success of a superhero movie looks more vulnerable, and studios are scrambling. Marvel’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23612887/ant-man-quantumania-marvel-flop-era\">post-<em>Endgame</em> design has fallen apart</a>, and the studio is banking on <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/tom-holland-robert-downey-jr-doctor-doom-secret-1236182181/\">bringing back Robert Downey Jr.</a> to help jump-start the engine. Warner Bros. is headed for a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2022/11/james-gunn-wants-all-dc-movies-tv-and-games-connected.html\">Jame Gunn-led reboot</a> of its DC Comics properties.  Sony&#8217;s tiny coterie of Marvel-adjacent films has been a semi-bright spot in the landscape, so if this film&#8217;s a hit, they&#8217;re liable to find a way to bring the franchise back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But how?</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/AB_1990_comp_ILM_v0007_textless_g_r7096_2000x1006_thumbnail_21d853.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.9635,0,96.073,100\" alt=\"Image of Venom baring teeth\" title=\"Image of Venom baring teeth\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Hey, that’s Venom! | Sony Pictures\" data-portal-copyright=\"Sony Pictures\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Last Dance</em>’s second credits scene happens after all the credits scroll, and it features a look at the rubble that remains at Area 51 where Venom perished. It’s all destroyed! Everything is a mess! All this has allowed Brock’s bartender from Mexico, who we see detained by the US military early in the film, to break out of his cell, and he wanders across the desert.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The important part here is that we see a cockroach approach remnants of a symbiote. (I fully understand that sentence is silly, but Venom is silly.) The gist: If this cockroach —&nbsp;nature’s ultimate symbol of survival — touches the symbiote, then said symbiote could possibly live. Therefore, if any part of Venom was spared by the acid, it could possibly survive via cockroach too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What this all means is that even though the movie said farewell and even though it probably is a goodbye to Hardy, there’s still a possibility that Venom or Venom-affiliated heroes (e.g., other symbiotes) could live on. That ambiguity is good for anyone who loves these movies, or anyone who possesses the odd, delusional fantasy of seeing some kind of Sony shared universe where <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24073066/dakota-johnson-madame-web-review\">Madame Web</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23005376/morbius-review-jared-leto-mcu\">Morbius</a>, and Venom all hang out like pals, or anyone who wants to finally get the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22698513/venom-2-let-there-be-carnage-post-credits-scene-tom-holland-spider-man\">Venom x Tom Holland Spider-Man</a> crossover that’s been relentlessly teased.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the aforementioned Knull credits scene, what will ultimately determine Venom’s future movies will be the box office. If lots of people go see this movie and it makes millions and millions of dollars, this won’t be Venom’s last dance. Fans of closure be damned.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Along with their associate James Jacobsen, the pair stands accused of recruiting and exploiting men for sex parties. These allegations were first revealed last year in a bombshell<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66889779\">BBC News</a> investigation and a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abercrombie-fitch-lawsuit-mike-jeffries-sex-trafficking-32aadb582055dd2468e5ad6be74e5ef0\">subsequent civil lawsuit</a> by a former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model. The alleged victims say they were under the impression that they would receive modeling opportunities for participating in these events. Both Jeffries’s and Smith’s legal teams have declined to comment on the charges, telling <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/business/mike-jeffries-arrested-sex-trafficking-abercrombie.html\">the New York Times</a> that they’ll plan to respond later on in court. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These disturbing charges add another seedy layer to Abercrombie &amp; Fitch’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23036145/abercrombie-netflix-white-hot-fitch\">problematic legacy</a> under Jeffries’s leadership, just as the company has begun to align itself with a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/consumerism/368168/abercrombie-fitch-retailers-fashion-revival\">more wholesome image</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This latest development also fits into a larger, more impactful narrative playing out in pop culture and society right now: In the fallout of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/3/18116351/jeffrey-epstein-case-indictment-arrested-trump-clinton\">Jeffrey Epstein’s 2019 case</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22698489/r-kelly-conviction-black-women-survivors\">R. Kelly’s 2021 conviction</a>, high-profile sex trafficking cases seem to be rising dramatically. According to a former prosecutor, we should probably expect to see more of them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before the charges against Jeffries, the news cycle had already been consumed by the mountain of legal troubles surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit\">hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs</a>. In September, Combs was indicted in New York City, where he remains in custody without bail, on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, and transportation for prostitution-related to his alleged “freak-off” parties. Combs’s lawyer has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sean-diddy-combs-arrested-federal-custody/\">called these claims</a> “an unjust prosecution” and says Combs “looks forward to clearing his name in court.” </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1397430310_8baa6d.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.975197577292,100,76.049604845416\" alt=\"Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs attends the 2022 Billboard Music Awards at MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 15, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\" title=\"Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs attends the 2022 Billboard Music Awards at MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 15, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Sean “Diddy” Combs at the Billboard Music Awards on May 15, 2022, in Las Vegas, Nevada. | Amy Sussman/Getty Images for MRC\" data-portal-copyright=\"Amy Sussman/Getty Images for MRC\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kanye West’s ex-assistant Lauren Pisciotta has also accused the rapper of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/yes-former-assistant-alleges-sex-trafficking-sexual-assault-amended-su-rcna175183\">trafficking women</a> in an amended civil lawsuit in which she also accuses him of sexual assault. (West&#8217;s lawyer <a href=\"https://people.com/kanye-west-responds-to-ex-assistant-sexual-harassment-wrongful-termination-lawsuit-8659055\">responded</a> to the lawsuit this summer accusing Pisciotta of &#8220;blackmail and extortion.&#8221;) Back in January, Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and AMC Networks chair James Dolan were <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/01/harvey-weinstein-james-dolan-rape-lawsuit-1235794234/\">accused of sex trafficking</a> in a complaint by a former massage therapist, although the judge dismissed the trafficking claims. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whispers of trafficking rings within Hollywood and other affluent spaces tend to run amok online, often lending to conspiracy theories and misinformation — <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/diddy-conspiracy-theories-have-lost-the-plot.html\">as we’ve seen in the case of Diddy</a>. However, we’re witnessing a legitimate movement happening around the way sexual abuse is dealt with. Victims are more willing to come forward and prosecutors more eager to pursue these cases of coerced sex, according to Neama Rahmani, a former prosecutor who’s worked on human trafficking cases for the Department of Justice and a co-founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers. Vox spoke to Rahmani about why all of these bombshell sex trafficking cases are being brought now, and the ripple effect they could have in the years to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How much of this do you consider to be a conscious trend happening in federal courts?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s absolutely a trend. There&#8217;s no question that prosecutors are being a lot more aggressive in these types of cases. There&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22195361/cult-stories-like-nxivm-documentaries\">NXIVM case</a> that was run out of that same office, the Eastern District of New York, where Jeffries is being prosecuted. R. Kelly was also prosecuted in the neighboring Southern District of New York. So you&#8217;re seeing more of these types of prosecutions because they&#8217;re more and more successful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is also obviously a result of #MeToo. Jeffrey Epstein got away with it for so many years, and now the tables have turned. Victims are coming forward. They&#8217;re empowered. They have a voice — because without the victims, you don&#8217;t really have a case. So it&#8217;s absolutely a trend in numbers, and we&#8217;re seeing more and more of it, and we are going to see more of it because there&#8217;s a lot more attention being paid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>New York’s </strong><a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-adult-survivors-act\"><strong>Adult Survivors Act</strong></a><strong>, which temporarily waived the statute of limitations for civil sex abuse cases, has been </strong><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-a-new-york-state-law-opened-sean-diddy-combs-to-sexual-assault-lawsuits\"><strong>credited</strong></a><strong> with some of the lawsuits leading up to Diddy’s federal investigation. The allegations against Jeffries also came to light </strong><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abercrombie-fitch-lawsuit-mike-jeffries-sex-trafficking-32aadb582055dd2468e5ad6be74e5ef0\"><strong>after a civil case was filed</strong></a><strong>. How big of a role are these laws playing in what we’re seeing?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re definitely seeing the statutes being reopened — not on the criminal side. But we know that a civil lawsuit can prompt an investigation that can lead to a criminal case. It goes back to<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/23/18237702/catholic-church-sex-abuse-summit-destroyed-documents\"> the Catholic Church and the sex abuse scandal</a> there. It was litigated very aggressively and all the way up to state Supreme Courts. They ruled that you can open up the statute of limitations for civil [cases] but not criminal. By reopening the criminal statute limitations, it&#8217;s a retroactive prosecution and violates the ex post facto clause of the Constitution. But you’re seeing more and more civil statutes of limitations that are open. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">New York State and New York City did it. California’s have been open multiple times for civil lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why does it typically take so long to catch on to these cases?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prosecutors are very conservative when it comes to rape cases, especially when we’re dealing with adults. Rape is one of the most underreported crimes, and a very small percentage of perpetrators are brought to justice because they&#8217;re hard cases. They happen behind closed doors. It&#8217;s an issue of consent and “he said, she said.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prosecutors don&#8217;t like to lose, and they don&#8217;t like to take cases unless it&#8217;s a sure thing. So oftentimes you need multiple victims to come forward before you can get a conviction. Prosecutors don&#8217;t want to move forward with just one victim. The cases can hang. We&#8217;ve seen it happen with Bill Cosby, Danny Masterson, Harvey Weinstein. You have to get 12 out of 12 jurors unanimously. It&#8217;s not easy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So oftentimes, they need more victims. And victims don&#8217;t want to come forward and relive that trauma. You have to tell your story in a very public way. That&#8217;s the big-picture reason why we haven’t, at least during my lifetime, seen many of these prosecutions historically. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>In the case of Jeffrey Epstein and now Diddy, a lot of people are curious about the networks of people involved in these sex trafficking cases. Do you think Diddy’s or Jeffries’s trials will lead to the exposure of a lot of people? </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">US Attorney Damian Williams says the Diddy investigation is ongoing. But in my experience following him, he’s not one of those prosecutors who takes a kitchen-sink approach. He’s not someone to charge everyone. <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kristina-khorram-everything-we-know-about-the-woman-being-dubbed-diddys-ghislaine/\">Kristina Khorram</a> — [Diddy’s] right-hand woman who allegedly provided the drugs, secured a lot of the victims, and recruited them — she hasn&#8217;t been charged. I would be surprised if any additional celebrities are charged, based on what I&#8217;ve seen so far. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again, prosecutors are conservative. They&#8217;re not going to name a celebrity unless they&#8217;re absolutely sure they could get a conviction. The standard is much higher in a criminal case. You need that unanimous jury beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do expect celebrities to be sued. You look at the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/sean-combs-rape-teen-celebrities-new-lawsuits-1236121708/\">lawsuit</a> against Diddy from this week. There&#8217;s a celebrity A and B, who allegedly participated [in the alleged rape]. The reason they haven&#8217;t been named is because there&#8217;s significant value in celebrities keeping their names secret and entering into a confidential settlement and paying to make this go away. I would expect to see individuals outed in those types of cases before they&#8217;re named in an indictment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do you see these cases continuing to have a ripple effect in the culture?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I mean, it’s happening now because there’s a willingness. Look at the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/374720/menendez-brothers-abuse-claims-real-monsters-netflix-drama\">Menendez brothers</a>, right? They may be released because they were the victims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father. This is 35 years after they shot and killed their parents. There&#8217;s a very different awareness and culture around sexual assault and sexual abuse now and believing victims. I really do think the tide has turned, and the days of rich and powerful men being able to take advantage of young men and young women because of the disparities in their wealth and power are numbered. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That’s because Vice President Kamala Harris has largely settled on a closing campaign message that sounds a lot like the idea President Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his campaign: that Donald Trump presents an existential threat to American democracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s the message she hammered home on Wednesday, amid reports from <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-military-generals-hitler/680327/\">the Atlantic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html\">the New York Times</a> in which Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, said — on the record — that Trump is “certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators,” fits “the general definition of fascist,” and once said he needs “the kind of generals that Hitler had.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a Wednesday afternoon press conference from her official residence in Washington, DC, Harris argued the reports were “further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is … We know what Donald Trump wants. He wants unchecked power.” She followed that with similar hits on Trump at a Wednesday night town hall on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/takeaways-kamala-harris-town-hall/index.html\">CNN</a>, saying plainly that she considers Trump a “fascist,” and believes voters “care about our democracy” and “not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This change in tone represents a shift, but is not <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-revives-message-democracy-trump-escalates-rhetoric-work/story?id=114908724\">an anomaly</a>. After a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer\">“Brat summer” of good vibes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/363560/gen-z-brat-coconut-kamala-harris-vote-young-voter\">memes</a>, and uplifting messages about “not going back,” Harris’s last few weeks of messaging have struck a graver tone about the threats Trump poses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Fox News last week, she invoked Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/10/21/trump-use-military-opponents/\">comments</a> this month about the US needing to defend against “the enemy from within” and the potential need to handle those supposed foes “if necessary, by National Guard or if really necessary by the military.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then on NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/transcript-president-kamala-harris-interview-nbc-news-hallie-jackson-rcna176330\">this week</a>, Harris painted the election as an opportunity for voters to choose “whether we are a country that values a president who respects their duty to uphold the Constitution of the United States. Donald Trump has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States.” And <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/23/kamala-harris-campaign-rally-dc-national-mall-election/\">next week</a>, Harris is expected to make the same argument in her final case to the American people from the National Mall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Why the shift?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Biden, this “threats to democracy” argument seemed like an attempt to rally the Democratic base, inject a sense of urgency in his unpopular reelection bid, and hope that the anti-Trump energy that fueled his 2020 victory and Democratic wins in the 2018 and 2022 midterms could power one final repudiation of Trump. It was the “<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/11/09/democrats-abortion-election-plan-2023\">Dobbs and Democracy</a>” strategy —&nbsp;one premised on reminding people that Trump was responsible for the loss of national abortion protections and that he repeatedly disregarded democratic norms during his tenure. Based on Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/19/biden-faith-campaign-mike-donilon-2024-election\">polling</a>, that message <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/politics/biden-democracy-january-6-what-matters/index.html\">wasn’t</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-campaign-trump-jan-6-voters/\">working</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s recent return to a democracy message seems to be in response to the closeness of the presidential contest in battleground states. According to <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/10/23/cnns_enten_rising_support_among_independent_voters_good_sign_for_trump.html\">polling</a>, she’s been largely unable to make more inroads with independents or continue making gains with swing-state voters after an initial burst of support after taking up her party’s nomination. There’s an ever-so-small chunk of undecided voters left in those states — so peeling away at the margins of Trump’s support could make all the difference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s partially why these appeals to protecting democracy are being made in front of moderate and disaffected Republican audiences. Starting with an event with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney in September — in which Cheney said that as “someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution,” she was backing Harris “because of the danger that Donald Trump poses” — Harris has been on a multistate campaign swing specifically aimed at giving moderate Republicans cover to cross party lines and support a Harris bid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, summed up that strategy on Tuesday night while being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBz1_nQpKHM\">questioned</a> by <em>Daily Show </em>host Jon Stewart about Harris’s embrace of Cheney.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“On the constitutional piece, there are a lot of people out there. I think Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney give permission to those folks who want to find a reason to do the right thing,” Walz said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Per reporting from the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-campaign-strategy-final-days-623cf25b673d7e875e69a904b93e8958\">Associated Press</a>, Harris’s team thinks these kinds of appeals and reminders of Trump’s extreme rhetoric — like running digital ads highlighting Trump’s rebranding of January 6 as a “day of love” — can help chip into the “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-campaign-strategy-final-days-623cf25b673d7e875e69a904b93e8958\">roughly 10 percent of voters</a> in the battleground states” who might be persuadable because they are undecided or soft supporters of Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The share of undecideds will only continue to decrease the closer we get to Election Day —&nbsp;and the results will reveal just how successful Harris’s strategy was.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Fish farming’s growth was spurred primarily by <a href=\"https://china-ocean.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marine-policy-mallory-fisheries_subsidies_in_china.pdf\">government</a> <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.12425\">subsidies</a> around the world, as the world’s wild fish catch peaked in the 1990s and countries sought another source of seafood.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aquaculture has also been <a href=\"https://bluefood.earth/\">boosted</a> by academic institutions, philanthropic foundations, nonprofit organizations, and the United Nations on the belief that fish farming can give overexploited oceans a break and more sustainably improve food security.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/hkC76-the-world-now-eats-more-fish-from-farms-than-from-the-ocean-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.606641214417,100,62.786717571167\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But fish farming comes with — forgive the pun — some major catches. Some of the most valuable farmed species, like <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e615939c-75d6-4e99-9282-76379f76d699/content\">salmon and trout</a>, are carnivorous and must be fed wild-caught fish when farmed. Farmed shrimp, along with a number of omnivorous fish species, are also fed wild-caught fish. All told, some <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/66538eba-9c85-4504-8438-c1cf0a0a3903/content/sofia/2024/world-fisheries-aquaculture.html\">17 million</a> of the 91 million metric tons of wild-caught fish are diverted to the aquaculture industry annually.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, what was supposed to relieve pressure from overexploited oceans has become a new source of its exploitation. According to a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/sciadv.adn9698\">new study</a> published in <em>Science Advances</em> by a team of researchers from the University of Miami, New York University, and conservation group Oceana, fish farming might kill far more wild-caught fish than previously thought — a finding that throws the aquaculture industry’s sustainable branding into question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The researchers found that the amount of wild-caught fish — usually from small species like anchovies and sardines — to feed the top 11 farmed fish and crustacean species could be 27 to 307 percent higher than current estimates, or even higher, depending on how it’s calculated. (The high degree of variability and uncertainty is due to a lack of validated industry data on what farmed fish are fed.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The extraction of wild fish to manufacture aquaculture feed is likely far higher than we&#8217;ve been told,” <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Spencer-Roberts-2289759346\">Spencer Roberts</a>, a PhD researcher at the University of Miami and lead author of the study, told me. “The story about fish farming feeding the world is very optimistic, but it&#8217;s based on incomplete data. So what we&#8217;re trying to do is portray a more realistic and comprehensive picture.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/WAM17791.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.1151832460733,100,83.769633507853\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"After being moved from the floating pens of a sea bass and sea bream farm in Greece, thousands of sea bass are dumped into ice containers.

It has also created a new realm of animal suffering: Fish farms, sometimes called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22301931/fish-animal-welfare-plant-based\">“underwater factory farms</a>” by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23925895/catalina-lopez-aquatic-animal-alliance-director-fish-farming-future-perfect-50-2023\">animal advocates</a>, often keep fish in conditions similar to the crowded <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">industrial farms</a> that confine pigs, chickens, and cows raised on land.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">Processing Meat newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">here</a> for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>’s biweekly newsletter from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\">Marina Bolotnikova</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\">Kenny Torrella</a>, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Have questions or comments on this newsletter?</strong> Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is a lot of hype in not just media but in governance conversations about aquaculture or blue foods more broadly as a sustainable source of food and a way to combat hunger or reduce food insecurity, but there are so many things ignored,” Roberts said. “I hope that [the new research] prompts other academics, but especially policymakers, to question some of the narratives.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fish farming might waste more fish meat than it produces</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The aquaculture industry measures the amount of wild-caught fish required to produce one unit of farmed fish with what it calls the Fish In:Fish Out (FIFO) ratio. In 1997, the early days of the fish farming boom, the industry had a FIFO ratio of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03308-6\">1.9</a>, meaning that for every kilogram of fish it produced, it had to catch and kill almost two kilograms of fish used for feed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2017, according to a team of aquaculture experts, that figure dropped to 0.28, an all-time low, largely because the industry switched much of its feed from wild-caught fish to crops like soy and corn, along with vegetable oils, minerals, and vitamins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those findings were <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03308-6\">published</a> in <em>Nature</em>, and it’s since been widely cited in food systems research. The fish farming industry puts its FIFO ratio at a <a href=\"https://www.iffo.com/fifo-data\">similarly low rate</a>, claiming a <a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/aquaculture-input-efficiency-fifo/\">major sustainability win</a>. (It’s worth noting that some of the <em>Nature</em> paper’s authors hold close ties to the aquaculture and livestock feed industries.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the model used in that paper was incomplete, according to Roberts. For instance, it didn’t include trimmings, the parts of a fish considered byproducts that do end up in fish feed, nor fish that were unintentionally killed and turned into fish feed. The model also used industry data reporting that, on average, only 7 percent of its farmed fish feed consisted of wild-caught fish; the rest consisted of crops. Other data sources, from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and another team of researchers, reported much higher rates of wild-caught fish in farmed fish diets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When correcting for these factors from the original model, Roberts and his co-authors found that for the top 11 farmed species, the global aquaculture industry’s Fish In:Fish Out ratio is much higher than the original model’s estimate of 0.28, ranging from 0.36 to 1.15, or 27 to 307 percent higher.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then the researchers ran the numbers again, adding in other fish and other marine animals killed unintentionally by commercial fishing vessels, and removed fish farms that don’t feed their animals at all. That adjustment brought up the industry’s FIFO ratio to between 0.57 and 1.78, or 103 to 535 percent higher than the original model. That means that at the upper estimate of 1.78, the industry still generates a net loss of fish, just as it did in the 1990s.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Species-chart-Done.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,19.37666699595,100,61.2466660081\" alt=\"Chart showing which species of farmed fish and wild-caught fish are produced.\" title=\"Chart showing which species of farmed fish and wild-caught fish are produced.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For carnivorous farmed species like salmon and trout, the aquaculture sector’s demand for wild-caught fish is especially high. By Roberts and his co-authors’ upper-bound estimate, it could take up to 6.24 kilograms of wild-caught fish to produce just one kilogram of salmon — 230 percent more than previously estimated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It appears this current paper replaced [earlier studies’] simplifying assumptions with better sources of data or better estimates,” said <a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/2484/david-c-love\">David C. Love</a>, an aquaculture and fisheries research professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. “What they found was that more fish are being used in the diet than what was previously thought.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But looking at the FIFO ratio for the entire industry obscures major differences in feeding requirements across species.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s hard to say, ‘Well, aquaculture is just one thing.’ It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s lots and lots of different species with different needs,” Love said. The biggest difference is between herbivorous species, like carp and tilapia with a FIFO ratio up to 0.83 at the upper bound of the adjusted model, and carnivorous species like salmon and trout, with a FIFO ratio up to 5.57 — a near sevenfold gap. Shrimp, freshwater crustaceans, and catfish also require more wild-caught fish than they produce at the upper bounds.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/WAM36963.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Round tanks of fish at a salmon hatchery outside\" title=\"Round tanks of fish at a salmon hatchery outside\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Tanks of fish at a farmed Atlantic salmon hatchery in Scotland. | Ed Shephard/We Animals Media\" data-portal-copyright=\"Ed Shephard/We Animals Media\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nationalaquaculture.org/national-aquaculture-association-staff/\">Paul Zajicek</a>, executive director of the National Aquaculture Association, dismissed the study’s findings in an email to Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As noted by the authors, these types of analyses are very challenging and we suspect a rival analysis will show differences as well,” Zajicek wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the massive amounts of wild-caught fish fed to farmed fish is only one piece of the bigger picture on fish farming’s unsustainability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fish farming’s environmental, social, and animal welfare costs</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the fish farming industry over time has lowered its reliance on wild-caught fish on a per-kilogram basis, it has replaced it with corn and soy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Every bit of fishmeal that you [remove from fish diets] has to still be substituted with something from land,” said <a href=\"https://people.miami.edu/profile/46ab69e099266868496ed41b79ebcc05\">Jennifer Jacquet</a>, a co-author of the study and professor of atmospheric and earth science at the University of Miami. “We’re already concerned with deforestation for [feeding] land animals, and now farmed salmon are also contributing to the deforestation of our world.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Crop-chart-done.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,19.434338056221,100,61.131323887558\" alt=\"Chart showing how fish farming has increased the demand for corn and soy.\" title=\"Chart showing how fish farming has increased the demand for corn and soy.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This explosion in crop use — about a fivefold increase in recent decades — doesn’t just mean more potential deforestation. Those crops are grown using a lot of synthetic fertilizer, which in turn pollutes waterways and harms wild fish. It’s also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions and displaces land that could be used to otherwise grow food directly for humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What we&#8217;re talking about is not so much increasing efficiency as much as a shift in pressure from ecosystems like the Humboldt Current [in Peru], where the anchovies come from, to ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest where the soy comes from,” Roberts said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/WAM19986.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Three catfish are shown underwater feeding on pellets\" title=\"Three catfish are shown underwater feeding on pellets\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Catfish at a fish farm in Thailand feeding on pellets. | Mako Kurokawa/Sinergia Animal/We Animals Media\" data-portal-copyright=\"Mako Kurokawa/Sinergia Animal/We Animals Media\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What we need, Love of Johns Hopkins University told me, are holistic life-cycle assessments that cover not just a species’ FIFO ratio but other metrics too, such as carbon footprint, water use, land use, and pollution, to give us a more accurate picture of aquaculture’s environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One such <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03889-2\">assessment</a>, published <em>Nature</em> in 2021, found that seaweed and bivalves, like mussels and oysters, have the lowest environmental footprint of all aquaculture foods. But it also illustrates the complex range of trade-offs between different species and whether they’re wild-caught or farmed. For example, farmed salmon use little land and water but use a lot of wild-caught fish and generate a lot of pollution. By comparison, farmed carp eat almost no wild-caught fish but require much more land and water.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When we farm or catch fish at scale, much like animals raised on land, we tend to overexploit one ecosystem or another, making it an inefficient way of producing protein relative to plant-based agriculture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rapid growth of fish farming has also come with grave ethical implications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Animal rights advocates have lambasted fish farm conditions, where fish often suffer from many of the same issues as animals raised on land, like overcrowding and disease. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/investigation-reveals-chinese-seafood-caught-and-processed-using-forced-labor-sold-in-u-s\">Slave labor</a> on commercial fishing vessels and inside fish processing plants has long plagued the industry.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/WAM22571.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"Group of carp in cloudy water jostling to feed on fish food pellets\" title=\"Group of carp in cloudy water jostling to feed on fish food pellets\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A crowded group of carp in cloudy water with poor visibility.

For example, many of the fish caught for the aquaculture industry come from West Africa and “could be part of the West African diet, but are instead being sold to fish meal plants” as food to be used on fish farms, Love said. Many of those fish end up in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02962-1\">wealthier markets</a>, like Europe and North America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“While the aquaculture industry regularly uses the narrative of food security, their top products, salmon and shrimp, are prized not for their nutritional value but for their export value,” wrote <a href=\"https://uk.oceana.org/people-partners/patricia-majluf/\">Patricia Majluf</a> of Oceana, a biologist and co-author of the study, in a separate <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn5650\">analysis</a> of the aquaculture feed industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the conversation among governments, philanthropies, nonprofits, and academics around the future of seafood — which is anticipated to grow some <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/9df19f53-b931-4d04-acd3-58a71c6b1a5b/content/sofia/2022/fisheries-and-aquaculture-projections.html\">30 percent</a> by 2050 — aims to balance conservation and economic development.

Blackboard, Schoology, ClassDojo, the list goes on — these apps help teachers communicate with families, and parents and other caregivers keep track of their kids’ learning. Good, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kind of.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tools started to appear in the early 2010s but really took off in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, when millions of schoolchildren were forced to adapt to learning from home, said Leah Plunkett, author of <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539630/sharenthood/\"><em>Sharenthood: Why We Should Think Before We Talk About Our Kids Online</em></a> and a faculty member at Harvard Law School.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some, like Blackboard or Google Classroom, function as “open grade books,” where parents and kids can see each assignment grade as a teacher enters it. Others, like ClassDojo, allow families to keep track of kids’ behavior at school. Still others can be used to send messages or manage extracurriculars like band or sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The apps are now ubiquitous — open grade book tools are in use in a majority of public and private high schools in America, Gail Cornwall <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/parents-teens-open-gradebook-software.html\">reports at The Cut</a>. These tools are an improvement over the system many millennials remember, in which students and parents might not find out about their grades until the school quarter or semester was almost over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By that time, “Sometimes it’s too late to bring those grades up,” said Meg St-Esprit, a Pittsburgh-based journalist and content creator whose almost-13-year-old son’s middle school uses Google Classroom and PowerSchool. Now kids and parents can track their progress — and their difficulties — together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the apps have raised privacy concerns, with some experts fearing that sensitive data about children could fall into the hands of cybercriminals or be used to limit kids’ opportunities later on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others fear that by encouraging parents to monitor every fluctuation in their children’s grades, the tools are fueling an achievement-obsessed culture that can lead to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/life/378065/teen-stress-burnout-teens-productivity-anxiety\">stress and burnout</a> among kids. “It can feel like you&#8217;re always plugged in,” St-Esprit said. “It can feel a little bit like hustle culture.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">School apps are helpful — and stressful</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you don’t have a school-aged child at home, you might be surprised at the sheer number of apps that contemporary education entails.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">St-Esprit, who has four children including her middle-schooler, has used not just Google Classroom and PowerSchool but also Seesaw, Remind, Bloomz, ClassDojo, PaySchools Central, CutTime, and TeamSnap. The notifications alone can be a time suck for parents: I received at least one during each call I made for this story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, for many families, the apps are a more efficient mode of communication than, say, a flier wadded up in a kid’s backpack. Parents often appreciate the transparency of open grade book apps, as well as the ability to message a teacher quickly rather than setting up a conference during the workday (<a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/the-good-and-the-bad-of-using-apps-to-connect-with-parents/2024/04\">some teachers</a> appreciate the flexibility, too). “It is fundamentally good and constructive for school systems to have real-time, reliable ways to communicate with parents and guardians,” Plunkett said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Phone apps aren’t a reliable mode of communication for everyone. Some families <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/the-good-and-the-bad-of-using-apps-to-connect-with-parents/2024/04\">don’t have smartphones</a>. Some don’t have the spare time necessary to navigate a veritable forest of login and setup instructions, some of which can be confusing even for relatively tech-savvy parents (not that I speak in any way from experience).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With open grade book tools and other school communication tech, “There’s just such clear ways that privileged parties benefit and others do not,” Catharyn Shelton, an assistant professor of educational technology at Northern Arizona University, <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/the-good-and-the-bad-of-using-apps-to-connect-with-parents/2024/04\">told EdWeek</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">App developers are aware of these concerns and some have taken steps to address equity issues. <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/the-good-and-the-bad-of-using-apps-to-connect-with-parents/2024/04\">ClassDojo and Seesaw</a>, for example, allow teachers to translate messages into a student’s home language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond accessibility, the apps come with other problems. Seeing every assignment grade show up on a phone or computer screen and knowing your parents will see it, too, can be anxiety-producing for kids. St-Esprit’s son recently got a low grade on an assignment and “he was anxious about it while we waited for that grade to pop up,” St-Esprit said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Google Classroom is a source of stress for me,” her son, Eli, told me in an email. “It&#8217;s hard to navigate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The apps can also encourage an obsessive focus on grades at the expense of learning. “She’s constantly like, ‘Did they grade that test? Did they grade that essay?’” one parent of a 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/parents-teens-open-gradebook-software.html\">told The Cut</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Emily Weinstein, lead author of a <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/unpacking-grind-culture-in-american-teens-pressure-burnout-and-the-role-of-social-media\">recent report</a> on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/life/378065/teen-stress-burnout-teens-productivity-anxiety\">teen stress and burnout</a>, said that the apps and the atmosphere of “constant quantification” they can create can contribute to high levels of academic pressure felt by young people today. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23759898/kids-children-parenting-play-anxiety-mental-health\">Other experts have argued</a> that the ability to track kids through apps has led to a hypervigilance among parents that leads them to limit children’s autonomy — which in turn can harm kids’ mental health and hold them back from developing crucial social and cognitive skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’ve got this idea right now that the closer we keep our kids, the more information we have, the more we direct, the more that we control, the better off our kids will be,” Lynn Lyons, a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders, told me last year. “And the research is showing the opposite.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The apps also raise privacy concerns</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to mental health concerns, some experts worry that the apps leave schools and families vulnerable to hackers. Some apps are used to communicate pickup plans, which can include a child’s geographical location, Plunkett said. “If that app has a breach, then all of a sudden, whoever&#8217;s getting that information has access to where every child in that school or school district is going.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, records of students’ behavioral challenges at school could come back to harm them later in life, Plunkett said. And the use of AI by schools and districts is raising the stakes on all conversations about student data. A school could use behavioral information to deny a student a letter of recommendation, Plunkett said, but “what I&#8217;m even more concerned about are those instances where there may not necessarily be a human review,” where data could be aggregated and analyzed by computer to make predictions or draw conclusions about students.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schools have long kept data on student grades and test scores. But the apps in use today raise the possibility of collecting and storing a larger, more granular array of information that could be used in ways students and families might not understand unless proper guardrails are put in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Updated federal youth privacy legislation would be a start, Plunkett said. App developers also need to provide schools with “nutrition label-style information” about what data their apps collect and how it can be used, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schools, meanwhile, can curb app overload by communicating really important information — a sick child, a serious behavior problem — by email, phone, or face-to-face meeting, St-Esprit said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The goal should be for parents to get “enough information to know what&#8217;s going on,” but not so much that “there is this constant state of looking over the child&#8217;s shoulder,” Plunkett said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There was something to be said for the brick-and-mortar days” of the ’80s and ’90s, she added. “We went to school and our parents didn&#8217;t necessarily know everything we did there every day, and I think that was probably good for everybody.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I’m Reading</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A <a href=\"https://www.today.com/parents/family/influencer-children-rcna175057\">growing number</a> of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/10/16/utah-protections-children-mom-influencers/\">states</a> are considering legislation to protect the privacy or compensation of child influencers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More states are also using opioid settlement money to help <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/15/nx-s1-5149347/opioid-funds-grandparents-addiction-epidemic-alabama\">“grandfamilies”</a> — grandparents raising kids whose parents struggle with substance abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Young people today apparently prefer <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/17/halloween-candy-chocolate-cocoa/\">gummy Halloween candy</a> to chocolate options, which is an incorrect opinion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My older kid and I just finished the <a href=\"https://www.scholastic.com/site/branches/eerie-elementary.html\">Eerie Elementary</a> series, about an evil elementary school that eats children (a premise that really resonates with kids who have mixed feelings about school). Now we need a new book series to start — I am taking recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From My Inbox</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The experience of high school (and even middle school!) students has become far more rigorous and demanding,” a 17-year-old reader wrote to me in response to last week’s newsletter about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/life/378065/teen-stress-burnout-teens-productivity-anxiety\">teen stress and burnout</a>. “To pursue my field of interest I&#8217;ve needed to go through an extreme amount of work only to apply to a reputable institution and find a flood of essays waiting for me — Caltech alone has nine. Over these last four years, I&#8217;ve done research competitions, nonprofit work, math competitions, astronomy competitions, and quiz bowls just to make my application competitive. I still have anxiety about the future because I&#8217;m unsure if anything I&#8217;m doing will matter.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is a tough thing to hear from a young person, but also confirms&nbsp; what the researchers found in <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2024-unpacking-grind-culture-in-american-teens_final-updated-for-web.pdf\">their report</a>. It’s a reminder of the need to examine the economic and cultural pressures that make kids feel they have to achieve so much so young.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lastly, I’d love to hear from families and teachers about apps — do you, your students, and/or the kids in your life use them to keep track of grades and extracurriculars? Do you love them, hate them, or both? Get in touch at anna.north@vox.com.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In large and varied studies, regularly eating processed meats — including cold cuts and hot dogs — leads to higher rates of cancers and cardiovascular disease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These products are also at <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956713520303595\">high risk for contamination</a> with listeria — outbreaks of which have made headlines recently, including one involving tainted <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24.html\">Boar’s Head liverwurst</a> that has killed nine people and sickened 57 since July, and has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boars-head-recall-listeria-deli-meat-lawsuits/\">prompted a wave of lawsuits</a>. Listeria is a nasty bug that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and meningitis, and can be deadly in particularly vulnerable people. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts say there’s no amount of lunchmeat that’s healthy to eat. Still, out of convenience, pleasure, or pure sentimentality, it often remains on the menu. If you’re one of the many people with a special place in your gut for deli sandwiches, there are still ways to minimize their harm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What that pastrami sandwich is doing to your body</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cold cuts are different from other kinds of meat in one important way: They’re processed in ways that delay spoilage. That processing involves a range of different methods, including drying (as in beef jerky), fermenting (as in many salamis and pepperonis), smoking (as in country ham), and curing with salt or other additives (as in many hot dogs and a wide range of lunchmeat).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Processing meat adds more to it than just shelf life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Curing, often using nitrates and nitrites — preservatives that prevent spoilage and preserve meat’s pinkish color — and salt, is one of the more common ways food manufacturers extend the life of modern cold cuts. When they reach the gut, nitrates and nitrites can be converted into a variety of molecules, among them ones that can be <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9365633/\">harmful to your health</a>. These compounds occur naturally in some foods, including leafy vegetables, but combining them with animal protein — especially with protein containing high levels of <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3967179/\">heme iron</a>, like beef and pork — raises the chance they’ll transform into those bad actors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Smoking meat also changes its chemical composition. Cooking animal protein at a high temperature and burning its dripping juices and fat create amazing flavors — but also, a whole other set of <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet#what-factors-influence-the-formation-of-hca-and-pah-in-cooked-meats\">gnarly compounds</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Transforming the chemical structure of meat in these ways has health consequences for people who eat a lot of it. In 2015, the World Health Organization released a report concluding that eating just 50 grams of processed meat daily — about the equivalent of a hot dog — increased a person’s lifetime <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/26/9616524/processed-meat-bacon-who-cancer-red-meat\">colorectal cancer risk</a> by 18 percent. Other studies suggest processed meat consumption also increases <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9365633/\">breast, prostate</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23193003/\">esophageal</a>, and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5788281/\">pancreatic</a> cancer risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eating processed meat can also raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, in part due to their high salt content — which raises blood pressure — and their high levels of saturated fats. In one large European study, a daily hot dog led to a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23701737/\">30 percent increase</a> in cardiovascular disease rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just the deli meat in a deli sandwich that can affect your health, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zumpano-julia-4757482a/\">Julia Zumpano</a>,&nbsp; a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Human Nutrition. The supporting players — including bread, condiments, cheese, and other goodies — are also part of the nutritional picture, so they also bear some consideration, for better or for worse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why lunch meat is particularly prone to contamination</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Deli meat’s long and winding path from production facility to table also creates multiple opportunities for microbial contamination. Chunks of meat often get processed and mushed together into a slab in one place, sliced in another, then moved “from the conveyor belt to the packaging center, to the cooler, to the semi, to the distributing center, to another semi, to the grocery store, and then it sits there until someone buys it,” says Zumpano.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The recent liverwurst outbreak involved listeria, a bacteria that’s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/risk-factors/index.html#:~:text=People%20who%20are%20pregnant,have%20a%20weakened%20immune%20system\">particularly dangerous</a> to newborns and people who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or aged 65 and above. However, lunchmeat has also been associated with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/health/deli-meat-salmonella-wellness/index.html\">salmonella</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20034929/\">Campylobacter</a> infections. The contamination sometimes happens in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/health/boars-head-deli-meat-listeria.html\">filthy production plants</a> — as in the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/boars-head-announces-closure-of-meat-plant-in-virginia-linked-to-deadly-listeria-outbreak\">latest Boar’s Head outbreak</a> — but can also happen when tainted meat spreads bacteria to other products through contact with knives or meat slicers at a <a href=\"https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/listeria/outbreaks/deli-11-22/details.html#:~:text=Epidemiologic%20and%20laboratory%20data%20show,contaminated%20with%20the%20outbreak%20strain.\">deli counter</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2159426501.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.738931137917,100,78.522137724166\" alt=\"This is a view into a display case at a prosciutteria in Venice, Italy.

The case is full of traditional cured meats as well as a selection of cheeses, viewed mostly in cross-section.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>A harm-reduction approach to sandwiches</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Zumpano says — very sadly for my fellow bologna lovers — that the healthiest lunchmeat is no lunchmeat at all. Still, you may consider what the alternative is when packing your lunch. If you’re replacing a hoagie with fast food or something from a vending machine, she says, “Maybe that deli meat sandwich could have been a little bit healthier — depending on the deli meat.” (It’s worth noting that even Zumpano says she eats deli meat from time to time.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re simply not ready to break up with cold cuts, you can still do a lot to minimize your sandwiches’ health risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Buying cold cuts at a deli counter is a great first step. This is where you can find the preservative-free meats that won’t last long on supermarket shelves. If you have access to meat freshly cut at the time of sale, “You can probably get a turkey breast that is just sliced turkey” — nitrate- and nitrite-free, unsmoked, and without tons of added salt, says <a href=\"https://mayafellernutrition.com/\">Maya Feller</a>, a registered dietitian nutritionist based in Brooklyn. (The fatty, preservative-filled stuff is also likely to be available at deli counters, so you still need to approach your decisions here critically.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Zumpano says — very sadly for my fellow bologna lovers — that the healthiest lunchmeat is no lunchmeat at all</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a small convenience sacrifice in making this choice: Because preservative-free meats have shorter shelf lives, you might need to buy less of it more often. “When I buy fresh meat off the bone, I buy a half pound versus a pound,” says Zumpano.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re nowhere near a deli counter or you’re not ready to give up packaged cold cuts, you still have a range of choices. Don’t bother looking at the front of the package — that’s all marketing, says Zumpano — and instead, flip it over to look at the more detailed information on the back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Feller starts by looking at the ingredient list. The meat you’re expecting to eat should be the first ingredient on the list, not water or other ingredients that serve as fillers or binders, she says. She also advises looking at how much of the daily recommended allowance of sugar, saturated fat, and salt is in one serving of the product; these should all come close to or be below 5 percent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The back of the package should also tell you if nitrates or nitrites are in the product. Here, don’t assume that natural is necessarily better: Some manufacturers add celery or beetroot powder to their products to take advantage of their <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/nitrates-in-food-and-medicine-whats-the-story\">naturally high levels of nitrates</a>, but there’s no evidence that meat cured with these products is less harmful. Natural or not, these chemicals can cause the same damage as synthetic nitrates, says <a href=\"https://www-sepi-encb-ipn-mx.translate.goog/oferta-educativa/doctorado-alimentos/jimenez.html?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc\">Cristian Jimenez Martinez</a>, a biochemist at Mexico’s National Polytechnic Institute who authored a recent review on natural preservatives. “The dose makes the poison,” she wrote in an email to Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same goes for higher-end artisanal products, which are not necessarily better for us, either. There’s an odd egalitarianism in knowing small-batch charcuterie and mass-produced baloney can both achieve the same level of carcinogenicity, which makes it especially important for consumers to understand what they’re eating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although public health authorities generally recommend that pregnant and immune-compromised people in particular avoid cold cuts to avoid the risk of listeria infections, people can also safely consume these products by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21460490/\">heating them</a> first. Some health experts recommend zapping them in the microwave under a damp paper towel until steaming; Zumpano pan-fried lunchmeat when she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re up for a radical change, you can give your sandwiches a full makeover. One option is to thin-slice leftover meats or other proteins you’ve cooked at home. (Zumpano often suggests her clients cook double the amount of protein they plan to eat at dinnertime, then put the rest on a sandwich or atop a salad the next day.) For a convenient shelf-stable option that’s rich in protein but is less processed than lunchmeat, low-sodium canned chicken and fish are good bets.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Life is full of opportunities to trade a little risk for a little pleasure, and sandwiches offer a daily opportunity to make that trade</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can also make your ham sandwich healthier by making changes to the vehicle holding the lunchmeat. Replacing heavily processed bread with bread that contains water, flour, yeast, salt, and maybe some added grains or seeds can increase the nutritional value of a sandwich. So can switching out mayo for hummus or avocado spread, which typically contain healthier fats and some soluble fiber. It’s always good to ramp up vegetable content too by adding more tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, and other garden favorites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Life is full of opportunities to trade a little risk for a little pleasure, and sandwiches offer a daily opportunity to make that trade. For long-term health, the key is to choose the lower-risk option more often and save the higher-risk option for moments of celebration.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The surprise, really, may be that not even the hurricanes have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/us-election-hurricanes-climate-voter\">pushed concerns about climate change</a> more toward the center of the presidential campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As early voting gets underway in some states and with less than two weeks before Election Day, voters will decide between Vice President Kamala Harris, who has called climate change an “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/trump-harris-climate-change/\">existential threat</a>,” and former President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2022/03/21/on-fox-donald-trump-calls-climate-change-a-hoax-in-the-1920s-they-were-talking-about-global-freezing/\">hoax</a>.” The editorial staff of Grist, one of Vox’s partners in the Climate Desk collaboration, has put together a climate-focused voter’s guide — a package of analyses and predictions about what the next four years may bring from the White House, depending on who wins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The next administration will be decisive for the country’s progress on critical climate goals. By 2030, the US has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate/#:~:text=Reducing%20U.S.%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions,clean%20energy%20to%20disadvantaged%20communities\">committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions</a> by 50 percent to 52 percent below 2005 levels, and expects to supply up to 13 million electric vehicles annually. A little further down the line, though no less critical, the country’s climate goals include reaching 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035 and achieving a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As you gear up to vote, here are 15 ways that Harris’s and Trump’s climate- and environment-related policies could affect your life — along with some information to help inform your vote. <em><em>—Paige Vega, Vox climate editor, and Grist staff</em></em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/election-stakes-energy.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.922893860067,100,76.154212279867\" alt=\"A black and white photo of a utility structure\" title=\"A black and white photo of a utility structure\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images via Grist\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your energy mix</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last year or so, utility companies across the country have woken up to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html\">a new reality</a>: After two decades of flat growth, electricity demand is about to spike, due to the combined pressures of new data centers, cryptocurrency mining, a manufacturing boom, and the electrification of buildings and transportation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the next president will not directly decide how the states supply power to their new and varied customers, he or she will oversee the massive system of incentives, subsidies, and loans by which the federal government influences how much utilities meet electricity demand by burning fossil fuels — the crucial question for the climate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s answer to that question can perhaps be summed up by the three-word catchphrase he’s deployed on the campaign trail: “<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/drill-baby-drill-donald-trump-oil-gas-rnc/story?id=112108980\">Drill, baby, drill</a>.” He is an avowed friend of the fossil fuel industry, from whom he reportedly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/trump-asks-oil-executives-campaign-finance-00157131\">sought $1 billion in campaign funds at a fundraising dinner</a>, promising in exchange to gut environmental regulations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is not exactly running on a platform of decarbonization, either. In an effort to win swing votes in the shale-boom heartland of Pennsylvania, she has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4855715-harris-fracking-ban-reversal/\">reversed course</a> on her past opposition to fracking, and she has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-fracking-energy-climate-trump-election-debate-1b86dfb4297facd0b89c487724a9e5b0\">proudly touted</a> the record levels of oil and gas production seen under the current administration. Despite the risk of nuclear waste, the Biden administration has also championed <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nuclear-power-biden-climate-change/\">nuclear power as a carbon-free solution</a> and sought to incentivize the construction of new reactors through subsidies and loans. Although Harris says her administration <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-spars-fox-news-host-says-not-continuation-biden-rcna175742\">would not be a continuation of Biden’s</a>, it’s reasonable to expect continuity with Biden’s overall approach of leaning more heavily on incentives for low-emissions energy than restrictions on fossil fuels to further a climate agenda. <em>—Gautama Mehta, Grist environmental justice reporting fellow</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your home improvements</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, the Biden administration handed the American people a great big carrot to incentivize them to decarbonize: the<a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/the-climate-stakes-of-the-harris-trump-election/\"> Inflation Reduction Act</a>, or IRA. It provides thousands of dollars in the form of rebates and tax credits for a consumer to get an EV and electrify their home with solar panels, a heat pump, and an induction stove. (Though the funding available for renters is slim, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/4/7/22954507/inflation-reduction-act-renters-home-rebates\">it is out there</a>.) In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/american-households-claimed-billions-in-clean-energy-credits-in-2023.html\">3.4 million Americans got $8.4 billion in tax credits</a> for home energy improvements thanks to the IRA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If elected, Trump has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/trump-says-he-will-rescind-funds-from-biden-s-climate-law?cmpid=BBD093024_GREENDAILY&amp;sref=wINQCNXe\">pledged to rescind the remaining funding</a>, which would require Congress’s support. By contrast, Harris has praised the law (which, as vice president, she famously <a href=\"https://x.com/VP/status/1821258926282961366\">cast the tie-breaking vote to pass</a>) and would almost certainly veto any attempts by Congress to repeal it. As a presidential candidate, she has not said whether she would expand the law,<strong> </strong>though many expect she would focus on <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/energy-transition-scenario-3-president-harris/\">more efficient implementation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while repealing the IRA might slow the steady pace of American households decarbonizing, it can’t stop what’s already in motion. “There are fundamental forces here at work,” said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School. “At the end of the day, there’s very little that Trump can do to stand in the way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, the feds provide guidance to states on how to distribute the money made available through the IRA. More climate-ambitious states are already layering on their <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/after-maine-surpasses-100000-heat-pump-goal-two-years-ahead-schedule-governor-mills-sets-new\">own monetary incentives to decarbonize</a>. So even if that IRA money disappeared, states could pick up the slack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And two, even before the IRA passed, market forces were setting clean energy on a path to replace fossil fuels. The <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90583426/the-price-of-solar-electricity-has-dropped-89-in-10-years\">price of solar power dropped</a> by about 90 percent between 2010 and 2020. And like any technology, electric appliances will only get cheaper and better. It might take longer without further support from the federal government, but the American home of tomorrow is, inevitably, fully electric — no matter the next administration. <em>—Matt Simon, Grist senior staff writer focusing on climate solutions</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your home insurance premiums</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether they know it or not, many Americans are already confronting the costs of a warming world in their monthly bills: In recent years, <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/home-insurance-midwest-climate-disasters/\">home insurance premiums have risen</a> across the country, as insurance companies face the fallout of larger and more damaging hurricanes, wildfires, and hailstorms. In some states, like <a href=\"https://grist.org/housing/florida-insurance-farmers-desantis-hurricane-ian-litigation/\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"https://grist.org/housing/state-farm-california-insurance-wildfire/\">California</a>, many prominent companies have fled the market altogether. While some Democrats have <a href=\"https://uphelp.org/new-bill-to-create-50bn-federal-backstop-for-catastrophe-reinsurance/\">proposed legislation</a> that would create a federal backstop for these failing insurance markets — with the goal of ensuring that coverage remains available for most homeowners — these proposals have yet to make much headway in a divided Congress. For the moment, it’s state governments, rather than the president or any other national politicians, that have real jurisdiction over homeowner’s insurance prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Near the end of the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542\">presidential debate in September</a>, when both candidates were asked about what they’d do to “fight climate change,” Harris began her response by referring to “anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences, who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up” as a way to counter Trump’s denials of climate change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Traditional homeowner policies don’t include flood insurance, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency runs a <a href=\"https://grist.org/housing/fema-risk-rating-flood-insurance/\">flood insurance program that serves</a> around 5 million homeowners in the US, mostly along the East Coast. Homeowners in the most flood-prone areas are required to buy this policy, but uptake has been lagging in some particularly vulnerable inland communities — including those that were recently <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-helene-flood-damage-cost-insurance/\">devastated by Hurricane Helene</a>. <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/what-project-2025-would-to-do-climate-policy-in-the-us/\">Project 2025</a>, which many experts believe will serve as the blueprint to a second Trump term (though his campaign disavows any connection to it), imagines FEMA winding down the program altogether, throwing flood coverage to the private market. This would likely make it cheaper to live in risky areas — but it would leave homeowners without financial support after floods, all but ensuring only the rich could rebuild. <em>—Jake Bittle, Grist staff writer focusing on climate impacts and adaptation</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/election-stakes-transportation-electric-vehicles.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.922893860067,100,76.154212279867\" alt=\"A black and white photo of an electric car plugged into a charger.

But don’t be fooled. A wide gulf separates how Harris and Trump approach transportation, with potentially profound climate implications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris hasn’t offered many specifics, but she has committed to advancing the rollout out of the Biden administration’s infrastructure agenda. That includes traditional efforts like building roads and bridges, mixed with Democratic priorities including union labor and an eye toward climate-resilience. The infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act include billions in spending to promote the adoption of electric vehicles, produce them domestically, and add at least <a href=\"http://Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed in 2021,\">500,000 charging stations by 2030</a>. They also include greener transportation efforts aimed at, among other things, electrifying buses, enhancing passenger rail, and expanding mass transit. That said, Harris has not called for the eventual elimination of internal combustion vehicles despite <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/electric-vehicles/states-banning-new-gas-powered-cars/\">such plans in 12 states</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has also been sparse on details about transportation — his website doesn’t address the issue except to decry Chinese ownership. During his first term and 2020 campaign, he championed (though <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/18/trump-biden-infrastructure-2020/\">never produced</a>) a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. It focused on building “<a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/building-stronger-america-president-donald-j-trumps-american-infrastructure-initiative/\">gleaming</a>” roads, highways, and bridges, and reducing the environmental review and government oversight of such projects. He has <a href=\"https://www.route-fifty.com/infrastructure/2024/07/trump-harris-offer-starkly-different-paths-transportation-policy/398488/\">favored flipping the federal-first funding model</a> to shift much of the cost onto states, municipalities, and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/06/07/trumps-infrastructure-public-private-partnership-000454/\">the private sector</a>. Ultimately, Trump seems to have little interest in a transition to low-carbon transportation — the official <a href=\"https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_gl=1*e7apre*_gcl_au*MTcxODc5ODQzOC4xNzI0MTk5MzU5&amp;_ga=2.167371838.104528262.1724199360-711274358.1724199360\">2024 Republican platform</a> calls for rolling back EV mandates — and he remains a vocal supporter of fossil fuel production. <em>—Tik Root, Grist senior staff writer focusing on the clean energy transition</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your health</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rising global temperatures and worsening extreme weather are <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate-connections-diseases-pathogens/\">changing the distribution and prevalence</a> of tick- and mosquito-borne diseases, fungal pathogens, and water-borne bacteria across the US. State and local health departments rely heavily on data and recommendations on these climate-fueled illnesses from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency whose director is appointed by the president and can be <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-09/ap-exclusive-docs-show-top-wh-officials-buried-cdc-report\">influenced by the White House</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his first term, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/donald-trump-dismantling-american-administrative-state\">tried to divorce</a> many federal agencies’ research functions from their rulemaking capacities, and there are concerns that, if he wins again in November, Trump would <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/cdc-dismantle-trump-administration-00146035\">continue that effort</a>. Project 2025, a <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/what-project-2025-would-to-do-climate-policy-in-the-us/\">sweeping blueprint developed by right-wing conservative groups</a> with the aim of influencing a second Trump term, proposes separating the CDC’s disease surveillance efforts from its policy recommendation work, meaning the agency would be able to track the effects of climate change on human health, like the spreading of infectious diseases, but it wouldn’t be able to tell states how to manage them or inform the public about how to stay safe from them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is expected to leave the CDC intact, but she hasn’t given many signals on how she’d approach climate and health initiatives. Her campaign website says she aims to protect public health, but provides no further clarification or policy position on that subject, or specifically climate change’s influence on it. Over the past four years, the Biden administration has made strides in protecting Americans from extreme heat, the <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/\">leading cause of weather-related deaths</a> in the US. It <a href=\"https://grist.org/labor/biden-admin-unveils-first-ever-heat-protections-for-workers-heres-what-to-know/\">proposed new heat protections</a> for indoor and outdoor workers, and it <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/04/12/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-funding-expand\">made more than $1 billion in grant funding </a>available to nonprofits, tribes, cities, and states for cooling initiatives such as planting trees in urban areas, which <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10864265/\">reduce the risk of heat illness</a>. It’s reasonable to expect that a future Harris administration would continue Biden’s work in this area. Harris cast the tie-breaking vote on the IRA, which includes emissions-cutting policies that will lead to less global warming in the long term, benefiting human health not just in the US but worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s more to be done. Biden established the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity in the first year of his term, but it still <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/07/29/health-office-climate-change/\">hasn’t been funded by Congress</a>. Harris has not said whether she will push for more funding for that office.<em> —Zoya Teirstein, Grist staff writer covering politics and the intersection between climate change and health</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your food prices</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Inflation has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/10/september-inflation-cpi/\">cooled significantly since 2022</a>, but high prices — <a href=\"https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/26946-survey-nearly-90-of-consumers-frustrated-over-grocery-pricing\">especially high food prices</a> — remain a concern for many Americans. Both candidates have promised to tackle the issue; Harris went so far as to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-price-gouging-ban-inflation-65dc8844bb41159d76886f752b6cab28\">propose a federal price-gouging ban</a> to lower the cost of groceries. Such a ban <a href=\"https://farmaction.us/2024/08/20/why-harriss-plan-to-take-on-monopolies-and-lower-consumer-costs-works/\">could help smaller producers and suppliers</a>, but economists fear it could also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/business/dealbook/harris-trump-war-on-prices.html\">lead to further supply shortages</a> and <a href=\"https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2024/ask-the-expert-how-the-2024-election-could-impact-your-grocery-bill\">reduced product quality</a>. Meanwhile, Trump has said he will <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-favors-huge-new-tariffs-how-do-they-work\">tax imported goods to lower food prices</a>, though analysts have pointed out that the tax would likely <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/09/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices/679942/\">do the opposite</a>. Trump-era tariff fights during the US-China trade war led to <a href=\"https://www.fb.org/market-intel/farm-cash-receipts-forecasted-to-hit-a-decade-low-in-2020#:~:text=During%202020%2C%20U.S.%20farm%20sector,a%20record%2Dhigh%20%24282%20billion.\">farmers losing billions of dollars in exports</a>, which the federal government had to <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/92-percent-trumps-china-tariff-proceeds-has-gone-bail-out-angry-farmers\">make up for with subsidies</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s immigration agenda <a href=\"https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/mass-deportation-food-trump-immigration-agricultural-workers-us-labor-supply/\">could also affect food prices</a>. If reelected, Trump has said he would <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/nx-s1-5044582/trump-has-promised-deportations-on-an-unprecedented-scale\">expel millions of undocumented immigrants</a>, many of whom work for low pay on farms and in other parts of the food sector, playing a vital role in food harvesting and processing. Their mass deportation and the resulting labor shortage could drive up prices at the grocery store. Meanwhile, Harris promises to <a href=\"https://www.fb.org/presidential-candidate-questionnaire\">uphold and strengthen the H-2A visa system</a>, the national program that enables agricultural producers to hire foreign-born workers for seasonal work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the short term, it must be emphasized that neither candidate’s economic plans will have much of an effect on the ways extreme weather and climate disasters are already driving up the cost of groceries. Severe droughts are <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/water-and-food-how-when-and-why-water-imperils-global-food-security\">one of the factors that have destabilized the global crop market</a> in recent years, translating to higher US grocery store prices. Warming has led to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01492-5\">reduced agricultural productivity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-29378-2\">diminished crop yields</a>, while major disasters <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/01/what-are-the-odds-that-extreme-weather-will-lead-to-a-global-food-shock/\">throttle the supply chain</a>. Even a forecast of extreme weather can <a href=\"https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/how-forecasts-of-bad-weather-can-drive-up-your-grocery-bill/\">send food prices higher</a>. These climate trends are likely to continue over the next four years, no matter who becomes president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the winner of the 2024 election can determine how badly climate change batters the food supply in the long run — primarily by controlling greenhouse gas emissions.<em> —Frida Garza, Grist staff writer focusing on the impact of climate change on food and agriculture, and Ayurella Horn-Muller, Grist staff writer focusing on the impact of climate change on food and agriculture.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/election-stakes-drinking-water_7bb3a2.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.922893860067,100,76.154212279867\" alt=\"A collage of a black and white photo of a hand holding a glass of water under a kitchen faucet.

But if a second Trump presidency is anything like the first, there is good reason to worry about the protection of public drinking water.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his first term in office, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/climate/trump-administration-rolls-back-clean-water-protections.html\">repealed the clean water rule</a>, a critical part of the Clean Water Act that limited the amount of pollutants companies could discharge near streams, wetlands, and other sources of water used for public consumption. “It was ready to protect the drinking water of 117 million Americans and then, within a few months of being in office, Donald Trump and [former EPA administrator] Scott Pruitt threw it into the trash bin to appease their polluter allies,” former Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/ohio/blog/2017/06/trump-pruitt-repeal-2015-clean-water-rule\">said</a> in a 2017 press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While in office, Trump also secured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which last year tipped the court in favor of a decision to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wetlands-business-climate-and-environment-washington-news-41fc297006512e1f507dc12daa44824a\">vastly limit</a> the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to regulate pollution in certain wetlands, forcing the agency to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/clean-water-epa-biden-supreme-court-sackett-a2101597f96ca9f0dcc6917832906b1e\">weaken</a> its own clean water rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A Harris administration would likely carry forward the work of several Biden EPA measures to safeguard the public’s drinking water from toxic heavy metals and other contaminants. For example, in April, the EPA passed the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard\">nation’s first national drinking water standard</a> to protect an estimated 100 million people from a category of synthetic chemicals known as PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” which have been linked to cancer, high blood pressure, and immune system deficiencies. Enforcing the new standard will require the agency to examine test results from thousands of water systems across the country and follow up to ensure their compliance — an effort that will take place during the next White House administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As president,” Harris’ website says, “she will unite Americans to tackle the climate crisis as she builds on this historic work, advances environmental justice, protects public lands and public health, increases resilience to climate disasters, lowers household energy costs, creates millions of new jobs, and continues to hold polluters accountable to secure clean air and water for all.” Project 2025 indicates that a future Trump administration would eliminate safeguards like the PFAS rule that place limits on industrial emissions and discharges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just this month, the EPA issued a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/climate/biden-epa-lead-pipes.html\">groundbreaking rule requiring water utilities</a> to replace virtually every lead pipe in the country within 10 years. With funds from Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, the agency will also invest $2.6 billion for drinking water upgrades and lead pipe replacements. Harris has previously spoken out about the dangers of lead pipes, stating at a press conference in 2022 that lead exposure is “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=811PkHWEeqc\">an issue that we as a nation should commit to ending</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The success of these and other measures will rely on a well-staffed EPA enforcement division, which may end up being one of the most insidious stakes of this election for environmental policies. Budget cuts and staff departures during the first Trump administration gutted the EPA’s enforcement capacity — a problem that the agency has spent the past four years trying to mend. Project 2025 “would essentially eviscerate the EPA,” said Stan Meiburg, who served as the EPA’s acting deputy administrator from 2014 to 2017.<em> —Lylla Younes, Grist senior staff writer covering chemical pollution, regulation, and frontline communities</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your clean air</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s clean air policy has been characterized by <a href=\"https://grist.org/accountability/epa-finally-cracks-down-on-the-carcinogen-used-to-sterilize-medical-equipment/\">a spate</a> of <a href=\"https://grist.org/regulation/the-epa-wanted-to-clean-up-steel-mills-then-a-group-of-rust-belt-senators-got-involved/\">new rules</a> to curb toxic air pollution from a variety of facilities, including petroleum coke ovens, synthetic manufacturing facilities, and steel mills. While environmental advocates have decried some of these regulations as insufficiently protective, certain provisions — such as mandatory air monitoring — were hailed as milestones in the history of the agency’s air pollution policy. Former EPA staffer and air pollution expert Scott Throwe told Grist that a Harris- and Democratic-led EPA would continue to build on the work of the past four years by enforcing these new rules, which will require federal oversight of state environmental agencies’ inspection protocols and monitoring data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Project 2025 proposes a major reorganization of the EPA, which would include the reduction of full-time staff positions and the elimination of departments deemed “superfluous.” It also promotes the rollback of a range of air quality regulations, from ambient air standards for toxic pollutants to greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, a growing body of research has found that poor air quality is often concentrated in communities of color, which are disproportionately close to fossil fuel infrastructure. Conservative state governments <a href=\"https://grist.org/regulation/republican-attorneys-general-epa-civil-rights-law/\">have pushed back</a> against the Biden EPA’s efforts to address “environmental justice” through agency channels and in court — efforts that will likely enjoy more executive support under a second Trump administration. <em>—Lylla Younes, Grist senior staff writer covering chemical pollution, regulation, and frontline communities</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your public lands</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under the Antiquities Act of 1906, a national monument can be created by presidential decree. The act can be a useful tool to protect important landscapes from industries like oil, gas, and even green energy enterprises. Tribal nations have asked numerous presidents to use this executive power to protect tribal homelands that might fall within federal jurisdiction. During his first term, Trump argued that the act also gives the president <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/president-trump-has-the-power-to-shrink-national-monuments/\">the implicit power to dissolve a national monument</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/trump-bears-ears-grand-staircase-escalante-monuments-shrink\">Trump drastically shrunk two Obama-era designations</a>, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah, in what amounted to the biggest slash of federal land protections in the history of the United States. At the time, Trump said “bureaucrats in Washington” should not control what happens to land in Utah. While giving back local control was Trump’s stated rationale, tribes in the area, like the Diné, Ute, Hopi, and Zuni, had been working for years to protect the two iconic and culturally significant sites. Meanwhile, his decision opened up the land for oil and gas development. While not all tribal nations are opposed to oil and gas production, tribal environmental advocates are worried that a <a href=\"https://grist.org/indigenous/second-trump-presidency-indigenous-peoples/\">second Trump term will erode federal environmental regulations</a> and commitments to progress in the fight against climate change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since 2021, the Biden administration has put more than 42 million acres of land into conservation by creating and expanding national monuments. This includes the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-designates-baaj-nwaavjo-itah-kukveni-ancestral-footprints-of-the-grand-canyon-national-monument/\">Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni</a>, a new monument spanning a million acres near the Grand Canyon — the kind of protection that tribal activists for years had worked to prevent industrial uranium mining. And just this month, the administration announced the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/biden-harris-administration-noaa-designate-3rd-largest-national-marine-sanctuary\">Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary</a> — a 4,500-square-mile national marine sanctuary to be “<a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/biden-harris-administration-noaa-designate-3rd-largest-national-marine-sanctuary\">managed with tribal, Indigenous community involvement</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris might not continue that legacy. While she has remained silent about what she would do to protect lands, she has been vocal about continuing the US’s oil and gas production as well as a push for more mining to help with the green transition — like copper from <a href=\"https://grist.org/indigenous/the-massive-copper-mine-that-could-test-the-limits-of-religious-freedom/\">Oak Flat in Arizona</a> and lithium from <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate-energy/construction-begins-lithium-mine-nevada-controversial/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://grist.org/climate-energy/construction-begins-lithium-mine-nevada-controversial/\">Thacker Pass in Nevada</a> — both important places to tribal communities in the area. Tribes have been subjected to the adverse effects of the energy crisis before — namely <a href=\"https://www.resources.org/resources-radio/the-effects-of-dams-on-tribal-lands-with-heather-randell/#:~:text=The%20social%20and%20cultural%20and,It%20flooded%20entire%20towns.\">dams that destroyed swaths of homelands</a> and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3222290/\">nuclear energy that increased cancer rates of Southwest tribal members</a> — and without specific protections, it’s easy to see green energy as a changing of the guard instead of a game changer. <em>—Taylar Dawn Stagner, Grist Indigenous affairs reporting fellow</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/election-stakes-climate-disasters.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.922893860067,100,76.154212279867\" alt=\"A woman cleaning her house after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Cedar Key, Florida.\" title=\"A woman cleaning her house after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Cedar Key, Florida.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images | A woman cleans her house after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Cedar Key, Florida.\" data-portal-copyright=\"A woman cleans her house after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Cedar Key, Florida.\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your next climate disaster</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Congress controls how much money FEMA receives for relief efforts after catastrophic events like hurricanes Helene and Milton, but the president holds significant sway over who receives money and when. A second Trump administration would likely curtail some of the climate-focused resiliency projects FEMA has pursued in recent years, such as cutting back money for infrastructure that would be more resilient against hazards like sea level rises, fires, and earthquakes. Republican firebrands, like US Rep. Scott Perry from Pennsylvania, have decried these projects as wasteful and unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under the <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-2977/pdf/COMPS-2977.pdf\">Stafford Act</a>, which governs federal disaster response, the president has the power to disburse relief to specific parts of the country after any “major disaster” — hurricanes, big floods, fires. In September, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/trump-california-wildfire-aid-newsom.html\">Trump suggested</a> he might make disaster aid contingent on political support if he returns to office, promising to withhold wildfire support from California unless state officials give more irrigation water to Central Valley farmers. Harris has not given an explicit indication of how she would fund climate-resiliency or disaster-response programs, though she has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vp/reel/DA6uGAASQMM/\">boosted FEMA’s recovery efforts</a> following Helene and Milton. <em>—Jake Bittle, Grist staff writer focusing on climate impacts and adaptation</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your understanding of climate change</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The United States has long been a leader in research essential to understanding — and responding to — a warming world. The government plays a key role in advancing climate science and providing timely meteorological data to the public. Neither Trump nor Harris address this in their platform, but history yields clues to what their presidency might mean for this vital work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has consistently dismissed climate change as a “hoax” and downplayed scientific consensus that it is anthropogenic, or driven by human activities. As president, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html\">gutted funding for research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/12/912301325/longtime-climate-science-denier-hired-at-noaa\">appointed climate skeptics</a> and industry insiders, and eliminated scientific advisory committees from several federal agencies. Thousands of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/science-ranks-grow-thin-in-trump-administration/2020/01/23/5d22b522-3172-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html\">government scientists quit</a> in response. (In fact, still reeling from Trump’s attacks, new union contracts <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02484-5\">protect scientific integrity</a> to combat such meddling.) His administration <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/attacks-on-science/trump-administration-censored-information-climate-change\">censored scientific data</a> on government websites and tried to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/climate/trump-national-climate-assessment.html\">undermine the findings</a> of the National Climate Assessment, the government’s scientific report on the risks and impacts of climate change. If reelected, Trump would almost certainly adopt a similar strategy, deprioritizing climate science and potentially even restructuring or eliminating federal agencies that advance it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11997344/what-kamala-harris-california-roots-reveal-about-her-environmental-priorities\">Harris has long supported climate action</a>: As senator, she <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/59/cosponsors\">co-sponsored the Green New Deal</a>, and, as vice president, cast the deciding vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which bolstered funding for agencies that oversee climate research. As part of its “whole of government” approach to the crisis, the Biden administration created the National Climate Task Force, with the EPA, NASA, and others to ensure science informs policy. Although Harris hasn’t said much about climate change as a candidate, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/climate/climate-policy-harris.html\">climate organizations generally support</a> her campaign and believe her administration will build on the progress made so far. <em>—Sachi Kitajima Mulkey, Grist climate news reporting fellow</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your electric bill</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot goes into <a href=\"https://grist.org/georgia-psc/breaking-down-a-georgia-power-bill/\">calculating the energy rates</a> you see on your monthly electric bill — construction and maintenance of power plants, fuel costs, and much more. It’s pretty tough to draw a direct line from the president to your bill, so if you’re worried about your energy costs, you’d do well to read up on your local public utility commission, municipal electric authority, or electric membership cooperative board.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What the president can do, though, is appoint people to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the board of up to five individuals who regulate the transmission of utilities across the entire country. As the US continues to shift away from fossil fuels, a fundamental problem stands in the way: The country’s aging and fragmented grid lacks the capacity to move all of the electricity being generated from renewable sources. In May, FERC, which currently has a Democratic majority, <a href=\"https://grist.org/energy/ferc-transmission-rule-electricity-grid/\">approved a rule</a> to try to solve that issue — it voted to require that regional utilities identify opportunities for upgrading the capacities of existing transmission infrastructure and that regional grid operators forecast their transmission needs 20 years into the future. These steps will be essential for utility companies to take advantage of the subsidies offered in the IRA and bipartisan infrastructure law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the rule is <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate-energy/recent-supreme-court-decisions-are-already-slowing-climate-progress/\">facing legal challenges</a>, which like much else in US courts, appear to be political. So even if Harris wins the presidency, and maintains a commission that prioritizes the transition away from fossil fuels, the oil and gas industry and the politicians who support it will not acquiesce easily. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Trump wins, he’d have the chance to appoint a new FERC chair from among the current commissioners and to appoint a new commissioner in 2026, when the current chair’s term ends. (<a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/and-then-there-was-one-ferc-commissioner-honorable-steps-down-today/446234/\">Or possibly sooner</a>.) Although FERC’s actions tend to be more insulated from changes in the White House because commissioners serve <a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/about/commission-members\">five-year terms</a>, a commission led by new Trump appointees would most likely deprioritize initiatives that would upgrade the grid to support clean energy adoption. Trump’s appointees supported fossil fuel interests on several fronts during his previous term, for instance by counteracting state subsidies to favor coal and gas plants. <em>—Emily Jones, Grist regional reporter, Georgia, and Izzy Ross, Grist regional reporter, Great Lakes</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/election-stakes-plastic-waste.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.922893860067,100,76.154212279867\" alt=\"A black and white photo of a large plastic bag of garbage.

In August, Biden administration <a href=\"https://grist.org/regulation/us-supports-ambitious-plastics-treaty-production-limits-environmental-groups-industry-reactions/\">announced its support</a> for a version of the treaty that <a href=\"https://grist.org/regulation/us-supports-ambitious-plastics-treaty-production-limits-environmental-groups-industry-reactions/\">limits plastic production</a>, and, though Harris hasn’t made any public comment about it, experts expect that her administration would support it as well. Meanwhile, a former Trump White House official told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/the-long-game/2024/04/09/plastics-talks-talk-trump-00151239\">Politico</a> in April that Trump — who famously <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/in-one-week-the-us-will-leave-the-paris-climate-agreement-could-biden-get-us-back-in/\">withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement</a> in his first term — would take a “hard-nosed look” at any outcome of the plastics negotiations and be “skeptical that the agreement reached was the best agreement that could have been reached.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration has also taken some <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Mobilizing-Federal-Action-on-Plastic-Pollution-Progress-Principles-and-Priorities-July-2024.pdf\">positive steps to address plastic pollution</a> domestically, including a ban on the federal procurement of single-use plastics. Experts expect that <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/what-would-a-harris-presidency-mean-for-the-plastics-crisis/\">progress to continue</a> under a Harris administration. In 2011, as California’s attorney general, <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-sues-plastic-water-bottle-companies-over\">Harris sued plastic bottle companies</a> over misleading claims that their products were recyclable. As a US senator, she <a href=\"https://barragan.house.gov/2020/02/12/landmark-legislation-would-help-u-s-break-free-from-plastic-pollution/\">co-sponsored a Democratic bill</a> to phase out unnecessary single-use plastic products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, meanwhile, does not have a strong track record on plastic. Although he signed a law to remove and prevent ocean litter, he has taken <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/14/politics/plastic-trump-recycling/index.html\">personal credit</a> for the construction of new plastic manufacturing facilities and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49090643\">derided the idea of banning single-use plastic straws</a>. And Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda could increase the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-has-big-plans-for-climate-and-energy-policy-but-can-he-implement-them/\">extraction of fossil fuels</a> used to make plastics.<em> —Joseph Winters, Grist staff writer covering plastics, pollution, and the circular economy</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your votes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After decades of failed attempts to tackle the climate crisis, Congress finally passed major legislation two years ago with the Inflation Reduction Act. Not a single Republican voted for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elections aren’t just important for getting the legislative power needed to enact climate policies — they’re also important for implementing them. The IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, another key climate-related law, are entering crucial phases for their implementation, particularly the doling out of billions of dollars for clean energy, environmental justice, and climate resiliency. Trump, having <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/05/trump-inflation-reduction-act-00177493\">vowed to rescind unspent IRA funds</a> if elected, seems poised to <a href=\"https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2024/09/18/red-and-blue-states-have-big-climate-plans-the-election-could-upend-them/\">hamper the law’s rollout</a>, slowing efforts to get the country using more clean energy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s a mistake to imagine that only federal elections matter when it comes to climate change. Eliminating greenhouse gases from energy, buildings, transportation, and food systems requires legislation at every level. In Arizona and Montana, for example, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/climate/down-ballot-races-senate-climate.html\">voters this year will elect utility commissioners</a>, the powerful, yet largely ignored officials who play a crucial role in whether — and how quickly — the country moves away from fossil fuels. State legislators can also open the door to <a href=\"https://grist.org/elections/states-climate-progress-election-washington-minnesota/\">efforts to get 100 percent clean electricity</a>, as happened in Michigan and Minnesota after the 2022 election. Even in a state like Washington with Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, who once campaigned for the White House on a climate change platform, votes matter — climate action is literally on the ballot in November, when voters could choose to <a href=\"https://grist.org/elections/states-climate-progress-election-washington-minnesota/\">kill the state’s landmark price on carbon pollution.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Depending on what happens with the presidential and congressional races, state, and local action might be the best hope for furthering climate policy anyway. <em>—Kate Yoder, Grist staff writer examining the intersections of climate, language, history, culture, and accountability</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><br>Your global outlook</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his first term, Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, a global commitment to reduce the burning of fossil fuels in an effort to curb the worst impacts of climate change. “<a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord/\">I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris</a>,” he said from the Rose Garden of the White House in 2017. Trump didn’t entirely abandon global climate discussions — his administration continued to attend global climate conferences, where it endorsed events on fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration rejoined the Paris Agreement and pledged billions of dollars to combat climate change both domestically and abroad, but a second Trump administration would likely undo this progress. Trump says that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/13/donald-trump-paris-climate-treaty-kamala-harris-china\">pull out of the Paris Agreement again</a>, and reportedly would also consider <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/28/trump-paris-climate-treaty-withdrawal-again-00165903\">withdrawing the US from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>, a 1992 treaty that’s the basis for modern global climate talks. Harris is expected, at least, to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/kamala-harris-climate-change/\">continue Biden’s policies</a>. Speaking from COP28 in Dubai last year, an annual United Nations climate gathering, she celebrated America’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/02/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-delivering-the-u-s-statement-at-cop28/\">progress in tackling the climate crisis</a> and petitioned for much more to be done. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In order to keep our critical 1.5 degree-Celsius goal within reach,” <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/02/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-delivering-the-u-s-statement-at-cop28/\">she said</a>, “we must have the ambition to meet this moment, to accelerate our ongoing work, increase our investments, and lead with courage and conviction.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But both the Trump and Biden administrations achieved record oil and gas production during their time in office, and Harris opposes a ban on fracking. In order to make a dent in the climate crisis, whoever becomes president would have to reject that status quo and put serious money behind global promises to mitigate climate change. Otherwise, climate change-related losses will just continue to mount — already, they are expected to cost $580 billion globally by 2030. <em>—Anita Hofschneider, Grist senior staff writer focusing on Indigenous affairs</em> </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/explain-it-to-me-newsletter-sign-up\">Explain It to Me newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newsletter is part of Vox’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me\">Explain It to Me</a>.

One, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362923/plant-based-food-meat-dairy-lobbying-congress-research-schools\">US food system</a> has become extremely complicated in recent decades: There are more imported foods now as well as more highly processed foods, which creates more opportunities for disease to enter the food system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two, the government has better and faster tracing capabilities, thanks to legislation around food safety modernization. That makes it easier for the Food and Drug Administration, one of the bodies that investigates such outbreaks, to track problems to their source. It also makes it easier for companies to recall tainted products before they spread further into the food system and sicken large numbers of people. (The US Department of Agriculture oversees recalls of meat, poultry, and eggs as well, but it’s not subject to this legislation.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here is what you need to know about the most recent cases of foodborne illness and why these outbreaks are happening.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which diseases are contaminating food products, and where?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latest issue with tainted food is at McDonald’s, where E. coli <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/investigation-update-e-coli-o157-2024.html\">linked to Quarter Pounders</a> has spread to 10 states and sickened 49 people —&nbsp;although <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/investigation-update-e-coli-o157-2024.html\">according to the CDC</a>, the actual number of people who have gotten sick is probably much higher. The exact source of the outbreak is under investigation, but the CDC believes onions or beef used in the burger could be the cause.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">E. coli, a type of bacteria, isn’t dangerous in and of itself. As Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Vox, “You have E. coli in your body. I have E. coli in my body,” specifically in the gastrointestinal tract. The problem is, some strains make people sick and are especially dangerous when they get into a water supply. Tainted water used in irrigation for agriculture can contaminate food. Deadly strains can also be introduced into meat products, particularly <a href=\"https://iacuc.wsu.edu/escherichia-coli/#:~:text=Eating%20meat%2C%20especially%20ground%20beef,suspected%20to%20be%20very%20small.\">ground beef</a>, when the animal is slaughtered and the meat is processed. E. coli can also spread by person-to-person contact if a sick person is not careful about hygiene.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, E. coli isn’t the only bacteria affecting the food supply right now. Listeria, which spreads easily and rapidly and can only be killed by heating food to high temperatures, led to a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/10/22/frozen-waffle-recall-list-listeria/75790138007/\">recall Friday of a wide range of waffles</a> produced for national supermarkets. This comes after <a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/recall/chicken-recall-list-listeria-brucepac-rcna175276\">a slew of chicken products at grocery stores</a> like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23815696/trader-joes-recalls-falafel-cookies-soup-food-safety-fda-broccoli-cheddar-rocks-insects\">Trader Joe’s</a> and Aldi were flagged for recall due to listeria concerns tied to BrucePac, a pre-cooked meat producer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both recalls follow the listeria outbreak that occurred in Boar’s Head meat products, including liverwurst, that were produced in June and July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The outbreak originated at the company’s <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/08/29/listeria-outbreak-boars-head-states-map-cdc/74996300007/\">Jarratt, Virginia, facility</a> and has been found in 19 states. It has killed 10 people out of 59 known cases so far, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24.html\">CDC</a>. Concerns about <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/boars-head-listeria-investigation-usda-bdcecaa25363c87d08ba01cf71aefb0b\">unsanitary conditions at the facility</a>, including mold, vermin, and meat and fat residue on equipment, floors, and walls go back at least two years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Boar’s Head was forced to recall 71 products and 7.1 million pounds of deli meat as a result of the outbreak. The company closed the Jarratt facility indefinitely and permanently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/health/boars-head-shutdown-listeria-deaths.html#:~:text=279-,Boar's%20Head%20Shuts%20Down%20Virginia%20Plant%20Tied%20to%20Listeria%20Deaths,given%20severance%20and%20offered%20relocation.\">stopped production of their liverwurst</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The third contaminant of concern, salmonella, was the subject of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-salmonella-eggs-sept-2024\">an egg recall</a> in September as well as a more recent <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/22/green-onion-recall/75795073007/\">recall of green onions</a>. It comes primarily from poultry, like chicken and eggs, but it can also show up in other types of food. In 2024, salmonella <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks.html\">outbreaks were linked to eggs, basil, charcuterie meat, and cucumbers</a>. The outbreaks linked to eggs and charcuterie meats had the highest numbers of hospitalizations, and each spread to more than 30 states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you go to your grocery store right now and buy some chicken and you culture it, you&#8217;ll find salmonella,” Adalja said. “It has an easy route, if someone doesn&#8217;t cook their food appropriately. It can even be happening in your own home; you don&#8217;t cook your chicken all the way through or you&#8217;re cutting chicken on a cutting board and then you start cutting lettuce or something. You can cross-contaminate.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why are E. coli, listeria, and salmonella such causes for concern?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Listeria, salmonella, and E. coli infections are particularly concerning for the disproportionate effect they can have on vulnerable groups like pregnant people, children, and people over the age of 65. Healthy individuals not in these groups may experience symptoms after exposure to such bacteria, but they’re less likely to need treatment for them. And in many cases, people who experience symptoms may well be able to recover on their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the Boar’s Head outbreak made clear, however, these bacteria can lead to more severe cases and even fatalities. Listeria causes <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/get-facts-about-listeria\">about 1,500 hospitalizations</a> per year, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/salmonella-is-sneaky-watch-out-202405293044\">salmonella about 26,500</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/php/technical-info/index.html#:~:text=The%20incidence%20of%20infection%20with,3%2C270%20hospitalizations%2C%20and%2030%20deaths.\">E. coli about 3,300</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Listeria is of particular concern as it is “just a much more virulent pathogen when it comes to infection than, for example, salmonella,” Adalja said. “It disseminates very quickly, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t cause telltale signs people think of foodborne illness causing:&nbsp;vomiting and diarrhea. Listeria might not cause that. It may just present as a systemic infection or with meningitis.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is a rundown of the symptoms that each of these bacteria can cause and who’s most at risk:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listeria</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Symptoms: </strong>Fever, muscle aches, nausea, and diarrhea</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Most at risk: </strong>Pregnant people, infants, people over the age of 65, and people with weakened immune systems</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Serious complications:</strong> Listeria can cause miscarriage and stillbirth in pregnant people, as well as severe infections for newborns. Additionally, it can lead to blood infections and infections of the brain like meningitis for adults. Symptoms including seizures, stiff neck, and severe headaches may be signs of meningitis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Treatment: </strong>Antibiotics&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Salmonella</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Symptoms: </strong>Diarrhea, fever, nausea, and cramps</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Most at risk: </strong>Children under 5, infants, people over the age of 65, people with weakened immune systems, people taking medications that reduce stomach acid</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Serious complications: </strong>There can be rare infections of other parts of the body including the liver and nervous system. Some people may also experience reactive arthritis, which manifests as joint pain.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Treatment: </strong>Antibiotics may be used for serious cases, and fluids are recommended to address potential dehydration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>E. coli</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Symptoms: </strong>Stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Most at risk: </strong>Children under 5, people over the age of 65, and people with weakened immune systems</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Serious complications: </strong>A rare condition could lead to kidney damage.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Treatment: </strong>Fluids are recommended to address dehydration.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why is there a spate of food recalls right now?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latest alerts add to a steady <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/04/25/food-recall-usda-fda-recalls\">uptick in food recalls</a> since the pandemic. In 2023, the total number of food recalls and public health alerts by the USDA and FDA were the highest they’ve been in the last few years, <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/food-for-thought-2024/\">according to a report from the US Public Interest Research Group, </a>a consumer advocacy group. (They’re still lower than they were from 2018 to 2020, however.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These recalls were largely driven by companies’ poor disclosure of allergens in different foods, with a smaller fraction due to the discovery of bacteria in items. (The USDA and <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2024/food-recalls-increasing.html#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20FDA%20says%20it's,been%20classified%20by%20the%20FDA.\">FDA</a> have said the number of food products they’ve recalled in 2024 have not increased compared to 2023.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recent recalls are driven by a couple of factors, including lengthier and more complicated food supply chains. Basically, if there are more steps involved in processing and packaging food, there are more chances for germs to spread and items to get contaminated. The popularity and prevalence of processed food, which is a major source of such pathogens, is also an issue. And better testing and detection means that authorities are able to more frequently identify these problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Our supply system has become so complicated that there are more and more blind spots that are allowed to exist and allowed to be ignored throughout the system,” Darin Detwiler, <a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/09/03/food-recalls-on-the-rise/\">a food policy expert at Northeastern University</a>, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also a <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Foodnetfast/LabSurvey\">growing use among government agencies</a> of what’s known as <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/reports/cidt.html\">culture-independent diagnostic tests</a>, which are more sensitive to pathogens and can turn results around more quickly than previous methods. The expanded use of these tests suggests that outbreaks could be getting caught with greater regularity and contributing to the sense that more are taking place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Information technology is also playing a role, Detwiler notes. The FDA is <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/new-era-smarter-food-safety/tech-enabled-traceability-core-element-1-new-era-smarter-food-safety-blueprint\">pushing for more digitization in tracing outbreaks of foodborne illnesses</a>, which enables a faster response to the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There can be repercussions for those responsible for outbreaks, though that’s often <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/listeria-outbreak-boars-head-deli-meat.html\">in the form of a fine</a>, which can be negligible for large corporations. Boar’s Head is facing a slew of lawsuits related to the listeria outbreak, and the US Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for inspections of food production facilities, is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/boars-head-listeria-investigation-usda-bdcecaa25363c87d08ba01cf71aefb0b\">now facing an internal investigation into its role</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even though the burden of making sure food is safe should fall on the companies that produce and handle it, as well as the government bodies tasked with inspection, Detwiler cautions that consumers should be more aware of the risks their food poses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We need to assume that food is always contaminated,” he said. “We always have to be vigilant about &#8230; where we buy, what we buy, what we eat, how we prepare the food, the questions we ask, that kind of thing, to be a stakeholder in that process as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, October 24, 5:30 pm:</strong> A previous version of this story said that the US Department of Agriculture is subject to food safety modernization legislation.</em> <em>The FDA is subject to the legislation, but the USDA is not.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Some of them have been reused. Some of them have been caught up in data breaches. Some are just bad passwords.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why, for the past 11 years, a group called the FIDO Alliance has been working to kill passwords — or at least make us less reliant on them. FIDO, short for Fast IDentity Online, wants to make signing into your accounts not only more secure but also, as the name implies, faster and easier. Since its members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and other architects of our online experience, the FIDO Alliance is in a position to accomplish this, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether you’ve realized it or not, FIDO’s efforts have already transformed the way you sign into everything online. You may have noticed a few years ago, for instance, that a lot more sites started requiring <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/MFA\">something called multifactor authentication</a>, which adds an extra step to the login process, like texting a code to your phone so the site can verify you are you. That was FIDO’s doing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But after years of making logging in more difficult but more secure, the alliance <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-launches-comprehensive-web-resource-to-accelerate-passkey-adoption/\">recently began a major push</a> to get platforms and people alike to adopt a technology that may just kill passwords altogether: passkeys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Passkeys are a new kind of credential that you can use to sign into web accounts without the use of a password. This new authentication standard is making passwords irrelevant by introducing a new, simpler, but more secure workflow. There’s <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/get-the-passkey-icon/\">a logo and everything</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can think of passkeys as two encrypted files, one on your end and one on the website’s end, that open up access to your account when one matches the other, much like a key and lock. Passkeys can’t be copied or spoofed, and they can’t be phished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once you’ve set up a passkey for a website, you can sign in the same way you unlock your phone: with your face, your fingerprint, or a PIN. The process is so quick and familiar, you may already be using passkeys on sites like Google and Amazon. Pretty soon, passkeys could be all you use. May your passwords rest in peace.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The password problem, briefly explained</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It wasn’t always like this. In the early days of computing, when computers took up entire rooms and required several people to operate them, there wasn’t a need for passwords. But once people started sharing those systems, passwords became key to computing in private.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the early 1960s, researchers at MIT built a giant computer called the Compatible Time-Sharing System, a pioneering machine that led to the development of things like email and file sharing. It allowed multiple people to work on their own projects at once, so Fernando Corbató, the head of the project, came up with a way for people to keep private files on the system. He made it possible for researchers to set up accounts and access them with unique strings of characters — and thus the&nbsp;password was born.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Unfortunately it&#8217;s become kind of a nightmare,” Corbató <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-35227\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> in 2014.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It turns out passwords aren’t very private at all. The MIT researchers quickly figured out ways to steal their colleagues’ passwords <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/01/computer-password/\">and play pranks on them</a>. Fast forward a few decades, and people are using hundreds of passwords to protect their hundreds of online accounts — or sometimes it’s the same password for everything. It’s absolutely a nightmare. Passwords are easy to forget and can be difficult to reset. If a hacker steals that one password you use because it’s a hassle to keep track of a bunch, they can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/28/21080122/avoid-hack-hacker-theft\">log into all your accounts, steal your money, and generally wreak havoc</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hackers can also just steal passwords, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/367986/freeze-credit-equifax-experian-transunion-ssn-breach\">sometimes millions of them at once</a>, in order to steal people’s identities. Phishing attacks, when a bad actor tricks someone into giving up their login credentials, are a particularly insidious way to gain access to large amounts of sensitive data. These data breaches are actually what led to the creation of FIDO in 2013, when a consortium of tech companies, banks, and governments banded together to come up with a better way to secure accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The effort started out with adding layers of security on top of the basic password. Multifactor authentication became mainstream about a decade ago. This improved security, but it was also a real pain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You’ve since seen even more complicated login routines. Requirements for passwords have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/02/government-experts-say-complicated-passwords-are-making-you-less-safe/\">gotten more complex</a> (think a dozen characters, upper- and lowercase, special characters, the works). Even once you’ve entered a paralyzingly long and complex password, you might get a push notification on another device to verify that you’re you on your laptop. You might get a magic link sent to your email. There could even be a QR code involved. All of these methods are vulnerable to phishing attempts, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To solve the problem, you need to really get to the root of the problem,” FIDO chief executive Andrew Shikiar told me. “By addressing the password problem, you’re really addressing the data breach problem.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The passkey solution</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Passkeys promise to fix many of the problems passwords created. Thanks to FIDO and W3C, the consortium that manages the standards for the World Wide Web, there is now an agreed-upon workflow for passkeys to replace passwords entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the user’s point of view, the passkey process is pretty easy. You just log on the old-fashioned way, with a password or a code or whatever, and then the website or platform will ask you if you want to set up a passkey. If you do, it will generate those two files — the lock and key, if you will — that make up the passkey. It will also prompt you to unlock your phone with your face, fingerprint, PIN, or swipe pattern, depending on your preferences. The passkey will then be associated with that device and stored in the cloud or in your password manager. The next time you go to log in, that site will go to see if you’ve got the key to fit its lock. If so, unlock your device, and you’re right back in. It takes maybe two seconds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Creating a passkey will not necessarily do away with your password for good. Many sites are keeping the password around as a backup, if you somehow lose track of your passkey. Plus, we’ve been using passwords for so long, it would be weird if they suddenly disappeared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People don’t want to feel like they we’re losing their password,” Shikiar said. “That&#8217;s a scary thought.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not for me. I personally couldn’t wait to switch from passwords to passkeys, once I learned about the wider rollout. So over the past week, I’ve set up as many passkeys as I can. But I did not set up 249 new passkeys to deal with all those problematic passwords. My passkey count is closer to 12.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The setup process is slightly different for each site, but once the passkey is in place, logging in is essentially a one-touch&nbsp;or one-glance process. Most of the time, I don’t even see a place to enter my password. The site just scans my fingerprint or my face, and I’m in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The main challenge, for now, is that not too many companies are using passkeys, which explains FIDO’s recent push to get more companies signed up. You can set up passkeys for your Google and Amazon accounts, for instance, but not for Facebook and Instagram. WhatsApp, however, does use passkeys. It’s all a bit confusing for now. (<a href=\"https://passkeys.directory/\">Here’s a full list</a> of major websites that support passkeys.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other issue here is that, while people can remember passwords in their heads, passkeys really need passkey managers. Because most new devices come with password managers built-in, this is actually not that big of a deal: Password managers are also passkey managers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Google and Apple started making the transition to passkeys a couple years ago. If you’re using an <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/patterns/passkeys\">Android</a> or <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195\">iPhone</a>, you can use the built-in password managers on those devices to save all of your passkeys. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13168025?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\">Google Chrome</a> also has a passkey manager, as does <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d\">Microsoft Windows</a>. Password managers, like <a href=\"https://1password.com/product/passkeys\">1Password</a> and <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/passwordless-passkeys/\">Bitwarden</a>, can also handle passkeys now. If you want to switch from an iPhone to an Android device or switch password managers, you’ll have trouble migrating all of those passkeys, but FIDO <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/\">is working on a solution</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Passkeys were designed to kill passwords, but it will be a slow death. Even though passwords are sticking around for now, they’ll gradually be rendered useless as more sites and platforms rely on passkeys instead. In a sense, passwords will become internet zombies, lurking and probably occasionally causing trouble.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The password will never fully die,” said Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “There will always be devices and corners of the internet where passwords hold on.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story was also published in the Vox Technology newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here</a></em></strong><em>&nbsp;so you don’t miss the next one!</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Apple thinks 249 of my passwords need attention. Some of them have been reused. Some of them have been caught up in data breaches. Some are just bad passwords. That’s why, for the past 11 years, a group called the FIDO Alliance has been working to kill passwords — or at least make us less [&#8230;]",

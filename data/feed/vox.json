She said she would resume some public events, though engagements are expected to remain limited through the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus,” the princess wrote in a post shared on  X. “Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She was diagnosed with cancer after doctors performed abdominal surgery on her and discovered evidence of the disease. </p>\n\n<p>Kensington Palace has not released details on what type of cancer the princess has, nor did it specify what stage the cancer was when it was found. But as a 42-year-old woman, Middleton is far from alone in her diagnosis: Worldwide, more and more people under 50 are developing cancers.</p>\n\n<p>Cancer typically strikes those who are in their 50s, 60s, or even older. Yet, in recent decades, early-onset cancers — which are usually defined as occurring in patients younger than 50 — are occurring at a higher rate, particularly in wealthy countries. As illustrated in the chart below, a <a href=\"https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049#DC1\">2023 <em>BMJ</em> analysis</a> found that the early onset of 29 different cancers had risen nearly 80 percent globally between 1990 and 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25350322/gwDvD_more_young_people_are_getting_cancer_today.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.278341533841,100,51.443316932319\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Dylan Scott/Vox\" />\n<p>Separately, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381\">a study published in <em>JAMA Network Open</em></a> the same year concluded that the occurrence of a wide range of cancers among people under 50 had increased between 2010 to 2019 among American adults, particularly among women.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the increase is attributable to colon and rectal cancers: In 2019, there were about 5.7 cases of colorectal cancer among 100,000 people ages 14 to 49. That’s up 63 percent since 1990, when there were approximately only 3.5 cases per 100,000 people. Breast, cervical, and skin cancers are still the most likely cancers to develop in adults under 50, but individual cases of colorectal cancers taking the lives of well-known <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/celebrities\" data-source=\"encore\">celebrities</a>, like actor <a href=\"https://health.ucdavis.edu/synthesis/issues/winter2021/patient_focus/chadwick-boseman.html\">Chadwick Boseman</a> in 2020, have made that trend more visible in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Cancers of the bladder, kidney, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, thyroid, and uterus also became significantly more common in the nearly three decades covered by the global investigation published in BMJ.</p>\n\n<p>John Marshall, director of the Ruesch Center for the Cure of Gastrointestinal Cancers at Georgetown University, told me recently that, early in his career, he rarely saw a patient under 50. Today, half of his patients are in that age range, many of them appearing to be healthy and fit. At first, these young patients usually came in with colorectal cancer, but Marshall has increasingly seen younger people with cancers attacking other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>\n\n<p>No single factor is to blame for this widespread uptick in numerous cancers among young people, particularly the rise in the gastrointestinal system, but scientists are starting to put together a picture of the reality behind one of the most important medical mysteries of our time.</p>\n\n<p>One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9218641/\">review published in <em>Frontiers in Nutrition</em></a> in 2022 found several dietary factors were associated with early-onset colorectal cancer. Eating a lot of deep-fried and processed foods, foods high in fat, and sugary drinks and desserts was a significant risk factor, as was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24049505/protein-intake-fiber-plant-based-vegetarian-vegan-meat\">having a diet low in fiber</a>. Other studies have found higher alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Toxins in our environment, such as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/8/24093650/mental-health-report-happiness-growth-well-being-smartphones\">microplastics</a>, could also be a contributing factor. These tiny particles can be found in everything from food containers to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/11/14/23955673/fast-fashion-shein-hauls-environment-human-rights-violations\">synthetic clothing</a>, before making their way into our bodies and our GI tracts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One New Zealand research team <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10340669/\">concluded</a> the upticks in cancers among young adults matched the timeline that we would expect from the multiplication of microplastics in the environment. Cellular and rodent models have suggested that microplastics could promote tumor growth. Though more research is needed, these materials contain chemicals that can disrupt hormones and pose a risk to our health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But these are still theories. Scientists still don’t fully understand what is primarily driving earlier-in-life cancer cases. What we do know is that stories like Middleton’s are becoming all too common.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, September 9, 12:55 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on March 22 and has been updated to reflect new information about Kate Middleton’s health status.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Pictures of sunsets and sunrises, recipes for keto brownies, videos of viral K-pop dances — there’s something for everyone. But right now there’s one specific semi-famous woman whose social media activity (liking, unliking, posting) has drawn widespread attention: <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/sports/brittany-mahomes-is-brushing-off-haters-after-patrick-mahomes-advice/\">Brittany Mahomes</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Best known as the wife of Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Brittany Mahomes’s national profile has, for the moment, eclipsed her husband’s. That’s due to her perceived support for former President Donald Trump and his promised political policies. This all started when Mahomes liked and then unliked an Instagram post from the former president that <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/28/brittany-mahomes-trump-support/\">outlined his 2024 platform</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under any normal circumstances, only <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittanylynne/?hl=en\">Brittany Mahomes’s biggest fans</a> would be deeply invested in whether she desires mass deportation and an Iron Dome missile defense system built over America. But Mahomes has connections to Taylor Swift, the most famous woman in the world. That very valuable association is why the social media likes and dislikes of an American football WAG (that’s “wives and girlfriends”) has become a pop culture saga.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re here to answer your most pressing questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Wait, what happened?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Brittany Mahomes has become a moment in this news cycle because she has been liking and unliking social media posts supporting former President Donald Trump and his various policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C-m53xGu3MY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a69d4fdc-9933-4d07-904b-7e88d71753a8\">August 13</a>, Trump’s Instagram account posted a platform promising to “Seal the border, and stop the migrant invasion,” “Keep men OUT of women’s sports,” and&nbsp;“Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.” He also plans to cut “federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, Radical Gender Ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/tiredasslesbian/status/1826972546052325629\">Eagle-eyed internet sleuths</a> spotted that Mahomes “liked” and “unliked” the xenophobic and transphobic dog whistle salad last week. And though Mahomes doesn’t follow Trump on her account, it seems as though the narrative was already set: Mahomes supports some of Trump’s most pernicious and divisive politics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The news that people saw Mahomes’s social media activity eventually circled its way back to Mahomes, who was not pleased that people noticed her public actions. To that, she posted a message via <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/brittany-mahomes-message-haters-liking-pro-trump-instagram-post\">Instagram Story</a> (Instagram Stories are temporary), denouncing her haters and telling them they were emotionally damaged adults:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/brittany-mahomes-slams-haters-instagram-015629071.html?.tsrc=daily_mail&amp;segment_id=DY_GOLDLIST_TEST&amp;ncid=crm_19908-1202929-20240825-0&amp;bt_user_id=6JRyBTwoYQzmdnLH3pN2QzNZuI5lUW99eij89uny52Y9VmIpDsEpGGO5JWIe&amp;bt_ts=1724580120381&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKBxQxF-fo9Px30l0B6tcZu6KwckIA3BbKQcCQTyBfmdE-eLjhpbxsDzUFDj5U0riA9M2Jsg-zMbF58SDN42jXuDiD764vw6o2Wv0F_tzmN_zscfp-UWDMzLVQM4dRmTihmI2MylQw9k_ZcZWJAySNmtqdVp7JDgb2AdfXCpwmLA\">Mahomes seemed</a> to see the negativity surrounding her social media proclivities as a sign that people were mad that she was succeeding, rather than that people were disappointed in her presumed politics, that is to say, what appeared to be her beliefs about how the country should be run and how others should be treated. Mahomes also <a href=\"https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1828870083847884899\">liked a pro-Trump comment</a> under a recent post, eliminating any ambiguity that her previous liking and unliking spree might be an accident.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On August 26, Mahomes doubled down and <a href=\"https://people.com/brittany-mahomes-doubles-down-calling-out-critics-after-backlash-8701908\">shared a post</a> that read, “Contrary to the tone of the world today … You can disagree with someone, and still love them. You can have differing views, and still be kind.” She did not comment on or explain the relative kindness of the views she appeared to support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, on September 4, Trump apparently heard the news and was flattered, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113080034075111751\" rel=\"nofollow\">posting a message</a> on his own social media platform, Truth Social. In the post, Trump called Mahomes “beautiful” and thanked her for “strongly defending” him, going on to decry “Crime and Illegal Immigration,” “INFLATION,” a “World that is laughing” at US leaders. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-truth-social wp-block-embed-truth-social\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"iframely-embed\"><div class=\"iframely-responsive\"><a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113080034075111751\" data-iframely-url=\"//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?maxheight=750&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthsocial.com%2F%40realDonaldTrump%2Fposts%2F113080034075111751&#038;key=a95589c51263af39f0de8ef8737db4f3\"></a></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mahomes has yet to comment on Trump’s thanks. During the Chiefs game on September 5, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/brittany-mahomes-not-in-taylor-swift-chiefs-box.html\">Mahomes and Swift</a>, who sat together during multiple games last year, enjoyed the game from separate suites. But during the US Open men’s tennis final on Sunday, September 8, <a href=\"https://people.com/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-shut-down-friendship-rift-rumors-hug-at-us-open-photos-8708258\">the pair were seated in the same box</a> (with their significant others) and photographed embracing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>And sorry, who is Brittany Mahomes again? Do people regularly care about Brittany Mahomes in general?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Brittany Mahomes is primarily famous because she’s married to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was her high school sweetheart. She’s also the <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a45601704/who-is-patrick-mahomes-wife-brittany-mahomes/\">co-owner</a> of the Kansas City Current, a team in the National Women’s Soccer League, which was the sport she excelled in through college, and she was a Sports Illustrated <a href=\"https://www.si.com/sports-illustrated/brittany-mahomes-makes-her-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-debut-01hxt4v7tp05\">swimsuit model</a> in May of this year. She and Patrick have two children and are currently expecting a third.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3\">biggest “Brittany Mahomes” search spike</a> of the past year was during the Super Bowl when people were ostensibly trying to figure out whether Patrick Mahomes had a wife and if she was hanging out with Taylor Swift (more on this in a bit).&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2160725206.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.696771244586,100,78.606457510828\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes at Wimbledon this year. | Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, the name Brittany Mahomes is not one the average American gives a lot of thought to, and her political views would probably warrant even less consideration. She’s not a political scholar nor is she some kind of kingmaker. Prior to her online statements about “haters,” the <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3\">American public wasn’t furiously Googling</a> “Brittany Mahomes loves Trump?” or “Brittany Mahomes Republican.” There’s a bit of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect\">Streisand effect</a> happening, where the more Mahomes doubles down, the more attention she draws to the kerfuffle. There’s possibly a timeline in which Mahomes lets the entire saga run its course and fade away as football season begins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing to note is that her pro-Trump political stance appears to many to be at odds with her husband’s identity. Patrick is biracial, with a Black father and a white mother. And it would seem that Brittany’s liking that pro-Trump post, especially his bits about attacking critical race theory (an attack that would minimize the historical <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy\">Black American experience</a>) would be insensitive if not incongruent with her husband’s identity. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american\">Trump has recently attacked</a> Vice President Kamala Harris’s biracial ethnicity, claiming that she “turned” Black for political gain. Harris’s father is Jamaican.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patrick hasn’t been open about who he’s voting for, but he has spoken up about police brutality and <a href=\"https://andscape.com/features/patrick-mahomes-saw-george-floyds-death-and-chiefs-quarterback-knew-he-couldnt-stay-on-the-sideline/\">supported Black Lives Matter</a>. In 2020, he <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/watch-patrick-mahomes-and-other-nfl-stars-demand-the-nfl-condemn-racism-and-admit-wrong-in-silencing-players-from-peacefully-protesting-2020-06-05\">urged the NFL</a> to denounce and separate itself from racism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But more important than her husband and the reason everyone’s talking about Brittany at all is that she’s allegedly friends with Taylor Swift — the most famous person on the planet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>So this is all because she’s friends with Taylor Swift?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pretty much!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How long have they been friends?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift and Mahomes seem to have formed their close bond after Swift started dating <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/25/23889682/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-date-nfl-chiefs-game\">Travis Kelce</a>, a Chiefs tight end who plays with Patrick Mahomes. The two women likely cultivated their relationship during Chiefs games last year, when they <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-rcna121662\">were photographed</a> together multiple times at the VIP suites, even potentially wearing matching necklaces. It wasn’t long until they took their friendship on the road, with Taylor including Brittany on a <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/photos/36639/taylor-swifts-nyc-night-out-with-selena-gomez-brittany-mahomes-more\">girls’ night in NYC</a> with the rest of her squad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Wait, what does Taylor have to say about Trump?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift has spoken up against Trump in the past, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump\">acknowledging in her 2020 documentary</a><em> Miss Americana</em> that she regretted not speaking up about him and his policies during the 2016 election. Ahead of the 2020 election, <a href=\"https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1266392274549776387\">Swift tweeted</a> that Trump was cavorting with white supremacists and promised “we will vote you out in November.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But ahead of the upcoming 2024 election, Swift has been less vocal about Trump and publicly more nonpartisan.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/taylor-swift-urges-282-million-instagram-followers-vote-super-tuesday-rcna141848\">In March</a>, she urged her fans to vote for “the people who most represent YOU into power.” Kelce, her boyfriend, has appeared in Covid-19 vaccine and <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/bud-light-boycott-movement-goes-after-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce\">Budweiser</a> commercials, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans\">two targets</a> of right-wing protests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At last year’s Super Bowl, Swift and Kelce found themselves in the middle of a kooky <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/12/us/politics/biden-tiktok-super-bowl.html\">right-wing conspiracy theory</a> that President Joe Biden rigged the game in Kelce and Kansas City’s favor, all to get some of that sweet Swift attention. The gist: that Kelce and Swift were liberal, so Biden tilted the game in their favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/donald-trump-taylor-swift-ai/index.html\">Trump also recently posted an AI image</a> falsely suggesting he has the support of her fans. Swift has not <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/us/ai-content-laws-taylor-swift-trump/index.html\">officially responded</a> to that “acceptance.”<strong> </strong>Still, Swift has yet to endorse a presidential candidate. In what’s likely to be a close election, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/swifties-kamala-harris-zoom/679637/\">some of Swift’s biggest fans</a> are urging her to throw her support behind Harris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Okay, so … Brittany Mahomes isn’t actually Taylor Swift, she’s just a friend. Why do her perceived politics matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mahomes’s social media meltdown came at a peculiar time for megastar Swift. Mahomes and her husband spent the weekend with Taylor Swift at the singer’s Rhode Island estate on August 24. Swift was reportedly hosting a birthday party for pal Blake Lively that weekend. Lively has been having a difficult time in the press recently because of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/367451/blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-press-tour-controversy\">feud with co-star Justin Baldoni</a> during the filming of their movie <em>It Ends With Us</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift’s getaway weekends are famous for being luxurious and over the top, but also as invitations only her very best friends receive. Swift is known for picking and choosing her friends from the world of beautiful and notable people and then visibly hanging out with them. Ever since Swift’s <em>1989</em> tour, where her pals — ranging from Fifth Harmony to Gigi Hadid — joined her onstage, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24134809/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-matty-healy-joe-alwyn\">Swift’s friendships</a> with the hippest, smartest, kindest, and most beautiful women in pop culture have become a crucial part of her image. All these people who call Swift friends are culturally cool, which makes Swift culturally cool.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-1717057814.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.7460602225,100,78.507879555\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Taylor Swift, Brittany Mahomes, and Blake Lively hanging out! One of these women may or may not be deeply into mass deportation! | Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, Swift’s friendships are the most human thing about her. They’re her way of signaling to the public that as different as she is from the rest of the population — a billionaire making hit music and selling all kinds of albums — she’s relatable as a good friend. Arguably, Swift’s friends have defined the singer almost as much as she’s defined herself. The Mahomes’ presence in Rhode Island would indicate that Brittany is indeed a bestie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, not unlike how fans are trying to puzzle out the dynamic of Brittany’s relationship with her husband, Swifties are trying to figure out how Brittany’s politics figure into her friendship with Swift. Since the singer has been relatively quiet, they’re trying to get a read on Swift’s current feelings about Trump. Or, possibly, get a read on how much longer Brittany and Swift will remain friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift’s friendships have always been a crucial and visible part of her image.<strong> </strong>And Brittany Mahomes may have just made a mark on that image that Taylor Swift didn’t agree to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, September 9, 10:30 am:</strong> This story, originally published August 29, has been updated multiple times, most recently with news that Mahomes and Swift sat together at the US Open on September 8. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He was younger — 23 to her 32 — but offered to help with her taxes. Then, in a familiar twist to anyone who has ever used a dating app, he ghosted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Rutter’s audience decided she was the one at fault: In comments sections, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating/woman-ghosted-taxes-date-tiktok-b2531075.html\">in the tabloid media</a>, and in other TikToks, she was called <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tiffanicvd/video/7358947225323441450?q=molly%20rutter&amp;t=1725557978441\">desperate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@winnieparkerr/video/7401597933180816670?q=molly%20rutter&amp;t=1725557978441\">unhinged</a>, and even, bizarrely, a “pedophile” for dating someone younger and for being willing to trust an internet stranger with her financial information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s just so funny to me,” she says now, months later. “People have latched onto this caricature of me: someone who doesn’t give a shit about what anyone thinks to the point that she’s self-destructive, doesn’t care about other people, is emotionally unstable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, however, is precisely the caricature that has made Rutter, a former teacher and now full-time content creator in Buffalo, New York, so fascinating to a growing and devoted following of 85,000 people who obsessively watch her videos. Like a modern-day Carrie Bradshaw — if scene-y nightclubs were replaced with Hinge and the glittering lights of Manhattan with snowy upstate — Rutter has built a budding career off juicy, detailed posts about what it’s like to be on the dating market in 2024. And much like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24124448/carrie-bradshaw-is-the-worst-netflix\">viewers of <em>Sex and the City</em></a><em>,</em> the fans aren’t always on her side.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mollyerutter/video/7394138389206912286\" data-video-id=\"7394138389206912286\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@mollyerutter\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mollyerutter?refer=embed\">@mollyerutter</a> <p>I barely got any content on this date because I was so in the moment!

The media is currently awash in heterosexual dating horror stories: The major <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/wellness/dating-apps-have-gotten-worse-hinge-tinder-bumble-gen-z-millennials\">dating apps are, we’re told, in their flop era</a>, prioritizing the money they can gouge from users by paywalling their most attractive users over the business of actual matchmaking. Women are <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/tiktok-videos-single-women-crying.html\">weeping on TikTok</a>, exhausted after years of trying and failing to find a decent partner; others are going “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/style/boysober-celibacy-hope-woodward.html\">boysober</a>” and taking extended breaks from sex and dating. There’s a sense that dating these days is worse in every possible way than it was in the golden age of yore, even though nobody can quite put their finger on when, exactly, that was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet all of the dating diaries TikTokers I spoke to believed the opposite. “I&#8217;m kind of, like, delusionally optimistic about things, so I would say that dating is better than ever,” says <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty\">Anne Marie Hagerty</a>, a 28-year-old founder of a production company in New York City. “We have so many more options. You can go out and about and meet people, you can be on dating apps. We have social media. You have so much more education about how to be emotionally healthy, therapy, and [how to] be a good partner. That&#8217;s one reframe on the dating conversation that I think is pretty important.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hagerty’s videos gained traction in early 2023 when she recounted the story of meeting a guy at a wedding and immediately feeling as though she’d found her perfect match, despite the fact that, at the time, he had a girlfriend. Months later, she posted <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty/video/7213584012525210922\">a video</a> titled, “POV: getting ready for a first date(?!) w person you think is your soulmate,” since she wasn’t sure if he was single yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The date — and it was, in fact, a date — was “the best first date of my life,” she wrote on a video immediately afterward, adding that it felt like she was falling in love. The man, nicknamed in her content as “soulmate first date,” soon became her boyfriend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her commenters didn’t necessarily see it that way. “Honestly the whole thing sounds like a red flag,” wrote one. Said another: “Run.” After their eventual breakup, Hagerty says that her viewers may have picked up on something she hadn’t. “They called our breakup months before it happened,” she says. “The comments about him were always not very nice, and they ended up being true.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty/video/7301316456757710126\" data-video-id=\"7301316456757710126\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@annemariehagerty\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty?refer=embed\">@annemariehagerty</a> <p>shoot for the stars ya feel <a title=\"datingstorytime\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingstorytime?refer=embed\">#datingstorytime</a> <a title=\"storytime\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/storytime?refer=embed\">#storytime</a> <a title=\"datingdiaries\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingdiaries?refer=embed\">#datingdiaries</a> <a title=\"dateideas\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dateideas?refer=embed\">#dateideas</a> <a title=\"datinglife\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datinglife?refer=embed\">#datinglife</a> <a title=\"helicopter\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/helicopter?refer=embed\">#helicopter</a> <a title=\"fyp\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\">#fyp</a> <a title=\"nyc\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nyc?refer=embed\">#nyc</a> <a title=\"bachelorette\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bachelorette?refer=embed\">#bachelorette</a> <a title=\"sexandthecity\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sexandthecity?refer=embed\">#sexandthecity</a> <a title=\"manhattan\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/manhattan?refer=embed\">#manhattan</a> <a title=\"newyorkcity\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/newyorkcity?refer=embed\">#newyorkcity</a> <a title=\"newyorker\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/newyorker?refer=embed\">#newyorker</a> <a title=\"dateoutfit\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dateoutfit?refer=embed\">#dateoutfit</a> <a title=\"nycdateideas\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nycdateideas?refer=embed\">#nycdateideas</a> <a title=\"nycdating\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nycdating?refer=embed\">#nycdating</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Anne Marie 🌎\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7301316504614619946?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; Anne Marie 🌎</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that kind of real-time feedback isn’t always welcome. Last fall, when Hagerty <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty/video/7301316456757710126\">planned a surprise helicopter ride</a> for a man who thought they were only going for coffee, people ridiculed her with sexist jokes and for “treat[ing] him like the princess he is.” “It’s the cost of doing business,” says Hagerty of the rude comments. But, she says, “I’m probably a chronic oversharer, but I’m also a storyteller at heart.” That’s part of why her content is so appealing: “It’s a lot of living vicariously as you would with a TV show, but TikTok is way more intimate,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wisdomsinclaire\">Wisdom Sinclaire</a>, a Chicago-based 24-year-old who works in data analytics for a housing nonprofit, occasionally gets heat for dating multiple men at the same time and supposedly being a “gold digger” (sexism is often a theme in the negative reactions). Overwhelmingly, though, her comments are from either young women who feel grateful that she’s normalizing the idea of dating around, or from older women who tell her they wish they had done the same in their 20s. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m a girl who wants to get married eventually, I want to have kids eventually,” says Sinclaire. “But in my 20s, I think it’s really important that I learn what I like and what I don’t like, and if I just settle down for the first guy who makes me smile and laugh, I might be missing out on so much more happiness. So of course I&#8217;m going to go out and date and meet as many new people as I can, and I feel like a lot of women should do that.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wisdomsinclaire/video/7393792077894520106\" data-video-id=\"7393792077894520106\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@wisdomsinclaire\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wisdomsinclaire?refer=embed\">@wisdomsinclaire</a> <p>First date in Miami… but this story takes a major turn 😩🥲💔 <a title=\"dating\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dating?refer=embed\">#dating</a> <a title=\"datingadvice\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingadvice?refer=embed\">#datingadvice</a> <a title=\"datingstorytime\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingstorytime?refer=embed\">#datingstorytime</a> <a title=\"flewedout\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/flewedout?refer=embed\">#flewedout</a> <a title=\"firstdate\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/firstdate?refer=embed\">#firstdate</a> <a title=\"datingtips\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingtips?refer=embed\">#datingtips</a> <a title=\"datenight\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datenight?refer=embed\">#datenight</a> <a title=\"miami\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/miami?refer=embed\">#miami</a> <a title=\"datingdiaries\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingdiaries?refer=embed\">#datingdiaries</a> <a title=\"date\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/date?refer=embed\">#date</a> <a title=\"dateideas\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dateideas?refer=embed\">#dateideas</a> <a title=\"relationship\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/relationship?refer=embed\">#relationship</a> <a title=\"storytime\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/storytime?refer=embed\">#storytime</a> <a title=\"capcut\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/capcut?refer=embed\">#CapCut</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Wisdom Sinclaire\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7393792075168303914?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; Wisdom Sinclaire</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rutter’s fanbase, like most TikTokers’, includes people who watch her with some level of either schadenfreude or not-exactly-kind voyeurism. She tends to have a plucky attitude toward her haters — “I always respond to people when they think I&#8217;m insane. I&#8217;m like, ‘Yeah, I&#8217;m cuckoo bananas!’” she says. But recently, someone leaked her Hinge profile on the <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/analysis/reddit-snark-pages-influencers.php\">snark subreddit</a> devoted to making fun of her. The replies were so cruel — mostly criticizing her for supposedly “catfishing” by including older photos — that Rutter deleted her dating apps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sometimes, the criticism comes from the suitors themselves. All of the TikTokers I talked to had dealt with dates who were staunchly against the idea of being mentioned online, even anonymously and even though the creators took care to obscure their identities and faces. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I know for certain there are probably men who have not gone on a second date with me because of my social media. And to that I say, good riddance,” says Rutter. “This is my job. I recognize that doing what I do is going to limit my options. It’s way more socially acceptable to be a teacher than it is to be an influencer on TikTok. But I’m not meant to be with those people who aren&#8217;t comfortable with it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of her recent dates — a British man on a trip to the US whom Rutter drove two hours to meet — was so upset that he asked her to delete the video she’d already posted of herself getting ready that morning. “I told him I wouldn’t [delete the videos] because I stand by the fact that there’s nothing revealing about you on there,” she explains. “What I didn’t tell him was that I had already gone really viral for those videos, and I looked at the amount of money I was going to make, and I was like, ‘No way are you taking away $500 from me.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rutter’s dating diaries are now her livelihood: She recently quit her job teaching at a private elementary school because she was earning thousands more from TikTok’s Creator Rewards Program, which allows eligible users to earn cash for views, than she was from her salaried position (parents had also complained to the school about her videos, even though she says she never violated its social media policy). She’s also found success on Cameo, the app that allows you to book personalized video messages from celebrities and influencers. In less than two weeks, Rutter says she’s booked 50 of them at $20 apiece. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michelleknutson\">Michelle Knutson</a>, a 30-year-old realtor living on a rural ranch outside Nashville, found that posting about her dating life has come with other pleasant surprises. She hasn’t made money or found a partner, but she’s met some of her best friends through the platform, women who related to her approach to dating — that is, waiting to find someone who is truly additive to her already-great life — as many of their peers were settling down with husbands and kids.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michelleknutson/video/7389044040341179694\" data-video-id=\"7389044040341179694\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@michelleknutson\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michelleknutson?refer=embed\">@michelleknutson</a> <p>Replying to @Kathy warning in advance for multiple hand slams 😂 but thats a wrap on five date guy <a title=\"datingstorytime\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingstorytime?refer=embed\">#datingstorytime</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - michelleknutson\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7389044073610496811?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; michelleknutson</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Knutson guesses that the reason so many women (and the vast majority of dating diaries’ viewers are women) find her content so compelling is that it’s a huge break from the way influencers typically post. “You know what to post when you get pregnant: It’s going to be your gender reveal, your nursery haul, the names you loved but didn’t choose — it’s this cadence people are familiar with. It’s highly consumed content, but it’s very guarded and very curated,” she says. “I think the fact that I’m saying, ‘This is the date I went on and I blew it,’ or ‘this was embarrassing,’ people see themselves in that mirror of like, ‘Oh, I do that too, but I would never share that on the internet.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hagerty says that when she began posting about dating, her audience shifted older to women in their 30s to 50s. “If you’re married, the dating content is interesting because it&#8217;s like, ‘What’s happening out there these days?’ Then if you’re single, you’re empathizing, and you’re like, ‘How are we navigating the scene?’” she says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Rutter, the answer to why she shares such an intimate part of her life — and opens herself up to harsh judgment at times — is much more personal. “Because of my body composition, I think it can be really lovely and inspiring for people to see someone being so unapologetic and confident. It can also be equally as uncomfortable for someone to see someone that confident,” she says. “It’s almost as though [people think], ‘She shouldn’t be this confident because of her body. Dating should be harder for her.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now that content creation is her full-time job, Rutter is steeling for even more scrutiny from her commenters, Reddit, and the rest of the internet. But it hasn’t stopped her: She’s already planning a podcast, writing a children’s book, and dreaming about someday being a professional speaker or, if the stars align, a stint on a dating reality TV show. A soul mate? That’d be nice — as long as he’s cool with the camera. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The bottom line is you can minimize respiratory viruses’ effects on your life by reducing your exposure to them, priming your immune system to fight them off, getting vaccinated, and making a plan to get tested and treated for an infection if you’re someone who’ll benefit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s how to think about this year’s cold, flu, and ongoing Covid-19 season, how to keep yourself healthy and safe, and how to be strategic about testing, vaccines, and medications.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Should I treat Covid like the flu? Or like the common cold?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The further we get from the OG Covid of 2020, the less likely it is that infections will translate into hospitalizations, deaths, or long-term disability. That doesn’t mean the virus doesn’t carry risk. “Covid continues to be a more dangerous virus than flu, [but] they’re becoming more similar,” said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Mandy Cohen in a late August press briefing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last season, Covid-19 caused <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fsurveillance%2Fresp-net%2Fdashboard.html\">more hospitalizations</a> than flu and RSV combined. However, with each successive wave of Covid, a <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker\">smaller proportion</a> of infected people are hospitalized or die as a result. That suggests the virus is less likely to cause severe illness, especially in low-risk people. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A Covid-19 infection does still carry the risk of persistent symptoms — also called long Covid — but that risk has significantly <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403211\">decreased over time</a>, in large part due to Covid-19 vaccines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We can&#8217;t attribute characteristics to Covid 2024 that we did to Covid 2020,” Doron says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If anything, people should be taking more care with other, non-Covid infections</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, an important question when thinking about Covid risk remains, “Who are you?” says <a href=\"https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md\">William Schaffner</a>, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Older, immunocompromised, pregnant, and frail people still “ought to be clearly more concerned,” he says, because the consequences of an infection are worse for them than for others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How long should I stay away from others if I have Covid-19?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although there are no longer any hard guidelines about how many days you should isolate if infected with Covid-19 as of this year, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html\">the CDC recommends</a> staying home and away from others if you have respiratory symptoms, regardless of the cause. Whether you had a positive Covid test or not, don’t go back to normal activities until your symptoms are improving overall and you’ve been fever-free (without meds like Tylenol or ibuprofen) for at least 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In conversations among infectious disease specialists, says Doron, most advocate that workers with Covid-19 infections should apply the same rules for going back to work as they do with flu or cold infections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t mean you should be flippant about Covid’s risks, says Doron. If anything, people should be taking more care with other, non-Covid infections. “You should stay away from people who are high-risk or immunocompromised regardless of what virus you have,” she says, “because all viruses can be dangerous to high-risk people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Doron recommends masking for people with any respiratory symptoms when in close contact with others, and for severely immunocompromised people (for example, people with low levels of infection-fighting cells after chemotherapy) when in public. During periods when lots of Covid-19 is circulating — like now — Schaffner suggests masking and avoiding crowded public locations for all high-risk individuals, including people 65 and up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Should I be testing for Covid-19 if I get sick?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since CDC and other experts say the methods for protecting others should be the same for all respiratory infections, the main reason to get tested if you’re sick is to determine whether you should take medicines directed at specific viruses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tamiflu (the brand name for oseltamivir) and other medications can make flu infections <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/whatyoushould.htm\">less lethal</a> for high-risk people (e.g. people of all ages with asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions). <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/outpatient-treatment.html\">Paxlovid</a> (the brand name for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) can have similar effects in older and immunocompromised people with Covid-19 infections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These drugs can be lifesaving if people take them for the right infections, but neither will do much good for other viruses. If you’re sick and you’re among those who’d benefit from treatment with one of these medications, it’s smart to get tested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US government will once again mail <a href=\"https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Test/Pages/default.aspx\">free Covid-19 tests</a> to Americans who request them starting at the end of September, and you can get tested for flu at many pharmacies, at urgent care centers, or at a health care provider’s office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the deal with all these different vaccines?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before the pandemic, the only seasonal vaccine most people needed to think about was a flu shot each fall. Now, there’s a Covid-19 booster vaccine available at about the same time. Additionally, shots to protect babies and older adults from the pneumonia-causing RSV virus — which was in development for years before the pandemic — finally became available to the public last fall. The toolkit is bigger now than it was a few years ago. It’s a good thing, but it can feel confusing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">US recommendations aim to keep things simple for most people: The CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s-t0627-vaccine-recommendations.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20everyone%20ages%206,with%20a%20COVID%2D19%20vaccine.\">recommends</a> everyone over 6 months old get a Covid-19 booster and a flu shot for this fall (more below on how to time your shots).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to RSV, three categories of people should be getting a vaccine: older people, pregnant people, and babies. For now, this is a one-and-done shot — people who get it don’t need to worry about an annual booster. If you’re 75 or over, 60 or older with an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/older-adults.html\">underlying illness</a>, pregnant, or have a newborn baby, talk to a health care provider about getting an RSV vaccine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How should I time the flu and Covid vaccines to give myself the best protection?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Getting the flu shot and the Covid-19 vaccine at the same time is perfectly fine, and you can even get them in the same arm a few inches apart. Any time before New Year’s is good protection, although you can be strategic with the timing if you need to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts have landed on Halloween as optimal vaccination time for both to avoid the worst of the winter flu season and whatever Covid might also be bouncing around in late winter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The main benefit of Covid-19 vaccination is protection from severe infection and hospitalization, not protection from infection altogether. However, there is a short-lived period after vaccination when antibody levels are so high that even infection is unlikely. If you have an important life event planned — say, a big overseas trip or a wedding — it’s not unreasonable to try to time your vaccine for about a month before that event in order to make it less likely you’ll be sick during your big moment, says Doron.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Experts have landed on Halloween as optimal vaccination time to avoid the worst of the winter flu season and whatever Covid might also be bouncing around in late winter</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re at risk for a severe Covid-19 infection, get a Covid booster as soon as you can, says Schaffner. His reasoning: There’s a lot of Covid circulating right now, and in any case, people who need extra protection can get <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html\">an extra dose</a> of the updated vaccine midwinter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re someone who’d benefit from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/index.html\">RSV vaccine</a>, the best time to get it is in the late summer or early fall, before the virus starts spreading. Vaccination for pregnant people in particular should happen between September and January.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Seriously, do I really need to get another Covid vaccine?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You betcha,” says Schaffner, echoing the CDC’s broad recommendation. Experts have determined that in the US, the benefit of getting the vaccine exceeds the risk for all age groups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, it’s more crucial for some than others. “The more high-risk you are, the more you’ll stand to benefit from the updated vaccine,” says Doron. That includes older people (65 and up) and those who are severely immunocompromised, like those actively receiving chemotherapy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All three Covid-19 vaccines expected to be offered this fall are safe and effective at preventing hospitalization. Novavax is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37992183/\">less likely to cause side effects</a> than the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines; in her <a href=\"https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/top-6-questions-answered-about-fall\">latest newsletter</a>, epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted that’s a major reason she’ll be waiting to get a Novavax booster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the vaccines’ safety record, a recent survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggests <a href=\"https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/more-in-u-s-accept-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-and-willingness-to-vaccinate-has-declined/\">false Covid beliefs are on the rise</a>, with one in five Americans believing Covid infection is safer than vaccination. “The level of messaging on one side didn&#8217;t change. On the other side, it did change,” director <a href=\"https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/kathleen-hall-jamieson-phd\">Kathleen Hall Jamieson</a> told me. “There&#8217;s less pro-vaccination messaging that you&#8217;re routinely hearing, and you’ve still got the same amount of anti-vaccination messaging out there.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do I need to get the Covid-19 vaccine if I recently had Covid?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-nationaltrend.html\">Wastewater measurements</a> suggest we’re in the midst of a big Covid-19 uptick nationwide, with infections likely continuing to climb upward in the Midwest and Northeast. That means many Americans have recently been infected with the virus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/76/10/1822/6964677?login=false\">not much benefit</a> to receiving a Covid-19 vaccine in the three months after a Covid-19 infection. Holding out for longer gets you more bang for your vaccine buck and allows the immunity produced by a Covid-19 infection to mature and solidify, says Doron. Studies of vaccine timing have borne this out: In one study, for example, antibody levels (which are protective against infection) were <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.21.22274025v1\">11 times higher</a> in people vaccinated eight months after infection than in people who only waited three months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the flip side, the longer you wait to get vaccinated after a Covid-19 infection, the more likely you’ll get infected in the interim. (However, most people are not reinfected in the first nine to 12 months after an infection, says Doron.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What else can I do to stay healthy this season?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re not sick, several familiar strategies can help keep you healthy: Wash your hands before touching your face or preparing food and after touching shared surfaces or using the bathroom; use a mask in crowded places; ventilate shared spaces by opening a window and turning on a fan if possible, and consider using an air purifier when gathering with others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“During the height of Covid, we forgot about reinforcing how important sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress reduction, all of those things impact the immune system,” says Doron. Optimizing those factors — while also maintaining a healthy weight and controlling underlying medical conditions — makes it more likely you’ll stay healthy if and when you get a respiratory infection.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

I don’t buy that premise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So I’m reimagining the genre. My advice column is based on <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-pluralism/\">value pluralism</a>, the idea — developed by philosophers like Isaiah Berlin and Bernard Williams — that each person has multiple values that are equally valid but that sometimes conflict with each other. When values clash, dilemmas arise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What happens when you value authenticity, for example, but also want to use ChatGPT to write your wedding speech because it would be more efficient? Or when you value fighting climate change but also desperately want to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22399882/climate-change-kids-children-overpopulation\">have kids</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you write in with a dilemma,&nbsp;I won’t give you my answer; I’ll show you how to find your own. First, I’ll tease out the different values at stake in the question. Then I’ll show how wise people — from ancient philosophers to spiritual thinkers to modern scientists — have thought about these values and conflicts between them. Finally, I’ll guide you to decide which value you want to put more weight on. Only you can decide that; that’s why the column is called<em> Your Mileage May Vary</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here, I answer the first Vox reader’s question, which has been condensed and edited for clarity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>My mother is retired, disabled, and poor. I assist her with her medical care by arranging appointments, talking to her doctors, and finding medical resources that she needs for her many ailments. I&#8217;ve even been able to find a home health aide to come to her house six days a week to assist her with daily cleaning, cooking, and other tasks.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>But as she ages, I know she will need more help than I can provide from afar. And I know I cannot take on the actual tasks of caring for an elderly person with the many issues she has. &#8230; Am I a monster for accepting the fact that she will likely end up in a state-run retirement community?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dear Definitely-Not-a-Monster, </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not a traditional advice column, where someone writes in with a question and comes away with a simple answer. In your case, though, there is one question I can answer very simply right off the bat: “Am I a monster?” The answer is no. The world isn’t divided into good people and bad people (despite what fairy tales and superhero movies tell us). We’re all just human beings, trying to live in line with our values as best we can under the conditions we’re given. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s clear that you hold multiple values simultaneously. You want your mother to be well-cared for. You also want yourself to be well-cared for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What could be more natural? I imagine that every animal on Earth feels this dilemma in their guts. And, demographically, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22639674/elder-care-family-costs-nursing-home-health-care\">it’s a fact</a> that more and more people are going to find themselves in exactly this position as baby boomers age. But I also know from personal experience that just realizing how common a dilemma is doesn’t make the internal tug-of-war any less confusing or painful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Feel free to email me at <a href=\"mailto:sigal.samuel@vox.com\">sigal.samuel@vox.com</a> or <a href=\"https://forms.gle/wTU5egBukdhyKeL56\">fill out this anonymous form</a>! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Sign up here!</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People have been wrestling with this painful confusion for thousands of years. They’ve come up with different ways to navigate trade-offs between these competing values, depending on the social mores of the time. We can learn from the insights they’ve surfaced along the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, even ancient traditions that take filial piety very seriously acknowledge that there will always be a tension between caring for your parents and caring for yourself. In Judaism, “Honor your father and your mother” is one of the Ten Commandments — it’s not all 10! In fact, biblical commentators have understood another commandment from Deuteronomy, “Guard yourself and guard your soul very carefully,” to mean that you’re obligated to take care of your own body and soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the Chinese ethical tradition of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Respect-Elderly-Implications-Service-Providers/dp/0761845305#:~:text=Book%20overview&amp;text=This%20book%20is%20concerned%20with,the%20resolution%20of%20those%20issues.\">Confucianism</a>, your body is considered a gift from your parents, so to harm its health (for example, by stretching yourself too thin) would be to disrespect them. That means caring for your parents can’t be the be-all and end-all value without becoming self-defeating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So to ask the question “What should care for my mom look like?” is to ask the question at the wrong level of granularity. A better question might be “What should care for my mom look like, considering everyone involved?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To answer that, you’ll want to think about your mom’s evolving needs, but you’ll also want to consider: How much bandwidth do you have in terms of your physical and mental health? Who else is counting on you — a partner, a child, a dear friend? What other commitments do you value?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You straight-up say, “I know I cannot take on the actual tasks of caring for an elderly person with the many issues she has.” That actually makes things pretty simple in your case. Even Immanuel Kant — the 18th-century German philosopher I think of as Mr. Duty — <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/ought-implies-can\">said</a> that “ought”<em> </em>implies “can,” meaning that if you’ve really thought through the situation and concluded that you can’t care for your mother on your own, you aren’t morally obliged to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s a more radical point to internalize here: Even if we imagine a scenario where you <em>can</em> take on all these tasks for your mom, that alone doesn’t mean you should. Being able to do something is necessary but not sufficient for having an obligation to do it. Even if, for example, you could have your mom move in with you, it doesn’t automatically follow that that’s a wise idea. It depends on what the effects would be on everyone involved — yourself included.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you feel that the effects of doing something, even something “good,” are prohibitive, that’s not an indictment of your morality as an individual. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23850582/millennials-aging-parents-boomers-seniors-family-care-taker\">Modern life</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22442407/care-for-caregivers-mental-health-covid\">does not make</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22639674/elder-care-family-costs-nursing-home-health-care\">caregiving</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23911269/parents-caregiver-older-aging-in-place-seniors-family-support\">easy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the surgeon Atul Gawande explains in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Being-Mortal-Illness-Medicine-Matters/dp/1250081246\"><em>Being Mortal</em></a>, children used to live close to their parents and parents used to, well, die earlier. It was more feasible for children to be their parents’ caregivers. Now, we live in a globalized world where the young often migrate to get an education or a job, and surviving into old age is much more common. (For someone born in 1900, the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy\">global average life expectancy</a> was 32 years; now that we have more medical knowledge and less poverty, it’s 71 years, and substantially higher in high-income countries.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, today’s parents are having kids <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/popfacts/PopFacts_2019-5.pdf\">later</a> in life than in the past, so when the parents reach old age, their offspring are in their prime. That means the young are trying to establish their careers and raise their own children at exactly the time their parents experience declining health and call for help —&nbsp;often from afar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our society is not set up to handle that. And it’s one of the reasons why retirement communities first became a widespread fixture of American life in the 1960s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These communities vary a lot in quality. You can try to find one with qualities that appeal to your mom, but you might also have to accept the fact that her living conditions may not be ideal. She might have an unhappy time there. That’s a societal failure that you can’t single-handedly fix. If you happen to be in a position to improve the system —&nbsp;if you work in public policy, say — great! Consider pulling those levers. More likely, though, you’ll want to focus on what you can do for her right now, given the system you live in and given all your other commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The existence of retirement communities doesn’t mean you should totally exempt yourself from caring for your mom. How you approach caregiving has implications for her, but it also has implications for your own moral development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Philosopher Shannon Vallor <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-011-0015-x\">argues</a> that the experience of caregiving helps build our moral character, allowing us to cultivate virtues like empathy, patience, and understanding. So outsourcing that work wouldn’t just mean abdicating a duty to nurture others; it would also mean cheating ourselves out of a valuable opportunity to grow. Vallor calls that “moral deskilling.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet she’s careful to note that caring for someone else doesn’t automatically make you into a better person. If you don’t have enough resources and support at your disposal, you can end up burned out, bitter, and possibly less empathetic than you were before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Vallor says, there’s a big difference between liberation from care and liberation to care. We don’t want the former, because caregiving can actually help us grow as moral beings. But we do want the latter, and if a retirement community gives us that by making caregiving more sustainable, that’s a win.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bonus: What I’m reading</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ancient Greeks —&nbsp;they’re just like us!

Kennedy’s grandson and silly goose social media star Jack Schlossberg speaks on the second day of the Democratic National Convention. | Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In life, there are certain inevitabilities. In the United States, those inevitabilities include death, taxes, and hearing about the Kennedys. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. making a splash in the 2024 presidential race (and now endorsing Trump), Caroline Kennedy’s son <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/jack-schlossberg-vogue-political-correspondent.html\">Jack Schlossberg</a> covering said race for Vogue, and rumors of the post-J. Lo Ben Affleck dating <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ben-affleck-annoyed-kick-kennedy-200000357.html\">Kick Kennedy,</a> it feels as though the media spotlight is circling back once again to America’s royal family. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For generations of Americans, especially those in the Northeast, a fascination with the Kennedys is nothing new. The ambition and glamour, public service and philanthropic triumphs, tragic deaths and scandals are all part of this family’s legacy, and so many people have watched and lived through each one with them. The American Kennedy obsession was a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24043045/politics-fandom-trump-fans-toxic-stan-culture-conspiracies\">parasocial relationship</a> before we even had a name for it. What might be harder to explain is that even as younger generations of Americans are further and further removed from the most famous and politically significant Kennedys, there’s still a fascination. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Why are so many people invested in <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/jack-schlossberg-interview\">Jack Schlossberg</a>, perhaps best known for making <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jack.schlossberg/video/7389585125987650858?lang=en\">goofy little lip-sync TikToks</a>, reasserting his family’s legacy? Why, in the case of Kick, are they still rubbing elbows with movie stars and entertainment moguls — or at least being rumored to? And what are we to make of the RFK Jr. of it all: the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html\">brain worm</a> and the separate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5063939/rfk-jr-central-park-bear-bicycle\">bear</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/rfk-jr-whale-head.html\">whale</a> carcasses? Is having a parasite in your cranium and playing around with animal bones somehow more or less embarrassing when you’re a Kennedy? What does the family name mean in 2024?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a better understanding of the Kennedys and this current moment, we turned to <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/experts/barbara-perry\">Barbara Perry</a>, a Kennedy expert and professor at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, an organization that specializes in presidential scholarship. I got to speak with Perry about why the Kennedys occupy such a special place in the American psyche, what Camelot means to politics, why some people are so desperate to see Schlossberg shed his silly goose era and run for office, and why RFK Jr. is so weird. She had answers for most of these burning questions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Barbara, I’m here to ask you about Kennedys in the news. RFK Jr. is a Kennedy. Jack Schlossberg is a Kennedy. Taylor Swift </strong><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/relive-taylor-swift-conor-kennedys-whirlwind-romance/\"><strong>dated a Kennedy</strong></a><strong>. Ben Affleck might be dating a Kennedy. The Kennedys are everywhere again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well there’s just so many of them and there’s so many to date. Every American could probably date one, and maybe even marry one at this point! </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>That’s the dream, isn’t it? We’re into something like the third generation of, or Kennedy family 3.0, at this point. </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy 3.0 is a really good way to describe it, but this goes all the way back probably to Jack Schlossberg’s third great-grandfather. President Kennedy&#8217;s grandfather, for whom he was named — John Fitzgerald — was the mayor of Boston and was in Congress in the 1890s. President Kennedy was only about three generations removed from abject poverty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So that would actually put us somewhere at 5.0 or 6.0 today. This is also a family that, for generation after generation, has pursued or been involved in public service. And that’s why many people think of them as “America’s Royal family.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Being in public service and being in the public eye go hand in hand. Generation after generation of people are drawn to this family. </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I personally know a thing or two about that magnetism — my mother took me to see John F. Kennedy. I was a little thing, a wee thing. My mother was a homemaker, very smart, voted, and kept up with the news, but she hated down-and-dirty politics. And the one and only campaign rally she ever went to was then-Senator John F. Kennedy, at a rally one month before he was elected. She piled my two older brothers and me into the car. She drove from the suburbs, and she didn’t particularly like driving downtown, but she did. We got there early so we could stand right in front of the podium. And I’d say that I can’t remember the speech, but I do remember the crowd and the excitement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I believe my mother feels the same as yours. Regardless of her own individual politics or how she feels about the current state of politics in the US, she adores the Kennedys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I bring that up because that’s part and parcel of the broad reach of this family, and something I was thinking about before you even called. I can name all sorts of factors that I think draw people to them, but one is, they’re the first completely modern media political family. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What do you mean? Is it that the Kennedys begin to understand the value of media or that the Kennedys are made for the media?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">TV didn’t exist for any [previous] presidential families — the Roosevelts or the Adamses. But it comes on strong for President Kennedy, his young and beautiful wife, and their two beguiling children. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I always cite <a href=\"https://time.com/4795637/jfk-television/\">this [stat]</a>: When Eisenhower was elected, the first time in ’52, only 20 percent of American homes had television sets. By the time Kennedy was elected eight years later, 80 percent of American homes had a television set. And that’s how people came to know him as this very young, handsome, active president, again, along with his stylish and beautiful wife, who took Washington by storm and then took the world by storm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And there’s the fact that his dad, Joe Senior, was a movie mogul. He was a producer of Hollywood movies in the ’20s, and that’s in part how they made their fortune. That’s another thing about this family. They’re a rags-to-riches story. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-515586136.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.976315497612,100,66.047369004777\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie. | Getty Images (archival)\" data-portal-copyright=\"Getty Images (archival)\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Life magazine had also just come on the scene. Teddy Kennedy used to say, “Oh yeah, Life magazine was kind of like our family photo album.” And people reading Life would say, “Oh my gosh, this family has nine children.” The women were beautiful and the boys were handsome, and they were active and sporting and witty and well-educated at Harvard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>It sounds like a perfect storm: the rise of new media and a family so photogenically perfect and stylish to take advantage of it. It’s the combination of a made-for-television family and the rise of television itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have to add this as well, but it’s also the horrors of his assassination in 1963.&nbsp; For this young man dead at 46, his wife 12 years younger becomes a widow, and then these two beautiful little children are now fatherless — I just don’t think anybody who lived through that [wouldn’t be sympathetic].&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Obviously there were Republicans and people who hated the Kennedys, and still do and hate Jack Kennedy. I’m not saying 100 percent of Americans were upset and grief-struck, but interestingly enough, he had just barely slipped by Richard Nixon in 1960 and I’m not sure he even got 50 percent of the popular vote. But after he died, people were asked if they voted for him and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/to-tell-the-truth-to-pollsters/\">well over 50 percent of Americans said yes</a>, which says to me that they were drawn to him even more in his death. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>It seems like the Kennedys are equal parts a mixture of tragedy and aspiration. You mentioned your mother being drawn to JFK despite not particularly being fond of politics. I think, for a lot of people, the Kennedys made political ambition seem glamorous — which, like you said, is very closely tied to Hollywood.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s this Hollywood theme that runs through the Kennedys, and if you sort of theoretically add that to a much better-looking royal family, it’s sort of like Diana — although she was attractive, most of the others are not. But if you add movies and beauty and charm and charisma and wit and athleticism to all of this, they just are very compelling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, like Diana or James Dean or Marilyn Monroe, these people flash across the sky like a shooting star and then are taken, usually with some kind of tragedy. It just somehow pulls people even closer to them, or they want to know even more about them, I think. And they’re frozen in time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was Mrs. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, who named her husband’s presidency Camelot, and to this day it sticks. That’s got a Hollywood air to it and a Broadway air. If you go and look at the lyrics to the main song from musical <em>Camelot</em>, “Don&#8217;t let it be forgotten. Once there was a spot for one brief shining moment known as Camelot.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I think your mention of Marilyn, Diana, and James Dean is interesting in that they’re not political figures. Monroe and Dean are tragic Hollywood figures — that whole live fast, die young curse. Diana is and has become more of a pop culture icon than she was a monarch. And those three figures are continuously mythologized and eulogized. </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>JFK Jr., I think, is often a part of that same conversation when it comes to American pop culture, since he never ran for office, but </strong><a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/jfk-jr-plane-crash-carolyn-lauren-bessette\"><strong>died in a plane crash</strong></a><strong> when he was only 38.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He was going to be the one to restore Camelot. He got the best of the looks of his father and his mother, and he was a handsome devil. He married the Calvin Klein woman [Carolyn Bessette], and they were on their way to the White House.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-1453022170.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.721562822657,100,78.556874354687\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"JFK Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette. JFK Jr. was largely seen as the next Kennedy in line for political prominence after his father’s generation. | Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Well, that idea of promise seems to be the thing that keeps us all watching or keeps people interested. People are still curious if there’s a Kennedy who sort of absorbs the political fantasy that we project onto this family. I can’t help but think that’s sort of what’s happening with the media attention on Jack Schlossberg. Of course, he seems to play into the joke and sort of subvert his family name by being a silly goose.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My question to you is, I think what I’m hearing is that you actually find that appealing, that he’s kind of a goofy comedian? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I’m not sure! But I think it’s not that different from what you said about the Kennedys being the first family with television. He’s sort of the first Kennedy that’s become a social media star.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I got to meet him two summers ago on Martha’s Vineyard. I don’t want to say he was overly serious, but he was mature and kind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And he seemed to get all the best characteristics of everybody in the family, physically, mentally, and in terms of his personality, he had a nice wit about him. He was charming, charismatic, cute, handsome, just lovely. And I thought, oh, and what a cute girlfriend. And I thought, oh, I hope they get married and they’ll have beautiful children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Barbara, you are sounding like your mother at the rally!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or your mother too! I maintain that I didn’t do anything that would embarrass me or the Miller Center or the JFK Library. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I think that it’s probably good for him if he wants a public life because he clearly has been chosen by his mother. He goes on TV with her. They speak on video during the 2020 election — he’s clearly the designated son and restorer of Camelot because he’s the only male heir to John Kennedy. He’s the only grandson of John Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, as you say, he’s smart, and I guess for a newer generation, he’s got the right stuff, as far as knowing how to use social media and being witty and funny and serious when he needs to be, but approachable when not. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>On the other side of that, can I ask you your thoughts on RFK Jr.? Do you think the obsession with him comes from him representing a weird and bizarre side of the Kennedys — like everything they’re not supposed to be?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, people are drawn to him I think in large part because he has the same exact name of his father and people still feel sad about that — maybe even more so in some way than Jack because with Bobby, he is, I think, more tied to our current politics and social policy of caring for the poor and minorities, and being anti-war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Going back to my mother —  she and my grandmother talked about the President and the family as if they were our family, and my grandparents hung a picture from a magazine of President Kennedy in their living room when he died. So that’s all part and parcel of this, and I think that does still attach in part to Robert Kennedy Jr. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is he genuinely weird or just weird for a Kennedy? Like, his scandals aren’t that far removed from the usual scandals — drugs and women — that have followed the Kennedy men around?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I can remember seeing interviews of Robert Kennedy senior, where he’d say, “Oh, my son, Bobby loves animals, and he has falcons.” And that always seemed to me to be rather odd, unless you’re in the Middle Ages in England. Falconry was not a big thing here, and even in the ’60s. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That home, Hickory Hill, where they lived out in northern Virginia, was a menagerie. They had a Newfoundland that would slobber all over everybody, and they had goats and rabbits and falcons and these raucous touch football games. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-2167290858.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.735821710327,100,78.528356579346\" alt=\"RFK Jr shaking hands with Donald Trump.\" title=\"RFK Jr shaking hands with Donald Trump.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"After a campaign in which RFK Jr. said his brain was partially eaten by a worm and that he may or may not have put a bear corpse in Central Park, he ended his presidential bid and endorsed Donald Trump. | Rebecca Noble/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Rebecca Noble/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was written about, but <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6832932/the-administration-big-splash-at-hickory-hill/\">Bobby and Ethel had some big party</a> at their home with a pool, and they started pushing people, fully clothed people, including Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian who was the White House historian during Kennedy’s presidency. That made the news, and Rose Kennedy was embarrassed, being the Victorian, and she’s writing to the family members to say, please don’t do that, it doesn’t make our family look very good. Your brother is the president of the United States, but even the parents were wild. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>So we shouldn’t be that surprised.</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If he weren’t crazy, people would still be interested in him, and maybe more so! And you can make all these alternative histories about him, but he made all the wrong decisions from the time he was a teenager and started doing <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-20/robert-kennedy-addict-reform-plans\">heavy drugs</a>. Even with the crazy stuff, up until the bear story and up until Kamala Harris came on the scene as the nominee, he was polling 10 percent in some states. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>The power of being a Kennedy!</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They’ve had great, great joys and great ecstasies and great triumphs, and then they’ve had just the worst tragedies. It is fascinating, I must say. Since we don’t have a royal family to watch and follow, we have the Kennedys. And they do keep producing interesting if sometimes bizarre figures.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In the space of about three years, essays have gone from a mainstay of classroom education everywhere to a much less useful tool, for one reason: ChatGPT. Estimates of how many students use ChatGPT for essays <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/16/about-1-in-5-us-teens-whove-heard-of-chatgpt-have-used-it-for-schoolwork/\">vary</a>, but it’s commonplace enough to <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/chatgpt-enters-classroom-teachers-weigh-pros-and-cons\">force teachers to adapt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While generative AI has many limitations, student essays fall into the category of services that they’re very good at: There are lots of examples of essays on the assigned topics in their training data, there’s demand for an enormous volume of such essays, and the standards for prose quality and original research in student essays are not all that high.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, cheating on essays via the use of AI tools is hard to catch. A number of tools advertise they can verify that text is AI-generated, but they’re <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/07/1067928/why-detecting-ai-generated-text-is-so-difficult-and-what-to-do-about-it/\">not very reliable</a>. Since <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17vy5tu/i_hate_ai_detection_software/\">falsely accusing students of plagiarism</a> is a big deal, these tools would have to be extremely accurate to work at all — and they simply aren’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>AI fingerprinting with technology</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is a technical solution here. Back in 2022, a team at OpenAI, led by quantum computing researcher <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6823\">Scott Aaronson</a>, developed a “watermarking” solution that makes AI text virtually unmistakable — even if the end user changes a few words here and there or rearranges text. The solution is a bit technically complicated, but bear with me, because it’s also very interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At its core, the way that AI text generation works is that the AI “guesses” a bunch of possible next tokens given what appears in a text so far. In order not to be overly predictable and produce the same repetitive output constantly, AI models don’t just guess the most probable token — instead, they include an element of randomization, favoring “more likely” completions but sometimes selecting a less likely one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The watermarking works at this stage. Instead of having the AI generate the next token according to random selection, it has the AI use a nonrandom process: favoring next tokens that get a high score in an internal “scoring” function OpenAI invented. It might, for example, favor words with the letter V just slightly, so that text generated with this scoring rule will have 20 percent more Vs than normal human text (though the actual scoring functions are more complicated than this). Readers wouldn’t normally notice this — in fact, I edited this newsletter to increase the number of Vs in it, and I doubt this variation in my normal writing stood out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, the watermarked text will not, at a glance, be different from normal AI output. But it would be straightforward for OpenAI, which knows the secret scoring rule, to evaluate whether a given body of text gets a much higher score on that hidden scoring rule than human-generated text ever would. If, for example, the scoring rule were my above example about the letter V, you could run this newsletter through a verification program and see that it has about 90 Vs in 1,200 words, more than you’d expect based on how often V is used in English. It’s a clever, technically sophisticated solution to a hard problem, and OpenAI has had a working prototype for <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6823\">two years</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So if we wanted to solve the problem of AI text masquerading as human-written text, it’s very much solvable. But OpenAI hasn’t released their watermarking system, nor has anyone else in the industry. Why not?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">It’s all about competition</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If OpenAI — and only OpenAI — released a watermarking system for ChatGPT, making it easy to tell when generative AI had produced a text, this wouldn’t affect student essay plagiarism in the slightest. Word would get out fast, and everyone would just switch over to one of the many AI options available today: Meta’s Llama, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini. Plagiarism would continue unabated, and OpenAI would lose a lot of its user base. So it’s not shocking that they would keep their watermarking system under wraps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a situation like this, it might seem appropriate for regulators to step in. If every generative AI system is required to have watermarking, then it’s not a competitive disadvantage. This is the logic behind a bill introduced this year in the California state Assembly, known as the <a href=\"https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab3211\">California Digital Content Provenance Standards</a>, which would require generative AI providers to make their AI-generated content detectable, along with requiring providers to label generative AI and remove deceptive content. OpenAI is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-supports-california-ai-bill-requiring-watermarking-synthetic-content-2024-08-26/\">in favor</a> of the bill — not surprisingly, as they’re the only generative AI provider known to have a system that does this. Their rivals are mostly opposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m broadly in favor of some kind of watermarking requirements for generative AI content. AI can be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/369502/chatgpt-ai-image-generator-regulation-debate\">incredibly useful</a>, but its productive uses don’t require it to pretend to be human-created. And while I don’t think it’s the place of government to ban newspapers from replacing us journalists with AI, I certainly don’t want outlets to misinform readers about whether the content they’re reading was <a href=\"https://futurism.com/advon-ai-content\">created by real humans</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though I’d like some kind of watermarking obligation, I am not sure it’s possible to implement. The best of the “open” AI models that have been released (like the latest Llama), models that you can run yourself on your own computer, are very high quality — certainly good enough for student essays. They’re already out there, and there’s no way to go back and add watermarking to them because anyone can run the current versions, whatever updates are applied in future versions. (This is among the many ways I have complicated feelings about open models. They enable an enormous amount of creativity, research, and discovery — and they also make it impossible to do all kinds of common-sense anti-impersonation or <a href=\"https://www.iwf.org.uk/about-us/why-we-exist/our-research/how-ai-is-being-abused-to-create-child-sexual-abuse-imagery/\">anti-child sexual abuse material</a> measures that we otherwise might really like to have.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So even though watermarking is possible, I don’t think we can count on it, which means we’ll have to figure out how to address the ubiquity of easy, AI-generated content as a society. Teachers are already switching to in-class essay requirements and other approaches to cut down on student cheating. We’re likely to see a switch away from college admissions essays as well — and, honestly, it’ll be good riddance, as those were probably <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/affirmative-action-supreme-court-college-admissions-essays-trauma/674314/\">never a good way to select students</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while I won’t mourn much over the college admissions essay, and while I think teachers are very much capable of finding better ways to assess students, I do notice some troubling trends in the whole saga. There was a simple way to let us harness the benefits of AI without obvious downsides like impersonation and plagiarism, yet AI development happened so fast that society more or less just let the opportunity pass us by. Individual labs could do it, but they won’t because it’d put them at a competitive disadvantage — and there isn’t likely to be a good way to make everyone do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the school plagiarism debate, the stakes are low. But the same dynamic reflected in the AI watermarking debate — where commercial incentives stop companies from self-regulating and the pace of change stops external regulators from stepping in until it’s too late — seems likely to remain as the stakes get higher.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

At least nine other people were injured. Prior to the shooting, Gray’s son had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/05/suspected-shooter-georgia-school-shooting-apalachee-high/\">struggled</a> with his mental health and had been “begging for help” for months, according to a statement his aunt gave the Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gray’s son had been the subject of a 2023 tip to the FBI over shooting threats he allegedly made in a Discord server, using an account name that appeared to reference the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23310544/moms-demand-action-shannon-watts-gun-control-sandy-hook\">Sandy Hook</a> school shooter. Police spoke to both father and son during the investigation. At the time, Gray had claimed his son, then 13, had no “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/apalachee-high-school-georgia-shooting.html\">unfettered</a>” access to weapons; he seemed skeptical that his son was behind the threats despite police tracing the account that made them to an email his son allegedly owned. The allegation was eventually found to be unsubstantiated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite this incident and despite having “knowledge he was a threat to himself and others,” just seven months after the FBI tip and investigation, Gray allegedly gave his son an AR-15-style rifle, according to Gray’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school-09-06-24#h_84015ae22e6921801926eda8a6f4678c\">arrest warrant</a>. Sources close to the investigation told CNN Gray had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school-09-06-24#h_adbca41ec4b74285deb938082540a669\">admitted</a> to giving the gift as a holiday present. In Georgia, it’s <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-school-shooting-gun/\">illegal</a> for a minor to buy a rifle but not illegal for them to possess one; had Gray not given his son a weapon, it likely would have impeded his son’s efforts to get one on his own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gray’s son was charged with four counts of felony murder and could receive additional charges. Gray faces <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-high-school-shooting-c3c97267a4dfff64a59e1605e515c2f9\">charges</a> of second-degree murder as well as involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children. Father and son were arraigned in court together on Friday morning in Barrow County. Neither asked for bond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If sentenced on the most serious charge of second-degree murder, Gray could be sentenced to between 10 and 30 years in prison; if convicted on every count, he could face up to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school-09-06-24#h_f7dd81373d23a1385b425ccec6e956e3\">180 years</a> in prison. His son’s charges carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison, possibly without parole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In both the Georgia and the Michigan cases, the alleged shooter’s parents ignored alarming warning signs and arguably enabled their son’s violence</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In separate trials held earlier this year, Jennifer and James Crumbley were each found guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter, after their son opened fire in the hallways of his school, Oxford High School, in Michigan on November 30, 2021 —&nbsp; just hours after school administrators had summoned the Crumbleys to campus in order to alert them that their son seemed to be having violent fantasies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The similarities between the Grays and the Crumbleys are eerie. In both cases, the parents allegedly ignored their son’s deteriorating mental health as well as signs he was experiencing violent fantasies. In both cases, the parents gifted their son a gun despite clear warning signs, and despite it being illegal in both states for minors to purchase the kinds of weapons they received. In both cases, authorities found evidence after the shooting that the shooter had <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/oxford-shooter-ethan-crumbleys-chilling-journal-entries-texts-reveal-twisted-fantasies\">kept writings</a> expressing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school-09-06-24#h_f0a7f213fd18b1f19af90463a49c8047\">violent ideation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prosecutors had argued in the Michigan case that the Crumbleys, both gun enthusiasts, enabled their son to commit the shooting in three key ways: by ignoring what should have been warning signs regarding his mental health, by purchasing a firearm they intended for him to own even though possession of such a firearm by a minor is illegal in Michigan, and by failing to secure the gun away from him — even after school officials alerted them to the problem just hours before the shooting took place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/us/jennifer-crumbley-trial-oxford-shooting.html\">months prior</a>, the Crumbleys’ son repeatedly asked his parents for help handling his mental health and showed signs of depression and mental illness. In texts sent to them, for example, he exhibited growing paranoia and complained multiple times of seeing ghosts or demons in their home when he was alone. The Crumbleys appeared to <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2024/01/30/jennifer-crumbley-ethan-text-messages-horror-movies/72409011007/\">ignore</a> or dismiss his concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Four days before the shooting, James Crumbley took his son with him to buy a gun that prosecutors argued they intended for their son’s personal use, despite his being under 18, the legal age for gun ownership in Michigan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two days before the shooting, after their son was disciplined at school for looking up bullets, his mother <a href=\"https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/oxford-high-school-shooting-ethan-crumbleys-phone-records-show-mother-ignored-texts-about-demons-ghosts\">joked</a> that he needed to “learn not.to.get caught.” The morning of the shooting, a teacher found disturbing violent gun fantasies the son had drawn, and the school summoned the parents for a conference to discuss their son’s concerning behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite these indicators, neither James nor Jennifer alerted the school to the fact they had just purchased a gun similar to the one shown in the drawing. They left him at the school and went back to their jobs, without returning home to make sure the gun was still secured. School administrators neglected to search the son’s backpack, where the gun was still hidden.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A few hours after this meeting, the Crumbleys received reports of the school shooting and immediately began frantically messaging him. “He must be the shooter,” Crumbley <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/jennifer-crumbley-mom-michigan-school-shooting-suspect-boss-text-messages/39027441\">texted</a> her boss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By then, however, it was too late to intervene.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April, the Crumbleys were each <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/james-crumbley-jennifer-crumbley-oxford-school-shooting-e5888f615c76c3b26153c34dc36d5436\">sentenced</a> to 10–15 years for their roles in the crime. Their son, who was 15 years old at the time of the shooting, was sentenced to life in prison without parole.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, the facts that led to the Crumbleys’ precedent-setting convictions seemed likely to limit that precedent’s reach. The case was so extraordinary that the possibility of it being repeated seemed rare. Another case, though, has emerged with the same hallmarks of parental negligence, arguable neglect, and a child whose alleged violent ideation went unchecked. There were additional stressors on Colin Gray&#8217;s son: The Grays were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school-09-06-24#h_f0a7f213fd18b1f19af90463a49c8047\">in contact</a> with local child protection services and had undergone a messy divorce prior to the shooting; his mother has an <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/school-shooting-suspects-mother-has-criminal-record-going-back-17-years/VZT5EIUGRJFM5OUQTW65MLEFMA/\">extensive criminal record</a> and, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/colt-gray-suspect-georgia-shooter/index.html\">according to</a> relatives, his father may have been emotionally and verbally abusive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The cases highlight the complex factors that lead to teen violence and the frustrating weaknesses of the systems that are meant to prevent it within a permissive gun culture.&nbsp;In the Crumbleys’ case, the school district failed to prevent the shooting, in part because they failed to search the shooter’s backpack to locate the gun he had with him the day of the shooting, but in large part due to his parents’ unconcern despite the school’s repeated attempts to alert them to their son’s escalating behavior. In the Grays’ case, law enforcement was unable to do anything about the online threats other than talking to Gray and his son — a conversation that apparently left no serious impression on the father, given his subsequent gun gift.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In sentencing the Crumbleys in April, Michigan Judge Cheryl Matthews <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/michigan-judge-hopes-sentences-for-james-and-jennifer-crumbley-parents-of-oxford-shooter-will-prevent-future-school-shootings/\">stated</a> she hoped the lengthy sentences they were given would prove a deterrent to future school shootings. While it’s impossible to know how many families heeded this warning and stepped in before their child escalated to violence, we now have yet one more example of a worst-case scenario: A father who didn’t just dismiss but allegedly enabled his son’s gun fixation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The decision to hold Gray responsible, not just for involuntary manslaughter but for second-degree murder, arguably reflects Georgia prosecutors’ belief that this shooting could have been prevented had the alleged shooter’s parents kept the weapon out of his hands. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\">384 mass shootings</a> in the US so far in 2024, a total that seems unthinkable — but a number that highlights the urgent need for parents to pay attention to warning signs before they escalate. Hopefully, in the wake of Gray’s arrest, even more parents will take notice.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The result was <a href=\"https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1830652074746409246\">an extended exercise in Nazi sympathizing</a> with little pushback from Carlson, who called Cooper (who tweets under the handle @martyrmade) “the most important popular historian working in the United States today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The interview poses a major test to the Republican Party.

The Trump camp —&nbsp;which sets the tone for the entire party — has so far done nothing to distance itself from the increasingly toxic Carlson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance, who has pre-taped a Carlson interview and is scheduled to speak with him at a live event in two weeks, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/jd-vance-stands-by-tucker-carlson-amid-hitler-and-holocaust-whitewash/\">refused to denounce Carlson</a> after the Cooper fiasco — with a spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/politics/jd-vance-tucker-carlson-darryl-cooper.html\">saying in a statement</a>&nbsp; that “Senator Vance doesn’t believe in guilt-by-association cancel culture.” A Trump campaign source <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/jd-vance-has-become-trumps-human\">told the Bulwark</a> that while it’s “not ideal timing” for Vance to appear twice with Carlson before Election Day, “it is what it is.” (Donald Trump Jr. is also scheduled to attend.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nobody should be surprised the current GOP is failing this particular test. This is the party that renominated Trump after all that he’s done; if there are red lines left for them, it’s not obvious what they are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more interesting is the reaction among conservative-aligned commentators and intellectuals —&nbsp;many of whom are expressing shock at what Tucker had done.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Didn&#8217;t expect Tucker Carlson to become an outlet for Nazi apologetics, but here we are,” radio host <a href=\"https://x.com/EWErickson/status/1830978780007145967\">Erick Erickson wrote on X</a>. The writer Sohrab Ahmari, who <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-courage-of-tucker-carlson/\">wrote a tribute to his “friend” Carlson</a> after his April 2023 firing from Fox, tweeted <a href=\"https://x.com/SohrabAhmari/status/1831366109192450559\">on Wednesday</a> that he “can’t get over … the fact that Tucker saw fit to lend [Cooper] an uncritical platform.” (Elon Musk tweeted the Carlson interview approvingly — only to delete the tweet later.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such expressions of shock feel absurd. For Carlson’s entire run on Fox News, liberals had been warning that his show had become a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/us/tucker-carlson-gop-republican-party.html\">vector for racist and neo-Nazi ideas</a> —&nbsp;while people on the right dismissed those concerns as the woke PC police trying to silence a prominent conservative voice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The liberal position has now been proven correct — yet again. The only question is whether conservatives will learn a broader lesson about how far-right ideas infiltrate their movement —&nbsp;with their own tacit support.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why liberals got Carlson right —&nbsp;and conservatives got him so wrong</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Tucker Carlson got a primetime spot on Fox News back in 2016, he immediately developed a fan base among the neo-Nazi right. They saw his bombastic style and his willingness to talk about race and immigration in ways many conservatives shied away from as a vehicle for bringing their own ideas into the mainstream.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Tucker Carlson is literally our greatest ally,” Andrew Anglin, the publisher of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, wrote in 2016. “I don’t believe that he doesn’t hate the Jews.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carlson did quite a bit to merit this fan base. He worked assiduously to <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/white-supremacists-applaud-tucker-carlsons-promotion-replacement-theory\">mainstream the idea of the “great replacement theory,</a>” the white supremacist idea that mass immigration is a secret elite plot to replace the native-born whites with minorities. He took white nationalists’ false ideas about a “white genocide” in South Africa and brought it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/23/white-farmers-trump-south-africa-tucker-carlson-far-right-influence\">to then-President Donald Trump’s attention</a>. He claimed that immigrants were making America “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/18/tucker-carlson-immigrants-poorer-dirtier-advertisers-pull-out\">dirtier</a>” and fearmongered about the alleged threat to America from “<a href=\"https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/887115275249885184?lang=en\">gypsies</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The link between Carlson and the radical right was quite direct. In 2020, his head writer Blake Neff resigned after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/media/tucker-carlson-writer-blake-neff/index.html\">CNN reported</a> that he had made racist and sexist comments on an anonymous web forum. In 2022, the New York Times reported that Carlson’s segments were at times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/us/tucker-carlson-gop-republican-party.html\">directly inspired</a> by stories published by racist and neo-Nazi websites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carlson got away with all of this by employing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/5/4/23709550/tucker-carlson-fox-news-white-men-text-racism\">a very clever rhetorical trick</a>. He would recast white nationalist talking points in nominally colorblind terms — giving his audience permission to think racist thoughts while still thinking of themselves as not racist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When he talked about the “great replacement,” for example, he would always shy away from saying the problem was the race of the immigrants. Rather, it was they were pliant voters for the Democratic Party who would undermine everything that “legacy Americans” held dear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Everyone wants to make a racial issue out of it. Oh, you know, the ‘white replacement theory’? No, no, this is a voting rights question,” <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/tucker-carlson-laughs-at-hysterical-critics-of-his-replacement-comments-rails-against-demographic-change-on-his-show/\">Carlson said</a> in a 2021 segment. “I have less political power because they’re importing a brand-new electorate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This move provided just enough plausible deniability that both Fox and the broader conservative movement could hail Carlson as one of their brightest stars: not merely one commentator, but the highest-rated host on cable news. It wasn’t until texts surfaced in 2023 showing Tucker himself engaging in naked racism — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/5/4/23709550/tucker-carlson-fox-news-white-men-text-racism\">praising the superior honor of “white men”</a> —&nbsp;that Fox finally felt the need to cut ties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Liberals easily saw through the charade: They knew who Carlson was and what he was doing the whole time. But conservatives took Carlson’s professions of innocence seriously, at least in public. They said that he was merely skewering the pieties of the left, not engaging in thinly veiled white supremacist apologia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no better example of this than <a href=\"https://www.jns.org/tucker-carlson-and-the-turning-point-for-right-wing-antisemitism/\">a recent column by Jonathan Tobin</a>, the former executive editor of Commentary magazine and current editor-in-chief of the conservative Jewish News Syndicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the column, Tobin expresses horror with Carlson’s interview with Cooper — saying it is “now incumbent on all decent people, and especially those on the right, to demand that Carlson no longer be treated as a mainstream figure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet in the <em>very same column</em>, he praises Carlson’s show on Fox as emblematic of mainstream conservative opinion:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his seven-year run on Fox, Carlson built an enormous following. It might well be said that during the Black Lives Matter summer of 2020, he became the tribune of contemporary conservatism with his articulate critique of the moral panic that swept the nation in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers and the “mostly peaceful” riots that ensued. Though his soft spot for tinfoil-hat controversies was no secret, such as his fascination with UFO conspiracy theories, his main focus was on the issues that most conservatives and many centrists cared about, such as illegal immigration, critical race theory indoctrination, and corrupt liberal elites that seek to squelch opposition to their continued hold on power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite everything, Tobin is still completely blind to what Carlson was doing on Fox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He seems to believe that Fox was effectively concealing Tucker’s true views, when in actuality it was helping him broadcast them in a slightly coded manner. This was so obvious that Carlson’s neo-Nazi fans openly bragged about it, and had been doing so since 2016. And yet Tobin singles out Carlson’s treatment of race and immigration — of all subjects! — as the areas where his Fox show best represented mainstream conservatism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the problem in a nutshell. On the right today, you can say something extremely racist and get away with it so long as you say “I’m not a racist!” in the following sentence. Liberals have long pointed out the problem with this maneuver; in response, conservatives have accused them of acting like woke scolds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carlson’s descent into Holocaust revisionism has proven the problem with this permission structure. The question is whether any others will learn their lessons&nbsp;— or whether, like Tobin, they will continue to engage in a form of thinking that allows their movement to be penetrated by bigots.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

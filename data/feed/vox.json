Now, they hope, the party has a nominee who can take the fight to Trump — and win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These hopes are not yet supported by polling data, which currently shows Harris on track to lose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s approval rating is not good (38 percent approval, 50 percent disapproval in <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">FiveThirtyEight’s average</a>). She trails Trump by about 2 points nationally, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">on average</a>, and the <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/arizona/harris-trump-arizona/\">few</a> <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/michigan/harris-trump-michigan/\">public</a> <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/arizona/harris-trump-arizona/\">polls</a> <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/georgia/harris-trump-georgia/\">pitting</a> her against Trump in swing states nearly all show her behind, sometimes behind by a lot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, maybe those polls aren’t worth much since voters haven’t truly gotten to know Harris. Maybe she’ll wage a smart, vigorous campaign and win them over. Maybe the excitement her selection brings to the ticket will supercharge enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maybe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris also has some very real weaknesses as a candidate that could turn things the other way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Namely, she will be attacked as a San Francisco liberal elite. She will be held responsible for the Biden administration’s record rather than being able to have a clean slate. And her stint at the top of national politics has had its fair share of gaffes and reported staff turmoil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(Her race and gender will also be factors shaping how she is perceived, but they are not reasons to assume that she cannot win. And it’s worth evaluating her record, as well as her political persona, on their own terms.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has his own serious weaknesses, and it’s certainly possible that Harris could win. But she doesn’t start off as the favorite, and she has some real work to do.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris will be attacked as a San Francisco liberal elite</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement of Harris was met with tremendous excitement from Democrats’ donor base, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/harris-fundraising-biden-actblue.html\">$81 million</a> pouring into the campaign’s coffers in less than 24 hours. Anecdotally, I’ve heard tremendous optimism from people in my (educated coastal urban) circles that Harris will be a far superior candidate to Biden. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, if the presidential election was conducted among educated coastal urbanites, Harris would surely win in a walk. But in reality, a winning candidate needs the votes of other demographics too, including from some people who don’t like educated coastal urbanites very much. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps the biggest electoral story of the past decade has been the phenomenon of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/10/01/understanding-electorate-diploma-divide/\">education polarization</a>, in which college-educated voters have been trending increasingly toward Democrats while non-college voters have been moving more toward the GOP. These shifts were arguably decisive in tipping key Midwestern swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — toward Trump in 2016. Biden — “Joe from Scranton” — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/5/10/22425178/catalist-report-2020-election-biden-trump-demographics\">reversed them a bit</a> in 2020, just enough to eke out an Electoral College win. Notably, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/us/politics/how-college-graduates-vote.html\">Trump made significant gains</a> among voters of color without degrees that year, and 2024 polling has suggested these trends could continue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the reason for this, some Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html\">have argued</a>, is that their national party has lost the ability to communicate to non-college voters, that the party’s donor and staffer class are so dominated by the educated coastal elite that they no longer speak the same “language” as swing-state voters and their values have dramatically diverged from them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is extremely good at speaking the language of Democrats’ upscale voter base. That is how she rose in blue San Francisco and California politics, and that is why there was initial enthusiasm for her 2020 presidential campaign. It’s also a main reason why, after that campaign flopped, she still got picked as Biden’s running mate (Biden’s campaign was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/12/joe-biden-fundraising-394488\">similarly flooded with donations</a> after her selection).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But can she convince Midwestern swing voters she’s on their side, that she doesn’t view them as “<a href=\"https://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/\">deplorables</a>,” that she’s not some out-of-touch San Francisco liberal extremist? Can she “speak” swing voter in a convincing way? We simply don’t know yet. While she has made some campaign appearances in swing states, doing so as the nominee means she&#8217;ll be in the spotlight in a new way, with much higher stakes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris will have to defend the Biden administration’s unpopular record</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s probably unfair to put too much blame on Harris for her low approval numbers when their main cause is likely that she is part of the Biden-Harris administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if most Americans are not happy with the administration Harris has been a part of, that will be a problem for her candidacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the effort to push Biden off the ticket, there’s been a tendency among Democrats (who generally believe Biden has done a good job) to blame his political woes on his age rather than his record. They theorize that the policies have been good but there’s been a communication problem in explaining how good they are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling, though, has been pretty consistent that the American public believes the administration has handled <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/issues\">major issues poorly</a> — most notably the economy, immigration, and foreign policy, with voters <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-leads-biden-double-digits-three-key-issues-pew-research-survey\">consistently saying</a> Trump would do a better job on all three issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris was not personally responsible for policy on inflation, the border, the Afghanistan withdrawal, or the Israel-Gaza war. (Republicans have falsely called her the “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc\">border czar</a>,” when Harris was in fact tasked with the much more limited role of addressing “root causes” of unauthorized immigration abroad.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s true that Harris has staunchly defended the administration’s policies on these issues. It will be tough for her to criticize any decision (since doing so would raise the question of why she didn’t criticize it earlier). And it will be hard for her to make the case that she’d do things all that differently from Biden, considering she’s already been vice president for four years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, when a new nominee runs for president, they get to offer idealistic promises of change and break with how the incumbent has been doing things in areas where the public wants change. That will be difficult for Harris. She does not start with a clean slate; she is burdened by what has been. And the public is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx\">not happy</a> with how things have been under Biden.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris has had a tumultuous political history in national politics</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there is the question of whether Harris will be able to run an effective and successful presidential campaign. There’s an idealized, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">meme-worthy</a> image of Harris’s political appeal that has spread among Democrats eager to turn the page on Biden, but her track record at the top of national politics has been more mixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That began with her 2020 presidential campaign, which actually ended in December 2019. There is no shame in running in your party’s presidential primary and losing. Not every defeat is the candidate’s “fault” rather than a reflection of larger circumstances. A loss can position a candidate well for success next time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris’s campaign was chock-full of public missteps and reports of behind-the-scenes chaos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She had one viral moment in which she <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18932212/joe-biden-kamala-harris-desegregate-busing\">confronted Joe Biden</a> about his historic opposition to busing policy on the debate stage, but days after, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/harris-clarifies-stance-on-federally-mandated-school-busing\">she acknowledged</a> that her views on what busing policy should currently be weren’t any different from Biden’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris also <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18919494/democratic-debate-2019-kamala-harris-healthcare-policy\">struggled to answer questions</a> about her health care policy, at times seeming to support a version of Medicare-for-all that eliminates private health insurance and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/20/20813658/kamala-harris-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-2020\">at other times</a> saying she supported no such thing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Internally, her campaign “became a hotbed of drama and backbiting,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/kamala-harris-2020-campaign/index.html\">according to CNN</a>, with finger-pointing leaks from rival factions constantly spilling out. She gave her sister Maya a key role, and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html\">New York Times reported</a> that “one campaign strategist said it was impossible to tell if Maya Harris was speaking for herself, as an adviser, or as her sister’s representative.” But in both of those stories, sources argued that the candidate’s own strategic indecisiveness was perhaps the campaign’s biggest problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this prevented Biden from picking her as his running mate in 2020. Then, early in his term, a similar story unfolded in the vice president’s office. In a high-profile interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in June 2021, Harris <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html\">struggled</a> to answer questions about the administration’s border policy, and claimed “we’ve been to the border” even though she had not. Afterward, she clamped down on her interview availability, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html\">reportedly</a> for fear of making further gaffes. (Amid all the scrutiny on Biden for doing few high-profile interviews, it’s worth noting that Harris hasn’t exactly been ubiquitous either.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/04/kamala-harris-staff-departures/\">story</a> after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html\">story</a> told of staff chaos in and departures from Harris’s office. A former aide offered scathing comments <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/04/kamala-harris-staff-departures/\">to the Washington Post</a>: “It’s clear that you’re not working with somebody who is willing to do the prep and the work. &#8230; With Kamala you have to put up with a constant amount of soul-destroying criticism and also her own lack of confidence. So you’re constantly sort of propping up a bully and it’s not really clear why.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be sure, Donald Trump’s staff drama in his campaigns and White House was far more intense (and it didn’t prevent him from winning in 2016). And reports of feuding in Harris’s office <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/12/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-party/index.html\">have lessened</a> in the past year or so; perhaps Harris has found advisers with whom she is more comfortable. But now she’s suddenly back in the spotlight, and the pressure is on. So now the question is will she rise to the challenge, overseeing and implementing a strategy and team that can win?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris is the underdog — but she<em> could</em> win</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this means that Harris absolutely cannot win.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problems above may be serious challenges for her campaign. And yes, she currently trails in the polls. But challenges can be addressed and polls can change. The election is more than three months away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s opponent, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/\">is also unpopular</a>. Democrats hope she can lean on her past as a former prosecutor to “prosecute” the case against him. Trump’s performance in the first debate was no great shakes; he may compare unfavorably to Harris in another — if he agrees to do it (and if he doesn’t, she can criticize him for that).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris will indeed energize the liberal base, and perhaps she’ll be more appealing to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/05/nx-s1-4987296/young-voters-biden-gaza-inflation-abortion-trump-genforward-poll\">young voters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/30/biden-black-voters-00160520\">Black voters</a>, who Biden has struggled with. She clearly has more energy and ability to campaign than Biden has had to this point. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if the past month should tell us anything, it’s that the future of politics is never set in stone. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Democrats appear to be rallying around Biden’s preferred successor, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee\">Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, and it seems likely that she’ll be the presidential nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here are seven questions answered about what needs to happen before Harris can become the nominee, what an open process for selecting Democrats’ next presidential candidate might look like, and what’s next for Harris and her party.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) <strong>Will Harris automatically replace Biden as the Democratic nominee?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is not officially the Democrats’ nominee; the endorsement of the Democratic Party’s leader isn’t enough. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has acknowledged this and said that she intends to <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1815122383415529963\">“earn and win this nomination</a>.” While there is still technically a chance that she will not become the nominee, she has already locked in endorsements she needs to make it unlikely that anyone will credibly challenge her. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She has been endorsed by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-50-democratic-party-us-state-chairs-back-harris-sources-2024-07-21/\">all 50 Democratic state party chairs</a>, party leaders including <a href=\"https://x.com/axios/status/1815439766155874376\">former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, and many of her would-be Democratic rivals.

That means the nominee may be selected before nearly 4,000 delegates gather at the convention beginning August 19. Typically, delegates formally vote for the winner of the party’s primaries to be the official nominee at the convention — a process that recently played out at last week’s Republican National Convention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These delegates are party loyalists — everyone from poll workers to elected officials — and are allocated to every state or territory by the party. They are pledged to the candidate who wins their state’s primary, but they can theoretically deviate from that under the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/07/12/biden-delegates-good-conscience-convention/76c735d2-4092-11ef-83bf-e35a32077d3e_story.html\">DNC’s rules</a>, which state that they “shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden won over 3,800 of those delegates in the Democratic primary. They will now be released and allowed to vote for whichever candidate they wish. As of Monday afternoon, Harris had already secured the endorsement of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/ap-dnc-delegate-survey/\">1,1152</a> of the 1,986 delegates she would need to win the nomination.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) <strong>How will DNC delegates choose a nominee to replace Biden?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">State delegations will need to decide among themselves who they will back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, of those that have convened in the hours since Biden announced he was dropping out, many seem to be coalescing around Harris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When elaborating on their reasoning, many delegates have cited the fact that voters in their state <a href=\"https://x.com/edewittNH/status/1815192248209830243\">already backed the Biden-Harris ticket in the Democratic primary</a> and that she is qualified to carry the torch forward. In that sense, they see themselves as keeping the will of Democratic voters, but they are not directly soliciting new input from voters — at least not formally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4) <strong>What happens at the Democratic National Convention?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before Biden dropped out, the DNC had <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360917/biden-trump-harris-dnc-delegates\">planned a virtual roll call</a> to lock up the nomination before the convention. The DNC adopted the virtual procedure during the pandemic when the roll call — which would normally happen in person at the convention and in which delegates formally announce their votes and select their nominee — had to happen remotely.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats may now decide to hold a similar meeting before the convention and, if a majority of delegates support Harris, her nomination would be secured. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If not, then the matter could go to a technically open convention, which hasn’t happened since 1968. In every election since 1968, the convention has been about rallying around the nominee, rather than selecting them. But Harris has already secured the endorsements of so many delegates that it seems unlikely she would face any real competition at the convention or that an open convention would be nearly as contentious as 1968 was.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5) <strong>What is an open convention?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An open convention simply means one in which delegates hash out who the nominee will be. That’s a process more akin to how presidents used to be picked, but one that fell out of style following a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24034712/iowa-caucuses-history-first-gop-primary-2024\">Democratic convention meltdown in 1968</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since then, the process has been: Every state has a primary, many of them fairly early in the presidential cycle, and then the convention is held to certify the will of voters through a ceremonial nomination process that energizes the party ahead of Election Day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That can’t happen this time, but something like it might. An open convention doesn’t seem likely at this point, given how quickly Harris has rallied delegates in her favor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, on the off chance it does happen, here’s how an open convention would work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big thing to know is the process would unfold with delegates voting on the convention floor for the candidate they support as the nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A candidate would need a majority of the pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. If no candidate achieves this majority, then the convention would move to additional ballots, where delegates continue to vote until someone emerges as the winner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/open-convention-democrats-biden-drop-out/\">749 superdelegates</a>, who are high-profile party leaders ranging from members of Congress to former presidents. If they voted in a block, they could quickly help end the process by coalescing around one candidate (presumably Harris). However, they cannot vote on the first ballot at the convention. They participate in voting only if the convention goes to a second ballot or beyond.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6) <strong>What is the timeline for this process?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s up in the air for now, but the DNC’s meeting on Wednesday will be livestreamed. The rules committee is expected to lay out a timeline around then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7) <strong>So, can Kamala Harris go ahead and campaign?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris can start campaigning immediately. Indeed, she has already hit the ground running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out\">draw from Biden’s $240 million in campaign cash</a> because she was already on the Biden-Harris ticket. Unless they could self-fund their campaign, any other Democrat would face a steep uphill battle to counter the kind of resources currently behind Harris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DNC might not be able to officially support her until she secures the nomination, but that creates an imperative for the party to act quickly in deciding on a nominee. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Following Judge Beverly Cannone’s declaration of a mistrial, the prosecution immediately vowed to pursue a retrial; the second trial is <a href=\"https://people.com/karen-reads-new-trial-date-set-8681424\">currently scheduled</a> to begin in late January 2025. That likely means heightened public interest and further entrenchment of the bitter camps in this case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prosecution alleges that Read, a successful finance analyst and adjunct professor who’s far from the “typical” murder suspect, killed her boyfriend, 46-year-old Boston police officer John O’Keefe, in the early, snowy morning hours of January 29, 2022. According to prosecutors, Read, who stood trial for second-degree murder and manslaughter, deliberately backed into O’Keefe with her SUV while she was intoxicated, then drove home, leaving him lying in the cold. O’Keefe <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/karen-read-trial-john-okeefe-death-what-know-rcna155905\">died from</a> blunt force trauma and hypothermia. But at trial, things were anything but clear; <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-juror-unanimous-verdict-not-guilty/\">reports indicate</a> the jury would have unanimously acquitted Read on charges of murder and leaving the scene, but were torn on the lesser charges, with a “soft” 9-3 split in favor of conviction for manslaughter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among the main pieces of evidence in the state’s favor: Read herself asking various witnesses, “Could I have hit him?” the next morning, after awakening and returning to the house to look for him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read, on the other hand, alleges that she’s been framed, in a spiraling conspiracy that began with a party full of witnesses lying about what happened and soon encompassed the entire Boston Police Department (BPD) and the prosecutor’s office. While from one standpoint, Read’s defense may be grasping at straws in its attempt to paint the case as a frame-up, from another, it’s the kind of police work Bostonians — and those in other cities across the country — have come to expect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The trial has developed from what initially seemed to investigators like an open-and-shut case into a reckoning with a criminal justice system the public no longer trusts.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The murky facts of the case</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read claims that after she and O’Keefe spent until <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/10/karen-read-murder-trial-day-9-a-full-day-of-new-witnesses/\">around midnight</a> drinking at a local bar, she dropped O’Keefe off to hang out at the home of retired BPD officer Brian Albert. Several people who were either members of the BPD or affiliated with the local justice system were also at the house, but no one who was there corroborates her story. Not one of them says they saw O’Keefe enter the building; instead, they all claim they had no idea O’Keefe had even arrived at the house until his body was located outside of it in the snow the next morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read, however, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZvaqbbul6o\">maintains</a> that she watched O’Keefe go into the house before she left the scene. She alleges that O’Keefe must have been injured inside the house, that the partygoers staged the crime scene to look like a hit-and-run, and that they have lied about it ever since. Her defense argues that the injuries O’Keefe sustained resulted from a physical fight and a dog attack from a German shepherd mix Albert owned.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The defense alleges the investigation was hindered from the start by a failure to treat the Albert house as a possible crime scene and a failure to treat the witnesses as possible persons of interest; <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/karen-read-officer-death-boston-officer-testimony-298b2aa70e1b6d8b13cc556daf3b4b0c\">two</a> of the primary investigative team members also have <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-day-13/3371005/\">personal links</a> to the witnesses. Further undermining the police were the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/police-red-plastic-cups-collect-204315489.html\">bizarre methods</a> they used, including using leaf blowers to clear away snow (and potentially evidence) at the crime scene, and using <a href=\"https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-items-police-used-scene-john-okeefes-death-canton-shown-court/L7ZEE2HGAVEU5NKMINUYB6KJWQ/\">solo cups and grocery bags</a> to collect evidence. Add to that a parade of unprofessional conduct and comments from officers, particularly from a lead investigator <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/\">who was fired</a> immediately after the mistrial, and the case has morphed into a genuine public scandal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the investigation and the widely publicized trial, a highly vocal contingent of supporters from Boston and beyond have made Read into a true crime cause célèbre; one <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/809459493961162/\">Facebook group</a> supporting her has over 50,000 members. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/351238/serial-true-crime-podcast-criminal-justice-adnan-syed\">a decade of thriving interest in true crime</a>, trial-watchers are hyper-vigilant to potential injustices and the shortcomings of law enforcement. In the eyes of many, the case has become a referendum on corrupt cops — a subject Bostonians <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/investigations/cdl-bribery-scheme-is-one-of-several-recent-misconduct-cases-plaguing-mass-state-police/3263475/\">know</a> all too well after decades of police misconduct ranging from <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/mass-state-trooper-ordered-to-falsify-records-cleared-of-wrongdoing/1959608/\">cover-ups</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/ex-head-of-mass-state-police-union-gets-prison-for-fraud-racketeering/3042305/\">kickbacks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read’s relentless conspiracy defense has been driven by incendiary star lawyer Alan Jackson, a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2013-feb-06-la-me-jackson-20130207-story.html\">former prosecutor</a> turned defense attorney who’s defended both <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24144453/harvey-weinstein-overturned-conviction-explained-eliza-orlins-molineaux-rule-sandoval\">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/3/16602628/kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-allegations-house-of-cards\">Kevin Spacey</a>. O’Keefe, the victim, has been fully overshadowed by the conversation around the case, with Read’s supporters <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-aidan-kearney-turtleboy-canton-massachusetts/\">allegedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.courttv.com/title/okeefe-family-reportedly-being-harassed-by-read-supporters/\">harassing</a> his family members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This polarization outside of the courtroom seems to have been reflected in the jury. After deliberating for less than a week, the jury tried repeatedly to declare themselves deadlocked to Judge Cannone, sending her notes to that effect. “We find ourselves deeply divided by fundamental differences in our opinions and state of mind,” a note from the day of the mistrial <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-deadlocked-jury-note/3415285/\">read</a>, citing “deeply held convictions that each of us carry, ultimately leading to a point where consensus is unattainable.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A deadlocked or hung jury results in a mistrial, after which the prosecution has to decide whether to retry the case. In this case, the prosecution seems intent on a retrial — despite the many, many problems with their arguments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The prosecution’s case is a circumstantial mess</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite presenting over 70 witnesses at trial, the prosecution’s primary evidence against Read remains largely circumstantial — meaning there’s very little direct or physical evidence backing their theory of what happened — and Read’s defense has offered up alternative theories for much of it. The timeline of the evening goes like this: After leaving a bar in Canton, Massachusetts, Read — whose blood alcohol content was likely <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/\">over</a> the legal limit — drove O’Keefe to Albert’s house. There, she either saw him safely inside or backed over him in the snow. In either event, she left the scene and drove home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Afterward, she left him an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-27/\">angry voicemail</a> declaring, “John, I fucking hate you.” Throughout the night, <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/20/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-thursday-june-20/\">Read called</a> O’Keefe and numerous other people. Early the next morning, she met up with two friends, including major prosecution witness Jennifer McCabe, who is also Albert’s sister-in-law, and drove back to Albert’s house, where they discovered O’Keefe in the snow. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/\">According to witnesses</a>, Read repeatedly asked whether O’Keefe could have been hit by a snow plow, or whether she could have hit him. Multiple first responders <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-massachusetts-murder-trial/\">also testified</a> to hearing Read repeatedly exclaiming that she hit him, though none of them <a href=\"https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/court-video-updates-karen-read-murder-trial-continues-with-more-first-responder-testimony/CINVO2VGPJCVDF6JDAPI3VJ6PU/\">noted this</a> in their <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/karen-read-trial-day-2-witness-testimony-continues/3354128/\">initial reports</a> from the scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This alleged repeated refrain of, “Could I have hit him?” and “I hit him,” was one the prosecution <a href=\"https://www.wcvb.com/article/i-hit-him-prosecution-quotes-testimony-in-closing-argument-for-karen-read-case/61367569\">leaned on heavily</a> as an argument for guilt. However, per witness accounts, Read also appeared to have no clear idea what had happened to O’Keefe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What concrete evidence the prosecution did offer was hotly contested inside as well as outside the courtroom. One crucial piece: a broken taillight. An investigator who interviewed Read at her parents&#8217; house that night <a href=\"https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html\">reported</a> seeing “some damage” to the right rear light of Read’s SUV; he testified that it was allegedly “cracked and a piece was missing.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly three weeks after O’Keefe’s death, the state’s lead investigator, Michael Proctor, <a href=\"https://www.courttv.com/title/scientist-compares-plastic-tail-light-pieces-in-karen-read-trial/\">allegedly located</a> more fragments of a tail light at the crime scene and transported the evidence to the crime lab. <a href=\"https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html\">Prosecutors say</a> they found minute traces of O’Keefe’s DNA on those fragments, as well as tiny particles from the tail light on some of O’Keefe’s clothes. Yet the defense hammered home the enormous delay in locating what would have been an incredibly significant piece of evidence, as well as the unreliability of evidence suddenly unearthed by Proctor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s because Proctor has multiple personal ties to both the victim and the witnesses. In texts he sent a day after the investigation began, he used a <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/\">misogynistic slur</a> to refer to Read, made it clear he thought Read’s guilt was obvious from the beginning, and even <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-live-stream-michael-proctor/\">texted</a> his sister that he hoped Read would kill herself. The defense alleges Proctor helped frame Read for the murder, deliberately damaging her tail light in order to claim the damage was caused when she hit O’Keefe with her car. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.wcvb.com/article/karen-read-trial-mirrored-video-evidence-impact/61041808\">a mysteriously altered video</a> of Read’s car that purportedly showed the damage made it all the way to trial before the defense pointed out that the image was misleadingly reversed — a “mirror” video with the tail light in question inverted from its actual position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It doesn’t help any of these optics that Proctor’s sister <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/\">texted him</a> that Albert’s wife Julie wanted to send Proctor “a gift” after the investigation was over. Proctor protested on the stand that none of these texts impacted the integrity of the police investigation, but given Monday’s mistrial, some jurors may have disagreed with him. They evidently weren’t alone: State police announced that they had <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/\">fired Proctor</a> immediately after the mistrial based on “information about serious misconduct [that] emerged in testimony” — an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/10/19/21523030/police-unions-misconduct-accountability-brutality-massachusetts-reform-violence\">extraordinarily rare move</a> on their part.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other facts of the case that on their surface might have supported the prosecution proved murkier on closer inspection. O’Keefe died of blunt-force trauma from a skull fracture and hypothermia, according to the medical examiner. He also had <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/19/metro/karen-read-trial-what-does-the-forensic-evidence-say/\">gashes on his arms</a> that seemed unlikely to have been made from a car impact. The defense alleged these resulted from a dog attack on O’Keefe inside the house. O’Keefe also <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/karen-reads-boyfriend-john-okeefe-had-no-broken-bones-doctor-reveals\">lacked</a> many of the injuries you’d expect to see from a car impact, such as broken bones or significant bruises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prosecution’s witnesses are also controversial. In addition to Read&#8217;s former friend McCabe, who had ties to both O’Keefe and the Alberts, the party attendees included several people that Read’s defense argued should have been investigated by police before taking the stand. Among them: Brian Higgins, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who’d been <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/05/24/karen-read-trial-brian-higgins-flirty-texts-kiss/\">sporadically flirting</a> with Read in the lead-up to O’Keefe’s death, and Albert’s son Colin, who as a teenager had made <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-murder-trial-day-13/\">violent threats against other teens</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of the witnesses who were at the party, including McCabe and the Alberts, exchanged a litany of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-irresolvable-tragedy-of-the-karen-read-case\">phone calls to one another</a> throughout the time O’Keefe supposedly lay on the lawn, per phone records. Several later <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/why-so-many-butt-dials-who-called-who-and-when-in-the-karen-read-case/3384232/\">testified</a> that the calls were “butt dials,” placed randomly and by complete mistake. As circumstances go, it’s eyebrow-raising, to say the least.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The defense’s evidence is equally unreliable</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite all the problems with the prosecution’s case, the strongest evidence for the defense is likewise fully debatable. One of the defense’s key witnesses was a veteran snowplow driver who made multiple trips past the Alberts’ house during the time O’Keefe was allegedly wounded in the snow, yet <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-28/\">claimed</a> he saw no body lying anywhere on the lawn. However, snow impedes visibility, even with a bright snowplow light, and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/\">eyewitness testimony</a> is notoriously unreliable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another piece of crucial evidence that many Read supporters consider a “smoking gun” for the defense has also been fully debunked by prosecution analysts. At issue: <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-day-16-jennifer-mccabe/\">Two searches</a> McCabe made on her cellphone at some point during the early morning hours surrounding O’Keefe’s death, including a misspelled query, “Hos long to die in cold.” The prosecution claims, and McCabe testified, that she made the searches around six in the morning when she and Read found O’Keefe lying in the snow. The official cellphone records for the search, however, show the <a href=\"https://x.com/bostonherald/status/1793566054066569408\">timestamp</a> for the search at 2:27 am.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The implication is that if McCabe searched for this then, she was part of a conspiracy to stage the scene and frame Read. But McCabe claims she merely opened that tab on her phone browser at 2:27 am, left it open, and searched the phrase hours later, after she and Read found him together. Multiple data analysts for the prosecution <a href=\"https://whdh.com/news/state-police-troopers-digital-forensic-expert-testify-as-karen-read-murder-trial-continues/\">corroborated</a> this interpretation of the cellphone data. Still, the defense scored a point in their favor by <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/21/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-friday-june-21/\">noting</a> that their expert witness, who argued the search occurred at 2:27, arrived at his conclusion by using a method developed by one of the prosecution’s witnesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other findings that leaned toward the defense included O’Keefe’s fitness tracker app, which showed him taking about 80 steps around the time Reed claimed she dropped him off. Yet here again, nothing about the timeline or O’Keefe’s activity is clear or corroborated by witnesses. The defense’s argument that O’Keefe was attacked inside the house, including by the family dog, is also speculative and unsupported by much evidence — which they claim is because the police never properly investigated. A medical expert <a href=\"https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-will-judge-allow-testimony-doctor-who-believes-okeefe-was-attacked-by-dog/67PPY2IWJ5DZTMVTK46CLMGEOE/\">testified</a> on the stand in support of the dog bite theory, but forensic bite mark evidence is incredibly unreliable and has been more or less <a href=\"https://www.todaysrdh.com/the-unreliability-of-bitemark-evidence-implications-for-forensic-odontology-in-legal-proceedings/\">fully debunked</a>, at least in cases involving humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So where does all of this leave us?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Corruption at the core</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ironically, outrage for the police’s conduct in this case has united Bostonians across political lines, with <a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/04/as-jurors-are-empaneled-at-karen-reads-trial-her-supporters-gather-at-a-distance.html\">community activists</a> joining the likes of local conservative pundit <a href=\"https://wrko.iheart.com/featured/the-howie-carr-show/content/2024-06-20-1270-the-howie-carr-radio-netw-meatball-morrisseys-revenge-messages-against/\">Howie Carr</a>. Meanwhile, hundreds of Read supporters traveled from <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/free-karen-read-supporters-murder-trial-dedham-court/\">across the country</a> to protest for her freedom outside the courthouse. They sometimes clashed with O’Keefe’s family and their&nbsp;supporters, who <a href=\"https://www.wcvb.com/article/tensions-run-high-outside-courthouse-as-jury-deliberates-karen-read-case/61456283\">argue</a> Read’s defense has turned a clear case of murder into a distorted media circus and fueled unfounded accusations of conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The mistrial means that the narrative of the case has also expanded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the one hand, popular resistance to the idea that a successful, articulate white woman could commit such a brutal murder might be fueling a good deal of the support for Read — which speaks to lots of assumptions about how we view class, privilege, and who gets to be seen as a victim. We’re accustomed, after all, to seeing women like Read in the role of the victim,&nbsp;no matter that she is the one on trial here. When it comes to true crime, the media <a href=\"https://jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/sites/jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/files/2022-11/True%20Crime%20and%20Danger%20Narratives-%20Reflections%20on%20Stories%20of%20Violence%2C%20Race%2C%20and%20%28In%29justice%20.pdf\">gives more attention</a> and sympathy to attractive middle-class white women than it does to male victims, much less victims who are poor or people of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Boston police are famously corrupt, with a long history of <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/1027/abos.html\">bribery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/retired-boston-police-captain-found-guilty-overtime-fraud-scheme\">fraud</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022-03-16/reforming-the-boston-police-has-been-a-hard-fought-uphill-series-of-battles-over-the-last-50-years\">racial bias</a>. The Read case is being compared to another possible homicide involving a <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/24/metro/sandra-birchmore-death-stoughton/\">horrifying allegation</a> of police conspiracy in nearby Stoughton, but this isn&#8217;t just a regional issue. American cities are frequently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/26/9036859/compstat-police-corruption\">beset</a> by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/8/4/23820288/six-former-mississippi-police-offers-plead-guilty-assault\">actual</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/2/16961146/baltimore-gun-trace-task-force-trial\">proven</a> police <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd\">corruption</a>. Boston isn’t unique. What does feel unique is the amount of public attention and scrutiny being given to the role of potential corruption in such a high-profile trial. It all adds up to what may well be a hopelessly irreconcilable pursuit of truth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, July 22, 3:40 pm:</strong> This story was originally published on July 3 and has been updated with the date for Karen Read’s new trial in 2025.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Sorry — actually it starts with the context of what came before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re an active internet denizen, you might already know what I’m referencing: a viral clip of Vice President Kamala Harris delivering a speech while repeating a question that she says her mother often posed to her: “‘You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if you’re fortunate enough not to live online, this is your guide to catching up on all the Kamala Harris memes. Many have been percolating for months (or even longer). Now that President Joe Biden has announced he will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention\">step off the Democratic ticket</a> and endorse Harris as his preferred presidential nominee, the memes are everywhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The coconut line is more than a year old: from a swearing-in ceremony that Harris led in May 2023 in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. But it’s also a stand-in for how the vice president is often perceived in pop culture, in mainstream media, and online: as a bit of a punchline, someone lacking serious power and with a perplexing political track record, and as the closest we’ll get to recreating Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s character in HBO’s <em>Veep.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention\">What happens now?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/359620/kamala-harris-2020-president-campaign-2024-failure-lesson\">What happened last time Harris ran for president</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361750/biden-drop-out-harris-endorse-polls-against-trump-democrats-dnc\">Does Harris give Democrats a better chance in 2024?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee\">Harris’s strengths and vulnerabilities as a presidential candidate</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Call it ironic or unironic #<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/25/20697783/khive-twitter-kamala-harris-2020-candidate-doug-hive\">KHive</a> posting, being “Kamalapilled” or “coconutpilled,” or simply feeling “unburdened” (I’ll get to that in a second). The surge in Harris memes after Biden&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">disastrous debate</a> performance was<strong> </strong>a symptom of the angst and uncertainty many Americans were feeling as the country and the Democratic Party navigated yet another crisis. Now, it appears to be a more earnest excitement and bewilderment by the internet&#8217;s denizens as the Democratic Party moves to nominate the first woman of color to be a major party presidential nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, to guide you through this discourse, I’ve rounded up a few of the most popular memes, starting with the foundational one.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>“Coconut trees” and the context of what came before</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the vice president referred to her mom’s question about falling out of a coconut tree, she was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JWR29RT5sw\">recounting a lesson</a> about the importance of history. Speaking to government appointees who would work on economic and education equity for Hispanic Americans, she emphasized that their task would be to aid not only young people, but also their parents, grandparents, teachers, and communities, “because none of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And she <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-swearing-in-ceremony-of-commissioners-for-the-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-hispanics/\">continued</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the takeaway is clear enough, something that’s been said for centuries: No person is an island.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it was her delivery that turned it into a meme: in a joking voice, with exaggerated hand and arm gestures, and with a signature Kamala Harris laugh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, social media users and right-wing accounts <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree\">accused</a> her of behaving strangely: “Obviously drunk,” one <a href=\"https://x.com/Rifleman4WVU/status/1656441274906320896\">viral tweet</a> said, while others used clips of the speech to describe being intoxicated or inebriated (which itself is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slimjosa/status/1808303666203697643\">another Harris meme</a>).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Being “unburdened by what has been”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Around the time of the most recent return of the coconut tree clip, another of Harris’s quotes began to circulate: not a memorable one-off, but a catchphrase she uses over and over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was a <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1310607188566724610\">go-to line</a> during her 2020 presidential primary campaign and into the general election as Biden’s running mate: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And thanks to a <a href=\"https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811\">Republican Party supercut</a> of all the times Harris has used the phrase in speeches, interviews, and appearances, the phrase went viral again. “Four straight minutes of ‘what can be, unburdened by what has been.’ It’s incredible. I had no idea she used it this much,” one Republican staffer <a href=\"https://x.com/thejcoop/status/1806867772988625316\">said</a> as he reshared the clip in the aftermath of the first presidential debate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The literal meaning of this catchphrase varies from speech to speech, but it’s often used in the context of Harris’s trailblazing career, marking historic firsts as a woman of color in elected office and carrying the weight of history, or as a call to arms to dream bigger and leave the past behind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a way, this quote contradicts Harris’s coconut tree line. As one <a href=\"https://x.com/Sturgeons_Law/status/1807513289330450566\">X user</a> put it: “How are you supposed to exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you AND be, unburdened by what has been at the same time? Waiting for her 3rd great revelation that synthesizes these two.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The “significance of the passage of time”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speaking at an <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?518860-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-affordable-broadband-access\">event in Louisiana</a> to announce millions of dollars in funding for broadband access, Harris referenced touring a library and reflected on historical inequities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We were talking about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. When you think about it, there is a great significance in the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She repeated the phrase a few more times, as noted in a clip widely <a href=\"https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1808533077271990424\">shared online</a>, and especially by right-wing users in the last few days.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The wheels on the bus </strong><strong><em>do</em></strong><strong> go round and round</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When seeing her campaign tour bus for the first time in 2019 during the Democratic presidential primaries, another video of Harris being a little awkward was shared on social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the camera pans 180 degrees around her, she walks across a lawn and onto the bus as she giggles and sings “the wheels on the bus go round and round,” slightly <a href=\"https://x.com/drmistercody/status/1808229682825122190\">off-key</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The vice president does impressions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More recently, clips of Harris showing another kind of less polished persona have also reappeared online: one from the ceremonial swearing-in of senators in January 2023, when <a href=\"https://x.com/_natemorris/status/1610652197968089088\">Harris imitates</a> Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet’s deep booming voice, and another from 2019, when she <a href=\"https://x.com/GraduatedBen/status/1808276737005916267\">imitates</a> her husband’s parents’ voices <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAPOKDV-nY\">during an interview</a> at the 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Y in New York City.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>There are plenty more</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You might remember other classic Harris deliveries — or you might be encountering them for the first time:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-did-it-joe\">“We did it, Joe.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/findareaction/status/1588718308060168193\">“I love Venn diagrams.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/TheMemesArchive/status/1557191149424713728\">“I love good news.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How she <a href=\"https://x.com/CapehartJ/status/1595526310335586305\">seasons a turkey</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1794818668200608070\">“Do not come.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s stint as vice president has often been pretty unremarkable, but it has provided a rich vein of memes, in part because she can be an awkward communicator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s part of what fueled critical media coverage of her during the first year of her tenure, and which led the White House to largely sideline her during the first half of the Biden presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other Kamala memes are rooted in the hokey nature of a lot of modern political speech: derived from aphorisms and pseudo-philosophical diction in the hope of echoing something like former President Barack Obama’s oratory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the first female, Black, and South Asian vice president, Harris was always doomed to receive an extraordinary amount of scrutiny and bias — and emphasized her persona as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuEZcAgOQs0\">“joyful warrior”</a> in part to combat some of those stereotypes. The joyful warrior, it seems, is sometimes a goofy one too. Harris delivers many of these lines in a genuinely funny way, with an affect unlike many politicians (described sometimes as just <a href=\"https://x.com/Chelsea_Fagan/status/1591478294444400640\">vibing</a> along).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, all this talk about being KHive pilled, or coconutpilled<strong>,</strong> especially from people who were skeptical or critical of the vice president just a few weeks ago<strong> </strong>speaks to the uncertainty of this moment. Plenty of people were wondering whether Biden would still be the Democratic nominee by the end of the summer. They’re meme-ing their way to a new celebration of Harris — unburdened by what has been. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Update, July 22, 2:50 pm ET:<em> </em></strong><em>This story was originally published <em>on July 3</em> <em>in the aftermath of the first 2024 presidential debate </em>and has been updated to include news about Joe Biden dropping out of the race and Kamala Harris becoming the likely Democratic nominee.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just a few hours before President Joe Biden announced that he will not seek a second term in the White House, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/biden-johnson-2024-elections-laws-00169973\">threatened lawsuits</a> to try to force Biden to appear as the Democratic candidate on at least some state ballots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Every state has its own system,” Johnson told ABC News, “and in some of these, it’s not possible to simply just switch out a candidate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a system governed by the rule of law, Johnson’s threats are empty. Though Biden was the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee until he decided to withdraw from the race, he would not legally have become the Democratic nominee until he was formally nominated by delegates to the party’s convention, which is <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/when-is-dnc-convention-chicago-2024/74491378007/\">scheduled to begin August 19</a>. So there’s no need to “switch out” Biden for another candidate because Biden was never formally on any state’s 2024 ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the world we live in is post-<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf\"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a><em> </em>(2024), the Supreme Court decision holding that former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for any crimes he committed using his official authority as president. That decision had <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/359206/supreme-court-incompetent-abortion-trump-immunity\">no more basis in law</a> than a decision forcing Democrats to run Biden for president would have. So the possibility that a GOP-controlled Supreme Court will make up some reason to sabotage Democrats’ chances of holding the White House cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court would struggle to justify such sabotage, in part because its own decisions benefiting Trump undercut the kind of lawsuits envisioned by Johnson. The Supreme Court’s recent decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-719_19m2.pdf\"><em>Trump v. Anderson</em></a> (2024), which reversed Colorado’s attempt to remove Republican Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot because of Trump’s role in the January 6 insurrection, also cuts against allowing any state to overrule the Democratic Party’s choice of candidate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Anderson</em> relied heavily on <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/779/\"><em>US Term Limits v. Thornton</em></a> (1995), which held that “powers over the election of federal officers had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.” That means that, even if a state wanted to remove the Democratic presidential nominee (who will almost certainly be Vice President Kamala Harris) from the ballot and replace her with Biden, it would have to point to a federal constitutional provision or law permitting it to do so.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>State laws generally do not prevent Democrats from putting Harris on the ballot instead of Biden</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though Speaker Johnson did not identify which state laws might prevent Democrats from nominating Harris instead of Biden as their presidential candidate, the Heritage Foundation, a far-right think tank closely aligned with the GOP, published a memo claiming that three states — <a href=\"https://x.com/OversightPR/status/1805239354505257196\">Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin</a> — may have laws that will frustrate the Democratic Party’s transition from Biden to Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But none of these states’ laws should be read to prevent Harris from appearing as the Democratic Party’s nominee on the 2024 ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Georgia law does require some presidential candidates to file a “notice of candidacy” in early July, but that same law <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2022/title-21/chapter-2/article-4/part-1/section-21-2-132/\">exempts the nominees of political parties</a> that held “a national convention and therein nominated candidates for President and Vice President of the United States.” In case there is any uncertainty about what the Georgia law means, Gabriel Sterling, a high-ranking state elections official, confirmed on X (formerly known as Twitter) Monday morning that <a href=\"https://x.com/GabrielSterling/status/1815370759985856541\">whoever Democrats choose at their August convention</a> will appear on the Georgia ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, in Nevada, regulations promulgated by the secretary of state’s office provide that “each major political party must provide the names of the party’s respective candidates for president and vice president of the United States to the secretary of state by <a href=\"https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showpublisheddocument/13075/638446205331930000\">not later than 5 pm on the first business day of September</a> of the year of a presidential election.” The first business day of September has not happened yet.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024\">Do other Democrats actually poll better against Trump than Biden?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out\">What happens to Biden’s campaign cash?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357955/biden-age-democrats-nominee-kamala-harris\">How did Democrats get here?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358084/biden-drop-out-lbj-harry-truman\">What can we learn from incumbents who stepped aside</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/362062/biden-drop-out-republicans-accuse-democrats-coup\">Why Republicans are accusing Democrats of a &#8220;coup&#8221;</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wisconsin law, meanwhile, provides that “nominees chosen at a national convention” must be certified “<a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/8/16/7#:~:text=The%20state%20or%20national%20chairperson,(2)%20(a).\">no later than 5 pm on the first Tuesday in September preceding a presidential election</a>.” So, much like in Georgia and Nevada, Biden was never certified as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee, and the party has plenty of time to choose a different candidate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So that should be the ball game. In all three states flagged by Heritage, major party presidential nominees are determined after each party’s convention takes place. So there is no need to switch the Democratic Party’s nominee from Biden to Harris because Biden never formally became the Democratic nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, there is one possible vehicle the Supreme Court could use to sabotage Harris. The normal rule is that state Supreme Courts have the final word on all questions of state law, so the US Supreme Court should play no role in deciding which candidate qualifies for each state’s ballot. In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf\"><em>Moore v. Harper</em></a> (2023), however, the Supreme Court said that it could overrule a state court’s interpretation of a state election law if a majority of the justices thought that the state court’s decision “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/27/23775378/supreme-court-moore-harper-john-roberts-independent-state-legislature-north-carolina-bush-gore\">exceed[s] the bounds of ordinary judicial review</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court, however, has never actually invoked this self-given power, and it’s unclear how the justices would defend a decision overruling state law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Republican lower court judges could wreak havoc before the Supreme Court weighs in</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One risk Democrats should be prepared for is that a lower court judge closely aligned with the Republican Party might issue a court order forcing Biden’s name back on the ballot. It’s far from clear what the legal basis of such a decision would be, but there are judges — think of figures like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/17/23512766/supreme-court-matthew-kacsmaryk-judge-trump-abortion-immigration-birth-control\">Christian Right crusader Matthew Kacsmaryk</a> or Aileen Cannon, the trial judge who has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga\">behaved like a member of Trump’s criminal defense team</a> — who’ve shown an extraordinary willingness to bend the law to achieve Republican goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also trivially easy for Republicans to bring a lawsuit before a friendly judge. Any lawsuit filed in Amarillo, Texas, for example, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/24/23725897/abortion-planned-parenthood-matthew-kacsmaryk-supreme-court-medical-progress-medicaid\">automatically lands in Kacsmaryk’s courtroom</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Would the Supreme Court affirm a decision by someone like Kacsmaryk or Cannon which sought to rig the 2024 election for Donald Trump? Again, such a decision would require an unusual amount of cynicism by the justices, even by the standards of this unusually cynical Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if everything works out for the Democratic Party in the end, Democrats should at least be ready for a Trump-aligned judge to temporarily throw the election into chaos.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Just a few hours before President Joe Biden announced that he will not seek a second term in the White House, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson threatened lawsuits to try to force Biden to appear as the Democratic candidate on at least some state ballots. “Every state has its own system,” Johnson told ABC News, [&#8230;]",

Though Harris is not the nominee yet, Biden’s backing gives her a significant boost ahead of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024\">other potential contenders</a>, fueling speculation about who else could join the ticket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, vice presidents have been selected to complement the main candidate. Biden chose Harris because she would bring youth, diversity, and legal experience. And former President Donald Trump chose Vice President Mike Pence because he was a traditional conservative and offered legislative expertise that he didn’t have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president.

Based on that history, there are a few guesses: Her pick could be someone from a purple or red state, who offers geographic diversity given her roots in California. And — to assuage voters who still hold sexist or racist attitudes, as President Barack Obama did with Biden in 2008 — it might be a white man.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is a rundown of some of the possible candidates who might be considered — and what they’d bring to the ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2159037882_26f6dd.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Gov.

Roy Cooper</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Cooper, 67, is the governor of North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2020 and 2016 that offers <a href=\"https://www.ncsbe.gov/about-elections/electoral-college\">16 electoral votes</a> (of the 270 needed to win). He’s known for winning repeatedly statewide even as other Democratic candidates have struggled to do the same for roles like the Senate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As governor, he’s also vetoed Republican bills on abortion and guns, and has strong approval <a href=\"https://abc11.com/post/2024-elections-could-governor-roy-cooper-replace-president/15011995/\">ratings overall</a>. Prior to becoming governor, he served as the state’s attorney general and in the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Cooper could help improve Democrats’ chances in a battleground state, though it will still likely be an uphill battle given past contests in North Carolina. He’s also been pretty popular in his role, and has secured backing from some moderates and Republicans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He previously collaborated with Harris while they each served as their states’ AG, meaning they have experience working alongside one another. And more recently, Harris and Cooper <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsVNTI1BqZo\">have campaigned together</a> in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">Biden’s disastrous June debate</a>, during which the governor cautioned against the return of “Donald Trump’s America.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2150001600_c3763f.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736744421098,100,78.526511157804\" alt=\"Gov.

Josh Shapiro</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Shapiro, 51, is the governor of Pennsylvania, another likely battleground state (with <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation\">19 Electoral College votes</a>), which Biden won in 2020 and which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He was elected in 2022, the same year that freshman Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was elected to the Senate. Shapiro ran far ahead of Fetterman, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results/pennsylvania/\">winning 57 percent of the vote, to Fetterman’s 51 percent</a>. Shapiro has established himself as a moderate who helped negotiate bipartisan deals when he was in the state legislature, and is also known for his work as attorney general, when he secured settlements for victims of sexual abuse by the Catholic Diocese. He’s also been a vocal supporter of Israel amid the country’s devastating military offensive in Gaza, following Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Like Cooper, he’s the popular Democratic governor of a swing state and could help the party improve their chances there. He’s also seen as more of a centrist who could appeal to moderate voters and independents, though his staunch backing of Israel could turn away progressive Democrats.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161807297_5538e2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Gov.

Prior to this role, he also served as Kentucky’s attorney general.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Beshear is the rare Democrat who has been able to win multiple times in a red state and could offer additional appeal to some swing voters. In addition to the support he’s received for his leadership during various crises, he’s also touted infrastructure and private sector investment in the state during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike other possibilities, though, he probably wouldn’t increase Harris’s chances of winning his home state, which is solidly GOP.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160763179.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Gov.

Pritzker, 59, is the governor of Illinois, a Democratic state that Biden and Clinton both won in 2020 and 2016. Before becoming governor, he was a businessman and philanthropist, and is a scion of the family behind Hyatt hotels, who’ve also been consistent and influential Democratic donors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As governor, Pritzker has established a modest national profile, including remarks he’s given attacking Trump and calls he’s made for more federal resources to address immigration in Illinois.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Pritzker has already built some name recognition as a fixture on cable news, and has proven to be a vocal Trump antagonist. Pritzker’s personal wealth could also potentially be a boon to the campaign, though his own state is not a battleground that would expand the Democratic map.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160744008_a0c39e.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Sen.

Previously, Biden won Arizona in 2020, while Clinton lost the state in 2016. Kelly is also known for his career as an astronaut alongside his twin brother Scott Kelly, and as the husband of gun control advocate and former US Rep. Gabby Giffords.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Kelly has a higher profile than some of the other names on this list, and is respected both for his scientific expertise and contributions as an astronaut in addition to his time in the Senate. He’s been a prominent gun control advocate alongside Giffords and made pushing these policies a priority.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given his efforts to appeal to both Republicans and independents in Arizona, he’d be another option who could help with trying to reach those voters. Arizona also continues to be an important battleground this time around, including in its <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">Senate race</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1394802139.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes. \" title=\"Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg attends a White House correspondents’ brunch on April 30, 2022, in Washington, DC. | Paul Morigi/Getty Images for White House Correspondents Insider\" data-portal-copyright=\"Paul Morigi/Getty Images for White House Correspondents Insider\" />\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Buttigieg, 42, is the secretary of transportation who rose to prominence as a former 2020 presidential candidate.

Prior to being governor, Whitmer was a member of the state legislature and the first woman to become the Democratic leader of the state Senate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What was the case for her? </strong>She’s among the members of the list who have strong and positive national recognition, and who could help raise Democrats’ chances in a pivotal swing state. Whitmer has also focused on issues including infrastructure and health care, which could broaden Democrats’ appeal to moderate voters. And if Harris and Whitmer were on the same ticket, they would form a groundbreaking all-woman ticket — something that neither major party has run before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why she won&#8217;t be the new VP:</strong> Less than 24 hours after Biden endorsed Harris, Whitmer emphatically told reporters that she has no desire to be vice president. “I’m not planning to go anywhere,” <a href=\"https://x.com/kenvogel/status/1815417822056755621\">she said, adding</a>, “I am not leaving Michigan; I&#8217;m proud to be the governor of Michigan.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, July 22, 2024, 12:58 pm ET:</em></strong> <em>This piece was originally published on July 21 and has been updated to include Gov.

He is the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/21/us/biden-drops-out-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first sitting president to step aside so close to Election Day</a>. “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden said in a letter on Sunday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to take his place. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a>&nbsp;in another statement. Not long after, Harris announced via the Biden campaign that she intends to run for president. “I am honored to have the president’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/kamala-harris-running-for-president-00170067\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">she said</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his term, President Biden managed to shepherd a surprising number of major policies into law with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate. His crowning achievement is signing the <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/one-year-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-is-working-kind-of/\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, or IRA — the biggest climate spending law in US history, with the potential to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to 42 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In announcing his withdrawal, Biden called it “the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite his legislative successes, the 81-year-old Democrat couldn’t weather widespread blowback following a debate performance in June in which he appeared frail and struck many in his party as ill-equipped to lead the country for another four years. He will leave office with a portion of his <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/biden-administration-tracking-climate-action-progress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposed climate agenda unpassed</a> and the US <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hope-dims-that-the-u-s-can-meet-2030-climate-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">still projected to miss</a> his administration’s goal of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-catalyze-global-climate-action-through-the-major-economies-forum-on-energy-and-climate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reducing emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Former President Donald Trump has vowed to undo many of the policies Biden accomplished if he becomes president, <a href=\"https://www.taxnotes.com/featured-news/ill-scrap-ira-tax-credits-day-1-trump-says/2023/09/28/7hdjq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">including parts of the IRA</a>.

There are fewer than 30 days until the Democratic National Convention on August 19. The thousands of Democratic delegates who already cast their votes for Biden will either decide on a nominee before the convention or hold an open convention to find their new candidate — something that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/open-convention-democrats-biden-drop-out/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hasn’t been done since 1968</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As vice president, Harris <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/politics/kamala-harris-inflation-reduction-act-climate-change/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">argued</a> for the allocation of $20 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, aimed at aiding disadvantaged communities facing climate impacts, and frequently promoted the IRA at events, touting the bill’s investments in clean energy jobs, including installation of energy-efficient lighting, and replacing gas furnaces with electric heat pumps. She was also the highest-ranking US official to attend the international climate talks at <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">COP28 in Dubai last year</a>, where she announced a US commitment to double energy efficiency and triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. At that same conference, Harris <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/politics/kamala-harris-cop28-saturday/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a> a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund to help developing nations adapt to climate challenges, although <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Politico reported</a> that the sum was “subject to the availability of funds,” according to the Treasury Department. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Vice President Harris has been integral to the Biden administration’s most important climate accomplishments and has a long track record as an impactful climate champion,” Evergreen Action, the climate-oriented political group, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris caught some flak for using a potentially overstated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/white-house-puts-1-trillion-price-tag-on-climate-efforts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“$1 trillion over 10 years”</a>&nbsp;figure to describe the Biden administration’s climate investments. She got that sum from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/white-house-puts-1-trillion-price-tag-on-climate-efforts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">adding up all of the administration’s major investments over the past four years</a>, some of which are only vaguely connected to climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-climate-plan/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposed</a> a $10 trillion climate plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 on the campaign trail, including 100-percent carbon-neutral electricity by 2030. Under the plan, 50 percent of new vehicles sold would be zero-emission by 2030; and 100 percent of cars by 2035. But that proposal, like similarly ambitious climate change proposals released by other Democrats during that election cycle, was nothing more than a campaign wishlist. A better indicator of what her plans for climate change as president would look like — better, even, than her record as vice president, as much of her agenda was set by the Biden administration — could be buried in her record as San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and as California’s attorney general from 2011 to 2017. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As district attorney, Harris&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-creates-environmental-unit-2666667.php\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">created</a>&nbsp;an environmental justice unit to address environmental crimes affecting San Francisco’s poorest residents and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://calepa.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/10/Enforcement-Orders-2009yr-UHComplaint.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prosecuted</a>&nbsp;several companies including U-Haul for violation of hazardous waste laws. Harris later touted her environmental justice unit as the first such unit in the country.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.leefang.com/p/kamala-harris-greenwashed-justice\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">An investigation</a>&nbsp;found the unit only filed a handful of lawsuits, though, and none of them were against the city’s major industrial polluters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As attorney general, Harris secured an $86 million settlement from Volkswagen for rigging its vehicles with emissions-cheating software and investigated ExxonMobil over its climate change disclosures.

Yet findings published today from the largest randomized basic income experiment in the US to date, backed by Sam Altman and OpenAI, should get your notice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The study, held from November 2020 through October 2023, gave 1,000 recipients $1,000 per month, no strings attached. It’s one of the biggest and longest trials ever run on direct cash giving. Many other <a href=\"https://guaranteedincome.us/\">basic income pilots</a> have given people $500 or less, and rarely for more than a year or two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the study was run by a group of academics, it was <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/basic-income\">set in motion</a> by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. For years, Altman has been publicly worrying that basic income will become necessary as AI eliminates traditional jobs while creating huge stockpiles of wealth held by a few. “If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today,” <a href=\"https://moores.samaltman.com/\">he wrote</a> in 2021. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Altman isn’t alone. Many major figures in the tech world, from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-universal-basic-income-ubi-ai-automation-unemployment-quotes-2024-6\">Elon Musk</a> to the “godfather of AI,” <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd607ekl99o\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, believe AI will usher a wave of technological unemployment, and basic income will become necessary to keep us all afloat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On this, I’m conflicted. In general, unconditional cash can be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23965898/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-economy-welfare-phase-ins\">an effective anti-poverty policy</a>, but the extensive list of small experiments and accumulating evidence doesn’t seem to be furthering the case of basic income to becoming a reality. So maybe any press is good press, and all the attention AI leaders are bringing to basic income will help it along. Spreading the fear of AI stealing all our jobs seems to garner much more enthusiasm for basic income than continually <a href=\"https://www.economicpossibility.org/reports/basic-income\">pointing at the evidence</a>. (Just look at Andrew Yang’s<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/18/20919322/basic-income-freedom-dividend-andrew-yang-automation\"> 2020 presidential campaign</a>, which centered on universal basic income as a response to automation.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But hitching <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15364546/universal-basic-income-review-stern-murray-automation\">the case for basic income</a> to fears of rapid AI progress makes it far more vulnerable than it needs to be. If there’s no great wave of AI-driven unemployment, if the AI <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/goldman-s-top-stock-analyst-is-waiting-for-ai-bubble-to-burst\">bubble bursts</a> and turns out to be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/18/23794187/telephone-operator-switchboard-automation-att-feigenbaum-gross\">hardly any different</a> than cycles of innovation and technological unemployment in the past, support for basic income would fall, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet the arguments for some kind of basic income are strong, no matter what happens with AI. There could be absolutely no further progress, AI could come to a complete and eternal standstill, and the case for basic income would remain as strong as ever: unconditional cash can be a simple and flexible way to style income-support policies that actually reach everyone in need (at the trade-off of higher taxes).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The basic income movement might be better off severing ties with speculations about AI altogether. Then, the conversation could focus on what basic income can actually be: an effective anti-poverty tool that would neither stave off dystopia nor usher in a leisurely paradise, but instead, just <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/10/13/23914745/basic-income-radical-economy-poverty-capitalism-taxes\">a world with less poverty</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">News from the largest randomized study of basic income in the US to date</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many cash transfer advocates feel that the movement is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/4/28/23044957/ubi-guaranteed-income-baltimore-new-york-mississippi\">overdue to graduate</a> from research to actual policy. But the “Unconditional Income Study,” as this three-year endeavor by the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.openresearchlab.org/approach\">OpenResearch</a> has been dubbed, added some welcome substance to the otherwise slim pile of research on big cash transfers over long periods of time. (OpenResearch is not affiliated directly with OpenAI, but it grew out of the tech accelerator Y Combinator when Altman ran it, and has received a combined $24 million from Altman and OpenAI’s nonprofit organization.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The study gave out monthly checks to people between the ages of 21 and 40 living in Texas and Illinois. To qualify, their 2019 household income had to be less than 300 percent of the federal poverty line: that would mean $77,250 for a <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-federal-register-references/2019-poverty-guidelines\">family of four</a>, or $37,470 for an individual. The average participant’s household income in 2019 was about $30,000. One thousand people were randomized into the treatment group and received the full $1,000 per month, while another 2,000 were part of a control group that got $50 per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The results are coming out in batches, with <a href=\"https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study\">two papers</a> out today — one on <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32719\">employment effects</a> and another on <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32711\">health outcomes</a> — and another on consumption still in the works. So far, the results are kind of scrambled, refusing to neatly fit into any particular view on basic income.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recipients spent an average of $310 more per month, mostly on housing, food, and car expenses. Overall, however, their incomes fell by about $125 per month, excluding the transfers.<strong> </strong>The drop in earnings was largely driven by people choosing to work a little less (since the transfers meant they still came out ahead). In total, labor market participation declined by 2 percent, cashing out as working about 1.3 hours less per week, or roughly eight fewer days of work over the course of a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At first glance, this finding is somewhat at odds with <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24337\">other basic income experiments</a> in the US, and challenges <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23965898/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-economy-welfare-phase-ins\">the narrative advocates</a> have been pushing that unconditional cash won’t make people choose less work. Sometimes, maybe it will. But eight fewer days of work per year doesn’t exactly look like the doomsday scenario of everyone choosing to live out their remaining days on welfare, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265291\">surfing</a>, or playing video games on the taxpayer’s dime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The cash’s impact on health was a little more straightforward: it didn’t seem to do much. Despite detailed data, including blood samples from some participants and nutritional intake, “We find essentially no evidence of improvements in physical health due to the transfers,” the paper states, “and can rule out even small improvements.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There were short-lived improvements in mental health, mostly through reductions in stress. But they faded by the end of the first year. Recipients also showed a major increase in food security during year one, which also faded by the second year. If there was any silver lining in the paper on health, it was that recipients went to hospitals, doctors, and dentists more often, and spent about $20 more per month on medical care as a result of the transfer, which the authors note could translate into indirect benefits in the long term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The appeal of cash transfers lies in the freedom that they give beneficiaries to make their own choices about what type of consumption to prioritize,” the authors conclude. “However, the nature of that freedom means that cash transfers are a blunt instrument for improving health and reducing health disparities specifically.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The results suggest that policymakers interested in improving particular health outcomes might be better off pursuing more targeted interventions, like expanding Medicaid eligibility, reducing prescription drug costs, or making it easier to make primary care appointments. Targeting health directly, in other words, rather than simple cash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the researchers argue, “if policymakers seek to reduce poverty and improve the well-being of low-income groups more generally, cash transfers could still represent an important option, even if they do not improve health outcomes in the near term.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Basic income restored a little bit of capitalism’s forgotten promise: the freedom to choose more leisure time</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most controversial and politically <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/manchin-wont-support-enhanced-child-tax-credit-without-work-requirement.html\">charged</a> parts of the basic income debate is how it would affect work. Among critical economists and policy wonks, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/opinion/child-tax-credit-basic-income.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">concern</a> isn’t that we’ll need basic income because there won’t be any jobs left after AI, but that basic income could itself be the thing that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/opinion/child-allowance-credit-romney.html\">wipes away</a> our desire to work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether these results support that fear depends on how deeply you read into the details. The results clearly show that people do work a little less. But going a bit deeper, the employment effects were concentrated among young, single parents. Does the option for single parents to choose an extra eight days off per year constitute a policy failure — or success?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The project also captured pretty detailed time-use data, letting researchers figure out where recipients were re-allocating their newly chosen time away from work. Though 1,000 people obviously made a variety of choices over the course of three years, the dominant trade was clearly toward more leisure time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24065976/economists-post-scarcity-abundance-industrial-revolution-socialism-capitalism\">previously written</a> about how, until recently, Americans across the political spectrum used to see the promise of capitalism as exactly that: delivering people the choice of cashing in economic progress for more leisure time. Getting an economic boost and subsequently choosing to work a little less was not seen as a policy failure, but <a href=\"https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/mike-konczal-tk/\">the whole point</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“But for decades, workers haven’t even been getting that choice because, for the most part, productivity growth has ended up as higher profits and more inequality,” sociologist Aaron Benanav <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2023/10/10/23895776/four-day-workweek-leisure-progress-labor-economy-utopia-capitalism-burnout-worker-satisfaction\">told me last year</a>. “It takes a political movement to cash that out in terms of a reduced workweek.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apparently, a generous basic income can at least help nudge that choice back into workers’ lives. After getting an extra $1,000, recipients effectively traded in $125 to get five-and-a-half more hours per month outside of work.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Interviews with participants paint a much brighter picture than the numbers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the survey data, OpenResearch held voluntary interviews with participants after the transfers ended to hear more about their experiences. Though only nine were recorded, I kept hearing variations on a theme that wasn’t captured in the statistics. (All names were changed by OpenResearch to protect the identities of participants.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Alina, a single mom living in Chicago, put it: “My whole mind kinda began to shift &#8230; I had to stop myself so that I could have the mental mind shift, the paradigm shift to say, ok, we can actually engage in system planning.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or Celene, who lived with her ex-wife and their kids in a friend’s basement before the transfers helped them get their own home: “It helped my mind clear a little bit because I didn’t feel like as much of a failure.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or Dominic, who lost his job during the pandemic: “The biggest thing it did was allow me a time of peace of mind so I could explore what I really wanted out of life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everyone seemed to mention how getting unconditional cash was literally changing their minds for the better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The mechanism doesn’t have to be all that mysterious. Everyone faces their own challenges, and people with low incomes especially so. But woven through all the differences is at least one shared consequence: stress. And we already know that stress can literally warp the mind, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24065976/economists-post-scarcity-abundance-industrial-revolution-socialism-capitalism\">especially around scarcity</a>. Giving people cash comes with the flexibility to address whatever sources of stress are loudest in their lives, freeing up the mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet, according to the numbers, the sharp reductions in stress that recipients had in the first year didn’t last, even though they shared these powerful stories after the third year. Which raises an interesting tension: Why is there such a big difference between the extremely positive stories that people are telling about their experiences, and the story that the numbers tell, which basically amounts to a shrug?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of it could be sampling bias: since the interviews were voluntary, maybe only people who had powerful and positive experiences opted in to the voluntary interviews to talk more about them. More broadly, though, there are parts of the human experience —&nbsp;and more specifically, the experience of being a participant in a basic income experiment — that statistics either fail to capture, or even conceal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I spoke with Elizabeth Rhodes, who has a joint doctorate in social work and political science, and directed the study for OpenResearch, she explained that all the variation across how people used the money, or what a “good outcome” actually is based on someone’s particular circumstances, made them difficult to capture in top-line statistics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One person might wind up finding <a href=\"https://www.economicpossibility.org/insights/stockton-basic-income-employment\">better work and taking on more hours</a> thanks to the cash, while another might scale back their hours to spend more time with their kids. Both cases can be good outcomes to the individuals involved, but “as an average treatment effect, where one person worked a lot more, while another worked less, it all kind of averages out.” she said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">We should insulate the case for basic income from any potential AI bubbles</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite receiving funding from much of the tech world where talk of AI is everywhere, none of the papers published from the Unconditional Income Study mentioned AI at all. That’s a good thing, because as I mentioned earlier, we should insulate the case for basic income from the volatility and unknowns of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Against the backdrop of all the “changing the world as we know it” talk, a number of analysts are beginning to think the AI <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/goldman-s-top-stock-analyst-is-waiting-for-ai-bubble-to-burst\">bubble</a> is already <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/7/9/the-ai-summer\">beginning</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/13/from-boom-to-burst-the-ai-bubble-is-only-heading-in-one-direction\">burst</a>. Maybe it will, and then it’ll inflate again. And maybe one of these go-rounds will actually lead to changes that go beyond the cycles of innovation and technological unemployment <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/18/23794187/telephone-operator-switchboard-automation-att-feigenbaum-gross\">we’ve weathered for centuries</a>. Or maybe they won’t. Who knows!</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The strongest arguments for unconditional income don’t need to rest on speculation. We have a <a href=\"https://basicincome.stanford.edu/research/ubi-visualization/\">lot of evidence</a>. We have real-world experience from <a href=\"https://guaranteedincome.us/\">a ton of pilot experiments</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23965898/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-economy-welfare-phase-ins\">lapsed national policies</a>. And we already have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23792854/poverty-mortality-study-public-health-antipoverty-america-deaths-poor-life-expectancy\">an urgent need</a> for better anti-poverty policies, even if there wasn’t an iota more of AI development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Breaking the link between basic income and automation would also force us to consider what — if not UBI — actually would be a good policy response to major technological unemployment. Because if we really do all lose our jobs to AI, $12,000 per year isn’t going to cushion the blow much. This is a persistent confusion in debate around basic income: if you’re talking about unconditionally giving people enough to live on indefinitely, you’re either imagining a society of monks, that everyone lives in rural West Virginia, or you aren’t actually talking about basic income at all, at least as it exists in any viable form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The average living wage for a family of four in the US is about $104,000 per year, according to the MIT <a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/articles/103-new-data-posted-2023-living-wage-calculator#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20the%20living,in%20the%20United%20States%20is\">Living Wage calculator</a>. Even if a guaranteed income on the scale of this study gave the full amount to children (which most proposals do not), the same family would only get $48,000 per year, less than half the living wage. There is no realistic guaranteed income proposal that could serve as a substitute for wages altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Altman himself <a href=\"https://moores.samaltman.com/\">has argued</a> for something more nuanced in the past: taxes on AI companies and land values that feed into a <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/social-wealth-fund/\">social wealth fund</a> where every citizen holds an equal share, receiving a dividend that rises or falls with the fund value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s basically a version of UBI that’s styled away from guaranteeing an end to poverty, and toward being able to adapt to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24108787/ai-economic-growth-explosive-automation\">runaway economic growth</a>. In addition, maybe we’ll need to consider <a href=\"https://pavlina-tcherneva.net/the-case-for-a-job-guarantee/\">job guarantees</a>. Or maybe compulsory employment is an iron cage we’ll finally break by more deeply <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/a-world-without-work/\">democratizing</a> the economy, and whatever diminishing pools of work remain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Either way, basic income advocates are left with a choice. You can welcome fears around AI as an incredibly effective marketing tool to spread awareness for basic income, and then try to jiu-jitsu that attention toward sturdier motivations, like <a href=\"https://jainfamilyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/reweaving-the-safety-net-12.15.20.pdf\">more effectively reducing poverty</a> than a patchwork of means-tested programs. Or, like me, you can try shouting into the void that we shouldn’t associate basic income and automation in the first place, since it sets the case for unconditional cash on shaky foundations, while there’s <a href=\"https://www.economicpossibility.org/reports/basic-income\">an empirically sturdy basis</a> already established.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With the OpenResearch studies, that basis continues to grow. Whether or not that’ll lead to any policy breakthroughs before AI flops, fades into being just another new technology that shifts things around for a bit, or really does transform the economy, who knows?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate, and polls showing the <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden\">increasing likelihood</a> that Trump will return to office.<strong> </strong>It took place just <em>before </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361888/biden-drops-out-kamala-harris-endorsement-dnc-democratic-nominee\">President Joe Biden dropped out of the race</a>, though questions about the future of the ticket were a constant backdrop to the conference. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike Mann’s somnambulant Europeans, of course, the international government officials, military officers, and corporate executives attending the annual gathering in the Rockies weren’t just there for their health and the mountain air, but for discussions on a range of pressing security topics from Gaza and Ukraine to the militarization of space and the role of AI in war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, as attendees watched the sessions with one eye on their iPhones to keep up with developments from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, it was hard to avoid the assessment that the future trajectory of many of the issues under discussion hinges significantly on the election’s outcome in November — an election that, with Biden out, is more uncertain than ever before. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Trump contrast</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President Biden had premised his case for reelection significantly on the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695\">sort of accomplishments</a> promoted and celebrated at gatherings like Aspen: the expansion of NATO, the multilateral response to the invasion of Ukraine, and the building of a network of alliances in the Pacific to counter China. Vice President Kamala Harris enters the race with less foreign policy experience than Biden, though she <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc\">has been involved</a> in the administration’s diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and Central America, and would presumably draw her circle of advisers from either Biden’s current team or other names that Aspen attendees and speakers are very familiar with. A major shift from Biden’s approach in Europe, China, and the Middle East seems unlikely with a Harris presidency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, by contrast, has promised to quickly end the war in Ukraine — a pledge celebrated on placards waved in Milwaukee — most likely by pressuring Kyiv to negotiate away territory to Moscow. He is also a longtime skeptic of European security alliances, including NATO, and recently suggested Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/17/donald-trump-taiwan-pay-us-defence-china-national-convention\">should “pay us for defense” </a>against an invasion by China, which sent the stock price of the island’s vital semiconductor manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-shares-fall-more-than-2-after-trump-says-taiwan-should-pay-defence-2024-07-17/\">falling</a>. Vance, Trump’s new running mate, is one of Congress’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">leading skeptics</a> of efforts to defend the “liberal international order,” particularly when it comes to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention\">What happens now?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024\">Do other Democrats actually poll better against Trump than Biden?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out\">What happens to Biden’s campaign money? </a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357955/biden-age-democrats-nominee-kamala-harris\">How did Democrats get here?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358084/biden-drop-out-lbj-harry-truman\">What can we learn from incumbents who stepped aside</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the stage in Aspen, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) pushed back on the idea that the GOP has taken an isolationist turn, describing the <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform\">recently adopted Republican platform</a> as a “Reaganesque peace-through-strength” document that emphasizes building the US defense industry and modernizing the military.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a close ally of Biden, told me on the sidelines of the conference on Thursday (in between media appearances discussing Biden’s then-undetermined fate)<strong> </strong>that “in his time as president, Trump showed an unevenness and erratic nature in his foreign policy that can make it really hard to persuade our close and trusted allies that we were still a reliable partner.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While administration officials and allies abroad have been discussing what can be done to Trump-proof US foreign policy, there is a limit to those efforts. Even as he touted the Biden administration’s record on support for Ukraine and work to strengthen NATO, Secretary of State Antony Blinken conceded, “Every administration has an opportunity to set its policies. We can’t lock in the future.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep calm and carry on</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, the foreign officials who spoke at the conference refused to take the bait when asked if they were concerned about Trump’s return. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, whose country is likely to be the one most directly impacted by the outcome of the election, told the Aspen audience, “We believe in American leadership and we believe that the American people want their partners and allies to be strong as well &#8230; Whatever will be the outcome, we’ll work with America.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was a sense from several officials that a Trump presidency was a movie they’d seen before, and they were more prepared for it this time. Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen told the crowd, “I would remind you that we worked with the Trump administration for meetings in Singapore” — likely a reference to the 2018 summit between the former president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “He was very happy with Singapore because we have a trade surplus with you … I’m not so concerned.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even less concerned about a new Republican administration were representatives of the defense and technology industries — also heavily represented at Aspen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think it could potentially be positive to have a Trump administration for a tech company trying to work with” the Department of Defense, said Tara Dougherty, CEO of the defense software company Govini. “They’re already talking about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/16/trump-ai-executive-order-regulations-military/\">Manhattan Projects for [artificial intelligence]</a> which shows they’re serious about the development and adoption of AI for military purposes.” She added that in Vance, Trump had chosen “a running mate who comes from this space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As with last week’s NATO summit, attendees frequently argued that one of Trump’s main complaints about US allies — that they free-ride on American security guarantees and don’t pay for their own defense — is less applicable today than it was during his term, with defense budgets increasing globally in the wake of the war in Ukraine and concerns about China’s growing power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is a different Europe than the Europe we complained about for years,” said Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of the US military’s Europe Command. “This is a Europe that recognizes what the burden is and that it’s got to be shared &#8230; This is exactly the moment when American interests will be advanced most by continued participation” in Europe’s defense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Coming down the mountain</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cavoli’s remarks (he didn’t specifically refer to Trump or the election) were met with applause in a room that didn’t need much convincing of the value of America’s global commitments. But Vance would likely argue that’s precisely the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-delivers-a-wake-up-call-to-munich-security-conference/\">speech at this year’s Munich Security Conference</a>, a gathering that draws a similar crowd to Aspen, the now-VP candidate described his view that continued military support to Ukraine is a dead end as representing “the majority of American public opinion, even though I don’t represent the majority of opinion of senators who come to Munich.” (For what it’s worth, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/05/08/views-of-ukraine-and-u-s-involvement-with-the-russia-ukraine-war/\">recent polls</a> show a majority of Americans still support continuing or increasing aid to Ukraine, though there’s a stark partisan divide.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speaking to Vox, Coons dismissed the notion that an internationalist foreign policy might be a tough sell to voters. “The strength of our alliances around the world have been the linchpins of our security and our prosperity for decades,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But on stage, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, an exemplar of a previous generation of globally-focused Republicans who have now all but vanished, was a bit contrite. “Those of us who were internationalists and believed in globalization” didn’t always take into account the impact it would have on some American communities, she said. “There are unemployed coal miners and unemployed steelworkers and kids who can’t get a decent education who really do wonder why we are doing what we’re doing internationally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At gatherings like Aspen, there’s always discussion about the importance of winning over international partners to American foreign policy priorities. Increasingly, there’s a sense in these conversations that America itself also has to be won over, whoever is at the top of the Democratic ticket. But as anyone who has read Mann’s book knows, the Magic Mountain can be a tough place to get down from.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

His poll numbers in swing states have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/new-polls-show-biden-slipping-further-behind-trump-in-critical-swing-states\">fallen sharply</a> in recent weeks, while the Democrats’ <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/rnc-trump-speech-biden-election-2024/card/polling-report-shows-biden-losses-extending-beyond-swing-states-t3KKgzxLEFQqNT5WuCtI\">internal data</a> has shown Trump only narrowly trailing in blue states such as Minnesota, New Mexico, and New Jersey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plenty of candidates in American history have closed larger polling gaps than Biden’s in a campaign’s last four months. But in recent weeks, the president <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360277/biden-nato-press-conference-democrats\">demonstrated</a> a gross inability to effectively communicate, with each public performance generating multiple misstatements or brain freezes that reinforced the public’s doubts about his cognitive functioning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden was undoubtedly right to step aside, but the wisdom of his decision to immediately endorse Harris — rather than clearing the way for a more open competition for the nomination at next month’s convention — is less clear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, the vice president has many liabilities as a candidate, and the Democrats boast multiple popular swing-state governors whose hypothetical nomination might ease the party’s path to an Electoral College majority. Given the stakes of keeping Trump out of power, Democratic convention delegates may have been justified in picking whichever ticket seemed most likely to bring victory in November.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, I think Biden made the right call. If there were some mechanism for instantly achieving party unity around nominating Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — or one of the party’s other top-tier talents — then Democrats would be wise to take it. But no such mechanism exists.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Failing to rally around Harris would have left Democrats bereft of a nominee until late August, giving Trump a month to campaign unopposed. And the vice president would have been highly likely to prevail at that convention anyway, given her official status as Biden’s heir apparent and the democratic legitimacy that comes with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At this point, it is unlikely that the most promising candidates on the Democratic bench would have chosen to compete, given the risks of alienating key constituencies within the party and the widespread sense that Republicans will be favored to win in November, irrespective of whom the Democrats nominate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden made a mistake in seeking a second term. And he made another by refusing to bow out swiftly once the debate made his unfitness plain. But on Sunday, he did the best he could to reverse some of the damage. It’s now incumbent on Harris — and all other Democrats — to put together a campaign strong enough to reverse the rest.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The (reasonable but probably wrong) case against Kamala</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before examining why endorsing Harris was (probably) the right call, it’s worth taking stock of the case for an open convention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That argument boils down to three fundamental claims: 1) Harris is not an especially strong candidate, 2) nominating the vice president prevents Democrats from getting a clean break from Biden’s vulnerabilities, and 3) the party has several strong alternative candidates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All these claims seem right to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris currently has a net disapproval rating of <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">roughly negative 12 percent.</a> And her electoral track record is unimpressive.&nbsp; In her first <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Attorney_General_election,_2010\">statewide election in 2010</a>, Harris beat a Republican in the race for California attorney general by less than 1 percentage point (two years earlier, Barack Obama had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election_in_California\">bested John McCain</a> by more than 23 points in that state). In 2020, Harris began her run for the Democratic nomination with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-more-billionaire-donors-than-any-other-democratic-candidate-2019-11\">strong fundraising</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/kamala-harris-first-good-month-poll-of-the-week/index.html\">early surge in the polls</a>. Yet her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Further, as a Californian whose Senate <a href=\"https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris\">voting record</a> put her on the left wing of her caucus, Harris is not an ideal figurehead for a party anxious to appeal to Trump-curious Midwesterners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/359620/kamala-harris-2020-president-campaign-2024-failure-lesson\">What happened last time Harris ran for president</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/362043/kamala-harris-vice-running-mate-democratic-presidential-ticket\">Who could be Harris’s running mate?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361750/biden-drop-out-harris-endorse-polls-against-trump-democrats-dnc\">Does Harris give Democrats a better chance in 2024?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">Why is everyone talking about Harris and coconut trees?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee\">Harris’s strengths and vulnerabilities as a presidential candidate</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Making matters worse, Harris’s candidacy did <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">not fall out of a coconut tree.</a> It exists in the context of her current boss’s unpopularity and conspicuous cognitive decline. For many voters, Biden has become a byword for inflation and infirmity. A Democratic nominee with no connection to the Biden administration would have given the party distance from both of these liabilities: They would have faced much less of a compulsion to defend Biden’s record, while confronting few questions about their own hypothetical complicity in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-public-election-campaign-343a47bf\">concealing the president’s frailty</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On both these fronts, Harris could find herself saddled with her boss’s baggage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, the Democrats have some formidable politicians on their bench. Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer both boast <a href=\"https://www.wlns.com/news/poll-majority-of-michiganders-approve-of-whitmers-performance/\">majority</a> <a href=\"https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania-politics/josh-shapiro-pennsylvanias-most-popular-governor-at-this-point-in-term-poll/\">approval</a> in their critical swing states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats would likely be better off with one of those governors as their standard-bearer, all else being equal. But this does not mean that the party would have been better off holding a completely open convention.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>An open convention probably would have resulted in Harris’s nomination</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problems with withholding endorsements from Harris and pursuing an open convention are threefold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, the Democratic Party is poorly positioned to organize and legitimize a contested convention. It has been more than half a century since the Democrats chose a nominee through convention wrangling, rather than purely through the primary process. In that time, the institutional structure of the party has dramatically changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the mid-20th century, Democratic delegates consisted in no small part of the leaders of trade unions and urban machines — individuals who were directly accountable to mass constituencies. This made it possible for them to credibly speak on behalf of key Democratic voting blocs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, since contested conventions were routine occurrences in American politics at that time, there was a great deal of institutional knowledge about how to broker such competitions and reach consensus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, by contrast, Democratic delegates are largely volunteers who speak for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jamelle-bouie.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jamelle-bouie.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">no one beyond the primary voters</a> in their areas. In this context, a contested convention could be chaotic, and its nominee lacking in democratic legitimacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be sure, anointing Harris is not especially democratic either. She was not elected by primary voters, any more than any other non-Biden Democrat. But the US electorate did vote to make her the president’s heir apparent, and this gives her a source of legitimacy that any other selection would lack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, and more importantly, failing to coalesce behind a nominee today would have left Democrats without a standard-bearer for a month. This would inhibit fundraising, at a time when the Trump-Vance ticket is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/fundraising-july-election-trump-biden/\">taking in serious cash</a>. And it would mean ceding swing-state airwaves to the Republican message — or else, running exclusively negative advertising — for the next four weeks. This is especially risky in a context where Democrats face the challenge of introducing a new nominee to the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Biden’s default replacement, having been elected to fill in for him in the event of his death or disability, Harris was uniquely capable of becoming her party’s consensus nominee in the absence of a protracted process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, Harris would have been highly likely to win an open convention, anyway. Before Biden dropped out, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn — a highly influential member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) — let it be known that he would favor Harris were Biden to drop out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Due to her uniquely high name recognition, meanwhile, Harris would likely outperform any other individual Democratic candidate in opinion polls. And as such polls, in combination with her title, rendered her the frontrunner for the nomination, various Democratic interest groups would have had an incentive to line up behind her, so as to ensure their influence in the likely Democratic nominee’s hypothetical administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Assuming that congressional caucuses, Democratic interest groups, and poll respondents did indeed all indicate their preference for Harris, Democratic delegates would almost certainly have felt compelled to back her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most critically, it seems unlikely that Shapiro, Whitmer, or other top-tier Democratic talents would have entered the fray in any case. For the reasons already stated, any non-Harris candidate would have faced an uphill battle for the nomination. And merely trying to win that nod would have come at the cost of potentially alienating constituencies that they would need to win during a future primary: A white candidate hoping to one day compete in the South Carolina primary might be wise to avoid being the person who tried and failed to block the first African-American vice president from claiming a nomination that was hers to inherit, at least from the perspective of some Black Democratic elected officials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, even if the gamble of challenging Harris paid off initially, the prize would ultimately have been the mixed-blessing of serving as the Democratic nominee in a year when the Republican ticket is favored. We cannot know exactly how polls and betting markets would have shifted had Democrats endorsed Shapiro or Whitmer. But Republicans have long held an advantage over Democrats this cycle <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/511979/neither-party-liked-gop-holds-advantage-issues.aspx#:~:text=GOP%20Holds%20Edge%20for%20Handling%20Americans'%20Top%20Worry&amp;text=Forty%2Dfour%20percent%20say%20the,same%20or%20have%20no%20preference.\">on the issues </a>most important to voters, chief of all inflation and immigration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the balance of risks and benefits here, an ambitious and promising younger Democrat might prefer to sit back and position themselves for 2028 or 2032. At the very least, no swing-state Democrat let word of their interest in potentially running leak in the weeks since Biden’s bad debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Harris may be stronger than she looks</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, although Harris has weaknesses, she is not devoid of political gifts. At 59, she is young by the standards of American politics. She is an able speaker, whose recent appearances have brimmed with more vitality and coherence than either Biden or Trump have mustered in years. Her recent remarks debunking the GOP’s claims of being the party of “unity” were especially effective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris does have a negative approval rating. But it is nevertheless <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">better than Biden’s</a>. And the public’s disapproval of her is less strongly held. As the political consultant Sarah Longwell <a href=\"https://x.com/SarahLongwell25/status/1814649334626971982\">has reported,</a> voters in focus groups tend to have a negative impression of Harris — but it is just that, an impression, rather than a deep-seated evaluation. They do not know much about her and are aware of that fact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, Harris’s political brand is essentially indistinguishable from Biden’s. Many of her detractors may therefore be simply giving pollsters their views of the president. Those who are actually familiar with Harris, meanwhile, may see her through the lens of her 2020 primary campaign, during which she joined many other Democratic candidates in a bidding war for the allegiance of the party’s left wing. Now that she has been vaulted directly into the general election, Harris has the opportunity to reintroduce herself to the public in a manner tailored to the sensibilities of swing voters by, among other things, leaning into her experience as a <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/kamala-harris-wrote-a-good-book-about\">“smart on crime</a>” prosecutor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, if she can nail her campaign’s rollout, it is possible that Harris would see her numbers significantly improve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Put all of this together and the case for uniting around Kamala is clear: Democrats can line up behind Biden’s logical successor today, put an end to their party’s internal chaos, and begin the work of rehabilitating Harris’s image — or they can pursue a path that likely ends with the same outcome, only after a month of internal disorganization, discord, and subpar fundraising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The former isn’t a perfect option, but it was probably the best decision available to the Democrats at this late date. Joe Biden deserves credit for making it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The new doctrine specifically allows for a nuclear strike in response to a strike with conventional weapons — like the longer-range missiles Ukraine now has permission to use — if those attacks involved the “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898\">participation or support of a nuclear power,</a>” likely referring to the US and other NATO countries.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear\">Throughout the war</a>, Russian leaders have threatened to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin\">use the country’s nuclear weapons</a> in the conflict if they believed they were necessary. That has led Ukraine’s allies to be cautious about the amount of aid they’ve offered, and has led to limits on what Ukrainian troops can do with those weapons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ukraine’s new ability to use longer range missiles to strike Russian territory — and Putin’s confirmation of new nuclear rules — have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear\">again raised the question</a>: Could Russia’s war in Ukraine escalate into a nuclear conflict?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the war, experts have downplayed Russia’s appetite for nuclear conflict. But the rapid escalation of the conflict in recent weeks, and particularly Russia’s new nuclear doctrine, could mean that possibility is closer than before. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the chances that Ukraine’s new missile capabilities lead to nuclear escalation?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putins-nuclear-warnings-since-russia-invaded-ukraine-2024-03-13/\">Putin and other officials have made statements</a>, both explicit and oblique, that Russia might be pressed to use nuclear weapons. Most experts agree that the risk of<a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2024/02/putin-threatens-again-an-updated-timeline-of-commentary-on-potential-nuclear-escalation-of-the-russia-ukraine-war/\"> Russia using such weapons is low</a>, but it’s not negligible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A previous version of the doctrine Russia updated on Tuesday said the country would tap into its nuclear arsenal <a href=\"https://nuclearnetwork.csis.org/why-russia-is-changing-its-nuclear-doctrine-now/\">only under four circumstances</a>: receiving credible data of a ballistic missile attack; nuclear or other WMD attack against Russia or its allies; attacks on Russian nuclear infrastructure; or conventional weapons attacks that threaten “the very existence” of the Russian state. Under the new doctrine,<strong> </strong>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov  indicated attacks like Ukraine’s on Tuesday <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-ukraine-war-b5ee115aa2099fa247f630e16da861d8\">could trigger a nuclear response</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That change shouldn’t be taken as a response to Ukraine’s strike, however, Samuel Charap, distinguished chair in Russia and Eurasia policy and senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new doctrine “has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-vladimir-putin-ramps-up-nuclear-threats-signal-us-ukraine-nato-missiles-joe-biden/\">been in the works for a long time</a>,” Charap said. “The timing may be tied to the attack of decision, but the substance has been brewing for a while.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Putin and other officials have not, it seems, made major preparations to actually use nuclear weapons. However as the war continues, Putin and his officials’ threats have become clearer and have involved actually demonstrating nuclear capacity. As recently as July, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-are-tactical-nuclear-weapons-why-is-russia-holding-drills-2024-06-11/\">Russia and Belarus held joint military exercises</a> that demonstrated Russia’s tactical nuclear capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Initially, the US and NATO <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/bidens-green-light-highlights-the-diminishing-power-of-putins-red-lines/\">responded to Russia’s threats with caution</a>, denying Ukraine weapons or placing restrictions on their use. But over the past three years, as little has come of Putin’s threats of nuclear war and of war with NATO, Western countries have given Ukraine access to increasingly sophisticated weapons systems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Besides the risk of nuclear war, Ukraine’s allies have had to balance concerns that they might be more directly drawn into the conflict. Though Ukraine is not a member of the NATO military alliance, Putin has previously warned that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html\">permission to use longer-range missiles</a> (like those used Tuesday) inside Russia would be considered a NATO attack on Russia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898\">US officials speaking to the Associated Press</a> said they had anticipated a response from Russia, but that Russian officials’ warnings were viewed as inflammatory rhetoric, and would not provoke any change in US action. That suggests the US does not believe there’s much danger in Russia using its nuclear capabilities in the near term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Russia “never explicitly, on the official level, warned that they would use nuclear weapons in response to X, Y, or Z,” Charap said. “The only explicit red line that they&#8217;ve ever drawn was on the use of long range, US [or] Western weapons to strike into Russia that has now been crossed. So I can imagine people will expect their response, and it will not just be with words.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After 1,000 days of the war, the conflict appears to be approaching an impasse. There’s no clear path to decisive victory for either side. Each side is deploying new tactics to try to gain an advantage: Ukraine with longer range missiles; Russia with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo\">recruits from North Korea</a>. And now, Russia and the US seem to be simply responding to each others’ escalations: Russia put North Korean troops on the battlefield, the US responded by authorizing the use of longer range missiles, and Russia released its new nuclear posture. That sort of behavior is both reckless and dangerous, Charap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You are in a spiral that is the definition of a tit-for-tat dynamic, where your actions are driven not by your goals, but by countering what the other guy is doing,” Charap said. “That only goes in one direction — continuing to up the ante. The spiral dynamic just continues until somebody gets out of control or somebody decides to stop it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

If the name Big Justice doesn’t sound familiar, the results from the election may have been a total shock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Back in March, a Florida-based father-and-son duo named A.J. and Big Justice posted a TikTok expressing their enthusiasm for Costco Wholesale and its food court items. The pair — as well as their extended universe of relatives and non-relatives, like the Rizzler — have since become viral sensations, cementing their internet celebrity status with an appearance on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pl6Dg0YB3w\"><em>The</em> <em>Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Costco Guys, the Rizzler, and this whole kind of straight-bro-coded mediaverse is a stand-in for how siloed media consumption on the left has gotten,” says Vox’s senior politics reporter Christian Paz. As a result, Paz suggests, some progressives may have “missed a bit of the political evolution the country was going through.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It asks the question: Does the rise of the Costco Guys — who are in no way explicitly political — help explain a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/385292/pop-culture-maga-trump-election-morgan-wallen-post-malone-twisters-zach-bryan\">cultural landscape</a> shaped by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros\">straight bros</a> that presaged a Donald Trump win? Or is their presence on the internet something more innocuous, a throwback to the early days of YouTube when regular people would go viral and get airtime on <em>Ellen</em>? The answers are a little complicated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>A history of the Costco Guys cinematic universe&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While they officially became viral sensations back in March, the Costco Guys’ celebrity has been years in the making. Originally from New Jersey, the family’s patriarch, Andrew Befumo (a.k.a. A.J.), was a professional wrestler who went by “the American Powerchild Eric Justice” before he retired and went into mortgage lending. About a decade ago, he started a family YouTube channel, featuring his wife Erika, his daughter Ashley, and his son Eric (a.k.a. Big Justice), called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@allbefumodup9624\">All Befumo’d Up</a>. The channel featured the sort of mundane if heartwarming content you might see on a slice-of-life reality show, like cooking meals, attending an <em>Avengers</em> screening, and singing Christmas songs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since 2022, Befumo has mostly been making videos on TikTok (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo?lang=en\">@a.j.befumo</a>) with Eric — who he nicknamed Big Justice after his wrestling persona — with occasional appearances from Ashley and Erika, “The Mother of Big Justice.” Early videos show the father and son attending baseball games and reviewing local restaurants using their food review scale known as the “boom meter.” Delicious foods get a “boom!” Underwhelming or flat-out gross foods get a “doom!” — which is rare.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They also recorded themselves running regular errands, like going to retail chains, with an unusual amount of enthusiasm. However, it’s that level of excitement in depicting the suburban, middle-class experience that’s part of their draw. While many famous vloggers are filming tropical vacations and helicopter rides, the Costco Guys treat a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7190051902590340398\">trip to Party City</a> like a special occasion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7341463847108152606\" data-video-id=\"7341463847108152606\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@a.j.befumo\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo?refer=embed\">@a.j.befumo</a> <p>We’re Costco Guys‼️ <a title=\"costco\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/costco?refer=embed\">#costco</a> <a title=\"father\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/father?refer=embed\">#father</a> <a title=\"son\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/son?refer=embed\">#son</a> <a title=\"family\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/family?refer=embed\">#family</a> <a title=\"bigjustice\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bigjustice?refer=embed\">#bigjustice</a> <a title=\"boom\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/boom?refer=embed\">#boom</a></p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - A.J. &#038; Big Justice\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7341464073617427230?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; A.J. &#038; Big Justice</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These videos raked up hundreds of thousands of views and earned them some sponsorship deals. However, it wasn’t until this past spring that their affinity for Costco would give them a ticket to internet stardom. On March 1, they posted their own version of the viral <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/were-x-of-course-we-y\">“We’re X, of course we Y” trend</a> about their love for the wholesale chain. “We’re Costco guys,” says Big Justice at the beginning of the video. “Of course we go shopping while eating a chicken bake.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By July, they released a Beastie Boys-esque theme <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7390004338837523754?lang=en\">song</a>, featuring Erika and Ashley, called “We Bring the Boom” that now has 14.4 million views. Since then, they’ve incorporated Costco and their extremely limited food court menu into much of their content, having guests rate the store’s “double chunk chocolate cookie” and come with them on shopping trips. They’ve released several remixes of “We Bring the Boom,” including a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7437627643073137966\">Christmas edition</a> most recently. Ashley and Erika also emerged from the background of A.J. and Big Justice’s videos, creating their own page in October, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@ashleyandmamajustice?lang=en\">@ashleyandmamajustice</a>, where they mostly rank and review desserts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite how normal these guys seem, viewers still feel like they’re watching something off-kilter and idiosyncratic. They have a wide-eyed, unflinching gaze — almost like they’re being held hostage and forced to read off a teleprompter — when staring into the camera. While you could argue that their zeal is earnest, their mannerisms are unnatural and stilted. The rap songs are inarguably cringe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7439079125026934059\" data-video-id=\"7439079125026934059\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@a.j.befumo\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo?refer=embed\">@a.j.befumo</a> <p>Jingle BOOM! 💥🎄<a title=\"christmas\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/christmas?refer=embed\">#christmas</a> <a title=\"song\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/song?refer=embed\">#song</a> <a title=\"dance\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dance?refer=embed\">#dance</a> <a title=\"father\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/father?refer=embed\">#father</a> <a title=\"son\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/son?refer=embed\">#son</a> <a title=\"mother\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mother?refer=embed\">#mother</a> <a title=\"daughter\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/daughter?refer=embed\">#daughter</a> <a title=\"family\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/family?refer=embed\">#family</a> <a title=\"fun\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fun?refer=embed\">#fun</a> <a title=\"bigjustice\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bigjustice?refer=embed\">#bigjustice</a> <a title=\"boom\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/boom?refer=embed\">#boom</a> @ItzTheRizzler @Sallyslices @Cody Chows @H00PIFY @The Makeshift Project @Cousin Angelo @Joe Felix @Real Santa Claus @Highland Bros @jerseyyjoe </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - A.J. &#038; Big Justice\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7439079103313136430?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; A.J. &#038; Big Justice</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the months since their initial virality, the “Costco boys” label has extended beyond the Befumo family to include some of their most frequent collaborators. Most notable among them is <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itztherizzler?lang=en\">the Rizzler</a> (a.k.a Christian Joseph), a kid influencer whose father began posting videos of him on TikTok in 2020. His father dubbed him the Rizzler, based on the slang term “rizz” that’s short for charisma. He’s since popularized the “rizz face,” a half-serious-half-smirking look similar to the alt-right meme/pose known as the <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/chad-facing-gen-z-lip-sync-face\">“Chad face”</a> or more broadly the “Gen Z Lip Sync Face.” A.J. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@costcoguysfootage/video/7437699620232449326\">said in an interview</a> that a TikTok of the Rizzler joking around while wearing an ill-fitting Black Panther costume led him to contact the Rizzler’s father about collaborating. Other frequent guest stars include <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@yourcousinangelo?lang=en\">cousin Angelo</a>, who may or may not actually be related to the Befumo family, and a TikTok dancer named <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jerseyyjoe?lang=en\">Jersey Joe</a> who posts videos dancing to Jersey Club music.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do the Costco Guys really belong to the “bro internet”?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since their rise to prominence, the Costco Guys have earned a questionable reputation on social media as <a href=\"https://x.com/akingofburbank/status/1858202143334752604\">alleged</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/dominicknero/status/1854680391707230226\">Trump</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/abracaddavid/status/1855478745185784141\">supporters</a> if not avatars for an increasingly MAGA-fied internet. The evidence is mostly superficial. They live in Florida. They spend much of their time in the big-box stores closely identified with the suburban American experience. Their logos and merch prominently feature the American flag.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s a lot of stuff about their content that is seemingly Republican-coded,” says EJ Dickson, senior culture writer at The Cut. “The main one is that they&#8217;re part of a demographic of white men in a state that overwhelmingly voted for Trump. The other aspect is the American flag imagery — very early on in their career. Actually, when A.J. was working in the mortgage industry, he was making content in front of an American flag.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other examples are more eyebrow-raising.&nbsp; Their fanbase —&nbsp;at least based on their account’s commenters — leans heavily white and male; comments on <a href=\"https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1846675777271611523\">one Costco Guys’ livestream</a> featured rows upon rows of the N-word in all-caps. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@impaulsive/video/7435041741549374762\">Logan Paul</a> knows about them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike Paul, though, the Befumo family has largely — and intentionally — avoided politics in their journey to fame. In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jxB2p7yLaw\">interview with internet reporter Taylor Lorenz</a>, A.J. said that they’ve been approached by presidential candidates to collaborate but that political content was “not in their wheelhouse.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Possible political affiliations aside, Dickson, who profiled A.J. and Big Justice for<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/aj-and-big-justice-costco-guys-tiktok-song-1235063207/\">Rolling Stone</a> in July, doesn&#8217;t think this accounts for all of their popularity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I do think people genuinely enjoy seeing this guy and his kid just being goofy and making this incredibly silly content together,” says Dickson. “A lot of people think their content is charming in its way.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She also argues that their videos may be more subversive than progressives online give them credit for: a father and son spending an immense amount of time together, showing each other affection and bonding over food. She compares them to bona fide right-wing personality Andrew Tate, who “built his brand in the thrall of his domineering and withholding father.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that A.J. is monetizing time with his family has not gone without criticism. A <a href=\"https://x.com/CensoredMen/status/1828472916520190250\">behind-the-scenes video</a> of A.J. sternly directing Big Justice in a video made the rounds in August and <a href=\"https://x.com/EPM106/status/1828869132449730707\">reinforced the assumption</a> by some that he’s a stage dad. Still, the image of fatherhood he promotes is adoring and hands-on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Even though [A.J.] performs masculinity with the way he looks and the workouts, he&#8217;s kind of doing the opposite by virtue of just clowning around on camera and spending a lot of time with his kid,” says Dickson.&nbsp;<br>Regardless, the Costco Guys do ultimately exist in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros\">lineage of influencers</a> and celebrities that draw straight, white, right-leaning male fans. Several moments this year have shown, from the conservative appropriation of <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2024/03/sydney-sweeney-snl-hooters-glen-powell.html\">Sydney Sweeney</a> to the overnight success of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/internet-culture/357813/hawk-tuah-girl-meme-tiktok-explained\">Hawk Tuah Girl</a>, that it’s not totally up to public figures to decide who they appeal to.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But he has nominated two of the document’s co-authors to Cabinet-level positions, and many others served in his first administration, which suggests the document may be a window into what the next four years could bring.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Monday, Trump nominated Brendan Carr, who wrote Project 2025’s chapter on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to head the agency. He has also appointed Tom Homan, a Heritage Foundation fellow named as a contributor to Project 2025, as his so-called “border czar.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/politics/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation.html\">Eighteen of the 40 co-authors and editors</a><strong> </strong>of the report served in the first Trump administration. Among them are Ken Cuccinelli, former acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security; Christopher Miller, former acting Defense secretary; and Russell T. Vought, former director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought is reportedly being considered for<a href=\"https://x.com/KFaulders/status/1858834604355989917\"> another top post in the coming administration</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the 2024 campaign, Democrats sought to tie Trump to Project 2025 — a policy agenda they decried as “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/house-democrats-project-2025-00182601\">dangerous</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/house-democrats-project-2025-00182601\">shockingly radical</a>” — framing it as a blueprint for his second term that is much more detailed than the <a href=\"https://prod-static.gop.com/media/RNC2024-Platform.pdf?_gl=1*llhkp8*_gcl_au*MTgwODMxODIyOC4xNzMxNjg2NDM2&amp;_ga=2.200856430.1597472303.1731861841-1459843538.1731686436\">GOP’s 28-page platform</a>. The document focuses on proposals to expand presidential power, gut the federal bureaucracy, enact the priorities of the religious right, deregulate, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump at one point <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1809249601595318585\">claimed</a> to have “no idea who is behind it” and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/09/11/highlights-debate-memorable-lines-trump-harris/\">denied any connection with it</a> when asked about it at the September presidential debate: “I have nothing to do with Project 2025. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it purposely. I’m not going to read it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, since Trump’s reelection, some of his allies have suggested that the document was <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/188097/steve-bannon-donald-trump-project-2025\">always intended to be the playbook for his second term</a>. Trump’s nominations of Carr and Homan seem to support that idea. Neither will <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/17/brendan-carr-fcc-trump-pick-00190075\">require additional Senate confirmation</a> to take on their roles; through them, they will be in a position to advocate for Project 2025’s ideas on communications and immigration, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s what we know about Carr and Homan and the ideas relevant to their posts outlined in Project 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Brendan Carr</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carr, a pick <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/11/18/how-elon-musk-could-benefit-from-trumps-fcc-nominee-brendan-carr/\">approved by Trump’s billionaire backer Elon Musk,</a> currently serves as the senior Republican on the FCC and was previously its general counsel. Now, he is set to take the helm, steering the commission toward a hardline stance against Big Tech and what he describes in Project 2025 as its “attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among his key proposals in Project 2025 is ending legal immunities for internet platforms hosting user-generated content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That would require stricter content moderation on the part of these platforms or cutbacks to the degree to which users can contribute content, fundamentally changing the way people interact online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, he wrote in Project 2025 that he wants to ensure that “Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor protected speech.” That echoes some of Trump’s other Cabinet picks who are seeking to crack down on “<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-wants-end-wokeness-education-051819573.html\">wokeness</a>” in their respective agencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carr also supports <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24094839/tiktok-ban-bill-congress-pass-biden\">efforts to block</a> TikTok in the US, identifying it, along with the Chinese smartphone producer Huawei, as a national security threat. He claims in Project 2025 that TikTok is part of a Chinese “foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.” However, there are reasons to believe that a TikTok ban would, as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/24100104/banning-tiktok-us-senate-ineffective-and-harmful-bill\">Vox previously reported</a>, have “serious consequences for online expression,” which include shutting down what has proved a hub for activism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carr may have some difficulty enacting his agenda initially, however. The commission will have a 3-2 Democratic majority until next June when Trump will be able to nominate a new member.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Tom Homan</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homan isn’t named as an author of a particular chapter of Project 2025 but as an overall contributor —&nbsp;and some of his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation\">stated hardline views on immigration and the border</a> are reflected in the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He started out as a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and worked his way up through the immigration agencies, becoming the head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s removal operations arm under former President Barack Obama. There, he presided over the most immigrants ever deported in a single year, exceeding 400,000. Under Trump, Homan served as acting director of ICE but was never confirmed to the position permanently by the Senate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homan’s new role as “border czar” appears to involve far-reaching responsibilities. Those include overseeing the implementation of Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">mass deportations policy</a> — the centerpiece of the former president’s immigration agenda.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means Homan’s responsibilities will likely intersect with many of the numerous immigration priorities outlined in Project 2025. Here is a non-exhaustive list of what’s included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expanding the use of a legal authority known as “expedited removal” to quickly deport immigrants who crossed the border without authorization.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Deporting immigrants even in currently protected, sensitive zones like churches.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ending large-scale parole programs that the Biden administration has relied upon as a deportation shield for individuals from certain countries, including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ending programs like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating a new legal authority akin to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/23719941/title-42-ending-border-biden-trump\">Title 42 policy</a>, which was implemented by Trump and maintained by Biden to rapidly expel immigrants arriving on the US southern border on the <a href=\"https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/programs/program-forced-migration-health/voices/epidemiologists-public-health-experts-reiterate-urgent-call-end-title-42\">dubious public health grounds</a> of stopping the spread of Covid-19.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homan has yet to indicate whether he or Trump fully endorses these policies. But unlike Trump, who claims to have never read Project 2025, Homan put his name to the document, and could draw from it in his new role.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In the early to mid-20th century, scientists developed <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/vaccines\">vaccines</a> that effectively eliminated the risk of anyone getting sick or dying from illnesses that had killed millions over millennia of human history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vaccines, alongside sanitized water and antibiotics, have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38798-z#:~:text=Vaccines%20have%20revolutionized%20modern%20medicine,their%20impact%20on%20disease%20prevention.\">marked the epoch of modern medicine</a>. The US was at <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27375/w27375.pdf\">the cutting edge of eliminating these diseases</a>, which helped propel life expectancy and economic growth in the postwar era. Montana native <a href=\"https://hillemanfilm.com/dr-hilleman\">Maurice Hilleman</a>, the so-called father of modern vaccines, developed flu shots, hepatitis shots, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the 1950s and ’60s, which became virtually universally adopted among Americans.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Vaccines effectively eliminated some of the 20th century&#039;s most infectious diseases\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Rpqv0/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"423\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Smallpox, the most common form of which has <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221063/#:~:text=There%20are%20five%20known%20classifications,97%20percent%20case%20fatality%20rate.\">a 30 percent fatality rate</a>, has been <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/index.html\">eradicated</a>. Mitch McConnell, Republican titan of the Senate, may be the last major public figure <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29908203\">still afflicted by a childhood case of polio</a>, less than a century after <a href=\"https://www.fdrlibrary.org/polio\">it paralyzed</a> a sitting American president. Measles likely infected millions of people annually in the US in the 1800s, although precise estimates from the era are hard to come by. In the early 1990s, thousands of people <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6878996/#:~:text=In%20the%20early%20decades%20of,reported%20in%20the%20United%20States.\">died</a> from the disease every year. It was still infecting <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/209448\">more than half a million and killing hundreds per year on average</a> in the 1950s and ’60s, before the vaccine debuted. Diphtheria, a deadly respiratory infection, killed more than 1,800 people annually between 1936 and 1945 as the vaccine against it was still being rolled out. It has not killed anybody in the United States in decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The vaccines that made this possible are among the most important achievements in human history. And yet many Americans appear to be losing faith in them, a worrying trend that could accelerate if President-elect Donald Trump succeeds in handing control of the top US health agency <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health/385541/rfk-jr-trump-hhs-vaccines-fluoride\">into the hands of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, the country’s foremost vaccine denier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy has spent much of his public career pushing the thoroughly <a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/autism\">debunked</a> theory of a link between autism and childhood vaccines. He has <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/\">supported</a> an anti-vaccine group in Samoa, where measles vaccination rates have since fallen off; a 2019 outbreak <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-global-health-samoa-kennedy/\">killed</a> 83 people just a few months after Kennedy visited the island and met with anti-vaccine advocates. He has likewise <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/politics/robert-kennedy-covid-vaccine-antisemitism/index.html\">cast doubt</a> on the safety and efficacy of the Covid vaccines, a position that helped nudge the lifelong Democrat toward Trump. After Kennedy dropped his own presidential campaign this year, he became Trump’s most influential health adviser and last week was nominated by the president-elect to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The day after Trump’s election, Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955\">insisted</a> he would not “take away anybody’s vaccines.” Instead, he said, he planned to compile vaccine safety information so that people could make their own decisions. But vaccine safety has been extensively studied — and the negative effects Kennedy claims <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/autism/faq/index.html\">remain undetected</a>. (Others in Trump’s orbit have <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-10-31/rfk-jr-wants-federal-health-data-so-he-can-show-vaccines-are-unsafe-trump-transition-co-chair-says\">stated</a> that Kennedy will nevertheless use whatever information he finds to try to pull vaccines from the market.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts fear that his appointment will validate his anti-vaccine attitudes —&nbsp;and exacerbate the public’s growing ambivalence toward these vital public health measures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As long-accepted, lifesaving public health measures increasingly become politically polarized, routine vaccination rates are <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/?utm_campaign=KFF-Covid&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_3P_iz266TOhPvf-NtGUHduQ39FGNRP47RiDP28gQOeYEbGXlMjpVZMTzhgEu_YcqZbEGDvcQz7M1-R2LmpLWUdPHOMQ&amp;_hsmi=334423251&amp;utm_content=334423251&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">rapidly declining in much of the US</a>. In the 2019–2020 school year, three states had less than 90 percent of K–12 students vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella. By the 2023–2024 school year, 14 states had fallen below that threshold. The number of states with more than 95 percent of schoolchildren vaccinated — the preferred level of coverage to prevent outbreaks — dropped from 20 to 11 during that same period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is no surprise then that the number of US measles cases <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/global-measles-cases-rise-health-officials-tell-us-what-la-county-is-doing-right-vaccine/15546618/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20reports,compared%20to%20four%20in%202023.\">more than quadrupled</a> from 2023 to 2024. Nobody has died of measles in the US <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-cases-states-2024-more-than-2023/\">since 2015</a>, but if vaccination rates continue to decline, this highly contagious disease (one person can infect <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757186/#:~:text=For%20measles%2C%20R0%20is,in%20a%20totally%20susceptible%20population.\">more than a dozen other people</a>) will spread with increasing ease, which raises the risk that American kids could die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We know how to prevent that.

But ending it may not be as easy as he’s promised.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under a longstanding interpretation of the Constitution and federal law, children born in the US automatically become American citizens, even if their parents are undocumented. Trump, however, has <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1663537082633953282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1663537082633953282%7Ctwgr%5E46e931ec2a8922d37b9d8ab8db1d1756825905ae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F2024-election%2Flitigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314\">promised that</a>, “On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward, the children of illegal immigrants will not receive automatic US citizenship.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Specifically, that executive order would <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1663537082633953282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1663537082633953282%7Ctwgr%5E46e931ec2a8922d37b9d8ab8db1d1756825905ae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F2024-election%2Flitigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314\">mandate</a> that at least one parent must be a US citizen or green card holder for their child to qualify for automatic citizenship. Federal agencies would be directed to deny passports, Social Security numbers, and public benefits to children with two undocumented parents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The executive order would almost certainly be challenged in court. Though it’s impossible to say what the Supreme Court may ultimately decide, history and precedent isn’t on Trump’s side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think that birthright citizenship is such a bedrock principle of American law that of all the things on the Trump agenda, this is the one least likely to be successful,” said Hiroshi Motomura, a professor at UCLA School of Law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1663537082633953282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1663537082633953282%7Ctwgr%5E46e931ec2a8922d37b9d8ab8db1d1756825905ae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F2024-election%2Flitigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314\">has framed the policy as a solution</a> to “birth tourism” — when pregnant people travel to the US to give birth in order to secure US citizenship for their child — and a means of removing a pull factor for unauthorized immigration, which has <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/01/migrant-encounters-at-u-s-mexico-border-have-fallen-sharply-in-2024/\">sharply declined</a> at the southern border in 2024. The policy also reflects Trump’s longtime efforts to assert a particular vision of what it means to be American in an era when the US’s <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-census-data-shows-the-nation-is-diversifying-even-faster-than-predicted/\">white population is declining</a>. In his first term, he reportedly eschewed immigration from “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-referred-haiti-african-countries-shithole-nations-n836946\">shithole countries</a>,” referring to Haiti and African countries. And he has more recently claimed that immigrants are “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-immigrants-are-poisoning-blood-country-biden-campaign-liken-rcna130141\">poisoning the blood</a>” of the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear how many people could be impacted by the policy. However, about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation\">5.5 million American citizen children</a> currently live in mixed-status households, some of them with two undocumented parents, which would have made them ineligible for automatic US citizenship under Trump’s proposed policy. That suggests that the affected population of future children born in the US could be large.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP8713373625\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What the law says</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prevailing belief among legal experts is that ending birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment, that there is not enough support in Congress to pass one, and that Trump’s proposed executive order would not hold up in court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“President Trump cannot do this,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean at Berkeley Law school. “President Trump cannot change the Constitution by executive order.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He said that ending birthright citizenship by executive order contravenes the 14th Amendment, which was adopted after the Civil War to ensure that formerly enslaved people would be considered US citizens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 14th Amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chemerinsky said that this has “always been understood to mean that all born in the United States (or naturalized as citizens) are United States citizens,” in addition to any individuals under US jurisdiction abroad, such as children born to US military personnel in foreign countries. The phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” was intended to exclude only Native Americans born on tribal land as well as children of enemy occupiers and foreign diplomats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in <em>United States v. Wong Kim Ark</em> “makes clear that those born in the United States are citizens,” Chemerinsky added. That case concerned a child born in California to Chinese immigrants who were lawful permanent residents of the US. At the time, no Chinese citizens were allowed to become naturalized US citizens under the Chinese Exclusion Acts. The court ruled that the child was a US citizen because he was born in the US, even though his parents were noncitizens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Can Trump ban birthright citizenship anyway?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right-wing immigration hawks have argued that the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” clause ought to be interpreted differently to exclude children of unauthorized immigrants from the benefits of automatic citizenship. The clause, they argue, was meant to exclude anyone who had any loyalties to a foreign power, including citizens of other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even some of Trump’s allies — including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/litigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314\">Mark Krikorian</a>, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigrant think tank — appear to acknowledge that he would face an uphill battle in court to realize his plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think it would be immediately challenged in the courts, and I think that the challenge would have all of the history and the origins of the statute behind it,” Motomura said. “I can&#8217;t predict what any court will actually do, but I think the historical record is so clear.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, if Trump succeeds in enacting his executive order, its impact would be far-reaching. Birthright citizenship has served as an “engine of integration” for immigrant populations in the US, and ending it would also undermine America’s cultural identity as an “inclusive immigrant society,” Motomura said, adding that it would hit people of Mexican and Central American origin the hardest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That aspect can&#8217;t be ignored,” Motomura said. “It&#8217;s the resurrection of the use of US citizenship rules with a real racial impact, and I think an intentional racial impact.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As a kid, her father attempted to buy her presents, but he so often missed the mark that he transitioned to giving her money by the time she was a teen, Zhang, 30, says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the start of their relationship, her husband wasn’t much better. A few of his greatest gift misses included a massage gun and a food scale. They couldn’t return the massage gun, Zhang says, so she kept it. As for the scale, the couple took it back and shopped for a replacement together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite his gifting shortcomings, Zhang’s husband refuses to give money as a gift, she says. As a compromise, she maintains a comprehensive wish list from which he can select items that are sure to please.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Zhang grew up in China, where giving monetary gifts during holidays and special events <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-institutional-economics/article/abs/money-or-inkind-gift-evidence-from-red-packets-in-china/935592457DFC22EFA20C4AF1F7E489DA\">is customary</a>. “During Father&#8217;s Day, I probably will give my dad money,” says Zhang, who is now based outside of Seattle. “With money, it&#8217;s guaranteed that you can use it. Probably you want it, you can spend it, or you can save it.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Who wants to put a dollar amount on a priceless relationship?&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the fact that giving cash as a present is not only normative but preferred in other countries like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/business/asian-weddings-cash-gifts.html\">Korea and Japan</a>, in the US and other Western cultures, the exchange is <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1093/ei/40.3.415\">sometimes seen as gauche</a>. Cash is easy, quick, and, most of all, practical since almost everyone could use a little more of it. But for those same reasons, money can be seen as thoughtless, or worse, an implication the gift recipient really, really needs it — more than the candle warmer or the novelty socks you picked out in a panic on Christmas Eve. After all, who wants to put a dollar amount on a priceless relationship?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if you were to ask recipients what they actually want for the holidays, the answer is clear: Cash is king. A <a href=\"https://business.yougov.com/content/48219-global-show-me-the-money-people-would-be-most-excited-to-be-gifted-cash-this-holiday-season\">December 2023 YouGov survey</a> found 38 percent of global respondents said they’d prefer to get cash for the holidays — the largest share of potential presents. Another 10 percent said they wanted gift cards. The MassMutual Consumer Spending &amp; Saving Index from 2022 found similar results: <a href=\"https://www.massmutual.com/global/media/shared/doc/Q4_2022_consumer_survey\">31 percent of Americans said their ideal gift was cash</a>; 16 percent said their dream present was a gift card.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The chasm between what people really want — money — and what givers feel comfortable gifting — pretty much anything else — has led gift-givers to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/upshot/an-economist-goes-christmas-shopping.html\">waste millions of dollars</a> on <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/104699/original/christmas.pdf\">unwanted or lackluster presents</a>. But you shouldn’t feel weird bestowing cash to your nearest and dearest, experts say. There are tactful ways to do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Americans have never liked giving cash gifts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans have long been leery of giving money to their loved ones for the holidays. In the 1993 book<em> </em><a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9780814792841/the-modern-christmas-in-america/\"><em>The Modern Christmas in America: A Cultural History of Gift Giving</em></a><em>, </em>William Waits writes that even though some magazines offered advice on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/07zelizer.html\">how to thoughtfully give money</a> in the early 20th century, the public found the practice “impersonal” and cold. “As a gift item,” Waits wrote, “[money] ascribed a certain numerical value to relationships but did not define the quality of the relationships.” Gift certificates posed the same problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/23/opinion/christmas-past-and-presents.html\">During that time,</a> rural Americans gifted their friends and family food and small handmade wooden or sewn presents. Those in cities swapped figurines, wall hangings, and other crafts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the 20th century, however, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/29/1059861668/why-americans-buy-so-much-stuff\">consumption and consumerism took root in the American psyche</a>. Businesses and department stores began to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-advertising-through-the-ages-has-shaped-christmas-129147\">heavily advertise their products during the holiday season</a>, encouraging shoppers to find the <a href=\"https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/06/00/82/00001/mleone-Melissa_Leone_Thesis.pdf\">perfect present behind their doors</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These days, the holiday shopping season seems to creep earlier and earlier with the goal of getting consumers to spend more and more, often on <a href=\"https://www.finder.com/banking/unwanted-gifts\">tangible, unwanted items</a> — a good portion of which <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/consumer/articles/17378-unwanted-holiday-gifts\">end up in the trash</a>. Nearly half of holiday shoppers begin their purchasing <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/news/early-holiday-shopping/#how-to-save-money-during-the-holidays-without-feeling-like-scrooge\">as early as August</a>, per a Bankrate survey. This year, Americans each plan to spend over <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/holiday-tips-news/2024-holiday-spending-report\">$900 on holiday gifts</a>, up from about <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/2023-holiday-shopping-report\">$800 last year</a>, according to NerdWallet’s annual holiday spending report.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-166422697.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A hand wearing a white glove and a Santa-Claus-style red sleeve with a white fluffy cuff holds out a fan of $100 bills. \" title=\"A hand wearing a white glove and a Santa-Claus-style red sleeve with a white fluffy cuff holds out a fan of $100 bills. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why giving cash is so uncomfortable</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Americans might be <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/average-cost-of-an-american-christmas.aspx\">spending more on holiday gifts</a>, or at least urged to, they aren’t necessarily choosing presents that are sure to delight the recipient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When shopping, givers often choose an item that says more about themselves than it does the recipient, says <a href=\"https://directory.sju.edu/ernest-baskin\">Ernest Baskin</a>, an associate professor of food, pharma, and health care at Saint Joseph’s University. Givers are <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2016/december/gift-study.html\">preoccupied with the “wow” factor</a>, research shows, a present that says, “Look how well I know you to have selected this thoughtful, meaningful item.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Most of the time, we&#8217;re not right about this, to be honest,” Baskin says. “Most of the time, [recipients] can tell you very well what their desire is, or they&#8217;d rather you just give them money so they can pick what their desire is.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cash is practical — almost too practical —&nbsp;and givers tend to <a href=\"https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dbf9a-SJDM2015Submission_ER_EFW.pdf\">underestimate how much recipients appreciate useful</a>, ordinary presents, research suggests. Indeed, handing someone a card with a check inside is less exciting than watching their face light up at the sight of a puppy in a box. However, after the initial excitement fades, the pragmatic, boring gift gets the most use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cash is also seen as thoughtless and low-effort, says <a href=\"https://juliangivi.wixsite.com/juliangivi\">Julian Givi</a>, associate professor of marketing at West Virginia University. Writing a check or hitting the ATM requires very little creative energy. “It&#8217;s really in no way personalized to you,” Givi says. “[Giving] 100 bucks to someone shows nothing about your knowledge of their hobbies, their interests, their passions, and so on.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Handing someone a card with a check inside is less exciting than watching their face light up at the sight of a puppy in a box.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The relationship between the giver and the receiver is also paramount in cash-giving scenarios. A grandparent tucking a $5 bill into a card for a kid is kosher, “but going up the age ladder is a little awkward,” Givi says. Think about it: How would grandma feel if you gave her $25 in cash?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cash gifts between friends is also tricky, says Lizzie Post, etiquette expert and co-president at the <a href=\"https://emilypost.com/\">Emily Post Institute</a>. That same $5 your aunt gives you every year is odd coming from a friend. There’s the implication that the receiver is in dire straits and perhaps needs the cash more than, say, a cashmere sweater. “We don&#8217;t often just hand our friends money,” Post says. “Instead, we go do something enriching with them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if the recipient explicitly requests cash, Americans still find it taboo to comply. Instead, givers have found ways to creatively disguise the act of bestowing money, especially through registries. To make the exchange more thoughtful, wedding or baby shower guests will often contribute to a honeymoon or diaper fund. Platforms like <a href=\"https://www.honeyfund.com/\">Honeyfund</a> and <a href=\"https://www.babylist.com/gp/babylist-diaper-fund/16619/338538\">Babylist</a> have facilitated these touchless cash gifts, eliminating the potential awkwardness of handing over a supposedly inconsiderate present.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“At the end of the day, that&#8217;s still just cash that you&#8217;re giving,” Baskin says, “but now you can say that I&#8217;m actually giving something that the couple needs.” Gift cards, too, are simply cash by another name, only restricted to specific stores.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Giving cash doesn’t have to be awkward</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite popular convention that cash presents are gauche, tacky, or uninspired, Post says the annals of etiquette wisdom permit monetary gifts. (Though she does find the practice of Venmoing money as a wedding gift a little crass.) The key is to make it thoughtful. Definitely include a card, Post says, and write a short note about how you hope they spend the dough: “Use this to buy those Taylor Swift concert tickets” or “Treat yourself to a massage.” As for the amount, consider your relationship with the recipient, but only give what is within your budget, Post says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Remember how awkward it would be to give grandma $25? Giving her a gift card to a grocery store is likely to go over better, Givi says, even if the dollar amount is the same. “You&#8217;re putting in some thoughtfulness to select something related to her and who she is,” Givi says. “Then also, you had to go out and buy this thing.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Definitely include a card, Post says, and write a short note about how you hope they spend the dough.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you feel so inclined as to ask for cash, offer the givers a few other options, Post says: “Someone asks you, ‘What do you want for Hanukkah?’ You could absolutely say to them, ‘I’m into these books. I&#8217;m into this sport. Anything to do with them is great. And of course, I&#8217;m always a fan of cash. Whatever is easiest for you to do.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Should you still lack gifting inspiration, ask yourself what gift you’d like to receive, Baskin, the Saint Joseph’s researcher, says. Is it embroidered socks or is it cold hard cash?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Baskin poses that same question to study participants, “the answer [that] often comes up,” he says, is “money.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

A <a href=\"https://civicscience.com/expected-holiday-gift-returns-up-47-this-year-led-by-gen-z/\">survey</a> from consumer research firm CivicScience showed that 28 percent of people had returned or exchanged a gift last year. According to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246622/christmas-gifts-desired-by-us-consumers/\">Statista</a>, the most wanted Christmas gift among US consumers is cold hard cash. The second most popular? Gift cards. The message seems to be: Thanks for the thought, but let me just choose what I want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over a single year, let alone an entire lifetime, you might amass a pile of stuff you won’t ever use, taking up valuable space in your home. Do you harden your heart and simply give all of it away? Do you attempt to return every unwanted item as soon as you receive it? What about the things that don’t spark joy, per se, but do have some sentimental value?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Standard etiquette advises us to remain gracious even in the face of laughably bad gifts, but research in the social psychology of gift-giving suggests we might be granting bad gift-givers too much benefit of the doubt. Sometimes, an ill-fitting gift is ill-fitting on purpose; it’s not mere miscommunication, but negative, even resentful communication. At the heart of solving this perennial problem is taking a good hard look at what motivates us to confer gifts unto others in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How to politely deal with well-meaning – but unwanted – gifts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The question of what to do with gifts you won’t use is a popular etiquette question “in a world of more and more consumer goods,” according to Daniel Post Senning, an etiquette expert at the Emily Post Institute. Generally, “gifts should be received in the same spirit of generosity that they’re given in,” Senning says. “If you don’t particularly appreciate the gift itself, the expectation is that you thank [them] for the effort or thought that went into it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With that in mind, Senning says that it’s not an etiquette cardinal sin to regift something if you know you can’t use it — for example, if you already happen to have the item. But you should avoid regifting anything handmade or personalized. “Beyond that, it’s about being upfront, ethical, honest” with the original gifter, if they ask, and the new recipient, Senning tells Vox. After all, a gift should be freely given with no obligations, and that includes the recipient having some choice in what they decide to do with the gift. (This is also a reminder to include a gift receipt whenever possible.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“One of my core beliefs is that everything comes into your life for a reason but that doesn’t mean you need to keep it forever.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even after the etiquette issue is resolved, it can be tricky figuring out which gifts you’ll no longer keep. “It’s usually easier to begin with items that have less sentimental value,” Juliet Landau-Pope, a productivity coach who has written about decluttering your home of <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/shopping-expert-handle-unwanted-christmas-gifts-1767643\">unwanted gifts</a>, tells Vox in an email. Larger items that take up a lot of space might be prime candidates for the initial decluttering, whether they’re going to be regifted or donated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s someone in your life who would appreciate a regift, you should <a href=\"https://emilypost.com/advice/the-etiquette-of-regifting\">ideally let them know</a> that you were given something you can’t use for insert-reason-here but would love to give them. Clothes — a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246589/holiday-gifts-to-be-bought-by-consumers-by-item/\">common</a> but often <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2005/12/why-clothes-make-a-terrible-gift.html\">miscalculated</a> gift — jewelry, and household goods can all go to a Goodwill location or a local family shelter. Furniture, appliances, and other household items can also be donated to <a href=\"https://www.habitat.org/restores/donate-goods\">Habitat for Humanity’s ReStore</a> program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One of my core beliefs is that everything comes into your life for a reason, but that doesn’t mean you need to keep it forever,” Landau-Pope says. Take the example of greeting and holiday cards, which may be piling up in your drawer or taking over your fridge. Landau-Pope’s policy is to keep handmade cards from her children, while displaying the others for a set period of time, taking a picture of the display, and then recycling them. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why so many of us get bad gifts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the ideal gift exchange scenario, we probably want to grace the people in our lives with gifts that will be met with undeniable enthusiasm. So why is it that we so often end up saddled with bad ones?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It might be an expectations mismatch: As Julian Givi, a marketing professor at West Virginia University, explains, “Whenever we’re gift-givers, we really focus on making people happy the moment that they’re opening the gift.” In order words, we prioritize the drama of a big reveal, as opposed to whether the gift is useful and valuable years down the road.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there are all the other unintentional ways we might give a bad gift. We might overestimate how passionate someone is about a hobby, sports team, or something else they once mentioned offhand. We might miss the mark simply because we don’t know enough about the other person; we wouldn’t guess in a million years that they have a bad childhood association with receiving hand-knit sweaters, for example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>We prioritize the drama of a big reveal, as opposed to whether the gift is useful and valuable years down the road.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, research shows there are more sinister motives for giving subpar gifts than we’d like to think. For one, some people know exactly what a recipient wants — maybe they have a gift registry — but they buy something else anyway because the options presented are boring to them personally, Givi says. Another selfish motivation his <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3379405\">research</a> has discovered: People resist choosing gifts (like, say, a nice pair of sunglasses) that are better than the versions they own, likely to avoid feeling envious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Deborah Cohn, a marketing professor at the New York Institute of Technology, has identified <a href=\"https://jcsdcb.com/index.php/JCSDCB/article/view/225\">five broad patterns</a> for how lousy gifts happen. On the more innocuous side is due to ritual and obligation. “You’re going to be at a party, you have to bring somebody something,” Cohn tells Vox. But you don’t know enough about them or just don’t want to expend the mental effort of figuring out what they’d really want, so you grab something perfunctory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A more aggressive (but all too common) type of bad gift-giving is when the gift is intended to impose a certain identity on the recipient. We’ve all heard stories about parents who only give dolls and dresses to their daughters, and Legos and video games to their sons. It’s not that these givers don’t understand what their individual children’s real preferences are — it’s that they want to foist their own desire upon the recipient.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This actually happened to me,” Cohn says. “Somebody gave me a book about a religion that I don’t ascribe to.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other typical bad gift-giving habits stem from pure self-centeredness, like picking out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuk08z/aita_for_not_appreciating_a_gift_from_my_husband/\">headphones for your spouse</a> that you intend to use or wanting bragging rights for presenting the splashiest (read: most expensive) gift at the party. These kinds of gift-giving behaviors aren’t mistakes, and they aren’t innocent, Cohn contends. “It’s selfish,” she says. “It’s thinking more about yourself than the recipient, and people can see right through it.” Right now, Cohn is working on further research on whether there’s a correlation between habitually bad gift-giving and narcissism.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How to be a better gift-giver</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Individual tastes in gifts can vary greatly, but there are some broad strokes of what people tend to appreciate. According to Givi, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317986307_Sentimental_Value_and_Gift_Giving_Givers'_Fears_of_Getting_It_Wrong_Prevents_Them_from_Getting_It_Right\">sentimental gifts</a> — for example, something handmade or connected to a memory that the two of you share — are often underrated by gift-givers. Another finding in Givi’s research was that people tend to appreciate gifts that are given “out of the blue, as opposed to gifts that we receive on our birthday or any other special occasion.” The fact that it’s not being presented out of any social obligation may emphasize that the thought behind a gift really does count.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Being a good gift-giver also involves imagining ourselves in another’s shoes. It takes conscious effort. You genuinely need to ask yourself what this particular person would want, not what you or some other abstract of a person would want in the same situation. It probably doesn’t help, then, that there’s still some social awkwardness around being explicit about what you want to be gifted and what you’d hate to receive. Maybe to some people, maintaining a regularly updated gift registry is gauche, but if you’re concerned about your pile of unused gifts gathering dust in the closet, taking the surprise out of gift-giving does seem like the preferable option. (According to Senning, it’s perfectly all right for gifters to ask for some direction on what gifts someone would like.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cohn recalls the memory of a bad gift she got in childhood: a prank played on her by her father in which every gift box just contained a smaller one, with nothing inside the last. It motivated her to study what gifts mean and how people communicate through them. She told her mother how the prank had made her feel; when Cohn finished her dissertation, her mother&nbsp;gave her another set of nested boxes, this time full of chocolates. “I think that was the best gift I ever got because she wanted to take away my pain. That’s what that gift was meant to do,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

There’s a lot of need out there, and it matters not just whether we give, but how. Effective giving can translate into more lives saved and more lives improved. Even among charities that target the poorest people in developing countries —&nbsp;where charities can typically be most impactful because a dollar goes much further — the most effective charities produce a whopping 100 times more benefit than average charities,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-63320-004\">according to expert estimates</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So this holiday season, we thought it might be helpful to update our annual guide to giving. Think of this as not only a rundown of charity recommendations, but also a broader guide to thinking about how to give. Here are a few simple tips for end-of-year giving that can help.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) Check in with charity recommenders</h2>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s of course possible to research charity options yourself, but you can save some time by outsourcing that labor to a careful, methodologically rigorous charity recommender like <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell</a>. <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/\">Charity Navigator</a> has started following in GiveWell’s footsteps by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/10/16/21515488/charity-navigator-impact-matters-nonprofit\">evaluating charities based on their ability to do the most good</a> at the lowest cost; GiveWell has a longer track record, but <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=8221\">Charity Navigator’s impact scores</a> are worth consulting, too.</p>\n\n<p>GiveWell, which functions somewhat like a grantmaker, currently lists <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">four top charities</a>. Its recommendation, if you find it hard to choose among the four, is to donate to the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/maximum-impact-fund\">Top Charities Fund</a>, which goes directly to those top charities based on GiveWell’s assessment of where the money is most helpful given the different groups’ funding needs.</p>\n\n<p>The top charities are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\">Malaria Consortium</a>, which helps distribute preventive antimalarial medication to children (a program known as “seasonal malaria chemoprevention”)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, which buys and distributes insecticidal bed nets, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa but also in Papua New Guinea</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international\">Helen Keller Intl</a>, which provides technical assistance to, advocates for, and funds vitamin A supplementation programs in sub-Saharan Africa, which reduce child mortality</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives\">New Incentives</a>, which increases uptake of routine immunizations by offering small cash incentives to families in Nigeria when they get their children vaccinated<strong>  </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">GiveWell chose those charities based on how much good each additional donation would do, not necessarily how good the groups are overall. In other words, these are organizations that can put new funding to use, rather than sitting on it. Other charities do great work, too, but if they’re already decently funded, they might not do the most good with your extra dollar.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Vox guide to giving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving — from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving\">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h1>\n\n<p>GiveWell also supports novel interventions, but through its <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants\">All Grants Fund</a>, not its Top Charities Fund. That can mean giving an organization a grant to run a study in order to find out whether a hypothetical future program is feasible, like a <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/one-acre-fund-tree-rct-january-2023\">January 2023 grant</a> to a group in Rwanda to run a randomized evaluation of its program training farmers to grow trees for timber. It can also mean <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/PATH-malaria-vaccines-January-2022\">funding time-sensitive programs</a>, like the rollout of a new malaria vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of 2021,<strong> </strong>GiveWell found itself in the position of having more funding available than extremely cost-effective opportunities to spend it on. So it made the (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22822406/give-well-give-directly-philanthropy\">somewhat controversial</a>) announcement that it would <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2021/11/22/we-aim-to-cost-effectively-direct-around-1-billion-annually-by-2025/\">roll $110 million in funds into 2022</a>, instead of distributing those funds to charities right away, in hopes of finding more high-impact opportunities later.</p>\n\n<p>The gambit paid off: Whereas in 2021<strong> </strong>GiveWell had found $450 million worth of cost-effective opportunities, it was more like $900 million in 2022 — meaning the size of the pool roughly doubled. Instead of having too much money and too few great causes to spend it on, GiveWell had too many great causes and too little funding to support them all. Specifically, it found<strong> </strong>itself around $300 million short.</p>\n\n<p>“﻿There’s this gap, and so we want to raise more, because there’s impact just being left on the table,”&nbsp;Elie Hassenfeld, GiveWell’s CEO, previously<strong> </strong>told Vox.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050277/Malaria_Consortium_Sophie_Garcia_Copyright.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A health worker looks on as a mother spoon-feeds the baby on her lap.\" title=\"A health worker looks on as a mother spoon-feeds the baby on her lap.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Caregivers are counseled by community health workers in Burkina Faso on how to administer further antimalarial doses at home. | Sophie Garcia/Malaria Consortium\" data-portal-copyright=\"Sophie Garcia/Malaria Consortium\" />\n<p>It’s worth noting that GiveWell takes disconfirming research seriously. In 2017, it recommended <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/no-lean-season\">Evidence Action’s No Lean Season</a>, which offered no-interest loans to farmers in Bangladesh during the “<a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/politics/how-stipends-bus-tickets-can-help-rural-families-overcome-the-hungry-season-1200478\">lean season</a>” between planting rice and harvesting it; the loans are conditional on a family member temporarily moving to a city or other area for short-term work. But a subsequent randomized evaluation found that the program <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2018/11/19/update-on-no-lean-seasons-top-charity-status/#Findings\">didn’t actually spur people to migrate or increase their incomes</a>, and GiveWell and Evidence Action then agreed that it should no longer be a top charity. Evidence Action stopped soliciting funds for it and later <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/7/18654620/evidence-action-no-lean-season-givewell\">shut it down</a> — an unusually scrupulous move for a charity.</p>\n\n<p>(Disclosure: Dylan has been donating to GiveWell since 2010. Because he writes about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/philanthropy\" data-source=\"encore\">philanthropy</a> frequently, outsourcing his giving to GiveWell prevents him from donating directly to specific top charities that he may cover in the future, not unlike investing in index funds to avoid conflicts of interest when writing about particular companies. GiveWell is also an advertiser on Vox podcasts.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) Pick charities with research-based strategies</h2>\n\n<p>GiveWell&#8217;s recommendations rely heavily on both evaluations done by charitable organizations and existing research literature on the kind of intervention the charities are trying to conduct.</p>\n\n<p>For example, research from the Poverty Action Lab at MIT suggests that <a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/scale-ups/free-insecticidal-bednets\">giving away insecticidal bed nets </a>— as the Against Malaria Foundation does — is vastly more effective than charging even small amounts for them.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/\">hundreds of studies</a> have found largely <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/26/the-case-for-cash-2/\">positive effects for the kind of cash transfers</a> that GiveDirectly, one of GiveWell’s grantees, distributes (even if cash <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/10/17827836/cash-basic-income-uganda-study-blattman-charity\">has its limits</a>).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) If you want to maximize your donation’s impact, give to poorer countries</h2>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really hard to adequately express how much richer developed nations like the US are than developing ones like Kenya, Uganda, and other countries targeted by GiveWell&#8217;s most effective charities.</p>\n\n<p>The US <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/5/18650492/2019-poverty-2-dollar-a-day-edin-shaefer-meyer\">still has extreme poverty</a>, in the living-on-$2-a-day sense, but it&#8217;s comparatively pretty rare and hard to target effectively. The poorest Americans also have access to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health-care\" data-source=\"encore\">health care</a> and education systems that, while obviously inferior compared to those enjoyed by rich Americans, are still superior to those of developing countries.</p>\n\n<p>Giving to charities domestically is a commendable thing to do,<strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/26/opinion/charity-holiday-gift-reproductive-rights.html\">many people feel</a> it’s right to give first to the communities they live in. But if you want to get the most bang for your buck in terms of saving lives, reducing illness, or improving overall well-being, you&#8217;re going to want to give to the places with the greatest need and where your additional dollar will do the most good. That means giving outside the US.</p>\n\n<p>Years ago, GiveWell actually looked into a number of US charities, like the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/nfp\">Nurse-Family Partnership</a> program for infants, the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/kipp\">KIPP chain of charter schools</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/HOPE-Program\">HOPE job-training program</a>. It found that all were highly effective, but were also<strong> </strong>far more cost-intensive than the best foreign charities. KIPP and the Nurse-Family Partnership cost <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">more than $10,000 per child served</a>, while a vaccination program like New Incentives in Nigeria costs <a href=\"https://www.newincentives.org/financials\">around $17 per child served</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has also <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/maintain-essential-services-malaria.html#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20COVID%2D19,related%20supplies%20have%20also%20increased.\">taxed health systems in low-income countries</a>, putting pressure on programs designed to fend off other diseases like malaria. Donations to anti-malaria, (non-Covid) vaccination, and vitamin A supplementation programs like the ones recommended by GiveWell can help cushion that blow.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4) If you do give locally, you can still consider impact</h2>\n\n<p>Although this guide is mostly meant to offer suggestions if you don’t have existing philanthropic interests and are curious for the most efficient ways to help, many people already do have specific causes: They want to give to their own communities, or to causes they’re passionate about for personal reasons (like curing a disease that killed a loved one, for instance). And they often want to use charity as a way to connect with broader trends in the news —&nbsp;by, say, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/19/22979793/ukraine-refugee-crisis-how-to-help\">donating to help refugees coming from Ukraine, Sudan, Gaza, and elsewhere</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is, of course, admirable to give to your own community and personal causes, and<strong> </strong>a lot has happened in recent years<strong> </strong>to make it easier to find effective ways to give domestically. The group Charity Navigator <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/10/16/21515488/charity-navigator-impact-matters-nonprofit\">acquired a nonprofit</a> called ImpactMatters in 2020<strong> </strong>and began incorporating its <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=8221\">estimates of the bang for the buck provided by charities</a> in several different sectors.</p>\n\n<p>So you can specify that your goal is, say, to provide a night of shelter for a person experiencing homelessness, and Charity Navigator will provide you with a menu of nonprofits and their cost per night of housing. The Nazareth Housing shelter in New York City, for instance, is estimated to provide nightly shelter at less than 200 percent of fair market rent, which is Charity Navigator’s benchmark for reasonable spending on shelter. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5) Saving lives isn&#8217;t everything</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041370/RS21098_P1200734_edited.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A child tilts their head back and opens their mouth so an adult hand can drop in a pill.\" title=\"A child tilts their head back and opens their mouth so an adult hand can drop in a pill.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A child in Côte d’Ivoire receives a dose of vitamin A, which helps build a healthy immune system and protects against blindness and serious illnesses. | Ruth Fertig/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hki.org/givingtuesday&quot;&gt;Helen Keller Intl&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"Ruth Fertig/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hki.org/givingtuesday&quot;&gt;Helen Keller Intl&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p>If you care mainly about reducing early mortality and giving people more years to live, then you should give all your donations to the Malaria Consortium, Helen Keller Intl, or the Against Malaria Foundation. Malaria is a frequently fatal disease, and cost-effective interventions to reduce malaria infection are a great way to save lives. Similarly, vitamin A supplementation, like Helen Keller does, is an effective way of reducing child mortality, as is vaccination (as promoted by New Incentives).</p>\n\n<p>But extending life isn’t the only thing that matters; improving quality of life matters, too.</p>\n\n<p>It’s extremely hard to weigh these interests<strong> </strong>against each other: Is it better to make a donation that can save one child’s life, or, with the same amount of money, to lift multiple families out of extreme poverty? There’s no one right answer to that question. How you answer it depends on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23862090/subjective-wellbeing-wealth-philanthropy-gdp-happiness-givewell\">your philosophical assumptions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“Philosophical factors can radically alter the cost-effectiveness of life-extending interventions,” writes the Happier Lives Institute, a research center that aims to find evidence-based ways to improve well-being worldwide, in <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/the-elephant-in-the-bednet/\">a new report</a>. To show this, the researchers crunched the numbers to compare the cost-effectiveness of three different charities in terms of how much they boost subjective well-being. Two were life-improving charities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly,</a> which gives cash to poor people in countries like Kenya and Uganda to spend as they see fit, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\">StrongMinds</a>, which treats depression in African women using group psychotherapy. The third charity, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, is mainly life-saving.</p>\n\n<p>Their findings? “On the assumptions most favorable to extending lives, AMF is about 30 percent more cost-effective than StrongMinds.&nbsp;On the assumptions least favorable to extending lives, StrongMinds is around 12 times more cost-effective than AMF.”</p>\n\n<p>So when you’re making your donations, it’s worth thinking not only about quantity of life, but also about quality of life. GiveWell asked recipients themselves how they weigh each of these, and you can read about the results <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/20/21009803/givewell-survey-kenya-ghana-saving-lives-poverty\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6) Maybe just give money directly to poor people</h2>\n\n<p>For years, one of our primary charities has been <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly\">GiveDirectly</a>, which gives unconditional cash transfers. (Sigal donated to them in 2022, 2023, and 2024.) We’ve given to them partly because there&#8217;s a large body of research on the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers\">benefits of cash transfers</a>, which we find quite compelling.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2871156/socialshare.0.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.13712291199202,100,99.725754176016\" alt=\"A smiling person holds up their cellphone to show the money transaction on its screen.\" title=\"A smiling person holds up their cellphone to show the money transaction on its screen.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"GiveDirectly uses the M-PESA system for mobile cash transfers. | Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p>But we’ve donated to GiveDirectly mostly because we didn’t trust ourselves to know what the world&#8217;s poorest people need most. We&#8217;ve been profoundly lucky to never experience the kind of extreme poverty that billions of people worldwide have to endure. We have <em>no idea</em> what we would spend a cash transfer from GiveDirectly on if we were living on less than $2 a day in Uganda. Would we buy a bednet? Maybe! Or maybe we&#8217;d buy an iron roof. Or school tuition for loved ones. Or cattle.</p>\n\n<p>But you know who does<em> </em>have a good sense of the needs of poor people in Uganda? Poor people in Uganda. They have a very good idea of what they need. Do they sometimes misjudge their spending priorities? Certainly; as do all of us. And bednets appear to be underpurchased relative to the actual need for them. But generally, you should only give something other than cash if you are confident you know the recipients’ needs better than they do. We weren’t confident of that, so we gave cash.</p>\n\n<p>As the World Bank&#8217;s Jishnu Das once <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131108022355/http://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/new-york-times-ethicist-better-economist-economist\">put it</a>, “‘Does giving cash work well?’ is a well-defined question only if you are willing to say that ‘well’ is something that WE, the donors, want to define for families whom we have never met and whose living circumstances we have probably never spent a day, let alone a lifetime, in.” If you&#8217;re not willing to say that, then you should strongly consider giving cash.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7) Don’t give to big charities &#8230;</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that all of the charities GiveWell recommends are reasonably small, and some big names are absent. That’s not an accident. In general, charity effectiveness evaluators are <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/28/mega-charities/\">skeptical of large relief organizations</a>, for a number of reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Large organizations tend to be less transparent about where their money goes and also likelier to direct money to disaster relief efforts, which are usually <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/disaster-relief\">less cost-effective, in general, than public health programs</a>. “Overall, our impression is that <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/28/mega-charities/\">your donation to these organizations is very hard to trace</a>, but will likely supplement an agenda of extremely diverse programming, driven largely by governments and other very large funders,” wrote GiveWell co-founder Holden Karnofsky in a 2011 blog post.</p>\n\n<p>Our colleague Kelsey Piper has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17927688/how-to-help-australia-fires-donate-disaster-relief\">explained</a> that by the time a disaster has struck, it’s mostly too late to improve disaster relief work. The quality of the immediate response, which includes search-and-rescue and emergency medicine, is determined by choices before the disaster occurs. Investments in improving those capabilities are most effective either before a crisis or well after, during the recovery phase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8) &#8230; But maybe consider meta-charities</h2>\n\n<p>A different option is giving to groups like GiveWell, <a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/\">Innovations for Poverty Action</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/invest/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> that evaluate development approaches and charities, and encourage effective giving. Suppose that every dollar given to Giving What We Can — which encourages people to pledge to donate at least 10 percent of their income until retirement — results in $1.20 in donations to the Against Malaria Foundation. If that’s the case, then you should give to Giving What We Can until the marginal effect on donations to Against Malaria hits $1 or lower.</p>\n\n<p>“If they can turn a dollar of donations into <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/metacharities\">substantially more than a dollar of increased donations</a> to effective charities, isn’t that the best use of my money?” asks Jeff Kaufman, a software developer who, with his wife Julia Wise, gives about <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/2017-donations\">half his income to effective charities and meta-charities</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9) Consider giving to animals</h2>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could consider giving to non-humans. Animal charities, especially those engaged in corporate pressure campaigns to better the treatment of farm animals, chickens in particular, can be effective in improving <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/animal-welfare\" data-source=\"encore\">animal welfare</a>. The charity evaluations in this area are much younger and less methodologically rigorous than GiveWell’s, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/3/20992185/animal-welfare-best-charities-factory-farming\">Animal Charity Evaluators has named four animal groups</a> that may be effective causes for donations:</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"http://vox.com/meatless-newsletter\"><strong>Sign up for the Meat/Less newsletter course</strong></a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to eat less meat but don’t know where to start? <a href=\"http://vox.com/meatless-newsletter\">Sign up</a> for Vox’s Meat/Less newsletter course.

You should, in this view, not give to charity during your career, and instead save and invest your money, increasing it as much as possible over time. That way you can give more when you die than you would have if giving continuously over the course of your life.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach is to “earn to give”: Take a high-paying job, typically in finance or tech, and give away a huge share of your earnings, like 40 to 50 percent. But it’s <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/\">not the best option </a>for most people, especially if the “earn to give” job is in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23458282/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto-ethics\">a morally dubious field</a>. And there are a lot of amazing jobs — in scientific research, in the private sector, in direct charity or nonprofit or government employment — where the typical person can do more good through their work than they could by solely<strong> </strong>using their career as a mechanism through which to generate donation money.</p>\n\n<p>So we suggest a more moderate course: You can sign the <a href=\"https://givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can pledge</a>, which commits members to donating 10 percent of their annual income to highly effective charities, or take a Trial Pledge, which commits members to donating a percentage of their choice — at least 1 percent — to such charities.</p>\n\n<p>Ten percent is a totally reasonable number, comparable to alms in many religions, that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/15/23874111/charity-philanthropy-americans-global-rich\">requires relatively minimal sacrifice</a>. (Here’s an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/2/20982600/charity-10-percent-tithe-giving-what-we-can-toby-ord\">interview</a> with Toby Ord, who started that pledge.) But even if 10 percent is too much for you, don’t despair. Giving 5 percent or 1 percent is better than giving 0 percent.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most important thing is to just get into the groove of donating, to make it a habit. We use direct deposit on our paychecks to make the most of our charitable contributions, just so it’s extremely automatic and hard for us to avoid doing. Going from not giving to giving a little, regularly, is a huge positive step.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, November 19, 2024:</strong> This story, originally published in 2020 and<strong> </strong>updated in 2021, 2022, and 2023, has been updated throughout for 2024.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Fed is an independent institution meant to make decisions that shape the domestic economy without political interference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no indication that Trump wants to exert the kind of control that Musk and Lee tweeted about, but even the type of influence he appears to want likely won’t be possible — at least in the short term.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How much can Trump influence the Fed?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump can’t influence the Federal Reserve much — for right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to interest rates, which are basically how much it costs to borrow money, Trump can complain they are too high (or too low) like any other American, but the Fed’s leaders are the only government officials with the power to adjust those rates. The Fed has lowered interest rates this year as inflation has declined but it kept rates fairly high for the last few years, in part to fight pandemic-era inflation. Even with the lower rates, however, many Americans are still finding it too expensive to borrow money so they can make big purchases like a home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Forcing or pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates won’t necessarily fix high borrowing costs for Americans; the interest rates set by the Fed are actually short-term costs that banks pay to each other to borrow money. The Fed’s decisions influence the cost of borrowing, but <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-promised-lower-interest-rates-will-largely-control-rcna179285\">there are a lot of other factors</a> that go into consumer credit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Furthermore, many of Trump’s other policy proposals — like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress\">broad tariffs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">mass deportation</a> — could <em>increase</em> inflation, which higher interest rates are supposed to combat. If implemented, these proposals could actually lead to higher inflation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you have big tax cuts, and he wants to spend more on the military, and is rounding up however many millions of undocumented workers he plans to [deport], that&#8217;s all going to be very inflationary” as will Trump’s proposed tariffs on imports, Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told Vox. “And then if you tell the Fed, ‘Well, you can&#8217;t do anything to try and contain it, because that would make me unpopular,’ That&#8217;s going to be a really bad story.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One other way Trump might try to meddle in the Fed’s affairs is by trying to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump appointed Powell, but was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/12/why-trump-wont-fire-fed-chair-00188867\">highly critical of Powell’s decision-making</a> during his first term, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/jerome-powell-trump-fed.html\">reportedly looked into</a> whether he could fire the Fed chair.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Powell has stated that he will serve through the rest of his term, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4v7vwgqj0o\">which doesn’t end until 2026</a>, but has declined to say whether or not he would stay on for a third term. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Legally, Trump cannot force Powell to resign or fire him. Members of the Fed’s Board of Governors, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm\">which Powell is part of</a> as the Fed chair, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/12/why-trump-wont-fire-fed-chair-00188867\">can only be fired</a> for wrongdoing or job performance reasons, not differences in policy. Trump could try to fire Powell claiming he’s performing his job poorly, but that decision would probably embroil the president-elect in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/column-fed-chairs-job-security-depends-embattled-supreme-court-precedent-2024-11-11/\">drawn-out legal battle</a>, like the one that ensnared <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/295/602\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he tried to fire a Fed commissioner</a>. (And that Roosevelt lost.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the Federal Reserve was created by an act of Congress, it would take Congressional action to make any changes to how it works. Congress has made some changes over the decades, but there’s no signal right now that most lawmakers are willing to challenge the independence of the institution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any attempts to interfere with the Fed’s independence could have ripple effects in the stock market, Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, told <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-jerome-powell-wall-street-donald-trump-federal-reserve-2024-11\">Business Insider</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;In general, there&#8217;s no question that the market does not like any attempt to interfere, by the executive or congressional branches, in the independence of the Fed,” Siegel said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But come May of 2026, Trump will be able to have some congressionally authorized say in Fed policy. That’s when he’ll be required to appoint a Fed chair for a new four-year term, who’ll then have to undergo Senate confirmation. That may be Powell, or it could be someone more compliant with Trump’s idea of what the Fed should be.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They just kind of happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the play kitchen her 3-year-old son inherited from his cousins. There’s the “random stuff” her mother-in-law buys online, all of it plastic and made up of countless tiny pieces. There’s the kid-sized workbench — Randall got that from her local <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21427525/buy-nothing-gifting-facebook-groups-community-money-borrow-lend-trade\">Buy Nothing group</a>, where neighbors can offload used items (and pick up more).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sheer volume of stuff her son has to play with is overwhelming, Randall told Vox. The day we talked, she and her family were having guests at their Pacific Northwest home, so she was attempting to declutter, “finding all the parts and putting food in the toy kitchen and putting the tools in the workbench.” But it was always a losing battle.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Shelves overflowing with cars and blocks and action figures can be just as stressful for kids as they are for parents.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a familiar refrain among parents: One reader told Vox recently that her family was “absolutely drowning in toys.” And while adults have been complaining about kids’ junk for generations (please see my father’s fruitless search for my brother’s one-inch-long toy wrench in Los Angeles International Airport circa 1992), many millennial and Gen X parents have the sense that something is different now — that kids have more toys than in past decades, and that they seem to arrive in ways Randall describes as “unintentional.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historical data on the average number of toys per kid is surprisingly hard to come by, but there is evidence that Americans’ toy glut is increasing — and it’s not just a problem for affluent households.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">US toy sales jumped from $22.3 billion in 2019 to $26 billion in 2020, and then to $30.1 billion in 2021, as parents struggled to entertain their kids at home during the pandemic. Sales <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/business/toy-sales-decline-2023/index.html\">dipped slightly in 2023</a>, perhaps because of inflation, but remain solidly above 2019 levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t think we’ll ever go back,” Juli Lennett, a vice president and industry adviser for toys at the market research firm Circana, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shelves overflowing with cars and blocks and action figures can be just as stressful for kids as they are for parents. Sometimes “kids don&#8217;t play with anything, because there&#8217;s just too many options,” said <a href=\"https://www.evieandsarah.com/\">Sarah Davis</a>, a parenting coach and co-author of the book <a href=\"https://www.evieandsarah.com/book/\"><em>Modern Manners for Moms and Dads</em></a>. Meanwhile, an overemphasis on acquiring new toys can foster materialism, which is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23944882/kids-money-shopping-allowance-parenting-consumer-culture\">linked with anxiety and depression</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stemming the tide of clutter is easier said than done, since toys often come from grandparents or other loved ones, or even from parties at school. But experts say there are certain characteristics that kids’ favorite toys share. And by focusing on those, grown-ups may be able not only to save money and space, but also to help kids have more fun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, I get the struggle. Recently, I was taking a shower when I noticed a pink plastic rat in the drain.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why kids have so many toys</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the early 2000s, a team led by archaeologist Jeanne E. Arnold counted up the possessions of 32 self-identified middle-class families. The average family in their sample had 139 toys visibly on display, with “untold numbers” out of sight in closets or under beds, the authors wrote in <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1vq382j7#page=7\">a 2012 book</a> about the research. One girl’s room contained 165 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22870250/nft-beanie-baby-price-guide-bubble-princess-value\">Beanie Babies</a>, 22 Barbie dolls, 36 “human/animal figurines,” and one miniature castle. “Spilling out of children’s bedrooms and into living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, and parents’ bedrooms, the playthings of America’s kids are ubiquitous in middle-class homes,” the authors wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That problem has only worsened, with several factors contributing to the overflow. Unlike most other categories of products, childrens’ playthings have actually gotten cheaper over the last 30 years, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-parents-miserable-cheap-toys-high-childcare-costs-2023-12\">Business Insider’s Katie Notopoulos reported</a>. A toy that cost $20 in 1993 would retail for just $4.68 today, in part because of lower production costs as manufacturing moved overseas. Those rock-bottom prices make it easier for grown-ups to buy kids that extra doll or car or <a href=\"https://schylling.com/product/party-animals/?wmc-currency=USD\">guinea pig in a shark suit</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Americans aren’t just buying more toys than they used to, they’re also buying them differently. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/3/17932344/toys-r-us-liquidation-coming-back\">Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy</a> in 2017 and has all but disappeared from the shopping landscape, and other brick-and-mortar toy stores, from <a href=\"https://www.app.com/story/news/local/2024/06/06/lakewood-store-toyland-colorful-building-closing/73982646007/\">small</a> to <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/15/investing/toys-r-us-toy-retailers-dead/index.html\">large</a>, have shuttered in recent years. Meanwhile, shopping has also become more seamless, thanks to Amazon and other e-commerce platforms. In the 1990s, my parents had to drive to Toys R Us to get my brother a <a href=\"https://www.4kidzinc.com/gurglin-gutz\">squishy, blood-shot rubber eyeball</a>; I can purchase a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outus-Halloween-Eyeball-Squeeze-Multicolor/dp/B0DB1ZN8FB/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3MSLW78VADFH2&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eWMX1AJqNnuoybYxpVCBA1l4pJxO0nXDdgSNsNb5yrXqYY-bQNCI454qSGxN7mE1sUCcS8e9tNKg7ljgB3zEcZJd6NfLa-fSFH2vVg8aK5vz4mG1Cyl08flw1-16dk0lgolE50D-ksj7Nh-k7ZbjbMRWJkFiArB3XC5n5XNMk_VyXu6z1GpeikLTz_obsska6IWqKQ80h9Nn1QsQ24DFKkwKlv9oNX4R-B-g_GfQnfRU0nR-zs_Fe_plClQ8SYkT0PRvzXdYoa9cd6zEyhUDirCGaTlVGB0vdm9Y04wAL4A.uNC_pa7qxZMmRRXcjHvxlRDPvj9vZ2xatHyqWwsF3OA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy&amp;qid=1729630757&amp;sprefix=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy%2Caps%2C73&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1\">similar eyeball</a> and get it delivered by the end of the week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Online shopping also offers a convenient way for far-flung extended family members to send kids more toys. “We ask for clothes and college fund money, and despite that, sometimes toys still come in,” Randall told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even secondhand shopping has leveled up, from yard sales and flea markets to Facebook groups and sites like <a href=\"https://www.mercari.com/\">Mercari</a> that let parents snag some lightly used Legos without leaving the couch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>In the 1990s, my parents had to drive to Toys R Us to get my brother a <a href=\"https://www.4kidzinc.com/gurglin-gutz\">squishy, blood-shot rubber eyeball</a>; I can purchase a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outus-Halloween-Eyeball-Squeeze-Multicolor/dp/B0DB1ZN8FB/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3MSLW78VADFH2&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eWMX1AJqNnuoybYxpVCBA1l4pJxO0nXDdgSNsNb5yrXqYY-bQNCI454qSGxN7mE1sUCcS8e9tNKg7ljgB3zEcZJd6NfLa-fSFH2vVg8aK5vz4mG1Cyl08flw1-16dk0lgolE50D-ksj7Nh-k7ZbjbMRWJkFiArB3XC5n5XNMk_VyXu6z1GpeikLTz_obsska6IWqKQ80h9Nn1QsQ24DFKkwKlv9oNX4R-B-g_GfQnfRU0nR-zs_Fe_plClQ8SYkT0PRvzXdYoa9cd6zEyhUDirCGaTlVGB0vdm9Y04wAL4A.uNC_pa7qxZMmRRXcjHvxlRDPvj9vZ2xatHyqWwsF3OA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy&amp;qid=1729630757&amp;sprefix=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy%2Caps%2C73&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1\">similar eyeball</a> and get it delivered by the end of the week.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rise of YouTube over the last 20 years has also changed toy purchasing, with influencers advertising toys and <a href=\"https://metricscart.com/insights/exploring-the-us-online-toy-industry/\">releasing their own lines</a>. Unboxing videos, in which kids or adults film themselves taking toys out of packages, have become a cultural staple, even <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/gabbys-dollhouse-interview-big-screen-plans-1235973385/\">inspiring the popular Netflix kids’ show</a> <em>Gabby’s Dollhouse</em> (which now has its own <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/gabbys-dollhouse\">branded toys</a>). There are simply <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23944882/kids-money-shopping-allowance-parenting-consumer-culture\">more avenues for toy advertising</a> and quasi-advertising today than in decades past, and — thanks to features like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/9/14/23872449/tiktok-shop-for-you-page-ads\">TikTok Shop</a> — more and easier ways to buy them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Changing childhood cultural norms may also be having an effect. More schools are asking parents to distribute small toys instead of cupcakes at children’s birthday parties, in an effort to cut down on sugar, parents tell me. The result is what Davis, the parenting coach, calls “the plastic graveyard — all these plastic toys that are just showing up from birthday parties and classroom parties in lieu of candy.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How many is too many toys?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After an initial burst of excitement, a lot of those new toys aren’t seeing much playtime, experts say. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Kids often really only play with a subset of toys, and the other ones are not really that relevant,” sociologist Allison Pugh told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://news.utoledo.edu/index.php/12_18_2017/fewer-toys-lead-to-richer-play-experiences-ut-researchers-find\">2017 study</a>, University of Toledo researchers found that toddlers played longer and more creatively when presented with just four toys than when they had 16 options to choose from (though that’s still a far cry from the 100-plus toys many kids actually own).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The benefit of having fewer choices is something a lot of early educators understand. “If you go into a preschool classroom, they&#8217;ll have like, three tables set up, and each table will have a specific group of toys,” Davis said. “It&#8217;s not too much. It&#8217;s not overwhelming.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids’ favorite toys, meanwhile, tend to be those imbued with “social meaning,” Pugh said. “Kids use toys to connect to other kids — sometimes just by owning the same exact thing, sometimes by playing with it together, sometimes by accruing and sharing specialized knowledge about that toy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Playing with others can give meaning even to objects that aren’t intended as toys at all: “My kids once developed an elaborate series of stories about a bunch of rocks that they found,” Pugh said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The social aspect of toys isn’t always so cute — kids can be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23944882/kids-money-shopping-allowance-parenting-consumer-culture\">bullied or feel inferior</a> if they don’t have the same toys other kids have, and social comparisons can be painful for children whose parents can’t afford new purchases. And while wealthier families may be able to afford pricier toys, lower-income parents sometimes feel so much pressure to buy popular items that they’ll go without basic necessities to do so, <a href=\"https://as.virginia.edu/why-parents-cant-resist-buying-their-children-hottest-gifts\">Pugh has found</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But thinking about toys as social objects is also a reminder that playing is what makes a toy a toy — if nobody plays with it, it’s just part of the plastic graveyard. Kids might gravitate at first to the toys with the most bells and whistles — like, for example, these <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grumblies-Tremor-Light-Up-Eyes/dp/B07NQFMZYK/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MoueXk7ZpDyZHYBPrw48HG34mX0u7OveZb_-7SKsqZwQ0wVTTHL5xGNV85LF6cjpVxXOVTixOBTeEEWhc6_8ZfSS19mHWvBvdON6EwEkUjLIESWomxFO9aPiUVR2sA8O.Bh-KDx9egT6ER8KQ7sEfalrZ5Iy54k0q6aWyXIFz0XA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=grumblies&amp;qid=1730304455&amp;sr=8-8\">cursed electronic stuffies</a> that emit bloodcurdling screams when thrown.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Playing is what makes a toy a toy — if nobody plays with it, it’s just part of the plastic graveyard.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But toys that do too much often lack “stickiness,” or the ability to hold kids’ attention for a long period of time, said Sudha Swaminathan, director of the Center for Early Childhood Education at Eastern Connecticut State University. The stickiest toys are usually simple and open-ended, she said, like blocks or <a href=\"https://www.easternct.edu/center-for-early-childhood-education/timpani/timpani-2017.html\">basic animal figures</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The toys that kids return to again and again are the ones that “require attention, imagination, and creativity,” Davis said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For her kids, that’s magnetic blocks. For Randall’s son, it’s a set of wooden train tracks left over from her own childhood. “I guess I just didn&#8217;t need to get any modern toys,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, kids are going to ask for toys they saw on YouTube, on the playground, or at a friend’s house. They’re going to come home with vials of mysterious green goo that end up in the freezer (maybe this is just my kid). <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/advice-my-childs-friend-is-rude-disrespectful.html\">Parents do not control</a> what their kids want, or even always what they get, and it can seem like that control is ebbing further every day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The adults in kids’ lives can, however, decide when to say yes and when we have to say no. And when all else fails and the clutter gets overwhelming, we can “sneak out in the dead of night,”&nbsp;while they’re sleeping, as Randall puts it, and get rid of that junk.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But Rome’s foundations started to weaken less than a century later, and by 27 BCE, the republic had collapsed. It then transformed into an empire, and even though the Roman state persisted, it was no longer a representative democracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fall of the Roman Republic is both complicated and straightforward: The state became too big and chaotic; the influence of money and private interests corrupted public institutions; and social and economic inequalities became so stark that citizens lost faith in the system altogether and gradually fell into the arms of tyrants and demagogues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that sounds very familiar, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Edward Watts is a historian at the University of California San Diego and the author of two books on ancient Rome. One, from 2018, is called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Republic-Rome-Fell-Tyranny/dp/0465093817\"><em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny</em></a>, and the other, from 2021, is <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-eternal-decline-and-fall-of-rome-9780190076719?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><em>The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Mortal Republic</em> is probably the best thing I’ve read on Rome’s history, both because it lays out what went wrong and why, and because it attempts to explain how the lessons of its decline might help save fledgling republics like the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I invited Watts on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about those lessons and why he thinks the American republic is in danger of going the way of ancient Rome.

Where do you think we are in that process today?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Edward Watts</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was much more optimistic in 2018 than I am now. What I saw in 2018 was a set of imbalances. I saw a primal scream by the American electorate that said, “We do not like what we&#8217;ve got.” And I saw hints that we might have violence injected into our political life. I had no idea that within two years that violence would take the form that it did and it would come so close to actually destroying the political system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was talking to a friend from Italy a couple of weeks ago about January 6, and he was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, it&#8217;s a blip.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s game this out. They came very close to actually getting in there when the representatives were present in the chamber, it was something like 15 minutes between when the representatives left and when the rioters got in. What would happen if they actually had gotten in and seized some representatives or disrupted the vote?&#8221; And my friend said, &#8220;Well, they would call in the army.&#8221; Who would call in the army? Who is actually legitimately in charge at that point? Who does the army answer to?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was the situation Rome found itself in. Once you break a system, there are no rules governing what happens and all of the institutions that depend on that system free-float. And I think we don&#8217;t appreciate how close we came to a moment where that was our government, or our lack of government. And in Rome that happened and it was profoundly devastating, hundreds of thousands of people died because of that. It&#8217;s not something that we should play with.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both the Roman political system and our own system were designed to be slow-moving with the idea that change should happen ploddingly and deliberately. Do you think, in retrospect, that trade-off wasn&#8217;t worth it for Rome? That it was too hard and too convoluted and therefore incapable of being responsive enough to what was happening?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Edward Watts</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where the 2,000-year lifespan of the Roman state is so important. Over and over in Roman history, there are these moments where people step back and say, “What we have is broken.” But because you have leaders and because you have a tradition of adapting, most of the time Rome doesn&#8217;t blow up all of these traditions and systems it inherited. It tries to find ways to amend them and to adapt them and to create new ways to make them more responsive to the needs of its citizens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The empire was built initially as a kind of Italian enterprise to extract stuff from all of these other places that it controlled. But by the early part of the third century [CE], every single free person in the Roman Empire was a citizen of the Roman state. And so this model of Italians extracting things from colonial subjects was gone. You couldn&#8217;t run an empire that way anymore because you have 6 million Italians and 60 million other Roman citizens. And so the third century was a process of trying to figure out how you remake a society that was originally devoted to sending resources into Italy and make it responsive to the needs of all of those people everywhere.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Would you say that adaptability, that expansion of the circle of citizenship, was the key to Rome&#8217;s survival for that long?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Edward Watts</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, and I think that&#8217;s a lesson we should take away from Rome. What Rome was able to do from its very earliest point, from the point when there were Roman kings, was to identify who could contribute to its society and find ways to empower people who were initially [on the] outside.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So some of the first Roman kings actually weren&#8217;t Roman. They were chosen because they were the best people for the job. The third-to-last king, Tarquinius Priscus, wasn&#8217;t even born in Rome. He actually grew up in a city in Etruria (present-day central Italy) and moved to Rome because it was a place where you were allowed to rise as high as your talents would permit. This society wouldn&#8217;t block you because you weren&#8217;t of the right background.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was deeply ingrained in what Roman society was, and I think that&#8217;s a lesson for us. You have to remain grounded in the things that make your country function, but you have to also acknowledge that there are people who may not have been born in a position of authority who have something to contribute. And if you&#8217;re going to make your society function in the long term, you have to find a way to bring them in, not just because it&#8217;s fair, but because they make your country better.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s interesting about Rome is that they experienced something like 150 years of political dysfunction and a brutal civil war before they finally scrapped the republic for an empire. That’s a long period of steady decline. Do you believe America has that much time to get its political affairs in order as a country?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Edward Watts</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just in the last four years, we&#8217;ve had people try to storm Congress and two <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360489/trump-shot-thomas-matthew-crooks-secret-service-butler-rally\">assassination attempts</a>. It took Rome a really long time to get to the point where they were willing to do that. And the fact that we&#8217;re barely talking about those assassination attempts is stunning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Rome, there was a sort of creative tension that usually functioned well, but sometimes didn’t, between individuals who wanted to push change and systems that were designed to resist rapid change. In 27 BCE, Augustus figures out how to create a regime where he is the dominant figure for the rest of his life, but there are a couple of moments before that where individuals make choices that could have gone differently, but they have enough faith in the integrity of the system, and they have enough trust in the aesthetics of that system, that they do not go that far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The moment that jumps out to me immediately is Sulla, who was a dictator. He won a civil war, he murders Roman citizens in a fashion that is totally contrary to what a Roman state is supposed to do, or what any state is supposed to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Sulla fundamentally believed that a republic is important. He seized power and he occupied a position of authority as an autocrat for a couple of years and then gave the republic back because he believed that was important to do. He did not need to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I think that&#8217;s a moment where we should reflect on whether some of the people who could find themselves in a position similar to Sulla in the United States would make that same choice. Would they walk away after changing whatever they wanted to change? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You once told me that people like Trump pop up in an old republic every generation or so, when things reach a certain point, and either the system reboots and gets back on the tracks or it goes the other way. I’m not really asking you to weigh in on the politics here, but I am asking you, as a historian, what you make of Trump as a symptom of deeper problems in the country.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Edward Watts</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where the tension between the system and the individual becomes so important because there are moments where republican systems are not working and an individual does seize the momentum and seize the opportunity to potentially refashion them in whatever way that person wants. They could do like Sulla or Caesar. Sulla seizes the republic, he kills a lot of people, but he turns it back, he restructures it. He believes in the republic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Caesar also takes over the republic, and what he wants to do is create a republic that is truly a republic. Caesar, I think, deeply believed that there are certain aspects of the republican structure and of this idea of a citizen-held political community that he did not want to transgress, even if it would cost him his life. It was much more important to him to have a republic than it was to make himself safe. He made that choice knowing full well that it was a choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What I find alarming about Trump is I do not believe he cares whether this country is a republic or not. And so if he takes power and he has the ability to remake the state, he&#8217;s not going to remake it as a republic. He&#8217;ll remake it as whatever he decides he wants it to be, but he has no deep commitment to the idea of the republic, and that&#8217;s different from every Roman who takes power.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of the many lessons we might draw from Rome’s collapse, what do you think is really worth reflecting on in this political moment?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Edward Watts</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think the biggest point — and I&#8217;m afraid the ship has already sailed — is that violence should never be a part of politics. Once it&#8217;s there, it is very hard to make it go away without even more violence that ultimately neutralizes the people willing to do it. Violence has no part in a representative political system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I think the other thing that is really important for us to understand is that you cannot wait or hope that a single individual is going to fix the problems in a society or fix the problems in a political system. If you have a political system that has functioned reasonably well and has been adaptable over the course of decades or centuries, that&#8217;s a very valuable thing. It creates rules, it creates assumptions, it creates a state of play where everybody more or less knows when you do X, this is how the system is going to respond. If you destroy that, you have nothing. And if you destroy that because of an individual, you just have that individual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Very occasionally, you will get an individual who creates something that maybe isn&#8217;t even better but is at least something. Most of the time the person who destroys does not have the capacity to create. And so you&#8217;re going to replace something that has governed just about every aspect of your civic and personal lives for your entire existence, and probably, in the United States, for the existence of 10 generations of your ancestors potentially. If you throw that away for an individual, you&#8217;re making a really significant bet. And if that individual is somebody that you don&#8217;t 100 percent trust is capable of creating something different, you are throwing away an incredibly valuable thing for nothing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-america-collapsing-like-ancient-rome/id1081584611?i=1000674694989\"><em>Listen to the rest of the conversation</em></a><em> and be sure to follow</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea\"><em> </em><em>The Gray Area</em></a><em> on</em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\"><em> </em><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"><em> </em><em>Spotify</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793\"><em> </em><em>Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s an event that’s reached almost hagiographic status: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLCOIcb41Y\">name-checked</a> in rap songs and even <a href=\"https://thehilltoponline.com/2024/10/28/supermodel-anok-yai-returns-to-the-yard-for-howard-homecoming/\">launching modeling careers</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The energy in October at my alma mater is always frenetic: You see students and alumni dressed their best, babies in strollers on the yard wearing HU onesies, and friends who have stayed connected across decades gathering once more at what’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-untold-story-of-how-howard-university-came-to-be-known-as-the-mecca-212245\">lovingly referred to as the Mecca</a>. This year, the excitement in the air was even more palpable. For lack of better phrasing, the vibe was different. On one hand, the obvious culprit was that the university was celebrating its 100th homecoming. On the other hand, that difference may have something to do with the fact that the school’s most famous alumna (at least right now) could soon become arguably the most powerful person in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris wasn’t on campus — she has spent part of her fall at the homecomings of  historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in swing states and not bright blue DC — but you wouldn’t know that looking around. Howard does not have a political affiliation, but vendors gathered outside the entrance to the football game hawking bucket hats with Harris’s name on them; her sorority sisters wore T-shirts with her face embroidered in pink and green; people fanned themselves with Harris/Walz fans while R&amp;B singers entertained the crowd; and children in HU gear played in a bouncy house as their parents looked on. Despite its nonpartisan stance, the university is where Harris plans to be the night of the election, in a way creating a homecoming all her own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In short, Howard is not a place with large numbers of Donald Trump supporters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Black voters are not a monolith, and the student body at Howard — one of the nation’s most prestigious universities —&nbsp;is not a representative sample of all Black voters. Indeed, some polls suggest that Black voters may be supporting Trump in higher numbers than in either of his previous two runs —&nbsp;a shift that some observers believe will be large enough to mark a “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373535/3-theories-gop-donald-trump-nonwhite-voters-hispanic-black-latino-asian\">racial realignment</a>” in American politics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the polls paint a murky picture. A recent NAACP survey found <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/28/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/aarp-survey-00185978\">Black men were backing off their support for Trump</a> and coming toward Harris in the final stretch before the election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some experts are skeptical that, after the election, the “racial realignment” will materialize. Enter Andra Gillespie, a political scientist and associate professor at Emory University who specializes in Black political participation.&nbsp;“The story of the cycle may very well be that people are overhyping the extent of Black defections away from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party,” she says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She points her finger at polling — or rather, the lack thereof — for Black voters specifically. While there has been plenty of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/In9Pqm9YlIo?si=VC53K-uLienjIi8x\">polling with enough respondents</a> to get a clear picture of the electorate, Gillespie argues that the numbers of Black voters within those samples don’t provide a clear enough picture of Black voters. I spoke with Gillespie in October about the number of votes Trump may get from Black voters, and how even getting just 80 percent of the Black vote worries Democrats. We also talked about the roles education and age play within this segment of the electorate, and whether we’re seeing shifts based on those factors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about the Harris campaign’s struggles with Black voters lately. Can you lay out what that struggle looks like? Are we talking about Black people leaving the Democratic Party en masse?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No. The first problem has been making a lot of conjectures based on sample sizes that have huge margins of error. So you&#8217;re looking at very noisy data. This started when Joe Biden was still the Democratic nominee for president. We forget that the number that comes out in surveys is the midpoint of a range of multiples. That&#8217;s why surveys are always plus or minus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was some evidence of [Black support] softening. We don&#8217;t know — because [Biden] dropped out of the race — whether or not people would have solidified their support for Donald Trump. Joe Biden was likely going to perform somewhere in the neighborhood of what he had done before and the numbers that you were getting, especially in the winter and early spring were suggesting that Donald Trump could get 30 percent of the African American vote. If your margin of error is minus 10, that means that that number could, in real life, be as low as 20 percent, which would suggest a gain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I&#8217;m thinking back to the Obama years, and 20 percent would be a lot.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Twenty percent would be a lot since nobody&#8217;s come close or even in the high teens since Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. So yeah, it would be unprecedented. But that&#8217;s what 100 people were saying or 150 people, or sometimes 200 people were saying in a survey in March or in February.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I want to be very clear: Donald Trump could actually improve his share of African American voters. I&#8217;m not saying that that&#8217;s impossible. But what&#8217;s a more likely scenario is that he makes a marginal gain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Looking at the numbers from the New York Times/Siena College poll that came out [recently], Trump&#8217;s numbers are in what I would call the normal range for a Republican candidate. What everybody was concerned about was the fact that Kamala Harris is pulling in below 80 percent on that poll. The upper bound of the margin of error would put that number into the low 80s, which would still be underperforming. But she still has three weeks from an election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Eighty percent of any demographic sounds like a lot of voters, but it&#8217;s framed as a problem for the Harris campaign.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s a problem for the campaign because Black people make up the base of the Democratic Party; it becomes a problem when she&#8217;s reliant on them turning out voting almost unanimously for her and in high numbers and in key battleground states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a state like Georgia, for instance, most white people are Republicans. Black people make up more than half of the Democratic Party in the state of Georgia. If they have anemic turnout or start to vote for the Republican or other candidates in the race, there just aren&#8217;t many other votes that she can pick up. For a state like Georgia to be competitive, you&#8217;ve got to perform at historical averages, which means she needs to be doing 90 percent or better. And she needs Black turnout to be proportional to their actual numbers in the electorate: 30 percent of voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You also have to care about it in the Blue Wall states, because even though Black people don&#8217;t make up as large a proportion of the population when you&#8217;re talking about margins, that could easily be 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 votes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I want to get into one of the narratives we&#8217;ve seen this election cycle, and that&#8217;s this flip in the parties when it comes to education. One of the narratives that we see emerging is that&nbsp;Democrats are </strong><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-a-college-degree-is-one-of-the-best-predictors-of-which-candidate-voters-support\"><strong>now the party</strong></a><strong> of those </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/opinion/gender-education-gap.html\"><strong>with college degrees</strong></a><strong> — your lawyers, your doctors; and Republicans are more the party of the working class — your blue-collar workers, maybe without a college degree. How do you see that playing out among Black voters?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think one thing that should be noted is 2016 was the year that pundits discovered that working-class white voters were Republican. That trend actually started a long time ago. I&#8217;ve seen graphs that chart this back to the mid-1970s, where you can see a decline in the number of non-college-educated white voters who are voting Democratic in elections. People just discovered it because Donald Trump ran on a populist platform, but he wasn&#8217;t doing anything revolutionary or new there at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So yes, we now accept that education correlates with party identification, and voting behavior with college-educated voters being more likely to vote Democratic these days. If you go back and you look at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-black-likely-electorate.html\">that New York Times/Siena College poll</a>, and you look at the breakdown in terms of support for Harris and Trump based on college education, you don&#8217;t see much of a difference in terms of support among Black voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are more conservative Black people who are still identifying as Democrats than Republicans, and the reason why is because of race. People who have a strong racial identity, people who perceive that the Democratic Party is the better party to handle issues related to race and civil rights. My friend, Tasha Philpot at the University of Texas, has noted that Black people aren&#8217;t necessarily putting the same weight or emphasis on social conservatism in the same way that white people might.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>If education is not this predictor for who Black people will vote for, is it a predictor of if they will vote or not?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If we&#8217;re looking at support for Harris, there’s only a percentage point difference [between Black voters with and without a bachelor’s degree]. I see differences in age — that&#8217;s actually not that unusual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We expect that younger people have weaker partisan attachments because they&#8217;re new to the electoral process. Older age cohorts, the oldest Black Americans uniformly, have made up their minds. I think part of the push on HBCU campuses is to get a group of young Black voters who are probably the most likely to show up because they&#8217;re the most resourced to be convinced to support Kamala Harris and to convince their friends to do that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea that they&#8217;re not strong Democrats could be a harbinger of things to come, but it&#8217;s going to take me 20 years to figure out what these folks are doing when they&#8217;re in their late 30s before I would be willing to say, “We&#8217;re witnessing a realignment of Black voters away from the party.” But I think that there&#8217;s still the question of who’s actually going to show up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I think it&#8217;s interesting because you mentioned that the Harris campaign is on this HBCU tour. They’re going to your Spelmans, your Morehouses, to talk to these young voters who are most likely to be resourced and most likely to show up to the polls. Every election year we hear the phrase “Black people are not a monolith” and that&#8217;s always been true. But I think of W.E.B. DuBois and this idea of the </strong><a href=\"https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/the-talented-tenth/\"><strong>Talented Tenth</strong></a><strong> – that one of the jobs of the Black elite is to achieve racial progress. But that leaves out the other 90 percent of Black people. How have we seen this dynamic between education, class, and politics play out through the years?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think it’s important to keep in mind <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-fallacy-of-the-talent_b_613510\">DuBois repudiated the idea of the Talented Tenth</a>. Part of the reason why college students in general are more resourced is, by being in college, they are picking up skills that are actually going to help them navigate civics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As they get older, their education is going to prepare them for jobs that might actually give them more flexibility to be able to vote easier than others who might have shift work where their schedule is predetermined for them. All of those things accumulate and matter in terms of predicting a person&#8217;s likelihood of turning out to vote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Also, colleges end up reducing the costs of voter registration and voting. If you are on a college campus where your office of student life has put out voter registration materials so that all you have to do is basically pick one up as you&#8217;re walking out of a cafeteria, that&#8217;s a lot easier than somebody who is living in an apartment downtown who then has to go to a county board of elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do we know why Trump has been able to peel away some of these Black voters? What are the factors there?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I am skeptical of how effective he has actually been, and we&#8217;ll see how those numbers play out on Election Day. I would not be surprised at a marginal gain of a percentage point or two, but he was never getting the 30 percent that he claimed to get. If I think about those marginal gains, there have been outreach efforts to African American men the Republican Party has been engaged in for a long period of time that actually predates Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The message that Trump has used to try to reach out — which has usually been worded in a really offensive way — actually harkens back to a strategy that Richard Nixon used to try to reach out to Black voters. Keep in mind, Richard Nixon didn&#8217;t do that badly, relatively speaking, among Black voters, despite the Southern Strategy, and it was because he used this strategy called Black Capitalism. He wanted to appeal to Black voters by talking about how Republican policies were more conducive to entrepreneurship and economic prosperity. And when you heard Donald Trump four years ago, trying to talk about his Platinum Plan — which, arguably, he may have <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ice-cube-donald-trump-platinum-plan-1075709/\">ripped off from Ice Cube</a> — that&#8217;s a play toward Black capitalism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">[Trump] in particular has benefited from having been in the public eye, having been sort of like the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/11/06/trumps-rap-sheet/\">name-check for financial success</a>. It&#8217;s not surprising that there&#8217;s some people who would ascribe very positive traits to him and to his presidency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How do you see all of this playing out and evolving beyond 2024? What will you be looking out for in the years to come when it comes to the Black electorate?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that we are still kind of in a post-1964 paradigm, where Black people are going to be overwhelmingly Democratic in their voting orientation. I expect that the ratio is going to still be somewhere in the neighborhood of about nine to one in favor of Democrats, give or take a couple of points.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let&#8217;s say that Republicans incrementally gain two to three percentage points per election cycle among Black voters. Then 20 years from now I might say, “Black people have been engaging in a secular realignment away from the Democratic Party and what we see is Republicans becoming more competitive over time.” If that happens and we start to point to the trend line, then we are going to start to go back to 2020 and 2024 and see that as the beginning of the shift. But if we are in the beginning of the shift — I don&#8217;t know that yet. It&#8217;s way too early for me to say that. I think the thing that will make it change is not Donald Trump.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That is just what Elon Musk has been doing, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported that the Tesla, X, and SpaceX chief has been having <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187\">undisclosed conversations with Vladimir Putin</a> and other senior Russian officials since late 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These conversations reportedly included a request from the Russian leader to avoid turning on Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The Journal reported that Musk’s Kremlin contacts were a “closely held secret” in government, and that even some White House officials had not been briefed on them, though there have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/business/elon-musk-ian-bremmer-putin-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html\">scattered reports in the media</a> about them dating back to 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If true, the story is a matter of concern not only because of Musk’s massive wealth and influence, but because he holds a “top secret” security clearance, as both the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html?oref=d_brief_nl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20October%2025%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief\">Pentagon and NASA have become deeply dependent</a> on Musk’s company SpaceX for space launches and satellite internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Responding to Vox’s request for comment, SpaceX’s media relations account described the Journal article as an “incredibly misleading story … based upon completely unsubstantiated claims from unnamed sources,” adding, “As has been repeatedly confirmed by the Department of Defense, SpaceX has worked (and continues to work) in close partnership with the U.S. Government regarding Ukraine and denial of service to bad actors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Were these engagements coordinated and cleared? Was he debriefed afterward?” a former US national security official told Vox, on condition of anonymity.<strong> </strong>“If I went and talked to Putin without going through the appropriate steps, I would definitely lose my clearance.” NASA administrator <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/politics/elon-musk-vladimir-putin/index.html\">Bill Nelson called for an investigation of Musk’s Russian ties</a> after the story was published, while the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/10/25/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-34/\">White House declined to comment</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the near term, though, it seems very unlikely that Musk’s clearance would be revoked or his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html?oref=d_brief_nl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20October%2025%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief\">$3 billion</a> government contracts be canceled. Whatever concerns national security officials might have about Musk, his companies — particularly SpaceX, which has <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/29410/number-of-worldwide-rocket-launches-by-companies-and-space-agencies/\">come to dominate rocket launches</a> and satellite internet — have simply become too embedded in American military operations to cut out, not least because for the moment, there are no competitors in a position to replace them.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As <a href=\"https://sandlerreiff.com/attorneys/joshua-ian-rosenstein/\">Joshua Ian Rosenstein</a>, an attorney specializing in national security law, put it to Vox, Musk may now be simply “too big to fail.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">When CEOs go rogue</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not the first time Musk’s activities have raised national security concerns. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Musk activated his Starlink satellite internet network <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/27/business/starlink-activated-ukraine/index.html\">over Ukraine and donated terminals</a> for the country’s use. Starlink, which allows users to connect to the internet via its network of satellites in areas where connectivity is low, has been vital to the Ukrainian war effort, particularly for operating the drones that have become <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24107959/replicator-drones-china-taiwan-ukraine-pentagon\">so central to combat</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while he initially <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-60637841\">expressed</a> support for Ukraine and the start of the war, Musk has not always been happy about how Starlink has been used by Kyiv. In September 2022, he personally <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/world/europe/elon-musk-starlink-ukraine.html\">ordered the deactivation of Starlink</a> near the coast of Crimea to prevent a Ukrainian attack, saying he wanted to avoid being complicit in a “major act of war and conflict escalation.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A little more than half a year after the war started, Musk was <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?s=20&amp;t=JHwlEs4VBkqVNIZKTxdsRw\">posting on X that he believes Crimea</a>, annexed by Russia in 2014, is rightfully Russian and should be formally ceded to Russia as part of an agreement to end the war. That’s a direct echo of Russian talking points, and a direct contradiction of the position of the US and virtually all Western governments.&nbsp;At various points, Musk’s company has threatened to withhold Starlink from use on Ukrainian drones altogether, saying the technology was never intended to be used “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/zelenskiy-aide-takes-aim-at-curbs-on-ukraine-use-of-starlink-to-pilot-drones-elon-musk\">for offensive purposes</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s China. Tesla’s <a href=\"https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202207/21/WS62d903a3a310fd2b29e6daa3.html\">largest factory is in China</a> and Musk has deepened his commercial ties to the country, even as many other American companies have been pulling back amid rising geopolitical tensions. He has described himself as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/world/asia/musk-china-tesla-explained.html\">kind of pro-China</a>” and more than a few critics have noted that his frequent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/15/elon-musk-hypocrite-free-speech\">advocacy for unrestricted free speech</a> does not appear to extend to the Chinese Communist Party. Musk has also suggested Taiwan ought to be turned into a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ef14997-982e-4f03-8548-b5d67202623a\">special administrative zone</a>” under Chinese control, along the lines of Hong Kong. (Support for such a scheme in Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/collapse-one-china\">plummeted after China’s crackdown</a> on Hong Kong’s democracy over the past decade.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">SpaceX told Vox that Starlink is not available in Taiwan because the Taiwanese government has not given it a license to operate and that this “has nothing to do with Russia or China.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is true Taiwan has opted to work with one of Starlink’s smaller competitors, the UK-European company Eutelsat, to develop its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/taiwan-to-have-satellite-internet-service-as-protection-in-case-of-chinese-attack#:~:text=The%20forthcoming%20service%20is%20via,get%20access%20to%20Elon%20Musk%27s\">own satellite backup</a>. In a recent interview, prior to the Wall Street Journal report, Taiwan’s Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Herming Chiueh told Vox his government was concerned that Musk “could cut the service [over] his personal opinion, so we don&#8217;t think this was a trustable partner.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some US lawmakers feel similarly. “The fact that a single individual has been so disdainful of our legal system, our regulatory system, and yet at the very same time so complimentary to an authoritarian system in China, concerns me greatly,” a Democratic member of Congress told reporters<strong> </strong>this week, adding, “when we think about the the amount of government contracts he has, as well as in some domains, even the potential for some classified work, it is hugely concerning.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The member claims that while Republican China hawks had also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/24/house-china-committee-elon-musk-spacex-starshield-taiwan.html\">raised concerns about Musk’s activities and interests</a> in the past, they’ve become less apt to do so as he has grown closer to the Trump campaign. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, the prominent role Musk has taken as a backer of former President Donald Trump’s current presidential campaign only adds to the national security concerns. He’s donated <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823\">tens of millions of dollars</a> to pro-Trump super PACS, devised a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/378912/musk-trump-voting-contest-million-dollars-swing-state-lottery-pennsylvania\">possibly illegal lottery</a> to incentivize voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, and turned both his own X account and the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-turned-x-trump-echo-chamber-rcna174321\">platform itself</a> into a pro-Trump megaphone. As <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-shared-tenet-content-thought-part-russian-plot-rcna171520\">NBC reported</a>, this has included personally amplifying content that appears to be part of an organized Russian misinformation effort. US intelligence officials have assessed that Russia is “undertaking a whole of government approach to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russia-starting-try-influence-us-voters-says-us-intelligence-official-2024-07-09/\">influence the election</a>” and wants Trump to win. (There’s no evidence that Musk knowingly spread Russian content.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Little Musk does is normal, but it’s important to remember that in general, it’s very unusual for the CEO of a defense contractor to get this involved in partisan politics.The X account of <a href=\"https://x.com/torybruno\">Tory Bruno</a>, CEO of SpaceX’s main competitor United Launch Alliance (ULA), is almost hilariously anodyne in contrast to Musk, consisting mainly of photos of rockets and his grandchildren. Companies like <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?Ind=D\">Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman</a> regularly donate roughly equal amounts to both Democrats and Republicans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This makes sense. These are companies that depend on the government for business, no matter which party is in power, a fact their political activities underscore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk clearly sees things differently. He has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4906822-elon-musk-donald-trump-democracy/\">described a Trump victory</a> as an existential necessity for the future of American democracy and is certainly acting as if he believes this is so.&nbsp;But even if Vice President Kamala Harris wins, he has every reason to assume he’ll still be in business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Too big to quit</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There may have been no more vivid demonstration of the American government’s increasing reliance on Musk’s space business than the launch of a SpaceX capsule in September. The mission was to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylvz1ppdmo\">pick up two astronauts</a> who were stranded on the International Space Station when the Boeing capsule they went up on experienced technical problems during flight. It was a reminder of just how much <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/07/11/boeing-ceo-guilty-737-max-crashes-airline\">legacy government contractors like Boeing have decayed</a>, which has only made Musk’s companies more important.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for the Pentagon, even as concerns have grown over Musk’s behavior, military commanders have been positively <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/10/why-pentagons-crush-elon-musk-dangerous-democracy/378666/\">glowing in their views of SpaceX</a>. The company has acquired a reputation for operating far faster and <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/spacex-now-dominates-rocket-flight-bringing-big-benefits-and-risks-nasa\">cheaper</a> than its competitors and its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket has been a game changer in an era where the military is rapidly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2024/1/16/24034692/national-security-threat-russia-space-weapons-true-anamoly-china-united-states-space-war\">building up its capabilities in space</a>. In 2016, the company broke the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/spacex-breaks-boeing-lockheed-monopoly-on-military-space-launches-idUSKCN0XO2TB/\">monopoly on military space launches</a> held by ULA, which is a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">SpaceX is also a privately owned company, unlike most large defense contractors, which analysts say helps allow it to be more nimble and innovate faster than its competitors, albeit at the cost of transparency (or accountability for the activities of its founder and CEO.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Musk, for all of his eccentricities, has done a lot of classic things right,” said <a href=\"https://usnwc.edu/Faculty-and-Departments/Directory/David-T-Burbach\">David Burbach</a>, a professor and space policy expert at the Naval War College, speaking on his own behalf and not the military. “He hired the right sort of people. He has been willing to stay out of the way, let people do their jobs.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When it comes to military space launches in particular, I don’t think it would be practical or prudent for the government to cancel its contracts with SpaceX because it would cause substantial harm to national security,” said <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/profile/todd-harrison/\">Todd Harrison</a>, a former space industry executive now with the American Enterprise Institute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far in 2024, eight of the <a href=\"https://www.planet4589.org/space/\">Department of Defense’s launches were on SpaceX rockets</a>, against just two for ULA and one for a smaller company called Rocket Lab. ULA has struggled to keep up, and Lockheed and Boeing are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-lockheed-martin-talks-sell-ula-sierra-space-2024-08-16/\">looking to sell the company</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is really no other company right now that can compete with [SpaceX], for scale,” said <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2977269/\">John Plumb</a>, who served as assistant secretary of defense for space policy until earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> The US military is <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/spacex-providing-starlink-services-to-dod-under-unique-terms-and-conditions/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20task%20order%20for%20Starshield,contracts%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20the%20spokesperson.\">also increasingly</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-navy-starlink-sea2/#:~:text=The%20US%20Space%20Force%20signed,name%20for%20its%20military%20products.\">relying on Starlink for mobile internet connectivity</a>. The military version of Starlink, known as Starshield, consists of a constellation of satellites built by SpaceX but owned by the US military. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Starshield’s satellites are highly adaptable to different military purposes. A recent analysis published by SpaceNews <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/op-ed-the-space-race-may-already-be-won/\">compared Starshield to the iPhone</a> for both its adaptability to different software applications and the degree to which it locks users into its platform in order to use those apps. The publication described it as “a Trojan horse that will enable SpaceX to further dominate the space domain and dictate policy to businesses and national governments alike.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I have seen very little expression of concern,” from military commanders, Burbach said. “[Musk is] an incredibly good salesperson. I think his company has actually lived up to much of the hype, but in general, DOD right now is very eager to hear about solutions that can help them leap ahead, particularly when it’s cheaper than existing technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Case in point: SpaceX has reportedly been awarded the contract to build the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/politics/spacex-spy-satellites-elon-musk.html\">next generation of classified surveillance satellites</a> for the National Reconnaissance Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Just can’t quit you</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plumb, the former assistant defense secretary, said it was far-fetched to imagine SpaceX would take action to hinder the US military, whatever Musk’s views. “SpaceX,” he added, “needs the US government as much as the US government needs SpaceX.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Plumb did acknowledge that the military’s reliance on this one company was a sign of larger issues in the defense-industrial complex. “I personally believe it is really important to have resilience in our industrial base, to not be beholden to just one company, but I certainly don&#8217;t see us getting out of SpaceX any time soon,” he said. “We need more competition, not less.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/ppl/dan-grazier/\">Dan Grazier</a>, who studies defense spending and acquisitions at the Stimson Center, said fact that the US government is “kind of married to Elon Musk now” is partly a symptom of consolidation in the US defense industry, which has gone from <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2937898/dod-report-consolidation-of-defense-industrial-base-poses-risks-to-national-sec/\">51 major defense and aerospace contractors</a> in the 1990s to just five today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When it’s your sole supplier, then the government doesn&#8217;t have a very good negotiating position,” Grazier said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Could new competitors be on the way? The best hope for disruption may come from Musk’s fellow tech plutocrat Jeff Bezos. Amazon is developing a competitor to Starlink known as Kuiper, which reportedly features some <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2024/02/06/amazons-kuiper-orbital-internet-system-will-include-important-national-security-features/\">jamming resistant features</a> likely to be of interest to military clients looking to gain an edge on their adversaries’ technology. Its activation has been pushed back until next year, however.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bezos’s Blue Origin is also developing the <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-tests-new-glenn-upper-stage/\">New Glenn</a>, which has a reusable booster like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and could provide <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/15/spacex-competition-nasa-pentagon/\">some competition for launch</a> business. For the time being, however, SpaceX continues to be fairly indispensable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What comes next, if anything, will be heavily influenced by the 2024 election. Concerns about what Musk may be telling Putin, or what Putin is telling him, are likely to be brushed aside if Trump wins the presidency. The former president has discussed giving Musk a newly created position in his Cabinet as “<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-elon-musk-government-job-cost-cutting-1968474\">secretary of cost cutting</a>.” Even if that doesn’t happen, Musk is likely to remain an influential Trumpworld figure, and his various businesses can also be expected to benefit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if Harris wins? Some believe that for all Musk’s influence, he has finally pushed things too far. <a href=\"https://www.eurasiagroup.net/people/ibremmer\">Ian Bremmer</a>, the geopolitical risk analyst and Eurasia Group CEO who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/business/elon-musk-ian-bremmer-putin-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html\">first reported</a> on Musk’s conversations with Putin two years ago, told me at a briefing this week that Musk&nbsp;“should not have a clearance right now. How he got the clearance given some of the things he&#8217;s done and said is kind of a shock and, I think, if it were not for an election period, that would have been reviewed and rescinded already.” However, Bremmer also acknowledged that the US government’s dependence on SpaceX and Starlink is a “serious issue for the US, and that&#8217;s going to have to be addressed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the moment, Musk is devoting a significant portion of his time and resources to electing a government that’s very unlikely to address it.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Today a large number of databases store this sort of genetic data —&nbsp;extracted from plants, animals, and microbes&nbsp;all over the world — and make it available for anyone to use, including companies. Corporations in a range of industries use this genetic data, known as digital sequence information (DSI), to find and create commercial products. Moderna, for example, used <a href=\"https://www.dsiscientificnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSI-covid-vaccines-factsheet.pdf\">hundreds of genetic sequences</a> from different respiratory viruses to swiftly produce its Covid-19 vaccine. Moderna has generated more than <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-beats-covid-vaccine-sales-expectations-deferred-revenue-rolls-2023-05-04/\">$30 billion</a> in sales from the vaccine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is absolutely, 100 percent clear that companies benefit from biodiversity,” Amber Scholz, a scientist at Leibniz Institute DSMZ, a German research organization, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1404559552.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.741428812701,100,78.517142374599\" alt=\"Yellow oblong blobs float blobbily\" title=\"Yellow oblong blobs float blobbily\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that secretes toxins used to produce Botox. | Cavallini James/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Cavallini James/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This new plan is meant to share some of those benefits, including profits, with nature. It states that large companies and other organizations in sectors that rely on DNA sequences — such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and food supplements — should put a portion of their<strong> </strong>profits or revenue<strong> </strong>into a fund called the Cali fund. According to the plan, that portion is either <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/bd4f/2861/9dce4f46d43a637231a442e0/cop-16-l-32-rev1-en.pdf\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/bd4f/2861/9dce4f46d43a637231a442e0/cop-16-l-32-rev1-en.pdf\">1 percent of profit or 0.1 percent of revenue, </a>though it leaves some wiggle room and remains open to review. This approach draws heavily from research by the London School of Economics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new Cali fund,<strong> </strong>operated by the UN, will go toward conserving biodiversity —&nbsp;the plants and animals from which all that genetic information stems.&nbsp;It will dish out the money to countries based on things like how much wildlife they have and how much genetic data they are producing. At least half of the money is meant to support Indigenous people and local communities, especially in low-income parts of the world, according to the plan.&nbsp;The exact formula for how money will be divvied up will be decided later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is a global opportunity for businesses who are benefiting from nature to be able to quickly and easily put some money where it’s genuinely going to make a difference in nature conservation,” William Lockhart, a UK government official who co-led negotiations for the new plan, told Vox on Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Remarkably, the new plan is the only international tool to fund conservation nearly entirely with money from the private sector, Lockhart said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It will change the lives of people,” Flora Mokgohloa, a negotiator with the government of South Africa, told Vox Friday, referring to how the plan could fund local communities who harbor biodiversity.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-549410223.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A large sea sponge, pale pink and cup-shaped, next to fiery orange and deep red coral on the ocean floor, with an assortment of pretty fish hanging out \" title=\"A large sea sponge, pale pink and cup-shaped, next to fiery orange and deep red coral on the ocean floor, with an assortment of pretty fish hanging out \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A barrel sea sponge (right, in pink) on a reef in Indonesia.

Many of the world’s hotspots of biodiversity are in developing nations, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, yet many of the companies that profit from that biodiversity are based in wealthy countries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is about correcting an injustice,” Thambisetty said. “A number of biodiverse countries have been alienated from the value of their resources.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s a big deal,” she said of the plan, when it was in draft form.<strong> </strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/54090836136_3068c7a220_o.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"People walk across a paved outdoor space surrounded by trees, with hazy hills in the distance.

The deal was reached in the final hours of COP16, a meeting of roughly 180 world governments that are members of a global environmental treaty called the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). While that treaty is legally binding, this new plan — which is a “decision” in treaty parlance — is not. So unless countries enshrine the decision in their own legislation,<strong> </strong>it will be difficult to enforce. (Some countries already have legislation to regulate access to their genetic data. It’s still not clear how these&nbsp;national&nbsp;laws will work alongside&nbsp;the&nbsp;new global approach.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more is that the US, the world’s largest economy, is one of two nations that’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/379295/cop16-biodiversity-why-us-global-treaty-protect-nature\">not a member of the CBD</a> treaty. The other is the Vatican. That means American companies may have even less of an incentive to follow this new plan and pay the fee for using DNA extracted from wild organisms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some advocates for lower-income countries are unhappy with the plan, saying it doesn’t do enough to remedy the problem of what they call biopiracy. That’s when companies commercialize biodiversity, including DNA, and fail to share the benefits that stem from those resources —&nbsp;including profits —&nbsp;with the communities who safeguard them. The plan undermines a country’s ability to control who gets to use its genetic resources, said Nithin Ramakrishnan, a senior researcher at Third World Network, a group that advocates for human rights and benefit sharing. “You’re just creating a voluntary fund that promotes biopiracy,”&nbsp;he said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/CBD_COP16-4791_0.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Colombia President Gustavo Petro (left) and UN Secretary-General António Guterres (right) embrace on October 29 at COP16.&lt;br&gt; | Mike Muzurakis/Earth Negotiations Bulletin/IISD\" data-portal-copyright=\"Mike Muzurakis/Earth Negotiations Bulletin/IISD\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, this decision —&nbsp;which resulted from hours of negotiations, often over single words —&nbsp;still has a lot of power, experts told Vox. Many companies,&nbsp;and especially those with international operations, will likely pay the fee, or a portion of it, they said, even if they’re based in the US. That’s because they operate in regions, such as the European Union, where this new plan will likely be honored. “The big companies are pretty engaged here,” Scholz, who is based in Germany, said. “They have a significant reputational risk.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Basecamp Research, a London-based startup that claims to manage the world’s largest database of non-human genetic sequences, wasn’t worried about a potential fee. “We are quite comfortable and willing to contribute,” Bupe Mwambingu, the company’s biodiversity partnerships manager, said. “It is going to go toward conserving biodiversity, which is the resource that we are tapping into for our business.” (Basecamp Research already pays local communities and conservation groups to extract physical organisms, such as microbes, which are later sequenced, the company said. It’s not clear whether this new plan would require the firm to pay more.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Early reactions from the pharmaceutical industry suggest it’s not thrilled. On Saturday morning, David Reddy, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, said in a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ifpma.org/news/conclusion-of-cop16-negotiations-on-multilateral-mechanism-for-benefit-sharing-of-dsi/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">statement</a>&nbsp;that the new plan does “not get the balance right” between the benefits it could generate and the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;“costs to&nbsp;society and science.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Any new system should not introduce further conditions on how scientists access such data and add to a complex web of regulation, taxation and other obligations for the whole R&amp;D ecosystem — including on academia and biotech companies,” he said.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share feedback on this story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Comments or questions on this story?

After multiple Latine <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/jennifer-lopez-bad-bunny-ricky-martin-amplify-kamala-harris-campaign-trump-rally-racist-puerto-rico-joke-1235812714/\">stars spoke out</a> against <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380818/trump-rally-puerto-rico-tony-hinchcliffe-groypers\">the racism and misogyny on display</a> at last week’s Madison Square Garden rally, Ricky Martin posted an Instagram Story <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cazarespr/status/1850678928815317433\">claiming</a> that the platform was blocking a post he’d published on the subject. Users also <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBunnyPR/comments/1gf39cp/x_twitter/\">speculated</a> that their <a href=\"https://x.com/badbunnynetwork/status/1851402662949875774\">access</a> to other public figures who posted about the rally, including Bad Bunny, was being somehow restricted. Add these musicians to a long list of users who say they’ve been shadow banned. These include <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/lifestyle/bella-hadid-claims-instagram-blocks-her-stories-when-she-talks-about-palestine\">Bella Hadid</a>, who claimed in 2022 that the platform penalized her for posts about Palestine, and sources for a recent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/\">Washington Post</a> investigation who claimed Instagram throttled their political content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Claims of political post suppression have been made for years, but the idea that a platform would be censoring this content right before a deeply consequential election is alarming. Is it true?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, yes and no. Instagram and its text platform, Threads, have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/\">claimed</a> in the past and continue to claim that they don&#8217;t shadow ban specific people. “Our policies are designed to give everyone a voice while at the same time keeping our platforms safe,&#8221; Meta’s Public Affairs Director Dani Lever told Vox in an email. &#8220;We’re currently enforcing these policies during a fast-moving, highly polarized, and intense election and we readily acknowledge errors can be made, but any implication that we deliberately and systemically suppress a particular voice is false.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-ranking-explained/\">detailed</a> the many moving parts that go into determining how a post gets ranked, curated, and served to users on a platform, including, he said, “thousands” of “signals” of user preferences, including what users like, information about the post and who posted it, and how interested you are in the person who made it. This criteria varies from user to user, and it’s constantly in flux.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instagram’s complicated system of ranking content involves another operation of filtering content as well. <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/02/25/how-we-investigated-shadowbanning-on-instagram\">Previous reporting</a> has indicated that Instagram and Threads do remove and filter out content, including covertly restricting individual accounts and their content from search results — the oldest <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/23933846/shadowbanning-meta-israel-hamas-war-palestine\">commonly understood meaning</a> of a shadow ban — as well as showing the posts to fewer users. That apparent contradiction may be why shadow ban discourse flared up again this past week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition, the political context — mere days away from an anxiety-inducing election — adds another layer of concern. The platform’s current <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-approach-to-political-content-on-instagram-and-threads\">official policy</a> regarding politics is not to recommend any political content to users. “Our goal is to preserve the ability for people to choose to interact with political content, while respecting each person’s appetite for it,” Mosseri <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C3IjTzGvk6_\">said</a> earlier this year when the policy was announced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People have told us they want to see less political content on Facebook,&#8221; Lever told Vox, &#8220;so we have spent the last few years <a href=\"https://transparency.meta.com/features/approach-to-political-content\">refining</a> our approach to reduce the amount of political content seen in Feed and other surfaces.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Users can opt into being served political content if they want — which is good — but users who don’t know they need to opt in first might go looking for political content and then get the wrong idea when they don’t find it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not only that, but in March, Instagram <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C4yJaqgxK5o\">rolled out</a> a little-noticed but massive change to the way it displays hashtags across the site: It essentially erased real-time feeds altogether. Now, regardless of what tag you’re searching for, you can no longer see posts made in real time on a universal feed. While you can still see posts that are recommended for you on the mobile app, you can’t see everything. This, again, is another wrinkle that might make people think they’re being targeted or that their posts are being hidden, when they’re more likely just being lost in Meta’s ineffable algorithmic approach to sourcing content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the polarized era we’re in, all of these factors can create confusion. After all, Meta <em>has</em> previously limited political content across all its platforms. In 2022, it issued an <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/09/28/upcoming-restriction-period-for-us-ads/\">ad restriction</a> in the week prior to the election to squelch all political advertising from getting through, and it’s conducting a similar restriction this week. (A recent <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2024/10/31/facebook-ads-election-misinformation/\">Forbes investigation</a> found that prior to the current week-long ban on election advertising, the company has been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284674/meta-is-profiting-from-election-conspiracy-theories\">profiting handily</a> from political Facebook advertising — even ads that spread rampant disinformation about the election.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lever pointed out to Vox that the company had actually <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/how-meta-is-planning-for-elections-in-2024/\">announced</a> its forthcoming approach to the elections a full year ago. &#8220;We very clearly stated that we would show people links to official information about how, when, and where to vote when they searched for terms related to the election on Facebook and Instagram,” Lever told Vox. Still, the average Instagram user likely won’t see missing content as part of a site-wide design; they may see it instead as an unfair ban on a specific piece of content or theme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Users’ perceptions that their speech is being curtailed has become a running theme for Meta, as well as other platforms like Twitter, now known as X. Owner Elon Musk has frequently come under fire for allowing censorship and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/10/30/study-shows-elon-musk-tweets-pro-trump-appear-x-users-feeds-within-2-sessions/\">artificial amplification</a> of content on that platform, often at the behest of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235213/x-brazil-suppression-speech-elon-musk-india-turkey\">right-wing authoritarian governments</a>. (Vox has reached out to X for comment.) Under Musk, X has also been known to <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-twitter-censor-left-accounts-rcna59638\">ban left-leaning users</a>, including journalists, from the platform despite the users having violated no site policies. All of this prior activity tends to feed the rumor mill in times of high anxiety and tension — like, say, days before an election. Even if X isn’t filtering content, the perception that it must be can contribute to user backlash.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The problem of users believing they’ve been shadow banned reflects larger tensions between tech and politics</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That leads us to another, perhaps more ominous, problem. Increasingly, the prominent moguls at the helms of these platforms seem willing to bend the knee to Donald Trump. Some tech entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong may be <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-28/non-endorsement-post-la-times-cancellations\">hedging their bets</a> in anticipation of a Trump election win. Musk has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380185/trump-elon-musk-election\">made it clear</a> that he is a Trump fan, but that’s not necessarily the case with Mark Zuckerberg, with whom Trump has had a famously tense relationship over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/1/6/22217657/us-capitol-breach-trump-rally-presidential-election\">January 6 insurrection,</a> Facebook and Twitter both <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/1/16/22234971/trump-twitter-facebook-social-media-ban-election-misinformation-zignal\">banned Trump</a> from their platforms, which left the former president thoroughly disgruntled, with Zuckerberg in particular. That March, on TruthSocial, he <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/donald-trump-tiktok-ban-facebook-zuckerschmuck-enemy-of-the-people-1235934951/\">indicated</a> his intent to protect TikTok in the face of attempts by US politicians to ban the platform — solely because TikTok is Facebook’s biggest competitor. Trump followed that up by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-warns-mark-zuckerberg-could-165321790.html\">threatening</a> to put Zuckerberg in prison if he filtered Trump-related content from Facebook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s statements are in line with a long litany of threats he’s made against his enemies across <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-opponents-enemy-within.html\">politics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5161480/trump-media-threats-abc-cbs-60-minutes-journalists\">the media</a>, and <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/trumps-threats-to-prosecute-opponents-election-workers-and-google/articleshow/114783967.cms?from=mdr\">Silicon Valley</a> if he were to win office. Additionally, Congress has shown <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/6/17824652/twitter-dorsey-energy-and-commerce-hearing-shadow-banning\">a willingness</a> to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/28/21538767/senate-social-media-hearing-section-230-twitter-google-facebook-dorsey-pichai-zuckerberg-censorship\">investigate social media platforms</a> when they’re displeased by alleged content restrictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tensions between Trump and Meta seem to be thawing, however, as Meta has been giving progressively more face to Trump. Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/trump-facebook-instagram-account-suspension/\">restored Trump’s access</a> to Facebook and Instagram in 2023 after a two-year ban. He also <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/187644/too-scared-endorse-harris-trump\">praised Trump</a> for his bravery following a July <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates\">assassination attempt</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/28/trump-bezos-billionaires-zuckerberg/\">called</a> him after the incident. While Trump had previously referred to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/donald-trump-tiktok-ban-facebook-zuckerschmuck-enemy-of-the-people-1235934951/\">Zuckerberg as an “enemy of the people,”</a> that vibe has shifted; on a recent podcast interview, Trump claimed he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4934534-trump-zuckerberg-politics-facebook/\">likes Zuckerberg “much better now.”</a> Facebook has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/09/meta-denies-zuckerberg-told-trump-he-cant-vote-for-a-democrat/?\">denied</a> Trump’s <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-ear-campaign-assassination-attempt.html\">claim</a> that Zuckerberg went one further and implied he would be voting for Trump in the election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not hard to see that in a scenario where tech CEOs are <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-trump-claims-are-courting-him/\">falling in line</a> to pay their dues to Trump in case he wins the election, the end user is the one who loses out.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The plant milk fee hasn’t helped. In the US, around <a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2021/key-takeaways-from-starbucks-q3-fy21-earnings-results/#\">one quarter</a> of Starbucks’ drinks that include milk are ordered with plant-based milk, according to data from 2021, and the upcharge adds much more to the cost of a drink for the customer than the actual cost of the plant-based milk to Starbucks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <a href=\"http://switch4good.org/\">Switch4Good</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for shifting away from dairy and has long agitated against the plant milk surcharge, it <a href=\"https://switch4good.org/droptheupcharge/\">costs</a> Starbucks between 9 and 28 cents extra to make a drink with soy, almond, or oat milk. That means the extra 70- to 80-cent charge could amount to a markup of more than 700 percent, depending on the milk alternative. A Starbucks spokesperson told Vox that the decision to drop the surcharge was made to benefit customers but didn’t answer questions about Switch4Good’s analysis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The company has also been<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-lawsuit-nondairy-milk-lactose-intolerance/\"> sued for the upcharge</a> on discrimination grounds because around one-third of Americans — disproportionately people of color — have difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While changing course on the plant milk upcharge was, above all, a business decision, it could also be a milestone in the food industry’s <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21092024/food-companies-greenhouse-gas-emissions/\">stalled efforts to combat climate change</a>, given milk’s big carbon footprint. The switch will also help to further mainstream dairy-free milk, a more humane and sustainable alternative to conventional dairy, during what has otherwise been a turbulent year for the plant-based food market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Starbucks’s new policy is a big deal for the climate&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Producing cow’s milk has outsize <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety\">social</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding\">environmental costs</a> compared to plant-based milks — costs that aren’t priced into what consumers pay for dairy, which benefits from a range of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools\">government subsidies designed</a> to make animal products cheap and plentiful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, there’s the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/377096/sonoma-county-denver-factory-farming-slaughterhouse-ban-ballot-measures\">animal cruelty</a>. The dairy business model depends on <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/160448/meat-bestiality-artificial-insemination\">artificially inseminating cows</a> and separating them from their calves at birth so humans can take their milk. The calves are typically forced to live alone in small enclosures while dairy cows are kept in large, industrial sheds, spending <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00257/full\">little to no time in pasture</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After multiple cycles of pregnancy and birth, when a dairy cow’s milk productivity wanes, she’s typically sent to slaughter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2163453178_584022.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Dairy cows in milking stalls at a large farm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. | Robert J.

Dairy production devours dramatically <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impact-milks\">more land and water</a>, and contributes far more greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution, than plant-based alternatives. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline\">Climate scientists agree</a> that reducing dairy and meat consumption in wealthy countries is a necessary part of climate mitigation.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/dC9zJ-cow-s-milk-has-a-much-bigger-environmental-footprint-than-plant-based-milk.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=14.652597402597,0,70.694805194805,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Starbucks has committed to <a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/uploads/2021/04/Starbucks-2020-Global-Environmental-and-Social-Impact-Report.pdf\">halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030</a>, and expanding its <a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2020/plant-based-menu-innovation-at-starbucks/#\">plant-based menu options</a> is a key component of that goal. Removing the plant milk upcharge, a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement, also contributes to the company’s sustainability plans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of 2023, the coffee chain had made <a href=\"https://content-prod-live.cert.starbucks.com/binary/v2/asset/137-88758.pdf\">minimal progress toward reducing its carbon footprint</a>; its overall emissions had increased from its 2019 baseline, in part because its emissions from cow’s milk were up 8 percent over that period. Starbucks is such a large buyer of milk that dairy emissions across its global operations is equivalent to around <a href=\"https://dairy.osu.edu/newsletter/buckeye-dairy-news/volume-26-issue-2/dairy-sustainability-–-jargon-dairy-story-and\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://dairy.osu.edu/newsletter/buckeye-dairy-news/volume-26-issue-2/dairy-sustainability-–-jargon-dairy-story-and\">2</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030222004830\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030222004830\">percent</a> of emissions from all US dairy production.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Food companies are <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21092024/food-companies-greenhouse-gas-emissions/\">struggling to cut their emissions</a> because most of their menus revolve around meat and dairy, the most carbon-intensive foods. Starbucks’s decision to drop its dairy-free surcharge should help. Substituting nondairy milks is already Starbucks’s second most requested drink customization, according to the company, so the change could push even more of its customers to go dairy-free. It could also push other chains to follow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What the Starbucks change could mean for the future of plant-based dairy</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The move represents a rare win in recent years for the US plant-based food industry. After a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger\">meteoric rise</a> in the late 2010s — as Beyond Meat and Impossible burgers went mainstream and Oatly became the it-milk of baristas and consumers alike — the sector has since <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/17/23682232/impossible-beyond-plant-based-meat-sales\">faltered</a>. A number of fast food chains have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/which-fast-food-has-fake-meat-not-many-serve-beyond-meat-impossible-foods\">dropped plant-based burgers</a> from their menus, while the incumbent livestock sector has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/5/23709822/milk-dairy-plant-based-meat-soy-almond-fake-processed\">attacked plant-based startups</a>. Shoppers have opted for cheaper animal products amid high inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plant-based milk, though, has managed to weather the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/7/20880318/meatless-meat-mainstream-backlash-impossible-burger\">plant-based backlash</a> better than most; from 2021 to 2023, <a href=\"https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf\">revenues were up 9 percent</a>, accounting for almost <a href=\"https://gfi.org/marketresearch/#:~:text=Plant%2Dbased%20milk%20sales,unit%20sales%20declined%208%20percent.\">15 percent of total milk sales</a> (though the number of nondairy milk units fell). Meanwhile, plant-based meat sales fell by an estimated 13 percent during that same period.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given Starbucks’s size and influence, dairy-free milk’s market share may continue to grow — and cow’s milk sales, which have been dropping for decades, may decline further.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/CZPWG-american-milk-consumption-has-fallen-by-almost-50-percent-since-1975-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.741052270191,100,66.517895459617\" alt=\"Chart showing US fluid milk consumption dropping by nearly half since 1975 through the early 2020s. \" title=\"Chart showing US fluid milk consumption dropping by nearly half since 1975 through the early 2020s. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Starbucks’s policy change, however, is more than just a sign of plant-based milk’s staying power; it also demonstrates the potential for the plant-based and anti-factory farming movements to apply sustained pressure to corporations and get results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA and <a href=\"http://switch4good.org/\">Switch4Good</a> have called on the company to drop the surcharge for years. While Starbucks says the change was a business decision, the protests, celebrity endorsements, and petitions likely helped, creating the very idea that charging more for plant-based options was unjust. And while the protests have at times been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/20/james-cromwell-starbucks-glue-vegan-milk-upcharge/\">ridiculed</a> as the work of whiny vegans angry about a 70-cent charge, the successful campaign will now primarily benefit Starbucks’s millions of nonvegan customers who just enjoy plant-based milks or require them due to lactose intolerance (and, of course, factory-farmed cows and the climate).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The move follows a vigorous five-year campaign, letters from more than 160,000 PETA supporters, protests at Starbucks around the country, and help from actor James Cromwell… as well as an appeal from Sir Paul McCartney,” a PETA statement reads. PETA paused its campaign in September to give the new Starbucks CEO, Brian Niccol, time to “make the right decision,” the organization said. “And he delivered.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/4.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.5968586387435,100,86.806282722513\" alt=\"A group of people with protest signs protest Starbucks’s plant-based upcharge. \" title=\"A group of people with protest signs protest Starbucks’s plant-based upcharge. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"PETA protested Starbucks’s plant-based milk surcharge for years before the company decided to drop it. | PETA\" data-portal-copyright=\"PETA\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Starbucks wanted to, it could go even further by making plant-based milk the default option for its milky drinks. In 2022, Blue Bottle, a Nestlé-owned upscale coffee chain with some 100 locations around the world, announced it was making <a href=\"https://blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/posts/oat-milk-by-default\">oat milk the default milk</a> in beverage orders in US locations as part of a larger effort to cut carbon emissions. Now, if a Blue Bottle customer wants cow’s milk, they have to request it, but most don’t; a few months after making the switch, Blue Bottle reported that 63 percent of customers were sticking with oat milk.<br><br>Blue Bottle’s approach, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/companies-and-schools-are-using-nudge-theory-to-cut-meat-consumption\">other food companies</a> have also embraced, shows how heavily our food choices are influenced by our food environments. Small changes — from dropping surcharges to changing default options — can nudge us toward a more climate-friendly future. Starbucks is the latest, and largest, company to put conventional dairy and plant-based milk on a level playing field. Others should follow.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Instead, she told Vox, “it’s based on feelings,” as well as misunderstandings about which groups, and what kind of people, are on the other side.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through a series of surveys and experiments over four years, Mason and Nathan Kalmoe, a political communication professor at Louisiana State University, studied the origins of extreme partisanship among ordinary Americans for the 2022 book, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo163195227.html\"><em>Radical American Partisanship</em></a><em>. </em>Mason and Kalmoe found that around 40 percent of Americans surveyed were willing to use dehumanizing language about the other party — a metric she says can be a precursor to even more serious political violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King spoke with Mason to understand how the American electorate got to this point and how we can get back to a more civil politics<em>.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<iframe frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP7443558362\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;ve written two books that seem relevant here. Tell me the names of your books.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first book is <em><a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo27527354.html\">Uncivil Agreement How Politics Became Our Identity</a></em>. And the second book is <em>Radical American Partisanship</em>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two main parties in the United States, Democrats and Republicans; as a researcher, what do you know about what we think about the other group that is incorrect?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everything! We all overestimate the extent to which people in the other party are extreme in terms of the policies. We also overestimate the degree to which the party is made up of groups that we kind of think of as like the stereotypical groups associated with the party. So, Republicans think that the Democratic Party is majority Black. It&#8217;s not. Democrats think that the Republican Party is majority wealthy people who make over $250,000 a year. It&#8217;s actually like 2 percent. And so we tend to assume that the stereotypical group that we think of when we think of that party, we tend to assume that that makes up the whole party and we&#8217;re all wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And in fact, political scientists and sociologists have done experiments where we correct people&#8217;s misperceptions and it actually makes them hate the other party less because they hadn&#8217;t realized that the party wasn&#8217;t made up of maybe people they didn&#8217;t like or wasn&#8217;t made up of people who are really extreme in their policy preferences. We are overestimating the extent to which the other party is made up of people that we assume we would really dislike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How do you define partisanship?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The classic understanding of partisanship is just which party you vote for based on your assessments of politics. But more recently, we&#8217;re starting to think of partisanship as a social identity, meaning it&#8217;s a psychological connection to the other people that are in the party and feeling like what happens to our party impacts our own sense of self-esteem and self-worth. The traditional view is thinking of choosing who to vote for like a banker chooses an investment. And really what we&#8217;re doing today is more like sports fans cheering on our team.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s partisanship. What is polarization?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So polarization can also be two things. It can be more than that, actually. But the classic understanding of polarization was that we are disagreeing about issues. So Democrats are really liberal and Republicans are really conservative on all of these different issues. But increasingly, what we&#8217;re finding now is that our polarization is partly about that, but it&#8217;s also about how we feel about each other. So Democrats and Republicans really don&#8217;t like one another, and we call that affective polarization. So it&#8217;s based on feelings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And really the important thing about understanding the effect of polarization is that it doesn&#8217;t require us to disagree in order to hate each other. We use theories from social psychology about why any groups don&#8217;t like each other to explain why Democrats and Republicans don&#8217;t like each other, and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily require that they disagree on, you know, marginal tax rates.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does the data really say that people of different parties dislike or even hate each other?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah. In fact, in my first book, I asked people how would they feel if their child married somebody from the other party or how would they feel if someone from the other party moved in next door to them. And those types of questions — people really don&#8217;t like the idea of their child marrying somebody from the other party. They don&#8217;t really want to have social contact with people from the other party. And that type of feeling isn&#8217;t entirely rooted in disagreement. So people who have really moderate policy preferences can still really dislike people from the other party. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the second book, we started to ask more extreme questions. So we asked, “Do you think people on the other party are not just wrong for politics, they&#8217;re downright evil?” Or even, “Do they deserve to be treated like humans because they behave like animals?” So a dehumanization question, which is kind of the most extreme of the questions, and we are finding that about 50 percent of partisans are willing to say that their partisan opponents are evil, and between 20 to 40 percent are even willing to dehumanize people in the other party. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We started asking this question in 2017. The reason we asked the question is because this is the type of thing that we measure in other countries, if there&#8217;s a mass violence event. This type of attitude exists beforehand. It doesn&#8217;t always lead to violence, but whenever there is mass violence, you have to have these dehumanizing and vilifying attitudes present beforehand, because otherwise it&#8217;s really hard to harm another human being and still feel like a morally good person. And really, the only way to do that is to think that they are a threat to you, that they&#8217;re evil and that they&#8217;re subhuman. And so when we see genocide in other places, for example, these attitudes exist before before the violence occurs. And what we wanted to know was, did these attitudes exist in the American electorate? And no one had really asked that question before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tell me about what kind of polarization we&#8217;re seeing these days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what we&#8217;re seeing is mostly affective polarization. So it&#8217;s basically the type of polarization that means that we don&#8217;t like one another. And if you think about human groups throughout all of human history, there are plenty of reasons that two human groups don&#8217;t like one another. Humans hate one another for all kinds of reasons. And it&#8217;s very much that type of visceral dislike and distrust that any two social groups can have against each other that we&#8217;re observing in the Democratic and Republican parties right now.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disagreeing on policy seems to me quite normal; thinking that a person in the other party is evil seems a bit less normal to me. What is this rooted in, this affective polarization? Where did this come from? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of this animosity between Democrats and Republicans has come out of a trend over the last many decades of not only our partisan identities being the thing that we fight over during elections, but also all of these other identities. And since the 1960s, our racial identities, our religious identities, all other cultural, even geographic identities have moved into alignment with our party identities. So what happens is that when we&#8217;re thinking about politics and who wins and who loses, we&#8217;re not just thinking my party wins or my party loses. We&#8217;re thinking, “If my party wins, then my racial group wins and my religious group wins.” And all of these other parts of my identity are winners and it feels really good and vice versa. “If my party loses, all these different parts of my identity are also losing,” and that feels really, really terrible. So the stakes get a lot higher when we think about our electoral choices and who is in control of our government as reflective of who we are as a human being. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would like to not live in this version of America. There&#8217;s an election to cover. How do we, in all seriousness, fix this problem?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We&#8217;ve tried a number of interventions in our surveys, so we&#8217;ll embed an experiment in the survey to try to see if we can make people less violent or less approving of violence. And one thing that we found that basically always works is to have them read a quote from a leader. So in our experiments, we use Biden or Trump, a quote that just says something like, “violence is never acceptable. That&#8217;s just not how we do things here.” And people who read that quote are less likely to approve of political violence than those who&#8217;ve read nothing in a control condition. So simply reading a sentence from a leader can get people to kind of step back from this aggressive stance. We need to get something back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the things I think that the last few years have done — and I think Trump as a candidate in particular — is really break the norms of what&#8217;s acceptable behavior in American politics and in American society. The idea that we can use racist and misogynistic language against our fellow citizens, the idea that we can tell lies and not be punished for it; you know, a lot of the things that our politics is characterized by right now are things that 20 years ago would not have ever been allowed on the political stage. And there are plenty of Democrats and Republicans that just remember a different time. And what worries me is that young people don&#8217;t. So we&#8217;re increasingly in this world where young people don&#8217;t know that it was nicer, more diplomatic, and so I hope that we can pay attention to the norms that have been broken because the only way to enforce a norm is for people around you, when you break the norm, to tell you to stop it. Laws are enforced with law enforcement. Norms are enforced with us, with people. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the reason that shame is such a powerful emotion, is because it&#8217;s the way that we enforce norms. To the extent that together as a community, if we see somebody behaving in a way that we think of as unacceptable, that we as a community can say to them, “That&#8217;s beyond the pale, that&#8217;s that you just crossed the line. I&#8217;m not accepting that kind of behavior.” And we haven&#8217;t been doing that to each other in many years, I think. But to the extent that we can kind of remember what it&#8217;s like to be normal people and treat each other like we&#8217;re part of a community together and that we&#8217;re part of the same society, that&#8217;s something that we all can do on our own.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

She rolls her eyes. “Guilty guilty guilty on all these charges,” she says. “The New York Post lady was there, just looking so smug.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stewart, now 83, pauses reflectively. “She’s dead now,” she adds. “Thank goodness. Nobody has to put up with all that crap that she was writing all the time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The past few years have seen a small boom in documentaries about the many wronged women of the ’90s and 2000s: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22276585/framing-britney-spears-us-weekly-perez-hilton-daniel-ramos\"><em>Framing Britney Spears</em></a>; <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23585077/pamela-a-love-story-netflix-anderson-documentary\"><em>Pamela, a Love Story</em></a>; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/television/lorena-bobbitt-documentary-jordan-peele.html\"><em>Lorena</em></a>. <em>Martha, </em>directed by R.J. Cutler, is a different animal. It is not an apologia for its subject. It does not suggest that the public and its obsession with her foibles and legal troubles ruined her life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Martha Stewart does not admit to ever having her life ruined. Martha Stewart disdains self-pity. Martha Stewart refuses to be a victim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Some people revel in this self-pity, etc., etc.,” Stewart remarks to the camera, when asked to reminisce about her divorce from the husband she describes as “a piece of shit” for having cheated. (Her own affairs, she explains to the camera <a href=\"https://x.com/netflix/status/1844415230631346531\">in a now-viral clip</a>, don’t count because her husband didn’t know about them.) She herself is different, she continues: “I just don’t.” She wouldn’t know how to wallow.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@philstarlife/video/7424823134383131922\" data-video-id=\"7424823134383131922\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@philstarlife\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@philstarlife?refer=embed\">@philstarlife</a> <p>American businesswoman Martha Stewart revealed that she cheated on her now ex-husband Andy in the trailer of Netflix documentary Martha.

She is exactly the mean perfectionist control freak all the tabloids used to claim she was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>What a perfectionist, what a control freak, what a mean lady.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cutler, who conducts the documentary&#8217;s single talking-head interview with its subject, interlaces it with plenty of archival footage. (In a neat touch, all the other interviews for the film are audio-only, so that Stewart’s face is the only one&nbsp;we see in the present.) As the interview evolves, Cutler seems to revel in needling Stewart. He repeatedly asks her the kinds of questions she clearly finds annoying —&nbsp;personal questions on subjects that deal with moments where she perceives herself as having failed. He pauses mid-interview, leaving her to sigh heavily as she waits for the questions to keep going. He brings out her Martha-ness, her irritability, her impatience, her dislike at being at someone else’s mercy, under circumstances that are not precisely under her control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those are all the things that used to make people hate Martha Stewart. What a perfectionist, what a control freak, what a mean lady. In <em>Martha</em>, they become the thing that makes her the most likable. They are human flaws, messy and endearing, in a woman who has worked for decades to try to make herself appear perfect.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stewart traces her perfectionism back to her upbringing. She was born in 1941, just on the far side of the Depression, to parents who couldn’t afford to feed their family. They set their six children to work tending the garden and beat them when they made mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her father was exacting, an alcoholic whose fine tweed suits and leather shoes had to be pressed and shined just so. Stewart’s face lights up when she says she was the only one he trusted to tend to them, but she allows that the man himself was “mean, mean, mean.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She got out of that house every chance she saw: first by modeling as a teenager, then by going to college, then by marrying publishing executive Andrew Stewart. Characteristically, once she was married, Stewart tackled every ambition with ferocious discipline and took each failure as a personal crisis. She spent years as a successful stockbroker until one of her recommendations tanked, at which point she quit finance and moved her family to the farthest suburbs of Connecticut so she could remodel a house that was falling apart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eventually, Stewart parlayed her highly refined skills at homemaking and party-hosting into a career as an upscale caterer for her well-heeled friends. From catering came the lifestyle guide <em>Entertaining</em> in 1982, and then more books, and then a magazine, and then a TV show. By the 1990s, Stewart was the center of a multimedia empire, the embodiment of a massively lucrative brand that was all centered on a lifestyle so elevated that no one besides Stewart herself could ever possibly achieve it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Martha Stewart thought snow peas individually stuffed with cream cheese made an elegant dinner party side. Martha Stewart modeled her fruit bowl displays off the paintings of the Italian Renaissance. Martha Stewart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/29/meet-the-cleanfluencers-the-online-gurus-who-like-things-nice-and-tidy\">like the cleaning influencers of today</a>, wanted to store her laundry detergent in an aesthetically pleasing container.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this could be a lot to swallow, both when Stewart was coming up and now. It&#8217;s easy to roll your eyes and wonder who has the time and energy to think that much about their laundry room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p> “She got under men’s hair,” Paglia says, “this idea that you could be a homemaking expert who’s a bitch.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Martha Stewart is a lot more interesting, it turns out, when she is presented to you not as someone you should aspire to be like but as a very strange and specific psychological case study.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cutler presents Stewart to the audience as a portrait of a perfectionist scrabbling madly for something, anything, to mold in her own image, and then lashing out furiously at anyone she perceives as getting in her way. You don’t necessarily want to be her, but there’s something so compelling about watching her twist herself around to become this impossible-to-please empress of all she beholds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One piece of archival footage shows Stewart lambasting an employee behind the scenes for using a paring knife to cut an orange for Easter brunch. “Well, isn’t that a stupid knife?” Stewart says impatiently, her tone sharp enough to cut the orange with voice alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In voiceover, the critic Camille Paglia explains the phenomenon that we’re watching. “She got under men’s hair,” Paglia says, “this idea that you could be a homemaking expert who’s a bitch.”</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-528812654.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.172323571838,100,79.655352856324\" alt=\"Martha Stewart, beaming, carries a tray of brioche sandwiches through the glass doors of the Stock Exchange.

She was a woman with power <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22350286/2000s-pop-culture-misogyny-britney-spears-janet-jackson-whitney-houston-monica-lewinsky\">in a moment misogynistic enough to humiliate powerful woman</a>; a woman who made art and business out of home life in a moment <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/kwmx72/that_damn_donna_reed_discussion/\">just feminist enough to understand a focus on the home as regressive</a>; a woman viciously committed to perfection in a moment that craved <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2022/2/10/22926619/introducing-just-like-us-the-tabloids-that-changed-america\">tabloid-friendly mess</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was the fundamental paradox of Martha Stewart. On the one hand, she built her brand on presenting a vision of the home so exactingly idealized it was impossible for anyone to live up to it. She romanticized the domestic sphere that women had spent so many decades trying to escape. She was regressive, surely, a ’50s throwback who deserved to be mocked and ignored.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Stewart used all that domestic acumen to make herself the first female self-made billionaire in the world. She took homemaking seriously as an aesthetic pursuit when the rest of the culture was minimizing it as unimportant women’s work. She had power and she had swagger and she knew it, and it put a target on her back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/02/21/martha-stewart-profile-joan-didion\">When Joan Didion wrote about Martha Stewart</a> for the New Yorker in 2000, she noted that there was something telling about the way all those Martha Stewart parody books that flourished in the era were so bizarrely sexualized. The parodies, Didion wrote, were “too broad, misogynistic in a cartoon way (stripping Martha to her underwear has been a reliable motif of countless on-line parodies), curiously nervous (‘Keeping Razors Circumcision-Sharp’ is one feature in ‘Martha Stuart’s Better Than You at Entertaining’), oddly uncomfortable, a little too intent on marginalizing a rather considerable number of women by making light of their situations and their aspirations.” There was a vengeful, humiliating edge to all of it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that power, however, took quite a beating when Stewart was arrested for insider trading in 2002.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2004, Stewart was found “guilty guilty guilty,” not of fraud but of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal investigators. She allegedly took an illicit tip from her stockbroker, perhaps in the same spirit with which she decided that her affairs didn’t count as infidelity. (The chief prosecutor against her was James Comey, of whom Stewart says in <em>Martha</em>, “Those prosecutors should have been put in a Cuisinart and turned on high.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Martha</em>, Cutler lingers in detail on Stewart’s trial and her time in jail. In his hands, the media circus around her conviction becomes a portrait of what it is like for a woman who built her whole identity on her sense of control to find herself rendered completely powerless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In archival footage of the period between her trial and her sentencing, Stewart explained her preparations for her sentencing to an interviewer in a chipper Snow White voice, as though explaining how to fold a fitted sheet. “Well, you know, you go to the dentist. You go to the gynecologist,” she said. “You just make sure you’re in as best shape as you possibly can to let your body and your mind take whatever comes!” In the diary she kept in prison, she instructed herself sternly to learn something new every day: the control freak doing her best to reap something of value from even the worst of experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Martha_n_00_22_37_12.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"A blonde woman in her 30s stands in the center of a cluttered wood-paneled kitchen.

The scandal that came with it, though, forced her to rebuild everything. She lost control of her fiercely guarded brand, lost her TV show, and lost what she estimates to be about $1 billion. Her first project after her release, the flashy NBC talk show <em>The Martha Stewart Show</em>, she dismisses now as a failure despite its seven seasons on the air: She wasn’t, she says, able to control it the way she wanted to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eventually, Stewart managed to rebuild herself as a sort of ironic celebrity. She’s built a clever brand for herself now as the nice grandma who knows everything there is to know about rose gardens but also has done hard time and <a href=\"https://people.com/food/martha-stewart-snoop-dogg-friendship-timeline/\">is friends with Snoop</a>. (Endearingly, their relationship appears to be both authentic and organic —&nbsp;they were seated next to each other on Comedy Central’s roast of Justin Bieber and apparently hit it off.) She’s not a billionaire anymore, but she’s made herself relevant to the public again while apparently refusing to change her own behavior or personality in any meaningful way. She still wants power, and she is still grabbing for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Stewart managed to rebuild herself as a sort of ironic celebrity. </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Didion’s essay, she suggests, in a passage Stewart describes as “very insightful” in the documentary, that it’s Stewart’s power that is attractive to her audience, not her unreachable exactitude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The dreams and the fears into which Martha Stewart taps are not of ‘feminine’ domesticity,” Didion writes, “but of female power, of the woman who sits down at the table with the men and, still in her apron, walks away with the chips.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What <em>Martha</em> suggests is different from Didion’s idea. It offers us a Martha Stewart who is attractive not because she played and won, but because she played so hard each and every time,&nbsp;even when she lost.

Each removed piece makes the base more wobbly; each block put back on top makes it more unbalanced until it eventually topples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, I’d argue, is basically how we should be thinking about the stakes of the 2024 election for American democracy: an already-rickety tower of state would be at risk of falling in on itself entirely, with catastrophic results for those who live under its shelter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We live in an era where democracies <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/magazine/democracy-elections-game.html\">once considered “consolidated”</a> — meaning so secure that that they couldn’t collapse into authoritarianism —&nbsp;have started to buckle and even collapse. As recently as 2010, Hungary was considered one of the post-Communist world’s great democratic success stories; today, it is now understood to be the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump\">European Union’s only autocracy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hungarian democracy did not die of natural causes. It was murdered by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who seized control of nearly every aspect of state power and twisted it into tools. Not just the obvious things, like Hungary’s public broadcaster and judiciary, but other areas —&nbsp;like its tax administration and the offices regulating higher education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bit by bit, piece by piece, Orbán —&nbsp;whose support Trump regularly touts — subtly took a democracy and replaced it with something different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this, he was a trailblazer, creating a blueprint of going from democracy to autocracy that has been followed, to varying degrees of success, by leaders in countries as diverse as Brazil, India, Israel, and Poland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The central question of this election is whether voters will grant former President Donald Trump the power to resume his efforts to place the United States on this list.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A predictable crisis</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s statements and policy documents like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">Project 2025</a> amount to a systematic Orbánist program for turning the government into an extension of his personal will. Their most fundamental proposal, a revival of Trump’s never-implemented Schedule F order, would permit the firing of <a href=\"https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/what-mandate-for-leadership-says\">upward of 50,000 career civil servants</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the kind of thing that’s easy to dismiss as so much insider Washington drama, but the stakes are sky-high: Beyond hindering the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">basic functions of government</a> that millions of people depend on, politicizing the civil service is a critical step toward consolidating the power needed to build an autocracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democratic collapse nowadays isn’t a matter of abolishing elections and declaring oneself dictator, but rather stealthily hollowing out a democratic system so it’s harder and harder for the opposition to win. This strategy requires full control over the state and the bureaucracy: That means having the right staff in the right places who can use their power to erode democracy’s core functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and his team have plans to do just that. They have discussed everything from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">prosecuting local election administrators</a> to using regulatory authority for “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election\">retribution” against corporations that cross him</a> — all steps that would depend, crucially, on replacing nonpartisan civil servants who would resist such orders with loyalists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How far Washington would travel down the Budapest road is very hard to say. It would depend on a variety of factors that are difficult to foresee, ranging from the competence of Trump’s chosen appointees to the degree of resistance he faces from the judiciary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even if there’s a reasonable chance that the worst case might be avoided, the danger remains serious. With specific plans for autocratization already in place, and a recent grant of criminal immunity from the Supreme Court, there’s every reason to treat a second Trump term as an extinction-level threat to American democracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This assault on democracy didn’t come out of nowhere. My recent book on democracy, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94\"><em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>, argues that rising political antagonism in America is a perennial outgrowth of its defining conflict over race and national identity — with the current round of conflict sparked largely (albeit not entirely) by backlash to Barack Obama’s 2008 victory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sense among some Americans that they were losing their country to something new, defined by a more diverse population and a more equal social hierarchy, made the idea of a strongman who could roll back change quite appealing to a significant chunk of the American population. These voters had come to constitute a plurality, if not an outright majority, of Republican primary voters — creating the conditions for Trump to rise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2016, Trump seized on this reactionary discontent and married it to a whole-scale agenda of backlash against the current political order. His policies and political rhetoric — on everything from immigration to gender to trade to foreign policy — were calculated to deepen America’s divisions and mainstream ideas once consigned to the fringes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As potent as this politics proved, it’s likely Trump never really expected it to take him all the way to the White House. He had done very little transition work — nothing like Project 2025 existed. His team was scrambling from the second the contest was called in their favor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president himself was unfamiliar with how American democracy worked and largely uninterested in learning the details. So in his first term, he haphazardly yanked at its foundations — flagrantly assailing basic democratic norms of conduct and installing an incoherent policy process that made it very difficult to rely on any expectation of neutral, stable governance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The results? Rising tensions between citizens and declining faith in government institutions, in part because government had become legitimately less reliable. There were several near-miss crises — people forget how close we were to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/18/16733560/north-korea-war\">nuclear war with North Korea in 2017</a> — and then two very real ones: a <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr570631\">botched pandemic response</a> and a democracy-shaking riot at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When critics warn about Trump&#8217;s threat, the constant rejoinder is that democracy already survived four years of Trump in office. In fact, democracy did not emerge unscathed from Trump&#8217;s first term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, perhaps more importantly, there are many reasons to believe that a second Trump term would be far more dangerous than the first&nbsp;— starting with the degree of authoritarian preparation that’s already gone into it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A toddler grown into a saboteur</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the first Trump term was akin to the random destruction of a toddler, a second would be more like the deliberate demolition of a saboteur. With the benefit of four years of governing experience and four more years of planning, Trump and his team have concluded that the problem with their first game of Jenga was that they simply did not remove enough of democracy’s blocks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do not think that, over the course of four more years, Trump could use these plans to successfully build a fascist state that would jail critics and install himself in power indefinitely. This is in part because of the size and complexity of the American state, and in part because that’s not really the kind of authoritarianism that works in democracies nowadays.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But over the course of those years, he could yank out so many of American democracy’s basic building blocks that the system really could be pushed to the brink of collapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He could quite plausibly create a political environment that tilts electoral contests (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377729/kamala-harris-supreme-court-electoral-college-senate-constitution\">even more</a>) in the GOP’s favor —&nbsp;accelerating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/magazine/democracy-elections-game.html\">dangerous and destabilizing partisan conflict</a> over the very rules of the political game. He could compromise media outlets, especially <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-what-a-second-trump-term-could-mean-for-media-and-technology-policies/\">government</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/donald-trump-weaponizes-non-endorsements-from-the-washington-post-and-los-angeles-times-1.7092891\">billionaire-owned ones</a>. He could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">wreck the government’s ability to perform basic tasks</a>, ranging from managing pollution to safely storing nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The damage could be immediately catastrophic in ways we saw in the first term: political violence and mass death (from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23677654/trump-foreign-policy-revisionist-history-dove-anti-imperial\">war</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health\">crank-controlled public health system</a>, or any number of other things). But even if the very worst-case scenarios were avoided, the structural damage to the tower of American democracy could be long-lasting&nbsp;— undoing the complex and mutually supporting processes that work to keep democracy alive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When government reliably and neutrally delivers core services, people tend to have more faith in all of its functions — including running fair elections. When they have more faith in elections, they tend to trust them more as a means of resolving major policy disagreements. When they trust election outcomes, they tend to grant a baseline level of legitimacy to the government that follows, making it easier for it to reliably and neutrally deliver core services. The steady house of democracy is built by the gluing together of these functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">John Rawls, the greatest political philosopher of the 20th century, described this as a long process of trust-building that starts with a basic faith in democratic ideals. When people of all political stripes basically believe in the system, he argues, they start acting inside its rules — giving others more confidence that they too can follow the rules without being cheated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Gradually, as the success of political cooperation continues, citizens gain increasing trust and confidence in one another,” Rawls writes in his book <em>Political Liberalism</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A second Trump term risks replacing Rawls’s virtuous cycle with a vicious one. As Trump degrades government, following the Orbánist playbook with at least some success, much of the public would justifiably lose their already-battered faith in the American system of government. And whether it could long survive such a disaster is anyone’s guess.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Genser was unanimous, and mailed-in Pennsylvania ballots won’t be tossed out. | Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Friday evening, the Supreme Court ruled it would leave in place a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that made it marginally easier for certain voters in the state to cast a ballot. The Republican Party had asked the justices to block that decision; doing so would have likely <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">disenfranchised thousands of voters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that won’t happen. The Court’s decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a408_3f14.pdf\"><em>Republican National Committee v. Genser</em></a> was unanimous, although Justice Samuel Alito wrote a statement indicating that he and Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch are only ruling against the GOP on narrow procedural grounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem at the heart of the case was that Pennsylvania law is unusually strict regarding how mailed ballots must be returned by voters. They must be stuffed in two envelopes, and if the inner envelope is missing, the ballot is void. The state supreme court decision at issue in <em>Genser</em> ruled that voters who cast such a voided ballot can still vote if they show up on Election Day and cast a provisional ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The case was closely watched because the presidential race is <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/pennsylvania/\">expected to be tight</a>, and it is likely that the decision will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">impact several thousand voters</a>. Also, Democrats <a href=\"https://x.com/iapolls2022/status/1852210212880429503?s=61&amp;t=TQlk4x44ENcfSu3Y1ke6ew\">tend to vote by mail more often than Republicans</a>. So, if the presidential election is indeed very close and it all comes down to Pennsylvania — and if mail-in ballots do favor Democrats this year — a victory for the GOP in <em>Genser</em> could have flipped the result and put Donald Trump back in the White House.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A win for the GOP could have scrambled future elections, too. The GOP’s legal arguments relied on a radical theory known as the “independent state legislature doctrine,” which the Supreme Court has rejected many times, but which all but one of the Court’s Republican members have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">expressed sympathy toward in the past</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you want a full explainer on this doctrine, you can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">read my preview of the <em>Genser </em>case here</a>. But the important thing to know about it is that it takes power over elections away from state courts and places it in the hands of state legislatures, in a manner that could completely scramble how the US currently holds elections. A brief filed by an array of admirals, generals, and service secretaries warned that the doctrine “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/243970/20221026122043996_Ret.%20Admirals%20AmicusBrief%20-%20Moore%20v.%20Harper.pdf\">undermines election integrity and exacerbates both domestic and foreign threats to national security</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the Court was asked to play with some very dangerous magic in <em>Genser</em> and, to their credit, all nine justices refused this request.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The decision should also give a small degree of comfort to Democrats, who’ve had good reason to wonder if this Court — which has a 6-3 Republican majority — can be trusted to referee a close election after its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\"><em>Trump v. United States </em>immunity decision</a>, in which the justices declared Trump was allowed to commit many crimes as president.

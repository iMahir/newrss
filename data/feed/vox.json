If anything surprised me about the outcome, it’s not that Donald Trump won, but how he did it. The president-elect won all seven swing states and the popular vote, and seemed to gain ground with basically every demographic except college-educated women. That is a political reckoning for the Democratic Party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All we can definitively say at this point is that there are many reasons for this electoral defeat and we just don’t know enough right now to parse it out in a satisfying way. But that doesn’t mean that we have no idea what happened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What is fairly clear is that the roughly 76 million people who voted for Trump were saying “no” to something — or, to be more precise, they were saying “no” to lots of things. And I am genuinely interested in understanding what —&nbsp;apart from the Biden administration —&nbsp;so many people were rejecting, and what lessons we might be able to draw from that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So in the aftermath of the election, I invited Vox’s own Zack Beauchamp on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about what we know and what it could mean for our political future. Beauchamp writes a newsletter for Vox called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/on-the-right-newsletter\"><em>On the Right</em></a>, which is all about the evolving nature of conservatism and the various ideas and movements driving it. He’s also the author of a recent book called <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/\"><em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We discuss the competing accounts of this election, the differences between conservative and reactionary parties, as well as some of the broader trends in democratic societies across the world. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <em>The Gray Area</em> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset\">Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

One is our analysis of what&#8217;s happening, and the other is how we feel about what happened. Analytically, I think it’s still pretty early to have any really strong conclusions, but I will say that most of what people are saying as a result of that doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense to me. If you notice, there&#8217;s a one-to-one correlation between someone&#8217;s very detailed account of what happened in the election and their own priors about how politics works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You mentioned that Trump gained ground with basically every group, right? Well, that only happens, this kind of uniform swing, when there&#8217;s some big structural factor at play. The candidates that make sense to explain a shift from 2020 to 2024 are inflation, right? That&#8217;s new and has been politically potent everywhere, and historically, in the US it matters. And <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents\">anti-incumbent sentiment</a>, which is a worldwide fact and true in democracies around the world. But Harris’s biggest losses were in blue states, and that suggests that something is going on beyond messaging. Something else is happening.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let&#8217;s set aside the election for a minute, though we&#8217;re going to keep coming back to it. When someone asks you what is American conservatism in 2024, what is your answer?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not conservatism. What we call the conservative movement today is not what the conservative movement historically has been in the United States. It&#8217;s a species of reactionary politics. The distinction rests in the party&#8217;s fundamental attitude towards democracy and democratic institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The old Republican Party, for all of its faults, played by the political rules. It had faith in the idea that elections determine the winner, and that when elections happen, you accept the verdict of the people and you adjust based on that regardless of whether or not you like the policy preferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reactionary parties are different from conservatism. They both share an orientation towards believing that certain ways in which society is arranged — certain setups, institutions, even hierarchies — are good and necessary. There&#8217;s value in the way that things are. What differs between the two of them is that conservative parties don&#8217;t see potential social change as an indictment of democracy. That is to say, even if a democracy or an election produces an outcome that they don&#8217;t like, that threatens to transform wholesale certain elements of the social order, a conservative would not throw out the political order as a consequence of that. Reactionaries are willing to do that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My view is, at the core of the Trump movement, which I want to distinguish from every Trump supporter because they&#8217;re not the same, but the people who have given Donald Trump an iron grip on the Republican Party, that base of hardcore support, are animated primarily by reactionary politics, by a sense that things have gone too far in a socially liberal and culturally liberal, and even in some cases economically liberal direction, and they want things to go back to partially a past that never existed, but also a past that did exist where there was a little bit more order and structure in terms of who was in charge and what the rules were.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What Trumpism seems to be, increasingly, is a rejection of the ruling elites, a rejection of the professional managerial class, which is more about class and culture than race and the preservation of traditional hierarchies. So how do you make sense of that?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When we talk about what Trumpism is, we need to specify what we&#8217;re talking about. And I don&#8217;t think [that means] looking at a general election and saying that every person who voted for Trump is necessarily a Trumpist. If somebody was considering voting for Harris or maybe voted for Democrats down ballot, it might not make sense to think of their behavior through a purely ideological lens, because they may not even have firm ideological beliefs. Many swing voters, if you look at the way they talk about politics, it’s sort of jumbled. Again, I&#8217;m not saying that they are bad for having jumbled views, but this is just a fact about people who don&#8217;t pay attention to politics very much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you look at Trump&#8217;s core supporters though, the story of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384970/trump-2024-election-win-race-racism\">racial and social grievance</a>, anger about immigration, a sense of alienation from the United States after Obama really personalized the changing social order — all of that is remarkably consistent among the people who will turn out to vote for Trump in a Republican primary. It&#8217;s been true over and over again. The evidence is overwhelmingly strong. This is their core motivation in Trump politics and in being engaged in this movement. And nothing about this election result changes that. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What that part of the story does is help us understand why Trump has gained control over one of our two major political parties, why it is that he crushed traditional Republicans who were unwilling to give those voters what they wanted in such clear terms, and those voters had become a majority of the Republican Party internally. And more than that, it&#8217;s why the bulk of Republicans rejected the 2020 election when previously they had believed elections were legitimate. It&#8217;s why so many people were willing to swallow the idea that Obama wasn&#8217;t born in the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So that&#8217;s one category of explanation, but then we&#8217;re talking about shifts in coalitions between different elections, and here the analysis becomes a lot trickier because we&#8217;re not talking about what makes up the core of an ideological movement, because all of those voters are baked into voting for Trump no matter what. I mean, you have 46 or 47 percent of the electorate that’s not going to change their mind no matter what on both sides. Maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but not much. So you end up having these voters in the middle, and what causes someone to change their votes between elections is not the same thing as what engages really highly motivated, highly ideological voters who make up a political movement. They&#8217;re swing voters, right? They&#8217;re not Trumpists in the clear sense just because they voted for Trump once. So collapsing that distinction leads to analytic mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I continue to have a hard time parsing out all the forces that are combining to scramble our politics. There&#8217;s so much alienation. It&#8217;s a very lonely society. Our democracy doesn&#8217;t feel very participatory for lots of people, so there&#8217;s not enough investment in it. I think social media, media fragmentation more generally, the collapse of consensus reality — it&#8217;s all been very destabilizing. And I&#8217;m just going to keep saying that I think millions of people have never experienced real political disorder, so they take liberal democracy for granted and frankly don&#8217;t take politics very seriously. They’re entertained by Trump. They think he&#8217;s funny, and maybe he&#8217;ll make eggs a little cheaper and also drive annoying coastal elites insane and that&#8217;s kind of it for plenty of people.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of people. Especially that point about taking liberal democracy for granted. When you live in a political order for a long period of time, you start to take it as a baseline. This is the way that things are. It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t even envision fundamental change — it&#8217;s that you don&#8217;t even have the vocabulary necessary or the sense of perspective necessary to believe that you should be envisioning radical change. It just doesn&#8217;t enter into your daily life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you look at interviews with swing voters and the way that they talk about politics or when you talk to them yourselves, the sense that you get is not that these people are like, &#8220;I want to burn American democracy to the ground.&#8221; It&#8217;s that they&#8217;ve got a choice between two candidates, like they do every election, and they pick the one who represents whatever their grievances are at this moment in time or whatever their anger or frustration or even hopes and dreams are at this moment in time. Lots of different things go into for a voter that changes their mind election to election, what speaks to that. And the stuff about who Trump really is and what he really stands for, the system-threatening part of it, just doesn&#8217;t even register because it seems too remote to feel real.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t think Trump is really committed to anything. I have always felt that his political genius consists in making himself into an avatar onto which people can project whatever they need to project and he’s so well-equipped to be this kind of vehicle. I genuinely do not think he cares about anything other than himself. I mean, if the man had to choose between preserving liberal democracy for another century or building a beautiful new golf course in Saudi Arabia, is there any doubt he&#8217;d build the fucking golf course?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No, but I think that that&#8217;s a mistake. Because it&#8217;s not that he doesn&#8217;t have a commitment to democracy in the sense that he&#8217;s not attached to it. He doesn&#8217;t like it. He doesn&#8217;t like the idea that he can&#8217;t do whatever he wants when he gets power. He gets very angry when people say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; or, &#8220;That&#8217;s illegal.&#8221; And he openly admires leaders in other countries who have either always been authoritarians, like Xi Jinping in China, or who have torn down their own democracies like Putin [in Russia] or Viktor Orbán in Hungary. He thinks that they&#8217;re strong and that it&#8217;s great that they get to do stuff like that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not an ideological commitment to authoritarianism, either. It&#8217;s not like Trump has a sincere belief that authoritarian systems work better or deliver better in some kind of meaningful sense. It&#8217;s a gut level &#8220;I like that. I want to be like that.&#8221; It&#8217;s when he said in those comments that were recently reported, &#8220;I want generals like Hitler&#8217;s generals,&#8221; it&#8217;s not like he was saying, &#8220;I want generals who will follow my orders to exterminate the Jews.&#8221; He&#8217;s saying, &#8220;I want people who listen to me and do the things that I say, whatever those things are, however crazy they might seem.&#8221; In that sense, he has a gut-level authoritarianism, and it&#8217;s reactionary in the sense that he very clearly hates a lot of the social change that has happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think our institutions will continue to hold?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah. I mean, I don’t think there’s any reason to expect that elections will be formally abolished by 2028 in the way that some wild-eyed commentators in social media have suggested. I think there is a moderate chance that the fairness of our elections will be severely undermined by then. And I think there is a very high chance that some of the core institutions of American democracy will be damaged in ways that have significant long-term consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Put differently, I don&#8217;t think this election itself is the end of American democracy. I do think it is the beginning of the greatest test American democracy has seen since the Civil War of its resilience, and the outcome of that test is not determined and there is a range of probabilities, ranging from truly catastrophic to merely somewhat bad.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What makes this to you a more significant test than the first Trump administration?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s the degree to which they have clear and cogent plans about what they want to do, and the anti-democratic nature of those plans. Coming into office last time, Trump didn&#8217;t have a vendetta against large chunks of the government. He didn&#8217;t believe an election had been stolen from him and that needed to be rectified. At the very least, he thinks it is a public blemish that needs to be shown to be false to many people, because if many people believe that he won, then that&#8217;s good enough. It doesn&#8217;t matter if he actually did. What matters, to put it differently, is Donald Trump&#8217;s honor, and the honor of Donald Trump must be avenged at all costs, and the insult of 2020 must be erased from the history books. That&#8217;s the kind of thing that he cares about.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The degree and scope of the planning that has gone into this and the willingness to take a hammer to different institutions and the specificity of the plans for doing so is not normal. To name just one example from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">Project 2025</a>, they want to prosecute the former Pennsylvania secretary of state who presided over the 2020 elections using the [Ku Klux] Klan Act, which was passed to fight the first Klan. It&#8217;s basically alleging that by trying to help people fix improperly filed mail-in ballots in 2020, this Pennsylvania secretary of state was rigging the election, trying to undermine everyone else&#8217;s fair exercise of their votes in a way akin to the Klan intimidating Black voters in the 1860s by threatening to lynch them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I speak to legal experts about this, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No credible prosecutor I know would bring such a charge.&#8221; It&#8217;s a real abuse of power and anti-democratic in many ways because it&#8217;s trying to wield federal power to prevent local authorities from administering elections properly and helping people vote. So in order to try to even begin an investigation on this front, let alone actually prosecute, what you need to do is fire the people who would do that kind of job, which would typically be in the Justice Department Civil Rights Division role, so the Election Crimes Unit and the Criminal Division, fire those people who work on these cases, bring in attorneys who are willing to do what you say, even though it&#8217;s ludicrous on the basis of a traditional read of the law, and then initiate an investigation, try to get charges spun up, and then get them to a judge like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360735/trump-classified-documents-case-cannon-dismissed-indictment\">Aileen Cannon</a>, who&#8217;s presiding over Trump&#8217;s documents case and has clearly shown herself to not really care about what&#8217;s going on, but rather just to interpret the law in whatever way is most favorable to Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that stuff, and this is just one specific example, illustrates the ways in which doing what Trump and his allies have outlined as part of their revenge campaign requires attacking very fundamental components of American democracy: the building blocks, like the rule of law, like a nonpartisan civil service that treats all citizens equally, like a judiciary that&#8217;s designed with interpreting the law as best as it can, rather than delivering policy outlines, you need all of those things in order to act on already offered promises in what is widely understood to be the planning document for the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As hard as it is to believe, there’s a shelf life to Trump’s political career and there are people who think our situation will be drastically better the day he leaves. I’m not so sure about that. Are you?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, I agree with you in brief, but to build on what you&#8217;re saying, let&#8217;s say Trump dies in office. Then you get President JD Vance, who shares some very similar ideological commitments to the people who want to tear down American democracy. So there&#8217;s that. There&#8217;s the fact that Trumpist politics have paid off in two presidential elections for Republicans, and I just can&#8217;t imagine being a Republican strategist right now and saying what we need to do is go back to 2012. Because even if all you care about is narrowly winning elections, then you&#8217;re going to try to be Trump rather than the pre-Trump GOP. There will be a lot of people trying to take up the mantle of Trump&#8217;s successor in the Republican Party, and that means doing a lot of the same things that he did.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But can they do that effectively? Can anyone else do what Trump has done?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zack Beauchamp</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m very skeptical of that. If you look comparatively at authoritarian parties that work inside democracies, many of them are led by singular charismatic figures. Not all, but many of the successful ones. There&#8217;s this saying in Indian politics that Narendra Modi is the man who has a 56-inch chest. And it&#8217;s not literally true, but it&#8217;s one of many things that isn&#8217;t about him that his supporters say when you talk to them. This sort of mythologizing and grandiose comments stem from Modi&#8217;s outsized personality and his ability to connect as a figure with supporters of his party and with a lot of ordinary Indians who might not have supported his party in the past. And I think Trump is much the same way. And that appeal, first of all, is not fixed. Modi, while he won reelection this year, his party took a major hit. They lost their parliamentary majority, and of course Trump lost in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But second is, what happens when he’s gone? We know that this is a huge problem for authoritarian parties in authoritarian countries. They&#8217;re often nasty fights over what happens after the big man dies. That seems equally true in authoritarian factions inside democracies, because part of what makes them authoritarian is that they put one guy in charge, and it&#8217;s not clear who&#8217;s next unless you have something like a monarchy where the rules of succession are clear. But even then, who doesn&#8217;t know about nasty fights inside monarchies over who is the true heir to the throne? It&#8217;s just a fact of life when you&#8217;re not having things settled through a normal democratic procedure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So I just don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen after Trump is gone. I can guess, and I think a lot will depend on how his administration manages American public opinion. Not only did Trump end his presidency historically unpopular, but even now, he&#8217;s unpopular. There&#8217;s a lot of people who really don&#8217;t like him, and many of the swing voters could be turned off by things that happened during his presidency, especially if it&#8217;s as disruptive as it seems like it might be to ordinary people&#8217;s lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/americas-reactionary-moment/id1081584611?i=1000677309825\"><em>Listen to the rest of the conversation</em></a><em> and be sure to follow </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a><em> on </em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793\"><em>Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Federal agencies would be directed to deny passports, Social Security numbers, and public benefits to children with two undocumented parents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The executive order would almost certainly be challenged in court. Though it’s impossible to say what the Supreme Court may ultimately decide, history and precedent isn’t on Trump’s side. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think that birthright citizenship is such a bedrock principle of American law that of all the things on the Trump agenda, this is the one least likely to be successful,” said Hiroshi Motomura, a professor at UCLA School of Law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1663537082633953282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1663537082633953282%7Ctwgr%5E46e931ec2a8922d37b9d8ab8db1d1756825905ae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F2024-election%2Flitigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314\">has framed the policy as a solution</a> to “birth tourism” — when pregnant people travel to the US to give birth in order to secure US citizenship for their child — and a means of removing a pull factor for unauthorized immigration, which has <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/01/migrant-encounters-at-u-s-mexico-border-have-fallen-sharply-in-2024/\">sharply declined</a> at the southern border in 2024. The policy also reflects Trump’s longtime efforts to assert a particular vision of what it means to be American in an era when the US’s <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-census-data-shows-the-nation-is-diversifying-even-faster-than-predicted/\">white population is declining in numbers</a>. In his first term, he reportedly eschewed immigration from “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-referred-haiti-african-countries-shithole-nations-n836946\">shithole countries</a>,” referring to Haiti and African countries. And he has more recently claimed that immigrants are “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-immigrants-are-poisoning-blood-country-biden-campaign-liken-rcna130141\">poisoning the blood</a>” of the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear how many people could be impacted by the policy. However, about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation\">5.5 million American citizen children</a> currently live in mixed-status households, some of them with two undocumented parents, which would have made them ineligible for automatic US citizenship under Trump’s proposed policy. That suggests that the affected population of future children born in the US could be large.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What the law says</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prevailing belief among legal experts is that ending birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment, that there is not enough support in Congress to pass one, and that Trump’s proposed executive order would not hold up in court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“President Trump cannot do this,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean at Berkeley Law school. “President Trump cannot change the Constitution by executive order.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He said that ending birthright citizenship by executive order contravenes the 14th Amendment, which was adopted after the Civil War to ensure that formerly enslaved people would be considered US citizens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 14th Amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chemerinsky said that this has “always been understood to mean that all born in the United States (or naturalized as citizens) are United States citizens,” in addition to any individuals under US jurisdiction abroad, such as children born to US military personnel in foreign countries. The phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” was intended to exclude only Native Americans born on tribal land as well as children of enemy occupiers and foreign diplomats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in <em>United States v. Wong Kim Ark</em> “makes clear that those born in the United States are citizens,” Chemerinsky added. That case concerned a child born in California to Chinese immigrants who were lawful permanent residents of the US. At the time, no Chinese citizens were allowed to become naturalized US citizens under the Chinese Exclusion Acts. The court ruled that the child was a US citizen because he was born in the US, even though his parents were noncitizens. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Can Trump ban birthright citizenship anyway?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right-wing immigration hawks have argued that the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” clause ought to be interpreted differently to exclude children of unauthorized immigrants from the benefits of automatic citizenship. The clause, they argue, was meant to exclude anyone who had any loyalties to a foreign power, including citizens of other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even some of Trump’s allies — including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/litigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314\">Mark Krikorian</a>, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigrant think tank — appear to acknowledge that he would face an uphill battle in court to realize his plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think it would be immediately challenged in the courts, and I think that the challenge would have all of the history and the origins of the statute behind it,” Motomura said. “I can&#8217;t predict what any court will actually do, but I think the historical record is so clear.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, if Trump succeeds in enacting his executive order, its impact would be far-reaching. Birthright citizenship has served as an “engine of integration” for immigrant populations in the US, and ending it would also undermine America’s cultural identity as an “inclusive immigrant society,” Motomura said, adding that it would hit people of Mexican and Central American origin the hardest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That aspect can&#8217;t be ignored,” Motomura said. “It&#8217;s the resurrection of the use of US citizenship rules with a real racial impact, and I think an intentional racial impact.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As a kid, her father attempted to buy her presents, but he so often missed the mark that he transitioned to giving her money by the time she was a teen, Zhang, 30, says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the start of their relationship, her husband wasn’t much better. A few of his greatest gift misses included a massage gun and a food scale. They couldn’t return the massage gun, Zhang says, so she kept it. As for the scale, the couple took it back and shopped for a replacement together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite his gifting shortcomings, Zhang’s husband refuses to give money as a gift, she says. As a compromise, she maintains a comprehensive wish list from which he can select items that are sure to please.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Zhang grew up in China, where giving monetary gifts during holidays and special events <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-institutional-economics/article/abs/money-or-inkind-gift-evidence-from-red-packets-in-china/935592457DFC22EFA20C4AF1F7E489DA\">is customary</a>. “During Father&#8217;s Day, I probably will give my dad money,” says Zhang, who is now based outside of Seattle. “With money, it&#8217;s guaranteed that you can use it. Probably you want it, you can spend it, or you can save it.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Who wants to put a dollar amount on a priceless relationship?&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the fact that giving cash as a present is not only normative but preferred in other countries like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/business/asian-weddings-cash-gifts.html\">Korea and Japan</a>, in the US and other Western cultures, the exchange is <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1093/ei/40.3.415\">sometimes seen as gauche</a>. Cash is easy, quick, and, most of all, practical since almost everyone could use a little more of it. But for those same reasons, money can be seen as thoughtless, or worse, an implication the gift recipient really, really needs it — more than the candle warmer or the novelty socks you picked out in a panic on Christmas Eve. After all, who wants to put a dollar amount on a priceless relationship?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if you were to ask recipients what they actually want for the holidays, the answer is clear: Cash is king. A <a href=\"https://business.yougov.com/content/48219-global-show-me-the-money-people-would-be-most-excited-to-be-gifted-cash-this-holiday-season\">December 2023 YouGov survey</a> found 38 percent of global respondents said they’d prefer to get cash for the holidays — the largest share of potential presents. Another 10 percent said they wanted gift cards. The MassMutual Consumer Spending &amp; Saving Index from 2022 found similar results: <a href=\"https://www.massmutual.com/global/media/shared/doc/Q4_2022_consumer_survey\">31 percent of Americans said their ideal gift was cash</a>; 16 percent said their dream present was a gift card.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The chasm between what people really want — money — and what givers feel comfortable gifting — pretty much anything else — has led gift-givers to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/upshot/an-economist-goes-christmas-shopping.html\">waste millions of dollars</a> on <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/104699/original/christmas.pdf\">unwanted or lackluster presents</a>. But you shouldn’t feel weird bestowing cash to your nearest and dearest, experts say. There are tactful ways to do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Americans have never liked giving cash gifts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans have long been leery of giving money to their loved ones for the holidays. In the 1993 book<em> </em><a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9780814792841/the-modern-christmas-in-america/\"><em>The Modern Christmas in America: A Cultural History of Gift Giving</em></a><em>, </em>William Waits writes that even though some magazines offered advice on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/07zelizer.html\">how to thoughtfully give money</a> in the early 20th century, the public found the practice “impersonal” and cold. “As a gift item,” Waits wrote, “[money] ascribed a certain numerical value to relationships but did not define the quality of the relationships.” Gift certificates posed the same problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/23/opinion/christmas-past-and-presents.html\">During that time,</a> rural Americans gifted their friends and family food and small handmade wooden or sewn presents. Those in cities swapped figurines, wall hangings, and other crafts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the 20th century, however, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/29/1059861668/why-americans-buy-so-much-stuff\">consumption and consumerism took root in the American psyche</a>. Businesses and department stores began to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-advertising-through-the-ages-has-shaped-christmas-129147\">heavily advertise their products during the holiday season</a>, encouraging shoppers to find the <a href=\"https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/06/00/82/00001/mleone-Melissa_Leone_Thesis.pdf\">perfect present behind their doors</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These days, the holiday shopping season seems to creep earlier and earlier with the goal of getting consumers to spend more and more, often on <a href=\"https://www.finder.com/banking/unwanted-gifts\">tangible, unwanted items</a> — a good portion of which <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/consumer/articles/17378-unwanted-holiday-gifts\">end up in the trash</a>. Nearly half of holiday shoppers begin their purchasing <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/news/early-holiday-shopping/#how-to-save-money-during-the-holidays-without-feeling-like-scrooge\">as early as August</a>, per a Bankrate survey. This year, Americans each plan to spend over <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/holiday-tips-news/2024-holiday-spending-report\">$900 on holiday gifts</a>, up from about <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/2023-holiday-shopping-report\">$800 last year</a>, according to NerdWallet’s annual holiday spending report.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-166422697.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A hand wearing a white glove and a Santa-Claus-style red sleeve with a white fluffy cuff holds out a fan of $100 bills. \" title=\"A hand wearing a white glove and a Santa-Claus-style red sleeve with a white fluffy cuff holds out a fan of $100 bills. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why giving cash is so uncomfortable</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Americans might be <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/average-cost-of-an-american-christmas.aspx\">spending more on holiday gifts</a>, or at least urged to, they aren’t necessarily choosing presents that are sure to delight the recipient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When shopping, givers often choose an item that says more about themselves than it does the recipient, says <a href=\"https://directory.sju.edu/ernest-baskin\">Ernest Baskin</a>, an associate professor of food, pharma, and health care at Saint Joseph’s University. Givers are <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2016/december/gift-study.html\">preoccupied with the “wow” factor</a>, research shows, a present that says, “Look how well I know you to have selected this thoughtful, meaningful item.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Most of the time, we&#8217;re not right about this, to be honest,” Baskin says. “Most of the time, [recipients] can tell you very well what their desire is, or they&#8217;d rather you just give them money so they can pick what their desire is.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cash is practical — almost too practical —&nbsp;and givers tend to <a href=\"https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dbf9a-SJDM2015Submission_ER_EFW.pdf\">underestimate how much recipients appreciate useful</a>, ordinary presents, research suggests. Indeed, handing someone a card with a check inside is less exciting than watching their face light up at the sight of a puppy in a box. However, after the initial excitement fades, the pragmatic, boring gift gets the most use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cash is also seen as thoughtless and low-effort, says <a href=\"https://juliangivi.wixsite.com/juliangivi\">Julian Givi</a>, associate professor of marketing at West Virginia University. Writing a check or hitting the ATM requires very little creative energy. “It&#8217;s really in no way personalized to you,” Givi says. “[Giving] 100 bucks to someone shows nothing about your knowledge of their hobbies, their interests, their passions, and so on.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Handing someone a card with a check inside is less exciting than watching their face light up at the sight of a puppy in a box.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The relationship between the giver and the receiver is also paramount in cash-giving scenarios. A grandparent tucking a $5 bill into a card for a kid is kosher, “but going up the age ladder is a little awkward,” Givi says. Think about it: How would grandma feel if you gave her $25 in cash?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cash gifts between friends is also tricky, says Lizzie Post, etiquette expert and co-president at the <a href=\"https://emilypost.com/\">Emily Post Institute</a>. That same $5 your aunt gives you every year is odd coming from a friend. There’s the implication that the receiver is in dire straits and perhaps needs the cash more than, say, a cashmere sweater. “We don&#8217;t often just hand our friends money,” Post says. “Instead, we go do something enriching with them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if the recipient explicitly requests cash, Americans still find it taboo to comply. Instead, givers have found ways to creatively disguise the act of bestowing money, especially through registries. To make the exchange more thoughtful, wedding or baby shower guests will often contribute to a honeymoon or diaper fund. Platforms like <a href=\"https://www.honeyfund.com/\">Honeyfund</a> and <a href=\"https://www.babylist.com/gp/babylist-diaper-fund/16619/338538\">Babylist</a> have facilitated these touchless cash gifts, eliminating the potential awkwardness of handing over a supposedly inconsiderate present.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“At the end of the day, that&#8217;s still just cash that you&#8217;re giving,” Baskin says, “but now you can say that I&#8217;m actually giving something that the couple needs.” Gift cards, too, are simply cash by another name, only restricted to specific stores.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Giving cash doesn’t have to be awkward</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite popular convention that cash presents are gauche, tacky, or uninspired, Post says the annals of etiquette wisdom permit monetary gifts. (Though she does find the practice of Venmoing money as a wedding gift a little crass.) The key is to make it thoughtful. Definitely include a card, Post says, and write a short note about how you hope they spend the dough: “Use this to buy those Taylor Swift concert tickets” or “Treat yourself to a massage.” As for the amount, consider your relationship with the recipient, but only give what is within your budget, Post says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Remember how awkward it would be to give grandma $25? Giving her a gift card to a grocery store is likely to go over better, Givi says, even if the dollar amount is the same. “You&#8217;re putting in some thoughtfulness to select something related to her and who she is,” Givi says. “Then also, you had to go out and buy this thing.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Definitely include a card, Post says, and write a short note about how you hope they spend the dough.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you feel so inclined as to ask for cash, offer the givers a few other options, Post says: “Someone asks you, ‘What do you want for Hanukkah?’ You could absolutely say to them, ‘I’m into these books. I&#8217;m into this sport. Anything to do with them is great. And of course, I&#8217;m always a fan of cash. Whatever is easiest for you to do.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Should you still lack gifting inspiration, ask yourself what gift you’d like to receive, Baskin, the Saint Joseph’s researcher, says. Is it embroidered socks or is it cold hard cash?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Baskin poses that same question to study participants, “the answer [that] often comes up,” he says, is “money.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

A <a href=\"https://civicscience.com/expected-holiday-gift-returns-up-47-this-year-led-by-gen-z/\">survey</a> from consumer research firm CivicScience showed that 28 percent of people had returned or exchanged a gift last year. According to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246622/christmas-gifts-desired-by-us-consumers/\">Statista</a>, the most wanted Christmas gift among US consumers is cold hard cash. The second most popular? Gift cards. The message seems to be: Thanks for the thought, but let me just choose what I want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over a single year, let alone an entire lifetime, you might amass a pile of stuff you won’t ever use, taking up valuable space in your home. Do you harden your heart and simply give all of it away? Do you attempt to return every unwanted item as soon as you receive it? What about the things that don’t spark joy, per se, but do have some sentimental value?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Standard etiquette advises us to remain gracious even in the face of laughably bad gifts, but research in the social psychology of gift-giving suggests we might be granting bad gift-givers too much benefit of the doubt. Sometimes, an ill-fitting gift is ill-fitting on purpose; it’s not mere miscommunication, but negative, even resentful communication. At the heart of solving this perennial problem is taking a good hard look at what motivates us to confer gifts unto others in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How to politely deal with well-meaning – but unwanted – gifts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The question of what to do with gifts you won’t use is a popular etiquette question “in a world of more and more consumer goods,” according to Daniel Post Senning, an etiquette expert at The Emily Post Institute. Generally, “gifts should be received in the same spirit of generosity that they’re given in,” says Senning. “If you don’t particularly appreciate the gift itself, the expectation is that you thank [them] for the effort or thought that went into it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With that in mind, Senning says that it’s not an etiquette cardinal sin to regift something if you know you can’t use it – for example, if you already happen to have the item. But you should avoid regifting anything handmade or personalized. “Beyond that, it’s about being upfront, ethical, honest” with the original gifter, if they ask, and the new recipient, Senning tells Vox. After all, a gift should be freely given with no obligations, and that includes the recipient having some choice in what they decide to do with the gift. (This is also a reminder to include a gift receipt whenever possible.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“One of my core beliefs is that everything comes into your life for a reason but that doesn’t mean you need to keep it forever.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even after the etiquette issue is resolved, it can be tricky figuring out which gifts you’ll no longer keep. “It’s usually easier to begin with items that have less sentimental value,” Juliet Landau-Pope, a productivity coach who has written about decluttering your home of <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/shopping-expert-handle-unwanted-christmas-gifts-1767643\">unwanted gifts</a>, tells Vox in an email. Larger items that take up a lot of space might be prime candidates for the initial decluttering, whether they’re going to be regifted or donated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s someone in your life who would appreciate a regift, you should <a href=\"https://emilypost.com/advice/the-etiquette-of-regifting\">ideally let them know</a> that you were given something you can’t use for insert-reason-here but would love to give them. Clothes — a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246589/holiday-gifts-to-be-bought-by-consumers-by-item/\">common</a> but often <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2005/12/why-clothes-make-a-terrible-gift.html\">miscalculated</a> gift — jewelry, and household goods can all go to a Goodwill location or a local family shelter. Furniture, appliances, and other household items can also be donated to <a href=\"https://www.habitat.org/restores/donate-goods\">Habitat for Humanity’s ReStore</a> program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One of my core beliefs is that everything comes into your life for a reason but that doesn’t mean you need to keep it forever,” Landau-Pope says. Take the example of greeting and holiday cards, which may be piling up in your drawer or taking over your fridge. Landau-Pope’s personal policy is to keep handmade cards from her children, while displaying the others for a set period of time, taking a picture of the display, and then recycling them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why so many of us get bad gifts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the ideal gift exchange scenario, we probably want to grace the people in our lives with gifts that will be met with undeniable enthusiasm. So why is it that we so often end up saddled with bad ones?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It might be an expectations mismatch: As Julian Givi, a marketing professor at West Virginia University, explains, “Whenever we’re gift-givers, we really focus on making people happy the moment that they’re opening the gift.” In order words, we prioritize the drama of a big reveal, as opposed to whether the gift is useful and valuable years down the road.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there are all the other unintentional ways we might give a bad gift. We might overestimate how passionate someone is about a hobby, sports team, or something else they once mentioned offhand. We might miss the mark simply because we don’t know enough about the other person; we wouldn’t guess in a million years that they have a bad childhood association with receiving hand-knit sweaters, for example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>We prioritize the drama of a big reveal, as opposed to whether the gift is useful and valuable years down the road.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, research shows that there are more sinister motives for giving subpar gifts than we’d like to think. For one, some people know exactly what a recipient wants — maybe they have a gift registry — but they buy something else anyway because the options presented are boring to them personally, says Givi. Another selfish motivation his <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3379405\">research</a> has discovered: people resist choosing gifts (like, say, a nice pair of sunglasses) that are better than the versions they own, likely to avoid feeling envious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Deborah Cohn, a marketing professor at the New York Institute of Technology, has identified <a href=\"https://jcsdcb.com/index.php/JCSDCB/article/view/225\">five broad patterns</a> for how lousy gifts happen. On the more innocuous side is due to ritual and obligation. “You’re going to be at a party, you have to bring somebody something,” Cohn tells Vox. But you don’t know enough about them or just don’t want to expend the mental effort of figuring out what they’d really want, so you grab something perfunctory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A more aggressive (but all too common) type of bad gift-giving is when the gift is intended to impose a certain identity on the recipient. We’ve all heard stories about parents who only give dolls and dresses to their daughters, and Legos and video games to their sons. It’s not that these givers don’t understand what their individual children’s real preferences are. It’s that they want to foist their own desire upon the recipient.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This actually happened to me,” says Cohn. “Somebody gave me a book about a religion that I don’t ascribe to.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other typical bad gift-giving habits stem from pure self-centeredness, like picking out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuk08z/aita_for_not_appreciating_a_gift_from_my_husband/\">headphones for your spouse</a> that you intend to use or wanting bragging rights for presenting the splashiest (read: most expensive) gift at the party. These kinds of gift-giving behaviors aren’t mistakes, and they aren’t innocent, Cohn contends. “It’s selfish,” she says. “It’s thinking more about yourself than the recipient, and people can see right through it.” Right now, Cohn is working on further research on whether there’s a correlation between habitually bad gift-giving and narcissism.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How to be a better gift-giver</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Individual tastes in gifts can vary greatly, but there are some broad strokes of what people tend to appreciate. According to Givi, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317986307_Sentimental_Value_and_Gift_Giving_Givers'_Fears_of_Getting_It_Wrong_Prevents_Them_from_Getting_It_Right\">sentimental gifts</a> — for example, something handmade or connected to a memory that the two of you share — are often underrated by gift-givers. Another finding in Givi’s research was that people tend to appreciate gifts that are given “out of the blue, as opposed to gifts that we receive on our birthday or any other special occasion.” The fact that it’s not being presented out of any social obligation may emphasize that the thought behind a gift really does count.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Being a good gift-giver also involves imagining ourselves in another’s shoes. It takes conscious effort. You genuinely need to ask yourself what this particular person would want, not what you or some other abstract of a person would want in the same situation. It probably doesn’t help, then, that there’s still some social awkwardness around being explicit about what you want to be gifted and what you’d hate to receive. Maybe to some people, maintaining a regularly updated gift registry is gauche, but if you’re concerned about your pile of unused gifts gathering dust in the closet, taking the surprise out of gift-giving does seem like the preferable option. (According to Senning, it’s perfectly all right for gifters to ask for some direction on what gifts someone would like.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cohn recalls the memory of a bad gift she got in childhood: a prank played on her by her father in which every gift box just contained a smaller one, with nothing inside the last. It motivated her to study what gifts mean and how people communicate through them. She told her mother how the prank had made her feel; when Cohn finished her dissertation, her mother&nbsp;gave her another set of nested boxes, this time full of chocolates. “I think that was the best gift I ever got because she wanted to take away my pain. That’s what that gift was meant to do,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

There’s a lot of need out there, and it matters not just whether we give, but how. Effective giving can translate into more lives saved and more lives improved. Even among charities that target the poorest people in developing countries —&nbsp;where charities can typically be most impactful because a dollar goes much further — the most effective charities produce a whopping 100 times more benefit than average charities,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-63320-004\">according to expert estimates</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So this holiday season, we thought it might be helpful to update our annual guide to giving. Think of this as not only a rundown of charity recommendations, but also a broader guide to thinking about how to give. Here are a few simple tips for end-of-year giving that can help.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) Check in with charity recommenders</h2>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s of course possible to research charity options yourself, but you can save some time by outsourcing that labor to a careful, methodologically rigorous charity recommender like <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell</a>. <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/\">Charity Navigator</a> has started following in GiveWell’s footsteps by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/10/16/21515488/charity-navigator-impact-matters-nonprofit\">evaluating charities based on their ability to do the most good</a> at the lowest cost; GiveWell has a longer track record, but <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=8221\">Charity Navigator’s impact scores</a> are worth consulting, too.</p>\n\n<p>GiveWell, which functions somewhat like a grantmaker, currently lists <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">four top charities</a>. Its recommendation, if you find it hard to choose among the four, is to donate to the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/maximum-impact-fund\">Top Charities Fund</a>, which goes directly to those top charities based on GiveWell’s assessment of where the money is most helpful given the different groups’ funding needs.</p>\n\n<p>The top charities are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\">Malaria Consortium</a>, which helps distribute preventive antimalarial medication to children (a program known as “seasonal malaria chemoprevention”)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, which buys and distributes insecticidal bed nets, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa but also in Papua New Guinea</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international\">Helen Keller Intl</a>, which provides technical assistance to, advocates for, and funds vitamin A supplementation programs in sub-Saharan Africa, which reduce child mortality</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives\">New Incentives</a>, which increases uptake of routine immunizations by offering small cash incentives to families in Nigeria when they get their children vaccinated<strong>  </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">GiveWell chose those charities based on how much good each additional donation would do, not necessarily how good the groups are overall; in other words, these are organizations that can put new funding to use, rather than sitting on it. Other charities do great work, too, but if they’re already decently funded, they might not do the most good with your extra dollar.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Vox guide to giving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving — from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving\">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h1>\n\n<p>GiveWell also supports novel interventions, but through its <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants\">All Grants Fund</a>, not its Top Charities Fund. That can mean giving an organization a grant to run a study in order to find out whether a hypothetical future program is feasible, like a <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/one-acre-fund-tree-rct-january-2023\">January 2023 grant</a> to a group in Rwanda to run a randomized evaluation of its program training farmers to grow trees for timber. It can also mean <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/PATH-malaria-vaccines-January-2022\">funding time-sensitive programs</a>, like the rollout of a new malaria vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of 2021,<strong> </strong>GiveWell found itself in the position of having more funding available than extremely cost-effective opportunities to spend it on. So it made the (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22822406/give-well-give-directly-philanthropy\">somewhat controversial</a>) announcement that it would <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2021/11/22/we-aim-to-cost-effectively-direct-around-1-billion-annually-by-2025/\">roll $110 million in funds into 2022</a>, instead of distributing those funds to charities right away, in hopes of finding more high-impact opportunities later.</p>\n\n<p>The gambit paid off: Whereas in 2021<strong> </strong>GiveWell had found $450 million worth of cost-effective opportunities, it was more like $900 million in 2022 — meaning the size of the pool roughly doubled. Instead of having too much money and too few great causes to spend it on, GiveWell had too many great causes and too little funding to support them all. Specifically, it found<strong> </strong>itself around $300 million short.</p>\n\n<p>“﻿There’s this gap, and so we want to raise more, because there’s impact just being left on the table,”&nbsp;Elie Hassenfeld, GiveWell’s CEO, previously<strong> </strong>told Vox.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050277/Malaria_Consortium_Sophie_Garcia_Copyright.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A health worker looks on as a mother spoon-feeds the baby on her lap.\" title=\"A health worker looks on as a mother spoon-feeds the baby on her lap.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Caregivers are counseled by community health workers in Burkina Faso on how to administer further antimalarial doses at home. | Sophie Garcia/Malaria Consortium\" data-portal-copyright=\"Sophie Garcia/Malaria Consortium\" />\n<p>It’s worth noting that GiveWell takes disconfirming research seriously. In 2017, it recommended <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/no-lean-season\">Evidence Action’s No Lean Season</a>, which offered no-interest loans to farmers in Bangladesh during the “<a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/politics/how-stipends-bus-tickets-can-help-rural-families-overcome-the-hungry-season-1200478\">lean season</a>” between planting rice and harvesting it; the loans are conditional on a family member temporarily moving to a city or other area for short-term work. But a subsequent randomized evaluation found that the program <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2018/11/19/update-on-no-lean-seasons-top-charity-status/#Findings\">didn’t actually spur people to migrate or increase their incomes</a>, and GiveWell and Evidence Action then agreed that it should no longer be a top charity. Evidence Action stopped soliciting funds for it and later <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/7/18654620/evidence-action-no-lean-season-givewell\">shut it down</a> — an unusually scrupulous move for a charity.</p>\n\n<p>(Disclosure: Dylan has been donating to GiveWell since 2010. Because he writes about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/philanthropy\" data-source=\"encore\">philanthropy</a> frequently, outsourcing his giving to GiveWell prevents him from donating directly to specific top charities that he may cover in the future, not unlike investing in index funds to avoid conflicts of interest when writing about particular companies. GiveWell is also an advertiser on Vox podcasts.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) Pick charities with research-based strategies</h2>\n\n<p>GiveWell&#8217;s recommendations rely heavily on both evaluations done by charitable organizations and existing research literature on the kind of intervention the charities are trying to conduct.</p>\n\n<p>For example, research from the Poverty Action Lab at MIT suggests that <a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/scale-ups/free-insecticidal-bednets\">giving away insecticidal bed nets </a>— as the Against Malaria Foundation does — is vastly more effective than charging even small amounts for them.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/\">hundreds of studies</a> have found largely <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/26/the-case-for-cash-2/\">positive effects for the kind of cash transfers</a> that GiveDirectly, one of GiveWell’s grantees, distributes (even if cash <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/10/17827836/cash-basic-income-uganda-study-blattman-charity\">has its limits</a>).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) If you want to maximize your donation’s impact, give to poorer countries</h2>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really hard to adequately express how much richer developed nations like the US are than developing ones like Kenya, Uganda, and other countries targeted by GiveWell&#8217;s most effective charities.</p>\n\n<p>The US <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/5/18650492/2019-poverty-2-dollar-a-day-edin-shaefer-meyer\">still has extreme poverty</a>, in the living-on-$2-a-day sense, but it&#8217;s comparatively pretty rare and hard to target effectively. The poorest Americans also have access to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health-care\" data-source=\"encore\">health care</a> and education systems that, while obviously inferior compared to those enjoyed by rich Americans, are still superior to those of developing countries.</p>\n\n<p>Giving to charities domestically is a commendable thing to do,<strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/26/opinion/charity-holiday-gift-reproductive-rights.html\">many people feel</a> it’s right to give first to the communities they live in. But if you want to get the most bang for your buck in terms of saving lives, reducing illness, or improving overall well-being, you&#8217;re going to want to give to the places with the greatest need and where your additional dollar will do the most good. That means outside the US.</p>\n\n<p>Years ago, GiveWell actually looked into a number of US charities, like the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/nfp\">Nurse-Family Partnership</a> program for infants, the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/kipp\">KIPP chain of charter schools</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/HOPE-Program\">HOPE job-training program</a>. It found that all were highly effective, but were also<strong> </strong>far more cost-intensive than the best foreign charities. KIPP and the Nurse-Family Partnership cost <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">more than $10,000 per child served</a>, while a vaccination program like New Incentives in Nigeria costs <a href=\"https://www.newincentives.org/financials\">around $17 per child served</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has also <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/maintain-essential-services-malaria.html#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20COVID%2D19,related%20supplies%20have%20also%20increased.\">taxed health systems in low-income countries</a>, putting pressure on programs designed to fend off other diseases like malaria. Donations to anti-malaria, (non-Covid) vaccination, and vitamin A supplementation programs like the ones recommended by GiveWell can help cushion that blow.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4) If you do give locally, you can still consider impact</h2>\n\n<p>Although this guide is mostly meant to offer suggestions if you don’t have existing philanthropic interests and are curious for the most efficient ways to help, many people already do have specific causes: They want to give to their own communities, or to causes they’re passionate about for personal reasons (like curing a disease that killed a loved one, for instance). And they often want to use charity as a way to connect with broader trends in the news —&nbsp;by, say, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/19/22979793/ukraine-refugee-crisis-how-to-help\">donating to help refugees coming from Ukraine, Sudan, Gaza, and elsewhere</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is, of course, admirable to give to your own community and personal causes, and<strong> </strong>a lot has happened in recent years<strong> </strong>to make it easier to find effective ways to give domestically. The group Charity Navigator <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/10/16/21515488/charity-navigator-impact-matters-nonprofit\">acquired a nonprofit</a> called ImpactMatters in 2020<strong> </strong>and began incorporating its <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=8221\">estimates of the bang for the buck provided by charities</a> in several different sectors.</p>\n\n<p>So you can specify that your goal is, say, to provide a night of shelter for a person experiencing homelessness, and Charity Navigator will provide you with a menu of nonprofits and their cost per night of housing. The Nazareth Housing shelter in New York City, for instance, is estimated to provide nightly shelter at less than 200 percent of fair market rent, which is Charity Navigator’s benchmark for reasonable spending on shelter. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5) Saving lives isn&#8217;t everything</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041370/RS21098_P1200734_edited.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A child tilts their head back and opens their mouth so an adult hand can drop in a pill.\" title=\"A child tilts their head back and opens their mouth so an adult hand can drop in a pill.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A child in Côte d’Ivoire receives a dose of vitamin A, which helps build a healthy immune system and protects against blindness and serious illnesses. | Ruth Fertig/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hki.org/givingtuesday&quot;&gt;Helen Keller Intl&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"Ruth Fertig/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hki.org/givingtuesday&quot;&gt;Helen Keller Intl&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p>If you care mainly about reducing early mortality and giving people more years to live, then you should give all your donations to the Malaria Consortium, Helen Keller Intl, or the Against Malaria Foundation. Malaria is a frequently fatal disease, and cost-effective interventions to reduce malaria infection are a great way to save lives. Similarly, vitamin A supplementation, like Helen Keller does, is an effective way of reducing child mortality, as is vaccination (as promoted by New Incentives).</p>\n\n<p>But extending life isn’t the only thing that matters; improving quality of life matters, too.</p>\n\n<p>It’s extremely hard to weigh these interests<strong> </strong>against each other: Is it better to make a donation that can save one child’s life, or, with the same amount of money, to lift multiple families out of extreme poverty? There’s no one right answer to that question. How you answer it depends on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23862090/subjective-wellbeing-wealth-philanthropy-gdp-happiness-givewell\">your philosophical assumptions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“Philosophical factors can radically alter the cost-effectiveness of life-extending interventions,” writes the Happier Lives Institute, a research center that aims to find evidence-based ways to improve well-being worldwide, in <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/the-elephant-in-the-bednet/\">a new report</a>. To show this, the researchers crunched the numbers to compare the cost-effectiveness of three different charities in terms of how much they boost subjective well-being. Two were life-improving charities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly,</a> which gives cash to poor people in countries like Kenya and Uganda to spend as they see fit, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\">StrongMinds</a>, which treats depression in African women using group psychotherapy. The third charity, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, is mainly life-saving.</p>\n\n<p>Their findings? “On the assumptions most favorable to extending lives, AMF is about 30 percent more cost-effective than StrongMinds.&nbsp;On the assumptions least favorable to extending lives, StrongMinds is around 12 times more cost-effective than AMF.”</p>\n\n<p>So when you’re making your donations, it’s worth thinking not only about quantity of life, but also about quality of life. GiveWell asked recipients themselves how they weigh each of these, and you can read about the results <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/20/21009803/givewell-survey-kenya-ghana-saving-lives-poverty\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6) Maybe just give money directly to poor people</h2>\n\n<p>For years, one of our primary charities has been <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly\">GiveDirectly</a>, which gives unconditional cash transfers. (Sigal donated to them in 2022, 2023, and 2024.) We’ve given to them partly because there&#8217;s a large body of research on the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers\">benefits of cash transfers</a>, which we find quite compelling.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2871156/socialshare.0.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.13712291199202,100,99.725754176016\" alt=\"A smiling person holds up their cellphone to show the money transaction on its screen.\" title=\"A smiling person holds up their cellphone to show the money transaction on its screen.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"GiveDirectly uses the M-PESA system for mobile cash transfers. | Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p>But we’ve donated to GiveDirectly mostly because we didn’t trust ourselves to know what the world&#8217;s poorest people need most. We&#8217;ve been profoundly lucky to never experience the kind of extreme poverty that billions of people worldwide have to endure. We have <em>no idea</em> what we would spend a cash transfer from GiveDirectly on if we were living on less than $2 a day in Uganda. Would we buy a bednet? Maybe! Or maybe we&#8217;d buy an iron roof. Or school tuition for loved ones. Or cattle.</p>\n\n<p>But you know who does<em> </em>have a good sense of the needs of poor people in Uganda? Poor people in Uganda. They have a very good idea of what they need. Do they sometimes misjudge their spending priorities? Certainly; as do all of us. And bednets appear to be underpurchased relative to the actual need for them. But generally, you should only give something other than cash if you are confident you know the recipients’ needs better than they do. We weren’t confident of that, so we gave cash.</p>\n\n<p>As the World Bank&#8217;s Jishnu Das once <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131108022355/http://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/new-york-times-ethicist-better-economist-economist\">put it</a>, “‘Does giving cash work well?’ is a well-defined question only if you are willing to say that ‘well’ is something that WE, the donors, want to define for families whom we have never met and whose living circumstances we have probably never spent a day, let alone a lifetime, in.” If you&#8217;re not willing to say that, then you should strongly consider giving cash.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7) Don’t give to big charities &#8230;</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that all of the charities GiveWell recommends are reasonably small, and some big names are absent. That’s not an accident. In general, charity effectiveness evaluators are <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/28/mega-charities/\">skeptical of large relief organizations</a>, for a number of reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Large organizations tend to be less transparent about where their money goes and also likelier to direct money to disaster relief efforts, which are usually <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/disaster-relief\">less cost-effective, in general, than public health programs</a>. “Overall, our impression is that <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/28/mega-charities/\">your donation to these organizations is very hard to trace</a>, but will likely supplement an agenda of extremely diverse programming, driven largely by governments and other very large funders,” wrote GiveWell co-founder Holden Karnofsky in a 2011 blog post.</p>\n\n<p>Our colleague Kelsey Piper has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17927688/how-to-help-australia-fires-donate-disaster-relief\">explained</a> that by the time a disaster has struck, it’s mostly too late to improve disaster relief work. The quality of the immediate response, which includes search-and-rescue and emergency medicine, is determined by choices before the disaster occurs. Investments in improving those capabilities are most effective either before a crisis or well after, during the recovery phase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8) &#8230; But maybe consider meta-charities</h2>\n\n<p>A different option is giving to groups like GiveWell, <a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/\">Innovations for Poverty Action</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/invest/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> that evaluate development approaches and charities, and encourage effective giving. Suppose that every dollar given to Giving What We Can — which encourages people to pledge to donate at least 10 percent of their income until retirement — results in $1.20 in donations to the Against Malaria Foundation. If that’s the case, then you should give to Giving What We Can until the marginal effect on donations to Against Malaria hits $1 or lower.</p>\n\n<p>“If they can turn a dollar of donations into <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/metacharities\">substantially more than a dollar of increased donations</a> to effective charities, isn’t that the best use of my money?” asks Jeff Kaufman, a software developer who, with his wife Julia Wise, gives about <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/2017-donations\">half his income to effective charities and meta-charities</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9) Consider giving to animals</h2>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could consider giving to non-humans. Animal charities, especially those engaged in corporate pressure campaigns to better the treatment of farm animals, chickens in particular, can be effective in improving <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/animal-welfare\" data-source=\"encore\">animal welfare</a>. The charity evaluations in this area are much younger and less methodologically rigorous than GiveWell’s, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/3/20992185/animal-welfare-best-charities-factory-farming\">Animal Charity Evaluators has named four animal groups</a> that may be effective causes for donations:</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"http://vox.com/meatless-newsletter\"><strong>Sign up for the Meat/Less newsletter course</strong></a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to eat less meat but don’t know where to start? <a href=\"http://vox.com/meatless-newsletter\">Sign up</a> for Vox’s Meat/Less newsletter course.

You should, in this view, not give to charity during your career, and instead save and invest your money, increasing it as much as possible over time. That way you can give more when you die than you would have if giving continuously over the course of your life.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach is to “earn to give”: take a high-paying job, typically in finance or tech, and give away a huge share of your earnings, like 40 to 50 percent. But frankly it’s <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/\">not the best option </a>for most people, especially if the “earn to give” job is in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23458282/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto-ethics\">a morally dubious field</a>. And there are a lot of amazing jobs — in scientific research, in the private sector, in direct charity or nonprofit or government employment —&nbsp;where the typical person can do more good through their work than they could by solely<strong> </strong>using their career as a mechanism through which to generate donation money.</p>\n\n<p>So we suggest a more moderate course: You can sign the <a href=\"https://givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can pledge</a>, which commits members to donating 10 percent of their annual income to highly effective charities, or take a Trial Pledge, which commits members to donating a percentage of their choice — at least 1 percent — to such charities.</p>\n\n<p>Ten percent is a totally reasonable number, comparable to alms in many religions, that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/15/23874111/charity-philanthropy-americans-global-rich\">requires relatively minimal sacrifice</a>. (Here’s an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/2/20982600/charity-10-percent-tithe-giving-what-we-can-toby-ord\">interview</a> with Toby Ord, who started that pledge.) But even if 10 percent is too much for you, don’t despair. Giving 5 percent or 1 percent is better than giving 0 percent.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most important thing is to just get into the groove of donating, to make it a habit. We use direct deposit on our paychecks to make the most of our charitable contributions, just so it’s extremely automatic and hard for us to avoid doing. Going from not giving to giving a little, regularly, is a huge positive step.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, November 19, 2024:</strong> This story, originally published in 2020 and<strong> </strong>updated in 2021, 2022, and 2023, has been updated throughout for 2024.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Fed is an independent institution meant to make decisions that shape the domestic economy without political interference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no indication that Trump wants to exert the kind of control that Musk and Lee tweeted about, but even the type of influence he appears to want likely won’t be possible — at least in the short term.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How much can Trump influence the Fed?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump can’t influence the Federal Reserve much — for right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to interest rates, which are basically how much it costs to borrow money, Trump can complain they are too high (or too low) like any other American, but the Fed’s leaders are the only government officials with the power to adjust those rates. The Fed has lowered interest rates this year as inflation has declined but it kept rates fairly high for the last few years, in part to fight pandemic-era inflation. Even with the lower rates, however, many Americans are still finding it too expensive to borrow money so they can make big purchases like a home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Forcing or pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates won’t necessarily fix high borrowing costs for Americans; the interest rates set by the Fed are actually short-term costs that banks pay to each other to borrow money. The Fed’s decisions influence the cost of borrowing, but <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-promised-lower-interest-rates-will-largely-control-rcna179285\">there are a lot of other factors</a> that go into consumer credit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Furthermore, many of Trump’s other policy proposals — like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress\">broad tariffs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">mass deportation</a> — could <em>increase</em> inflation, which higher interest rates are supposed to combat. If implemented, these proposals could actually lead to higher inflation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you have big tax cuts, and he wants to spend more on the military, and is rounding up however many millions of undocumented workers he plans to [deport], that&#8217;s all going to be very inflationary” as will Trump’s proposed tariffs on imports, Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told Vox. “And then if you tell the Fed, ‘Well, you can&#8217;t do anything to try and contain it, because that would make me unpopular,’ That&#8217;s going to be a really bad story.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One other way Trump might try to meddle in the Fed’s affairs is by trying to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump appointed Powell, but was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/12/why-trump-wont-fire-fed-chair-00188867\">highly critical of Powell’s decision-making</a> during his first term, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/jerome-powell-trump-fed.html\">reportedly looked into</a> whether he could fire the Fed chair.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Powell has stated that he will serve through the rest of his term, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4v7vwgqj0o\">which doesn’t end until 2026</a>, but has declined to say whether or not he would stay on for a third term. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Legally, Trump cannot force Powell to resign or fire him. Members of the Fed’s Board of Governors, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm\">which Powell is part of</a> as the Fed chair, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/12/why-trump-wont-fire-fed-chair-00188867\">can only be fired</a> for wrongdoing or job performance reasons, not differences in policy. Trump could try to fire Powell claiming he’s performing his job poorly, but that decision would probably embroil the president-elect in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/column-fed-chairs-job-security-depends-embattled-supreme-court-precedent-2024-11-11/\">drawn-out legal battle</a>, like the one that ensnared <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/295/602\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he tried to fire a Fed commissioner</a>. (And that Roosevelt lost.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the Federal Reserve was created by an act of Congress, it would take Congressional action to make any changes to how it works. Congress has made some changes over the decades, but there’s no signal right now that most lawmakers are willing to challenge the independence of the institution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any attempts to interfere with the Fed’s independence could have ripple effects in the stock market, Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, told <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-jerome-powell-wall-street-donald-trump-federal-reserve-2024-11\">Business Insider</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;In general, there&#8217;s no question that the market does not like any attempt to interfere, by the executive or congressional branches, in the independence of the Fed,” Siegel said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But come May of 2026, Trump will be able to have some congressionally authorized say in Fed policy. That’s when he’ll be required to appoint a Fed chair for a new four-year term, who’ll then have to undergo Senate confirmation. That may be Powell, or it could be someone more compliant with Trump’s idea of what the Fed should be.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They just kind of happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the play kitchen her 3-year-old son inherited from his cousins. There’s the “random stuff” her mother-in-law buys online, all of it plastic and made up of countless tiny pieces. There’s the kid-sized workbench — Randall got that from her local <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21427525/buy-nothing-gifting-facebook-groups-community-money-borrow-lend-trade\">Buy Nothing group</a>, where neighbors can offload used items (and pick up more).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sheer volume of stuff her son has to play with is overwhelming, Randall told Vox. The day we talked, she and her family were having guests at their Pacific Northwest home, so she was attempting to declutter, “finding all the parts and putting food in the toy kitchen and putting the tools in the workbench.” But it was always a losing battle.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Shelves overflowing with cars and blocks and action figures can be just as stressful for kids as they are for parents.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a familiar refrain among parents: One reader told Vox recently that her family was “absolutely drowning in toys.” And while adults have been complaining about kids’ junk for generations (please see my father’s fruitless search for my brother’s one-inch-long toy wrench in Los Angeles International Airport circa 1992), many millennial and Gen X parents have the sense that something is different now — that kids have more toys than in past decades, and that they seem to arrive in ways Randall describes as “unintentional.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historical data on the average number of toys per kid is surprisingly hard to come by, but there is evidence that Americans’ toy glut is increasing — and it’s not just a problem for affluent households.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">US toy sales jumped from $22.3 billion in 2019 to $26 billion in 2020, and then to $30.1 billion in 2021, as parents struggled to entertain their kids at home during the pandemic. Sales <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/business/toy-sales-decline-2023/index.html\">dipped slightly in 2023</a>, perhaps because of inflation, but remain solidly above 2019 levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t think we’ll ever go back,” Juli Lennett, a vice president and industry adviser for toys at the market research firm Circana, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shelves overflowing with cars and blocks and action figures can be just as stressful for kids as they are for parents. Sometimes “kids don&#8217;t play with anything, because there&#8217;s just too many options,” said <a href=\"https://www.evieandsarah.com/\">Sarah Davis</a>, a parenting coach and co-author of the book <a href=\"https://www.evieandsarah.com/book/\"><em>Modern Manners for Moms and Dads</em></a>. Meanwhile, an overemphasis on acquiring new toys can foster materialism, which is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23944882/kids-money-shopping-allowance-parenting-consumer-culture\">linked with anxiety and depression</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stemming the tide of clutter is easier said than done, since toys often come from grandparents or other loved ones, or even from parties at school. But experts say there are certain characteristics that kids’ favorite toys share. And by focusing on those, grown-ups may be able not only to save money and space, but also to help kids have more fun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, I get the struggle. Recently, I was taking a shower when I noticed a pink plastic rat in the drain.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why kids have so many toys</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the early 2000s, a team led by archaeologist Jeanne E. Arnold counted up the possessions of 32 self-identified middle-class families. The average family in their sample had 139 toys visibly on display, with “untold numbers” out of sight in closets or under beds, the authors wrote in <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1vq382j7#page=7\">a 2012 book</a> about the research. One girl’s room contained 165 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22870250/nft-beanie-baby-price-guide-bubble-princess-value\">Beanie Babies</a>, 22 Barbie dolls, 36 “human/animal figurines,” and one miniature castle. “Spilling out of children’s bedrooms and into living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, and parents’ bedrooms, the playthings of America’s kids are ubiquitous in middle-class homes,” the authors wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That problem has only worsened, with several factors contributing to the overflow. Unlike most other categories of products, childrens’ playthings have actually gotten cheaper over the last 30 years, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-parents-miserable-cheap-toys-high-childcare-costs-2023-12\">Business Insider’s Katie Notopoulos reported</a>. A toy that cost $20 in 1993 would retail for just $4.68 today, in part because of lower production costs as manufacturing moved overseas. Those rock-bottom prices make it easier for grown-ups to buy kids that extra doll or car or <a href=\"https://schylling.com/product/party-animals/?wmc-currency=USD\">guinea pig in a shark suit</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Americans aren’t just buying more toys than they used to, they’re also buying them differently. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/3/17932344/toys-r-us-liquidation-coming-back\">Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy</a> in 2017 and has all but disappeared from the shopping landscape, and other brick-and-mortar toy stores, from <a href=\"https://www.app.com/story/news/local/2024/06/06/lakewood-store-toyland-colorful-building-closing/73982646007/\">small</a> to <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/15/investing/toys-r-us-toy-retailers-dead/index.html\">large</a>, have shuttered in recent years. Meanwhile, shopping has also become more seamless, thanks to Amazon and other e-commerce platforms. In the 1990s, my parents had to drive to Toys R Us to get my brother a <a href=\"https://www.4kidzinc.com/gurglin-gutz\">squishy, blood-shot rubber eyeball</a>; I can purchase a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outus-Halloween-Eyeball-Squeeze-Multicolor/dp/B0DB1ZN8FB/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3MSLW78VADFH2&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eWMX1AJqNnuoybYxpVCBA1l4pJxO0nXDdgSNsNb5yrXqYY-bQNCI454qSGxN7mE1sUCcS8e9tNKg7ljgB3zEcZJd6NfLa-fSFH2vVg8aK5vz4mG1Cyl08flw1-16dk0lgolE50D-ksj7Nh-k7ZbjbMRWJkFiArB3XC5n5XNMk_VyXu6z1GpeikLTz_obsska6IWqKQ80h9Nn1QsQ24DFKkwKlv9oNX4R-B-g_GfQnfRU0nR-zs_Fe_plClQ8SYkT0PRvzXdYoa9cd6zEyhUDirCGaTlVGB0vdm9Y04wAL4A.uNC_pa7qxZMmRRXcjHvxlRDPvj9vZ2xatHyqWwsF3OA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy&amp;qid=1729630757&amp;sprefix=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy%2Caps%2C73&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1\">similar eyeball</a> and get it delivered by the end of the week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Online shopping also offers a convenient way for far-flung extended family members to send kids more toys. “We ask for clothes and college fund money, and despite that, sometimes toys still come in,” Randall told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even secondhand shopping has leveled up, from yard sales and flea markets to Facebook groups and sites like <a href=\"https://www.mercari.com/\">Mercari</a> that let parents snag some lightly used Legos without leaving the couch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>In the 1990s, my parents had to drive to Toys R Us to get my brother a <a href=\"https://www.4kidzinc.com/gurglin-gutz\">squishy, blood-shot rubber eyeball</a>; I can purchase a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outus-Halloween-Eyeball-Squeeze-Multicolor/dp/B0DB1ZN8FB/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3MSLW78VADFH2&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eWMX1AJqNnuoybYxpVCBA1l4pJxO0nXDdgSNsNb5yrXqYY-bQNCI454qSGxN7mE1sUCcS8e9tNKg7ljgB3zEcZJd6NfLa-fSFH2vVg8aK5vz4mG1Cyl08flw1-16dk0lgolE50D-ksj7Nh-k7ZbjbMRWJkFiArB3XC5n5XNMk_VyXu6z1GpeikLTz_obsska6IWqKQ80h9Nn1QsQ24DFKkwKlv9oNX4R-B-g_GfQnfRU0nR-zs_Fe_plClQ8SYkT0PRvzXdYoa9cd6zEyhUDirCGaTlVGB0vdm9Y04wAL4A.uNC_pa7qxZMmRRXcjHvxlRDPvj9vZ2xatHyqWwsF3OA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy&amp;qid=1729630757&amp;sprefix=squishy%2Beyeball%2Btoy%2Caps%2C73&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1\">similar eyeball</a> and get it delivered by the end of the week.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rise of YouTube over the last 20 years has also changed toy purchasing, with influencers advertising toys and <a href=\"https://metricscart.com/insights/exploring-the-us-online-toy-industry/\">releasing their own lines</a>. Unboxing videos, in which kids or adults film themselves taking toys out of packages, have become a cultural staple, even <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/gabbys-dollhouse-interview-big-screen-plans-1235973385/\">inspiring the popular Netflix kids’ show</a> <em>Gabby’s Dollhouse</em> (which now has its own <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/gabbys-dollhouse\">branded toys</a>). There are simply <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23944882/kids-money-shopping-allowance-parenting-consumer-culture\">more avenues for toy advertising</a> and quasi-advertising today than in decades past, and — thanks to features like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/9/14/23872449/tiktok-shop-for-you-page-ads\">TikTok Shop</a> — more and easier ways to buy them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Changing childhood cultural norms may also be having an effect. More schools are asking parents to distribute small toys instead of cupcakes at children’s birthday parties, in an effort to cut down on sugar, parents tell me. The result is what Davis, the parenting coach, calls “the plastic graveyard — all these plastic toys that are just showing up from birthday parties and classroom parties in lieu of candy.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How many is too many toys?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After an initial burst of excitement, a lot of those new toys aren’t seeing much playtime, experts say. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Kids often really only play with a subset of toys, and the other ones are not really that relevant,” sociologist Allison Pugh told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://news.utoledo.edu/index.php/12_18_2017/fewer-toys-lead-to-richer-play-experiences-ut-researchers-find\">2017 study</a>, University of Toledo researchers found that toddlers played longer and more creatively when presented with just four toys than when they had 16 options to choose from (though that’s still a far cry from the 100-plus toys many kids actually own).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The benefit of having fewer choices is something a lot of early educators understand. “If you go into a preschool classroom, they&#8217;ll have like, three tables set up, and each table will have a specific group of toys,” Davis said. “It&#8217;s not too much. It&#8217;s not overwhelming.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids’ favorite toys, meanwhile, tend to be those imbued with “social meaning,” Pugh said. “Kids use toys to connect to other kids — sometimes just by owning the same exact thing, sometimes by playing with it together, sometimes by accruing and sharing specialized knowledge about that toy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Playing with others can give meaning even to objects that aren’t intended as toys at all: “My kids once developed an elaborate series of stories about a bunch of rocks that they found,” Pugh said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The social aspect of toys isn’t always so cute — kids can be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23944882/kids-money-shopping-allowance-parenting-consumer-culture\">bullied or feel inferior</a> if they don’t have the same toys other kids have, and social comparisons can be painful for children whose parents can’t afford new purchases. And while wealthier families may be able to afford pricier toys, lower-income parents sometimes feel so much pressure to buy popular items that they’ll go without basic necessities to do so, <a href=\"https://as.virginia.edu/why-parents-cant-resist-buying-their-children-hottest-gifts\">Pugh has found</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But thinking about toys as social objects is also a reminder that playing is what makes a toy a toy — if nobody plays with it, it’s just part of the plastic graveyard. Kids might gravitate at first to the toys with the most bells and whistles — like, for example, these <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grumblies-Tremor-Light-Up-Eyes/dp/B07NQFMZYK/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MoueXk7ZpDyZHYBPrw48HG34mX0u7OveZb_-7SKsqZwQ0wVTTHL5xGNV85LF6cjpVxXOVTixOBTeEEWhc6_8ZfSS19mHWvBvdON6EwEkUjLIESWomxFO9aPiUVR2sA8O.Bh-KDx9egT6ER8KQ7sEfalrZ5Iy54k0q6aWyXIFz0XA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=grumblies&amp;qid=1730304455&amp;sr=8-8\">cursed electronic stuffies</a> that emit bloodcurdling screams when thrown.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Playing is what makes a toy a toy — if nobody plays with it, it’s just part of the plastic graveyard.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But toys that do too much often lack “stickiness,” or the ability to hold kids’ attention for a long period of time, said Sudha Swaminathan, director of the Center for Early Childhood Education at Eastern Connecticut State University. The stickiest toys are usually simple and open-ended, she said, like blocks or <a href=\"https://www.easternct.edu/center-for-early-childhood-education/timpani/timpani-2017.html\">basic animal figures</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The toys that kids return to again and again are the ones that “require attention, imagination, and creativity,” Davis said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For her kids, that’s magnetic blocks. For Randall’s son, it’s a set of wooden train tracks left over from her own childhood. “I guess I just didn&#8217;t need to get any modern toys,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, kids are going to ask for toys they saw on YouTube, on the playground, or at a friend’s house. They’re going to come home with vials of mysterious green goo that end up in the freezer (maybe this is just my kid). <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/advice-my-childs-friend-is-rude-disrespectful.html\">Parents do not control</a> what their kids want, or even always what they get, and it can seem like that control is ebbing further every day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The adults in kids’ lives can, however, decide when to say yes and when we have to say no. And when all else fails and the clutter gets overwhelming, we can “sneak out in the dead of night,”&nbsp;while they’re sleeping, as Randall puts it, and get rid of that junk.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

I decided this year to try my best to answer them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are you asking me to do?</h2>\n\n<p>I am asking you to give 10 percent of your pretax income to a charity that saves lives. I give my 10 percent to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund\">GiveWell’s top charities fund</a>, which redistributes it to highly effective global health charities like the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\">Malaria Consortium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international\">Helen Keller International</a>. <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/sources/blog-post/giving-recommendations-2023#1\">GiveWell estimates</a> that for every $5,000 gift, these charities will save one human life.</p>\n\n<p>I think of GiveWell as like the charity version of an index fund: It’s a rigorous, impartial recommender that you can donate to without having to pick and choose individual causes. It has also been, disclosure, an advertiser on Vox Media podcasts, though I’ve been using it since long before that was true.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10 percent seems like a lot.</h2>\n\n<p>It’s significant. For the average American household, which has an <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2023/demo/p60-279.html#:~:text=Highlights,and%20Table%20A%2D1).\">income of roughly $75,000</a>, it’s a $7,500 commitment. That’s a real bite, but it’s also more than enough to save a life.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I don’t know if I can afford 10 percent …&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s fair! Can you do 5 percent?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maybe …&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>I would go as low as 1 percent!</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But then that’s only $750 a year, and that can’t save a life.</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, every five years you would. And if you want to do more good, we can always go back to 10 percent!</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Vox guide to giving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving — from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving\">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h1>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Okay, okay, 10 percent. Isn’t that <a href=\"https://www.biblestudytools.com/msg/deuteronomy/passage/?q=deuteronomy+14:22-26\">kind of religious</a>?</h2>\n\n<p>For sure: The practice of tithing in many world religions is a key inspiration here. The twist is I’m suggesting tithing not to religious institutions but to highly effective charities (which could be religious or not — it’s not their beliefs that matter, but their effectiveness).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So why these particular charities?</h2>\n\n<p>Because there’s a huge, huge difference between what the most and least effective charities can accomplish with donations. You might think that charities are like brands of dish soap …</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I’ve never once thought that.</h2>\n\n<p>It’s an analogy, give me a second. The absolute best dish soap is probably, at most, a tiny bit better than the average brand, right? I mean it’s just soap. Even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dish-soap/\">Wirecutter</a> says “you probably can’t go wrong with most name-brand dish detergents.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fair enough, soap is soap.</h2>\n\n<p>But really, charities are more like chef’s knives. The difference between the best and worst knife is enormous and affects the entire process of cooking, or so it has been explained to me by superior cooks. It’s the difference between an enjoyable time in the kitchen versus pure drudgery (and a heightened chance you inadvertently chop off your fingertip).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So what does this have to do with charity?</h2>\n\n<p>What it has to do with charity is that the vast majority of nonprofits have no evidence of positive impact at all, and even charities brave enough to agree to rigorous tests of their impact see widely variable effectiveness. In global development, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/effective-social-program/#estimates-within-international-development-and-meta-analyses-vs-rcts\">something like 60 to 70 percent of interventions</a> tested show no results at all, which effectively means the money donated could have just been thrown down a hole.</p>\n\n<p>And among those that do show results, the size of the impact varies drastically. The researcher Benjamin Todd has looked into these questions a lot, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2023/02/how-much-do-solutions-differ-in-effectiveness\">examining nine different databases of program impact</a>, and found that in every context, from US social policy to global health to the UK’s National Health Service to estimates of climate policies, the results are “fat-tailed.” That’s statistics talk for the conclusion that the best interventions are much, much better than the average interventions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much better are these super-interventions?</h2>\n\n<p>It depends, but here are a couple of examples: The most cost-effective treatments examined by Britain’s National Health Service were 120 times more effective than the median treatment. A World Bank study found the most effective interventions in global health were 38 times more effective than the median ones.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And why should I care about giving my money to the 38-times-more-effective place?</h2>\n\n<p>Because it lets you do a lot more good. Suppose you’re giving $7,500 a year. If you gave that to an average global health program, you’d be providing 30 more total years of healthy life to a few people, per the World Bank data.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">30 years of life! That’s pretty good, right?</h2>\n\n<p>It’s great. But if you put that money toward one of the 2.5 percent most cost-effective interventions, you’d save about 1,275 years of life.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wow, I can actually provide a millennium of extra life?</h2>\n\n<p>Quite possibly! These are necessarily rough numbers and you shouldn’t take them too literally. You might merely save hundreds of years of life. But the magnitudes here strongly suggest that you should be careful about choosing where to donate, because the difference between the best and the merely okay is huge.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a reason the philosopher Toby Ord, who originated the “10 percent of income to effective charities” pledge idea, has argued that <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/research/the-moral-imperative-towards-cost-effectiveness\">cost-effectiveness is a moral imperative</a>, on par with the moral imperative to give money at all.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So I looked at the GiveWell list of top charities …&nbsp;why aren’t there any working in the US?</h2>\n\n<p>Good question. The short answer is the US is a rich country, which means everything tends to cost more than it does abroad — including the cost of helping people in need. The US still has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/5/18650492/2019-poverty-2-dollar-a-day-edin-shaefer-meyer\">extreme poverty</a>, in the global, living-on-$2-a-day standard, but it’s comparatively rare and hard to target effectively. The poorest Americans also have access to health care and education systems that, while obviously inferior compared to those enjoyed by rich Americans, are still superior to those of very poor countries.</p>\n\n<p>To be blunt: People in the US simply are not dying for want of a <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\">$1.50 anti-malaria pill</a>. (For one thing, the US <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/malaria-mosquito-control-scn/index.html\">managed to essentially eradicate</a> malaria transmission from within its borders.) That means it is much, much more cost-effective to help people abroad.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much more cost-effective?</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s one example. Years ago, GiveWell looked into a number of US charities, like the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/nfp\">Nurse-Family Partnership</a> program for infants, the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/kipp\">KIPP chain of charter schools</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/united-states/charities/HOPE-Program\">HOPE job-training program</a>. It found that all were highly effective but were also<strong> </strong>far more cost-intensive than the best foreign charities. KIPP and the Nurse-Family Partnership cost <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">more than $9,000 per child served</a>, while a program like the Malaria Consortium’s prevention efforts costs <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">around $4,500 per life saved</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s been less work on evaluating US charities in recent years than would be ideal, and I’d love to hear about charities that can save lives here very cost-effectively. But right now, the evidence suggests to me that it’s much more expensive to save lives in the US than abroad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But …&nbsp;I still want to help people closer to me.</h2>\n\n<p>That’s a commendable impulse! I get it, really, and if the most I can convince you to do here is give 10 percent of your income to fight poverty in the US, then you should do that and I’ll take the win.</p>\n\n<p>But I would also ask you to consider the idea that people in other, much poorer countries have equal moral weight to those who live in your country. Their lives matter just as much. And if you can help, say, 100 of them for the cost of helping one American, and you choose to do the latter, you’re making an implicit choice to value Americans much more than non-Americans. I think there might be valid reasons to make that choice —&nbsp;but it’s not one I want to make, so that’s not how I donate.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What about animals? This all sounds very human-centric. Animals count, too!</h2>\n\n<p>Indeed they do. I think the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/btTeBHKGkmRyD5sFK/open-phil-should-allocate-most-neartermist-funding-to-animal\">best critique</a> of GiveWell’s list — well, less a critique than an argument not to use it exclusively —&nbsp;is that you can do even more good, even more efficiently if you try to help animals, especially farm animals bred and raised in extreme suffering just so they can be slaughtered. There are billions of them, and very little is spent trying to help them. If you want to help them, <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> has some good suggestions of where to give. I’m partial to the <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/\">Humane League</a>, which pressures corporations to improve their treatment of farmed animals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This all …&nbsp;sounds like effective altruism.</h2>\n\n<p>It does because it is. Todd and Ord were among the founders of effective altruism, and generally the community and people in it have developed a lot of the ideas you see above, from the focus on cost-effectiveness to the “give 10 percent” idea to taking animals seriously.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Didn’t effective altruists do a bunch of crimes a few years ago?</h2>\n\n<p>A bunch of EAs definitely did a bunch of crimes a few years ago. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/2023/10/17/23914617/sam-bankman-fried-michael-lewis-going-infinite-the-gray-area-crypto-ftx-caroline-ellison\">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> and several of his colleagues at FTX and Alameda Research identified as EAs and stated that they were only becoming billionaires to donate the proceeds to effective charities. Of course, they turned out to be stealing lots of money in the process and Bankman-Fried has since been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23944399/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-ftx-trial-fraud-guilty\">convicted</a> in federal court and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/samuel-bankman-fried-sentenced-25-years-his-orchestration-multiple-fraudulent-schemes\">sentenced to 25 years in prison</a>. (Disclosure: In 2022, Bankman-Fried’s philanthropic family foundation, Building a Stronger Future, awarded Vox’s <a data-source=\"encore\" href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a> a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/7/21020439/support-future-perfect\">grant</a> for a 2023 reporting project. That project is now on pause.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So he did crimes because of these ideas?</h2>\n\n<p>I don’t think we know for sure why he did what he did, but <a href=\"https://www.spencergreenberg.com/2023/11/who-is-sam-bankman-fried-sbf-really-and-how-could-he-have-done-what-he-did-three-theories-and-a-lot-of-evidence/\">there are some theories</a>. One theory is that Bankman-Fried took the idea that you should make as much money as possible and donate it as efficiently as possible, and ran way<em> </em>too far with it — to the point where committing outright fraud to make money to donate made sense to him, on the apparent grounds that the potential good that could be done with it was worth the risk to himself and many others. Other theories hold that he was just lying the whole time, never cared about doing the right thing, and used EA as a cover for his own greed. Either way, it reflects very badly on EA.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So why are you asking me to take these effective altruist ideas seriously?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because they’re good ideas and they’re in danger of being totally discredited because of some effective altruists who didn’t even take the “donate a lot of your income to normal charities that save lives” part of the philosophy seriously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Look at SBF: He distributed a bunch of money to causes he valued, but they were explicitly <em>not</em> causes involving giving people lifesaving medication right now. They were <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=FTX+Future+Fund\">more speculative “longtermist” causes</a> — things like AI safety and preventing global catastrophic risks. Whatever you think of that behavior, it’s precisely <em>not</em> what I’m asking you to do right now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If they didn’t take these ideas seriously, why should I?</h2>\n\n<p>Because you have the opportunity to save lives, right now, and you should take it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This whole thing where you think I’m, like, obligated to give this much is weird.</h2>\n\n<p>I don’t think you’re “obligated.” I just think it’s a good thing to do and that you should consider it. If everyone did it, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/15/23874111/charity-philanthropy-americans-global-rich\">we could end global poverty</a> and then some. And I don’t even think it’s purely an altruistic good thing. I think it’ll be good for you as a person, too.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oh, really? I should <em>selfishly</em> give away 10 percent of my income?</h2>\n\n<p>That’s honestly a big part of why I do it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Really? For yourself?</h2>\n\n<p>Sure. Look, I think it’s important to do good for other people, in and of itself. That’s a major motivator, definitely.</p>\n\n<p>But …&nbsp;you ever wonder if your life has meaning? If it makes any kind of difference to the world? Personally, I want to live a life that means something, that leaves things ever so slightly better than I found them. I want to be pursuing goals that aren’t just material. I don’t want to mark the progression of my life solely through raises and promotions, or fall victim to the subtle pressures that push me to spend more and more of my money on gadgets and furniture that make me progressively less happy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What on earth are you even talking about?</h2>\n\n<p>I’m talking about a problem that, for me, giving 10 percent of my income away helps solve. One, it helps establish a baseline meaning or impact from my work — if nothing else, I know that the money I make through my job contributes to saving people’s lives. That has to count for something. That’s a source of real meaning and pride.</p>\n\n<p>Two, it provides a powerful counterforce to the treadmill that comes as you age and make more money, a treadmill that pushes you to spend lots of it to keep up with your peers or feel like you’re living better. There are definitely times when I feel like I’m not taking as nice a vacation as my friends are, or where I feel kinda cheap for having mostly Wayfair furniture while my friends have a nice, solid wood dining table. Sometimes I blame the donations for these feelings.</p>\n\n<p>But mostly I am thankful for them. The idea that, after you reach a certain level of baseline comfort, additional consumer spending is going to make you dramatically happier is a <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/danielgilbert/files/if-money-doesnt-make-you-happy.nov-12-20101.pdf\">seductive lie</a>. And one of the few weapons I have against it is the knowledge that I face a very real choice between, say, getting one of those amazing lie-flat business-class airplane seats for my next vacation and saving a human being’s life. That lets me resist the former, and live a life that feels just a tiny bit more meaningful.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Okay, fine, I’m in. Where do I sign up?</h2>\n\n<p>The group <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> runs a pledge, which I and thousands of others have signed, for people who commit to donating 10 percent of their income to highly effective charities. You can sign if you want. But the main thing to do is <a href=\"https://secure.givewell.org/\">just give</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Trump <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-turning-point-action-convention-detroit-june-15-2024/\">blasted US aid to Ukraine</a>, joking that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is “maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that&#8217;s ever lived. Every time he comes to our country, he walks away with $60 billion.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sure enough, this skepticism applies to more traditional foreign aid spending as well, through vehicles like the US Agency for International Development (USAID). <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/news-summary/white-house-releases-fy18-budget-request/\">All</a> <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/news-summary/white-house-releases-fy19-budget-request/\">four</a> <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/news-summary/white-house-releases-fy20-budget-request/\">budget</a> <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/news-summary/white-house-releases-fy21-budget-request/\">proposals</a> during Trump’s first term included major cuts to foreign aid; the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/news-summary/white-house-releases-fy21-budget-request/\">last one</a> proposed a 34 percent cut to global health programs, including an over 50 percent cut to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/13/23544865/congress-hiv-malaria-global-fund-replenishment\">Global Fund</a>, the main international body coordinating donor funds to fight malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Project 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">notorious Heritage Foundation project</a> outlining policy for a second Trump term, commissioned Max Primorac, who served in USAID during Trump&#8217;s first term, to <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-09.pdf\">outline a plan for aid</a>. His focus was on fighting DEI and reproductive health initiatives, combating Chinese influence, returning support to fossil fuels in developing countries, and enacting &#8220;deep cuts&#8221; to the aid budget.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that reads like a case that foreign aid advocates should be freaking out right now, the same way <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381773/trump-win-election-abortion-ban-filibuster-dobbs\">abortion rights</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation\">immigrant advocates</a> are. But the truth is more nuanced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president does not control the foreign aid budget directly, and during Trump’s first term, a <a href=\"https://www.usglc.org/blog/republicans-and-democrats-agree-foreign-aid-cuts-would-hurt-u-s-national-security/\">bipartisan</a> coalition in Congress ensured that none of the cuts were adopted. While his budgets proposed cuts to institutions like the Global Fund, the US also made <a href=\"https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2019/2019-10-10-global-fund-donors-pledge-usd14-billion-in-fight-to-end-epidemics/\">large pledges</a> of <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/united-states-endorses-gavi-recommendation-us-116-billion-four-year-commitment\">increased support</a> during his term, albeit largely at Congress’s instigation. Mark Green, the former Congress member who Trump tapped to head USAID last time, is widely respected in the aid world and <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/what-mark-green-hopes-to-leave-behind-at-usaid-96983\">pursued reform policies</a> that honestly don’t look very different from those of Biden’s administrator, Samantha Power, or Obama’s Raj Shah and Gayle Smith.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts and advocates I spoke with emphasized that no one really knows what Trump II will bring, or how similar/different it will be from his first term. Some of his Cabinet picks, like Florida Sen. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/marco-rubio-trump-secretary-of-state.html\">Marco Rubio</a> or North Dakota Gov. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/11/14/doug-burgum-interior-department-trump/\">Doug Burgum</a>, seem like people any Republican could’ve chosen. Others, like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/politics/robert-f-kennedy-donald-trump-hhs/index.html\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/385329/trump-cabinet-appointments-democracy-matt-gaetz-pete-hegseth\">Matt Gaetz</a>, seem wildly unqualified and bizarre. But while little is certain, aid experts emphasized that we should not assume big cuts or other major damage to the US foreign aid system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I have every expectation that we will see an attempt to cut funds for these areas, and those proposed cuts are profoundly dangerous,” Colin Puzo Smith, director of global policy at the antipoverty group <a href=\"https://results.org/\">RESULTS</a>, told me. “But it’s&nbsp;so, so, so important for the global health advocacy community to remember, for the public to remember, and for other country leaders to remember, that those decisions don’t sit with the White House. They fall to Congress.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The case for optimism on foreign aid under Trump</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The best case that foreign aid will survive the Trump years without major damage is the record of Trump I.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you look at total foreign assistance spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (the two years after Trump took over but before Covid-19), <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40213#page=36\">foreign aid funding was basically the same</a> in dollar terms, only declining slightly due to inflation. When you account for military aid declining as the fight against ISIS in countries like Iraq and Jordan wound down, the picture looks even better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The basic reason that funding remained high despite budget requests from Trump proposing deep cuts is that members of Congress, in particular Republicans who were chairing relevant subcommittees in the Senate and House for Trump’s first two years, were <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/13/23544865/congress-hiv-malaria-global-fund-replenishment\">adamant that funding stay high</a>. They were not shy about denouncing his proposed cuts, even very early in his term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most important institutions on aid funding in Congress are the State and Foreign Operations subcommittees of the appropriations committees for each chamber. Appropriations is in charge of all funding that has to be regularly authorized; that excludes things like Social Security or Medicare but includes the entire foreign aid budget.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Republicans chairing the subcommittees during Trump’s first term were furious at the prospect of foreign aid reductions. “The proposed cuts to U.S. diplomacy and assistance are sweeping and potentially counterproductive to our national security goals,” Hal Rogers, the Kentucky Republican in charge of the House subcommittee, said in a <a href=\"https://halrogers.house.gov/2017/5/congressman-rogers-statement-on-president-trump-s-fy18-budget-proposal\">2017 statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Senate chair was Lindsey Graham, a former Trump critic who had by this point become a major booster. All the same, Graham pronounced the foreign aid cuts “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/02/28/graham-trump-slashing-of-state-dept-and-foreign-aid-would-be-dead-on-arrival-in-congress/\">dead on arrival</a>,” and argued Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/05/23/lindsey-graham-trumps-state-department-budget-could-cause-a-lot-of-benghazis/\">cuts to the State Department</a> could lead to “a lot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack\">Benghazis</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The health research group KFF has a <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/u-s-global-health-budget-tracker/\">useful tool</a> allowing you to compare global health funding each year in the President’s budget, both in House- and Senate-proposed spending bills and in actuality. In almost every case, you see Congress pushing for more spending than Trump did, and winning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump wanted to provide $1.125 billion to the Global Fund, the anti-malaria/TB/HIV group. The final bill provided $225 million more than that. Trump wanted $424 million for USAID efforts against malaria. The House upped that to $505 million, the Senate to $655 million, and the final passed version was $755 million, plus another $202 million for the National Institutes of Health to research malaria.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That reflects a deep bipartisan commitment to global health funding, one that persists to this day. Graham is currently the ranking member on the funding subcommittee, and likely will be chair again come January. Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who has succeeded Rogers as chair of the House subcommittee, is also known as an enthusiastic supporter of global health funding. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In late 2022, under President Joe Biden, a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/13/23544865/congress-hiv-malaria-global-fund-replenishment\">bipartisan deal was cut</a> involving these players enacting major increases in a number of global health funding streams. Those same actors could do that again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There remain a lot of people in key positions in Congress who are very supportive of global health,” Chris Collins, head of <a href=\"https://www.theglobalfight.org/\">Friends of the Global Fight</a>, which pushes for increased global health support from Congress, told me. “Global health has always been bipartisan.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The foreign aid team that Trump put in place last time also gets high marks from observers in the field. His USAID pick Mark Green sought to reorient the agency toward emphasizing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23274306/usaid-foreign-aid-effectiveness-evidence-grants\">evidence-based interventions and programs</a> run by locally rooted organizations, as opposed to US-based contractors. His program in that vein, the <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/npi/npi-awards\">New Partnership Initiative</a>, was quite similar to the <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/usaid-didnt-hit-its-30-percent-target-local-solutions\">Local Solutions</a> program under Obama and the pledge by Power to <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/samantha-power-takes-localization-global-104646\">increase the share of aid running through local groups to 25 percent</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;Thanks to the able leadership of Administrator Mark Green, USAID has avoided much of the harm many feared could befall it under an administration that has so often positioned itself at odds with a development agenda,&#8221; the <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/mark-greens-legacy-and-priorities-next-usaid-administrator\">Center for Global Development&#8217;s Sarah Rose and Erin Collinson</a> wrote when he stepped down in 2020. &#8220;When Green steps down from the job today, he will leave behind an agency that has largely continued to champion development.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The basic bull case for Trump II is that his second USAID administrator will be a broadly liked technocrat like Green, focused on improving efficiency rather than pursuing a partisan agenda focused on gender or reproductive health issues. That, plus a Congress willing to fund aid programs generously, could result in basically decent outcomes, if not spectacular ones.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The case that this time will be different</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first Trump term was not an unqualified success from a foreign aid standpoint. While his cuts did not make it through Congress, the fact that he proposed them put aid agencies under pressure and added uncertainty that they’d be able to continue programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He also engaged in some classic Republican policies that global health experts disdain, like reviving the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-mexico-city-policy-an-explainer/\">Mexico City Policy</a>, a Reagan-era measure that bars aid to organizations that provide abortions. This is an example of Trump being a standard Republican president — every Republican since Reagan has adopted that policy, and every Democrat in office has then rescinded it. It’s more or less an American tradition at this point. But the policy is also associated with <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2123177119\">worse maternal health outcomes</a> in recipient countries. Meanwhile, other Trump appointees <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-11-05/ex-trump-official-and-abstinence-advocate-strikes-secretive-health-deal-in-uganda/?tpcc=africa_brief&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Africa%20Brief%2011132024&amp;utm_term=africa_brief\">pushed for abstinence-only sex education programs</a> to combat HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, an approach that most research suggests is <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2/abstract?cookiesEnabled\">ineffective</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More to the point, Trump II is by no means guaranteed to be like Trump I. His appointments so far have indicated he’s willing to depart from normal US policy more drastically; compare, for instance, his <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2022/03/10/former-sen-dan-coats-dishes-on-supreme-court-ukraine-trump/\">first-term choice</a> of respected former Sen. Dan Coats to be director of national intelligence <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/385329/trump-cabinet-appointments-democracy-matt-gaetz-pete-hegseth\">to his choice</a> this time of Tulsi Gabbard, who is incredibly close to the Russian government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to global health, two big changes stand out. One is that Trump II will be a post-Covid administration, and thus will reflect the deep skepticism of multilateral health institutions that has developed on the right as a result of the pandemic. A few months into the pandemic, Trump announced he was <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-the-trump-administrations-decision-to-leave-the-world-health-organization\">withdrawing the US</a> from the World Health Organization (WHO), citing its failure to contain the virus and arguing it was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52294623\">excessively close to the Chinese government</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Biden administration reversed course on that decision, GOP anger toward the WHO in particular has lingered. The <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-passes-fy25-bill-advances-american-leadership-and-security-supports\">most recent Republican appropriations bill</a> in the House zeroed out funding for that agency as well as the UN Population Fund, UNESCO, and the UN Environment Fund, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Diaz-Balart, the chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, crafted that bill and is known as a moderate who resisted deeper cuts in Trump’s first term. If he wants to zero out WHO funding, it’s a fair bet it’ll be zeroed out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The multilateral space is one where you’re going to see a shift,” Elizabeth Hoffman, executive director for North America at the <a href=\"https://www.one.org/us/get-involved/join/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPunVKVVQidu315RlfKkH6nLVUnkEApnL6wgdFb_A55bTpxVZsKPBrQaAhtsEALw_wcB\">ONE Campaign</a> and a veteran foreign aid staffer in Republican congressional offices, told me. “There’s going to be a shift from trying to do things through multilateral mechanisms and looking at a more bilateral framework.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear that this skepticism will extend to multilateral funding mechanisms like the Global Fund or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/358800/gavi-biden-vaccine-congress-foreign-aid\">Gavi</a>. But there’s another factor in Trump II of potential concern for Gavi, especially: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump, the latter has repeatedly suggested that RFK will have a role as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/robert-kennedy-jr-donald-trump-health-care.html\">kind of public health czar</a>. He made it official by naming Kennedy as his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-hhs-secretary-pick-00188617\">pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy is perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health\">most influential anti-vaccine activist</a> not only in the US, but the world. A few months after he <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/\">visited the nation of Samoa</a> in 2019 and campaigned with anti-vaccine advocates there, a massive measles outbreak, driven by declining vaccination rates, broke out, killing <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7255155/\">some 83 people, mostly children</a>, in a country of <a href=\"https://data.who.int/countries/882\">217,000</a>. The US population equivalent would be over 136,000 deaths.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear how much power Kennedy will have to repeat his Samoa performance in the US. He <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181197/rfk-jr-discusses-potential-role-in-the-trump-administration-and-health-policy-vision\">told NPR</a> the morning after the election, “We’re not going to take vaccines away from anybody.” But he used the same appearance to emphasize that he thinks “the science on vaccine safety particularly has huge deficits,” suggesting he maintains his belief that they’re unsafe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How much power Kennedy will have to reduce vaccinations in the US is unclear, and how much power or interest he’ll have in reducing them abroad is even less clear. But whereas the last Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/news-summary/white-house-releases-fy21-budget-request/\">declined to propose funding cuts for the vaccine funding group Gavi</a>, even as it sought to cut almost every other kind of foreign aid, it’s not hard to imagine Kennedy’s presence pushing them to include Gavi and other vaccination programs in their budget slashing agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such cuts, if enacted, would be tragic. Economic research suggests that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/358800/gavi-biden-vaccine-congress-foreign-aid\">Gavi’s support for national vaccination programs can save a life for a few thousand dollars</a>, or even less. It’s one of the most cost-effective things the US government does, in any domain. If anti-vaxxers in Trump’s orbit target it, and if Congress goes along with them, the ramifications would be devastating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps the most disturbing omen for Trump’s foreign aid policy is the report from the Washington Post that he wants to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/13/elon-musk-government-efficiency-congress-budget-law/\">revive “impoundment,”</a> a practice Congress banned after Watergate in which the president simply refuses to spend money that’s been allocated by Congress. Trump publicly flirted with using a related tool, called rescission, to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/22/white-house-backs-off-foreign-aid-cuts-1472130\">unilaterally cut foreign aid in 2019</a>. This time he seems more serious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Trump fully usurps the power of the purse from Congress, then any hope for foreign aid premised on the bipartisan congressional coalition behind foreign aid spending becomes hollow. Trump could simply overrule the Lindsey Grahams and Mario Diaz-Balarts of the world. Then we’d be in an incredibly dark reality indeed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

If you told me that you’re agonizing over what to get a rich person, I would ask you to reevaluate your priorities. Rich people have enough money that they can buy whatever they want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But since the rich are people, and people celebrate birthdays, holidays, and milestones with presents, there will sometimes be a rare occasion when someone needs to get them a gift. And the exasperation goes from imaginary frustration to real annoyance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s when people, mostly rich ones, call <a href=\"https://thegifterie.co/\">The Gifterie</a>, a bespoke gifting concierge that helps clients choose the perfect gift for the most affluent, famous, and picky people in the world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Gifterie is the creation of Elise Nach and Min Polley. They came to me highly recommended by a few celebrity personal assistants.&nbsp;Whether the recipient is an avid golfer or a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23327493/nepotism-baby-meaning-dakota-johnson-zoe-kravitz-maude-apatow\">newborn nepo baby</a>, Nach and Polley will find just the thing.&nbsp;I spoke with Nach about the difference between good and bad gifts, what they’ve learned from gifting the hardest people to buy for, how we — normies&nbsp;— can translate that to the presents we give this holiday season, and, of course, the most absurd celebrity request they’ve ever taken.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Alex Abad-Santos: I asked one of my friends who works as a celebrity’s personal assistant to ask his colleagues and they all recommended The Gifterie. And now I’m here to ask you, the experts, what to get people — like celebrities — who have everything</strong>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Elise Nach: </strong>As a company we&#8217;re used to working with a variety of requests, whether it is very specific, like, “Blake Lively is having another baby. We need to send something she doesn’t have,” to [working with] Amazon, when they&#8217;re launching a new series and they want to send something fun to all their press and talent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to either the celebrity gifting or higher-end clientele that really have everything, we always say it&#8217;s more about making something feel special — [showing] that you put thought into it. Because they have a thousand scarves or they have a thousand different baby toys. Whether it&#8217;s etching a baby&#8217;s name on a gift or stitching someone&#8217;s initials on something, things like that seem to make a bigger impact with the recipient than just another Hermès scarf.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which again, lovely. Who doesn&#8217;t want to get that?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>If anyone is reading this, I would not turn down a Hermès scarf.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, I wouldn’t either. But the key to successful gift-giving is really personalizing it. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it has to have their name on it, but just knowing the recipient well enough to say, “Okay, this person really loves X.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That could be golf, or travel, or something like, “We know they&#8217;re going on a huge press tour,” so we want to get them something to carry their stuff. It’s something you can home in on — think about the conversations you’ve had with this person and what they’re about. It&#8217;s just so much more thoughtful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How much do you need to know about the recipient to feel like you have the confidence that you can give a good gift? You’re getting great gifts for people you might never even meet.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There&#8217;s a couple of our clients that we work with on a continuous basis, and they just email us and they&#8217;ll say, so and so — typically, an actor or a director or somebody that works on one of their shows — is having a birthday or having a baby, and we want to send something.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether the budget is $150 or $5,000, our team will dig in and do a little deep dive on the internet on these people, and see if we can figure out something that they like or are interested in. We’ll do a little sleuthing and figure out, like, “Okay, this person seems to really love backpacking.” And we would recommend outdoorsy things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBSNsywSCT0/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBSNsywSCT0/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBSNsywSCT0/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by The Gifterie (@thegifterie.co)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We&#8217;re really trying to stay on the pulse of what&#8217;s cool, what brands are trendy, quality brands in all different kinds of categories.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It isn&#8217;t necessarily that we have to know a certain amount of information about the people that we’re gifting, it&#8217;s just the more we know, the better, right? If you receive a thoughtful gift, it&#8217;s because somebody really thought of you and took the time to think, “What would this person like?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I think what you’re getting at — and maybe this is the key to all gift-giving — is that it just comes down to thoughtfulness. Showing someone that you’ve thought about them.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have this quote on our website: “Happiness doesn&#8217;t result from what you get, but from what you give.” That’s basically our motto. Whether they&#8217;re going through something rough or they&#8217;re celebrating an amazing milestone, giving people something that has thought behind it and brings them joy is always the best direction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes from someone else, it&#8217;s that extra level of excitement that somebody else got it for you. You didn&#8217;t buy it for yourself; someone took the time to think of you. It&#8217;s just a lovely feeling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If you receive a thoughtful gift, it&#8217;s because somebody really thought of you and took the time to think, “What would this person like?”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I know we&#8217;re talking about high-end clientele and very rich people, but do you need a big budget to get people thoughtful presents?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s not so much how much something costs, but how much you put the thought into it and made it feel special.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Presentation is also a big component. How we gift wrap things — adding dried flowers, the kind of ribbon you use, the paper, etc. — we really think about taking it to another level of not just sticking it in a box. We get a lot of feedback from recipients that the gift was just so beautifully gift-wrapped that they didn’t even want to open it. And then to open it and find something so pretty inside is also a really nice touch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So for people that are gifting who don&#8217;t have a big celebrity budget, you can still wrap it in a really beautiful way and make it feel elevated and special. You can get stuff at Michael&#8217;s. It doesn&#8217;t have to be from fancy places online. And when you receive a gift like that, it feels like somebody put extra thought into it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Are there any gift ideas people should avoid?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ice cream.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>But that’s a wonderful gift!</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Have you tried shipping it?&nbsp; We&#8217;ve done it, but it&#8217;s a nightmare and very stressful. I would also avoid anything super perishable. That would definitely be number one. If you know you&#8217;re not going to overnight it, if it&#8217;s something that isn&#8217;t going to be locally given, then I would probably avoid food.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Are there polarizing foods that are a no-go? Raisins? I hate raisins.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No, we don’t usually include raisins. I mean, how do I say this? Probably avoid cheese that is … you know … more potent. But really, avoid things that are perishable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With gifts that are very breakable, make sure they&#8217;re padded and packaged correctly. One of the worst things is sending someone a gift and something shows up broken.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Just save your money. People would prefer a card or gift card, if you&#8217;re not going to put thought into it.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is there such a thing as a bad gift?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I just think being generic just shows that you didn&#8217;t put any thought into it. You know what I mean?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just save your money. People would prefer a card or gift card, if you&#8217;re not going to put thought into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do you have a go-to gift for someone that’s just notoriously hard to buy for?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sometimes when it’s something celebratory, like someone just won an Emmy — that can be a tough gift. For those kinds of gifts, we&#8217;ll do a beautiful bottle of champagne and we will etch on the bottle, “Congratulations on your Emmy win” with their name or the date. It&#8217;s something that they could drink, but they could also put it on a shelf and always see it as another trophy. It’s a thoughtful way of enhancing a bottle of champagne or their favorite liquor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you know that they love a certain whiskey, or a beautiful bottle of champagne, or a really expensive bottle of wine, and it&#8217;s for someone who has everything — those seem to always go over well because you&#8217;re getting them something they love, they&#8217;ll definitely drink it at some point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the most difficult request you’ve ever gotten?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Okay, so not naming names.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I totally want you to name names but I understand.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We got a request from an assistant at a record label: “So and so is coming in. They&#8217;re really big. We really need a welcome or a thank you gift basket for them. Can you spend X amount and put all this stuff together?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We said sure, and that we could do something beautiful —&nbsp;a basket of wine, cheeses,<strong> </strong>&nbsp;and all these fresh goods. And the assistant was like, “Can you get it here by 2 pm?” And this was like 10:30 in the morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the valley to Santa Monica is not easy. It&#8217;s about a 45-minute drive at 2 pm, and longer with traffic. We went to all of our favorite shops, curated this gorgeous present, but were running out of time to get it to the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvsCXNmLjAQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvsCXNmLjAQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvsCXNmLjAQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by The Gifterie (@thegifterie.co)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The assistant kept texting and emailing us, asking when we were going to get there. And he wound up meeting Min on the side of the 405, not like the actual freeway —&nbsp;they exited and drove off the freeway — but they met halfway, and she handed off the gift.&nbsp; The time constraint made it one of the craziest requests. We were just like chickens with our heads cut off trying to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don&#8217;t ever want to say no to anything — we do once in a while —&nbsp;but sometimes we’re like,&nbsp; “Oh, this would be so fun.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Getting something special every time seems incredibly stressful. I only have five friends and I’m already fretting about Christmas. But you’ve turned that stress into a business.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s exciting because every single day we&#8217;re working on different things. We love answering weird requests and hard calls. We really love anything random and unique. We love figuring it all out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We&#8217;re coming up with unique ideas, whether it&#8217;s for one person or for 100 people. Because if it was just the same thing, then we would just have an automated website, and people would pick from it, and that would be that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>A website full of generic nonperishable cheese boards.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Exactly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Going back at least to <a href=\"https://www2.hawaii.edu/~barkai/HO/Trump%20Cards%20-%20The%20Elements%20of%20the%20Deal%20-%20Ch2%20of%20The%20Art%20of%20the%20Deal.pdf\">his 1987 book <em>The Art of the Deal</em></a>, where he said that dealmaking ability is determined “in the genes,” Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/07/trump-finally-just-says-that-some-immigrants-are-genetically-inferior/\">credited his own success to good genes</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/EricLevitz/status/1843305027718492550\">blamed poor peoples’ failures on bad ones</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this is possibly the first time — and at least the highest-profile moment — where he has explicitly linked his faith in genetics to his obsession with migrant criminality. While Trump has long (and falsely) maintained that immigrants are responsible for the lion’s share of American crime, he has never explained exactly what it is about the current wave of migrants that makes them so much more likely to commit violent acts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now we know the answer: that, per Trump, “[being] a murderer —&nbsp;I believe this&nbsp;— it’s in their genes.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s comments fit neatly into a broader conservative intellectual universe, unintentionally combining two disparate ideas on the right into a disturbing synthesis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right-wing intellectuals have long been fascinated by genetic determinism — a belief that people’s lot in life, including their propensity to commit crime, is set at birth. Separately, some Trump-era conservatives have declared war on the Reaganite vision of America as a nation defined by its founding ideals rather than the ethno-cultural identity of its people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s musings about genes tie these notions into a coherent whole. Immigration is an existential threat to America, per Trump, because it brings in people who are genetically incapable of assimilating into the American body politic. America is a nation determined by its people — specifically, people who have “good genes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It doesn’t take a historian to see the disturbing parallels at work here.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The right’s deep belief in genetic determinants of crime</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">American conservatism, as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/370829/trump-vance-manliness-harvey-mansfield\">I’ve argued previously</a>, sees an insistence on the idea of a fixed human nature as one of its defining traits. For some conservatives, this manifests as a notion that inequalities are natural: that the very best rise to the top due to their innate gifts, while the poor remain so due to their own failings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_Bell_Curve/xP5GAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0&amp;bsq=the%20bell%20curve\">the central theme of <em>The Bell Curve</em></a>, the infamous 1994 book on the role of intelligence in America’s social structure. Though best remembered for its infamous claim that racial inequalities likely reflect the superior intelligence of whites relative to Blacks, the book’s main focus is using research to naturalize America’s class structure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Bell Curve</em> treats intelligence as a heritable, largely genetic trait. Modern societies, the book writes, are extremely good at identifying and elevating their most genetically gifted children, producing a “cognitive elite” at the top of the social structure and an unintelligent underclass at the bottom. The underclass’ problems are primarily caused by the stupidity of its denizens —&nbsp;including, the book claims, poor communities’ high crime rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Many people tend to think of criminals as coming from the wrong side of the tracks. They are correct, insofar as that is where people of low cognitive ability disproportionately live,” authors Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like many of <em>The Bell Curve</em>’s arguments, linking criminality to genetics has remained a popular move among right-wing intellectuals even as the modern evidence base <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=e2b4763057047eb8ed358ee441f28a397b41c70a\">tells a more complicated story</a>. After Trump’s Hugh Hewitt interview, prominent right-wing commentator Richard Hanania insisted that “<a href=\"https://x.com/RichardHanania/status/1843335827788837156\">he’s right that crime is largely genetic</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Interestingly, Hanania dissented from Trump’s application of this idea to immigrants. Correctly pointing out that immigrants are <a href=\"https://www.richardhanania.com/p/conservatives-are-lying-on-immigrant\">no more prone to crime</a> than native-born Americans, Hanania concluded that immigrants as a group don’t have the “bad genes” that incline certain people toward criminality. “Trump is lying on crime, even when he tells the truth about genetics,” <a href=\"https://x.com/RichardHanania/status/1843338678304944401\">Hanania concludes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in this, he is in the right-wing minority: most share Trump’s view of immigrants as an especially criminal and essentially alien group. Indeed, this has led the modern right to take a very different view of America <em>as a country</em> than they have in the past —&nbsp;one that ties in uncomfortably well with Trump’s comments on genes and crime.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">America as a (biological) nation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In one of his <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/11/giving-thanks-freedom/\">earliest political speeches</a>, Ronald Reagan insisted that “America is less of a place than an idea.” The American idea, per Reagan, is that “deep within the heart of each one of us is something so God-like and precious that no individual or group has a right to impose his or its will upon the people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reagan is expressing the traditional conservative movement view of American national identity: that it is defined by our shared commitment to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. This kind of nationalism, which scholars term “creedal” or “civic” nationalism,” gives rise to a deep belief that anyone can be an American provided they are properly socialized into American ideals. As president, Reagan offered amnesty to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22557613/reagan-immigration-reform-amnesty-legalization-biden\">millions of undocumented migrants</a> and explicitly welcomed people crossing the Southern border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Rather than making them or talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems, make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit,” as he put it in <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/amerex_ch12.pdf\">a 1980 presidential debate</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, of course, putting up a fence is Republican orthodoxy. Gone too is Reagan’s creedal nationalism and its welcoming, idealistic spirit. Instead, the modern right is increasingly enamored by a darker vision of American nationalism: one in which the country’s identity is <a href=\"https://www.commentary.org/articles/steven-smith/the-nationalist-creed/\">defined less by its founding ideals than by blood and soil</a>. Americanness is not set by commitment to principles of liberty and equality, but rather by one’s historical and familial connections to the country. It is a more classically European way of seeing national identity, and one that’s echoed at the highest levels of the current Republican Party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“America is not just an idea. It is a group of people with a shared history and a common future. It is, in short, a nation,” Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance said during his speech at the Republican National Convention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While allowing that “it is part of that tradition, of course, that we welcome newcomers,” Vance argued that this tradition also requires strict criteria for the number and kind of newcomers who should be permitted. Immigrants may only be allowed “on our terms,” or else America will lose the sense of nationhood that he believes underpins the country’s greatness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home. And if this movement of ours is going to succeed, and if this country is going to thrive, our leaders have to remember that America is a nation, and its citizens deserve leaders who put its interests first,” Vance said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump made a similar, if more pointed, argument in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/09/24/trump_it_takes_centuries_to_build_a_culture_reckless_migration_policy_can_change_it_quickly.html\">a September campaign speech in Pennsylvania</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It takes centuries to build the unique character of each state,” the former president said. “But reckless migration policy can change it very quickly and destroy everything in its way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his recent comments about immigrants and crime, Trump shows how this new nationalism fits together with the longstanding conservative preoccupation with genetics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is not just that America is a country for a specific kind of people; it’s that the people we’re letting in are biologically incapable of becoming peaceful Americans. Creedal nationalism’s faith in assimilation is not merely misplaced, but a delusional denial of genetic reality. The only responsible conservatism, on this account, is one that understands the United States as an almost physical entity: one whose survival depends on keeping its gene pool full of desirables.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve seen versions of this nationalism before. It does not tend to end well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was adapted from the On the Right newsletter.</em>&nbsp;<em>New editions drop every Wednesday.

Many of the residents in afflicted communities have never experienced a disaster like this before and are now navigating layers of government bureaucracy to get supplies, relief money, and to begin rebuilding. It’s creating frustration and confusion, leaving the door open to <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/blog/addressing-hurricane-helene-rumors-and-scams\">misinformation and scams</a> around the relief effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene is also creating a political problem as politicians look to blame each other for hiccups in the response and residents try to figure out who to hold accountable. A lot of attention has focused on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and its role in the disaster recovery. This week, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper met with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell and military officials to <a href=\"https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/07/governor-cooper-fema-administrator-criswell-meet-military-leaders-western-north-carolina\">discuss the recovery work underway</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These dynamics are already creating a lot of pressure, and it’s poised to get even more chaotic as Hurricane Milton, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/376323/hurricane-milton-category-5-tampa-florida\">spooled up to category 5 strength this week,</a> heads toward the Florida coast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just a matter of finger-pointing; knowing whether to press local, state, or federal officials is essential to getting help to the people who need it now, and learning from past disasters can soften the devastation from future catastrophes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Collectively, governments around the world are actually getting better at disaster response. We’ve seen over the past century that, in general, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23150467/natural-disaster-climate-change-early-warning-hurricane-wildfire\">natural disasters are killing fewer people</a>. However, the destructive potential of something like a hurricane is growing now that more people are living in their paths. Asheville, North Carolina, which experienced extensive flooding after Helene, experienced <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/04/03/asheville-is-2-in-the-country-for-highest-move-in-vs-move-out-ratio/73144952007/\">a big population spike in the past decade</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as average temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, extreme events like hurricanes spool up faster into monstrous storms and dish out more rainfall and drive more storm surge into coastal areas than they would otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that there are so many variables in natural disasters and the communities they afflict, how do you gauge whether your government is doing a good job against a force of nature?&nbsp;And when things go sideways, when should you blame your mayor, your governor, or your president? I posed these questions to <a href=\"https://ccie.ucf.edu/person/claire-connolly-knox/\">Claire Connolly Knox</a>, who founded the Emergency and Crisis Management program at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. She spoke to me from her home in Florida where she was making preparations for Milton’s arrival.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given how different every disaster is, it&#8217;s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison between them. It also seems like expectations are all over the place of who should be responding to what after a disaster. What do you make of the responses to some of the recent disasters we&#8217;ve seen? I&#8217;m thinking specifically about North Carolina after Helene. What do you think is worth highlighting?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a number of things. This is going to be one for the record books. One is that it highlights that so much of the conversation focuses on disasters, hurricanes specifically, and the immediately impacted area. Everyone was really concerned about Florida and the Big Bend and Tallahassee, and rightly so, because everyone primarily looks at where the eye of the storm is going and then looking at those initial brunt forces and the impacts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think what this hurricane is teaching us is that there’s so much more to hurricanes that we sometimes forget: That&#8217;s the rain. That&#8217;s the storm surge. That is the spin-off tornadoes. Those cascading impacts we frequently do not focus on. With the Helene system going into North Carolina, the amount of rain that fell is very reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/360921/hurricane-beryl-houston-blackout-centerpoint-outage\">Hurricane Harvey</a> with the amount of devastation and the flooding that took place.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">North Carolina is a place that’s infrequently hit by hurricanes. I would expect Florida to have a lot of resources ready but maybe it’s excusable that North Carolina was caught a little bit off guard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How would you evaluate their response? Are they graded on a curve when it comes to a disaster like this? And should FEMA have seen this coming and done more?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every disaster starts and ends locally, so every disaster response starts at the local level, and it ends at the local level. A lot of people don’t realize that. They think immediately of FEMA. FEMA has the purse strings, they help pay for a lot of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the response is local. It goes to the state if locals can&#8217;t handle it. The state then does an emergency declaration to release additional funds. If it’s going to be more than they can handle, they go to their FEMA region. That then goes up to FEMA national, and then to the president for an emergency declaration or disaster declaration depending on which is needed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every state adheres to the same standards set forth by FEMA to have a comprehensive emergency management plan to train their local emergency managers to have the capacity to respond to a disaster.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Every disaster response starts at the local level, and it ends at the local level. A lot of people don’t realize that.”</p><cite>Claire Connolly Knox</cite></blockquote></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So you start local, and then if you need more resources, you go to the state, and then you go to your local FEMA administrator, then you go to the federal government for an emergency declaration. Is that typically how you escalate?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, that is in the statute of the <a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/consumer/insurance/the-stafford-act-explained.html\">Stafford Act</a>, the process that disaster assistance goes through. In addition to that more formal setup, you also have mutual aid agreements between local governments, between states. For example, when Hurricane Katrina happened, you had emergency management staff and first responders from other states poised and ready to enter the impacted area. You&#8217;ve seen that happening [in North Carolina], not only amongst the public sector, but also the private and nonprofit sectors. Emergency management is all about facilitating and being able to bring together everyone who can help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is this process necessarily reactive, or is there a way that you can be proactive?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both. However, you’re seeing more proactive responses. That&#8217;s really a big lesson learned from Hurricane Katrina. You saw <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/archive/person/w-craig-fugate\">Craig Fugate</a>, the FEMA administrator during Superstorm Sandy, preemptively set up stuff, and he actually got criticized for that, but that has now become more of the norm, trying to be as prepared and to preemptively set up resources so that they could quickly enter and reduce the amount of lives lost.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What was the criticism for being preemptive there?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea was they were setting up resources in advance, and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bushs-former-fema-head-criticizes-obamas-response-to-sandy/\">some people said that was not the role of the federal government</a>. Some said it was a waste of resources. However, on the flip side, you also had <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-katrina-anniversary/heck-job-brownie-where-disgraced-fema-head-now-n400436\">former FEMA administrator Michael Brown</a> who was heavily criticized during Hurricane Katrina for not being responsive. There are critics on both sides of the fence.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the federal government is already getting involved at the front end, then is it in charge of the disaster response at that point? Or how does the hierarchy of responsibility work?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s all local. So it’s your city, county, and your state who are the leaders when it comes to a major disaster. FEMA has to be invited in. They’re not siloed though. If you look at a local city or county, their emergency operations center has seats for all of the different sectors: communications, transportation, utilities, law enforcement, fire, health. You’re going to have someone, a representative from the federal government, either virtually or someone in the room, as well. Each of FEMA’s regions has staff that could be deployed to assist those local governments.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Trump’s FEMA lies, debunked</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of Hurricane Helene, former president Donald Trump amplified many falsehoods about the federal government&#8217;s disaster response.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Claim</strong>: The federal government isn’t helping Republican areas of western North Carolina.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reality</strong>: According to FEMA, North Carolina has received $32 million in aid, and roughly 84 percent of the $210 million in funds it doled out in its initial Hurricane Helene response went to states that backed Trump in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Claim</strong>: “Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country,” Trump said at a Thursday rally in Michigan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reality</strong>: FEMA does oversee a program that was allocated $650 million in funding for housing for migrants in fiscal year 2024. However, this funding is completely separate from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which FEMA draws from for aid during natural disasters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Claim</strong>: “They’re offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They’re offering them $750. They’ve been destroyed. These people have been destroyed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reality</strong>: FEMA does have a program – Serious Needs Assistance – that gives recipients $750 each if they qualify, but it’s one of many aid offerings that disaster victims can receive, not the only one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">—<em>Li Zhou, politics and policy reporter</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read more about Trump&#8217;s recent claims and the harm of disinformation <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/376982/trump-hurricane-helene-fema-lies-debunked\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When a disaster strikes, how do you evaluate the response? Is there a metric? How do I know what was reasonable for emergency managers to do? How do I know if they dropped the ball?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s where my research comes in. I study <a href=\"https://emilms.fema.gov/is_0552/groups/114.html\">after-action reports</a>, or things that went well and things that did not go well during a disaster. They frequently include an implementation plan, so taking those lessons learned, who is the lead to implement this lesson, if there’s any funding needed, and a timeline of when to expect that particular lesson to be implemented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, an after-action report is not required after every disaster. What I have found is that in areas that tend to be heavily destroyed — looking at Asheville, North Carolina — I would not anticipate an after-action report coming from them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a lower priority?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It tends to be. For example, after Hurricane Charlie, I reached out to local governments over in Tampa and Florida&#8217;s Gulf Coast. Their immediate response was “I’m not going to sit down and write a report. I need to be helping people.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you have a major disaster like this, FEMA does an after-action report, your state government does an after-action report. A lot of the lessons learned will be captured in those reports and those documents after the fact. That tends to be one of the ways in which you measure the effectiveness of response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve seen over time where a lot of those lessons learned that have been documented make their way into local, state, and federal policy. After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, there was the <a href=\"https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FCJEI/Programs/SLP/Documents/Full-Text/Williams.aspx\">Lewis report</a> with 94 recommendations that changed our building codes, how we do land use planning,&nbsp; emergency management. We’ve seen that happen after Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, after Harvey, Irma, Maria, etc. After all these major disasters, about a year or two later major policy changes come out.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How are we doing in disaster response in general in the US? Is it improving over time? Are we seeing any patterns? Are there places we still keep getting tripped up over and over?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I really love that you asked this question. We’re really good at identifying the lessons learned. We’re really good at saying what went well and what did not go well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, we’re not really good at implementing those lessons learned, and we’re really not good at evaluating whether we’ve actually implemented them. And usually the test is the next disaster. It tests whether we’ve actually done what we’ve said we&#8217;re going to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Who then is to blame, or who gets credit, during a disaster response? Is there somebody that we can hold accountable in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a very, very hard question to answer. I say it depends. I think a lot of people don&#8217;t realize emergency management touches on every aspect of our life and our society, and so it makes it really hard to answer that question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Making decisions during a crisis is not easy. You have incomplete information. You are trying your best to be able to make decisions very quickly, very rapidly, while dealing with misinformation or incomplete information. I think you’re asking a very important question, but it’s very hard to answer.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re also in an era where average temperatures are rising, and then many types of disasters are reaching greater extremes, and that more people are experiencing hazards that they may not have experienced before. People have pointed out that <a href=\"https://www.ashevillenc.gov/news/100-years-after-the-flood-of-1916-the-city-of-asheville-is-ready-for-the-next-one/\">North Carolina did flood like this back in 1916</a>, but it’s a completely different world now. How do you prepare for the future when that risk profile just looks so drastically different?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are lots of free resources and data and models available through FEMA, through NOAA, through the National Hurricane Center to help with planning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To cope with future disasters, we have to think more holistically. In emergency management, we teach and we practice “<a href=\"https://www.iafc.org/membership/iCHIEFS/iCHIEFS-article/a-whole-community-approach-to-all-hazards-planning\">all hazards, whole community</a>.” It is a networked approach to responding to a disaster, not just the public sector. You have the private sector and nonprofit sector that are engaged in the response efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of it is to be aware there are so many local jurisdictions that can only think about emergency management and disasters when it&#8217;s on their doorstep. For a mayor, I would have them find out if they know who their emergency manager is. Is it someone who is a police chief or fire chief who happens to wear the emergency management hat only when there&#8217;s a disaster? Unfortunately, in a lot of our small rural communities, there is not a single dedicated emergency manager. It&#8217;s someone who was also wearing two or three other hats. It would help to have a dedicated person networking, setting up mutual aid agreements, doing all those things that get activated when there&#8217;s an actual disaster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Are there any interesting case studies here worth highlighting, or aspects of a disaster response we tend to overlook?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would look at Florida’s response to Hurricane Maria. A lot of communities may prepare for a disaster themselves, but they don&#8217;t prepare a response for their neighbors getting a disaster. Being able to be a receiving community for evacuees, being able to deploy resources to your neighboring community is critical. When you look at the individuals evacuated from Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria in 2017 here in central Florida, you had these resource centers that are now known as the national standard of how do you take care of that neighboring community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s very important because, especially with climate change, we’re already seeing a shift of the population. Central Florida is the receiving community for all these coastal communities. As our coastlines change, as sea level rise increases and our vulnerability increases in these coastal zones, the interior communities need to be ready to receive them, and if they don&#8217;t do it well, that could potentially be a disaster within a disaster.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 8, 7:20 pm ET:</strong> This story, originally published October 8, has been updated to include  falsehoods about Hurricane Helene spread by former president Donald Trump.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It is certainly making aid distribution more difficult, with disaster recovery officials <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/misinformation-amid-helene-recovery-extremely-damaging-fema-official/story?id=114572760\">spending valuable time fighting lies</a>, including by <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response\">putting up an agency website</a> to combat them. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/08/fema-hurricane-milton-helene-disinformation\">Deanne Criswell,</a> the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said the degree of disinformation is at a point that [she’s] “never seen before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far, Helene is estimated to have damaged <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc\">thousands of homes and businesses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/hurricane-helene-live-updates-rcna173973\">taken more than 220 lives</a>, washing out <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/us/how-helene-devastated-western-north-carolina/index.html\">dozens of roads</a> and entire towns. FEMA, which is the government entity dedicated to disaster relief, has also said that it’s provided upward of <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual\">$210 million in aid to victims of Helene</a>, including 15.6 million meals and 13.9 million liters of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s falsehoods come as he and others on the right —<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/08/fima-disinformation-hurricane-helene-response-00182841\"> including Tesla’s Elon Musk</a> —&nbsp;are attempting to use the recent natural disaster as a political wedge in the 2024 presidential election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below are some of the lies Trump has elevated about Helene and what we know about what’s actually happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trump’s lies, debunked&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Claim:</strong> The federal government isn’t helping Republican areas of western North Carolina.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re being treated very badly in the Republican areas,” <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-georgia-governor-brian-kemp-unable-talk-biden-hurricane-helene-rcna173236\">Trump said in a Fox News</a> interview on September 30. “They’re not getting water, they’re not getting anything.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reality: </strong>FEMA administrator Criswell has <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/06/fema-deanne-criswell-criticizes-trump-hurricane-helene/75543612007/\">described these allegations as</a> “frankly ridiculous and just plain false.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Data from the agency&nbsp;shows that it distributed significant funding to states that voted for Trump in 2020, as well as those that didn’t. <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual\">Per an October 7 FEMA</a> press release, the agency greenlit $32 million in aid for households in North Carolina, $87 million for households in Florida, $57 million for households in South Carolina, and $632,000 for households in Tennessee — states that backed Trump in 2020. It’s also approved $31 million for households in Georgia, and almost $500,000 for households in Virginia, both of which voted for Biden in 2020. Roughly 84 percent of the $210 million in funds it has doled out in the Hurricane Helene response went to states that backed Trump in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republican governors in South Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee have praised the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-hurricane-response/index.html\">speed of the government’s response</a>, and regional <a href=\"https://www.wbtv.com/2024/10/07/nc-officials-working-dispel-helene-rumors-misinformation-spreads/\">North Carolina GOP lawmakers</a>, including state Sen. Kevin Corbin, have <a href=\"https://www.wbtv.com/2024/10/07/nc-officials-working-dispel-helene-rumors-misinformation-spreads/\">urged people to stop spreading misinformation</a>. Some news <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/fema-floods-north-carolina.html\">reports indicate</a> that aid to more remote, rural areas has taken longer to arrive — and that lack of accessibility and cell service has posed a challenge in getting support out to numerous places. (There isn’t evidence these delays are politically motivated, however.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Previously, NBC News reporter Garrett Haake <a href=\"https://x.com/Acyn/status/1840838655440798188\">asked the former president directly</a> about evidence he had to support this claim, and Trump did not provide any.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Claim:</strong> Kamala Harris gave FEMA funding to migrants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country,” Trump said at a Thursday rally in Michigan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reality: </strong>“This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs,” <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response\">FEMA notes</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The agency does oversee a program called the Shelter and Services program that was allocated $650 million in funding for housing for migrants in fiscal year 2024. This funding actually comes from the US Customs and Border Patrol budget, but FEMA helps oversee the program’s implementation. As such, this funding is completely separate from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which FEMA draws from for aid during natural disasters. The DRF received about $45 billion in funding between the fiscal year 2024 budget and a supplemental appropriations bill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,” FEMA states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has warned that the DRF <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/07/hurricanes-eroding-washingtons-disaster-programs-00182784\">could run out of money before the end of hurricane season</a> due to the severity of this year’s storms. House Republicans, however, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mike-johnson-wont-commit-bringing-house-back-election-hurricane-relief-rcna174174\">have balked at returning to Congress</a> to approve more funds prior to the November election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Claim: </strong>FEMA is only giving $750 to people affected by the hurricane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They’re offering them $750. They’ve been destroyed. These people have been destroyed,” Trump said during a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally this past Saturday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reality:</strong> FEMA does have a program —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ia-quick-reference_serious-needs.pdf\">Serious Needs Assistance</a> — that gives recipients $750 each if they qualify, but it’s one of many aid offerings that disaster victims can receive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ia-quick-reference_serious-needs.pdf\">barrier to qualify is low</a>, most people affected by the storm are likely eligible, and recipients are not limited to this $750 in support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Serious Needs Assistance is supposed to provide rapid relief to people who need cash to cover immediate needs like water, food, and first aid. That relief is intended to temporarily help while people wait to hear about approval for other aid programs that could provide more robust funds for larger issues like home repairs. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>This misinformation could cause real harm</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One major concern multiple FEMA officials have expressed is that Trump’s lies will undercut people’s trust in the agency and reduce their openness to applying for the aid they need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is reducing the likelihood that survivors will come to FEMA with a trusted way to register for assistance,” Keith Turi, an acting associate administrator for Response and Recovery, told reporters earlier this week. “That misinformation is directly impacting our ability to help people, and it&#8217;s unfortunate because these individuals have been through extremely traumatic times.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This worry stems from the concrete impact misinformation can have as it’s shared and regurgitated by prominent leaders. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-conspiracy-theories-rumors/\">As the Washington Post reported,</a> a rumor about a dam bursting in western North Carolina led to hundreds of people evacuating and the diversion of precious first responder resources last week. Criswell also expressed concerns that these lies could make FEMA workers’ lives more difficult in the field: <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/06/fema-director-helene-misinformation-truly-dangerous-narrative-00182624\">in one viral online post</a>, a person suggested that people should form a militia to counter the agency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/371855/trump-vance-springfield-ohio-racist-conspiracy-theories-haitian-immigrants\">misinformation about Haitian immigrants</a> in Springfield, Ohio, also made clear, the falsehoods he spreads can have damaging and immediate real-world consequences. In that case, Trump falsely suggested that Haitian immigrants were eating people’s house pets, fueling bomb threats at schools as well as property violence against people living in Springfield. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

With wind speeds pushing <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml\">180 miles per hour</a> Monday afternoon, before weakening slightly Tuesday, Milton is one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Forecasters expect Milton, which is once again a Category 5 storm as it churns in the Gulf of Mexico, to make landfall in western Florida<strong> </strong>on Wednesday night. The storm may lose steam before then as it faces disruptive winds and dry air, yet Milton is still expected to be an “extremely dangerous” hurricane upon arrival, <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/071735.shtml?\">according to</a> the National Hurricane Center. Storm surge in the densely populated Tampa Bay, which could see a direct hit, could reach <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml\">15 feet</a>, the Center said in an advisory Monday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Milton is not the typical Atlantic hurricane, according to <a href=\"https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/jonathan-lin\">Jonathan Lin</a>, an atmospheric scientist at Cornell University. “It is exceedingly rare for a hurricane to form in the western Gulf, track eastward, and make landfall on the Western coast of Florida,” he said in an email Monday. “There are not really any hurricanes on record that have done this and made landfall at a Category 3+ status.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s even more unusual is how quickly the storm intensified, defying forecasts and gaining more than 100 miles per hour in wind speed between Sunday morning and early Monday afternoon. Milton had “some of the most explosive intensification this forecaster has ever witnessed!” a National Weather Service forecaster <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSAtlanta/status/1843324138230014357\">wrote on X Monday</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why Milton intensified so quickly</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The simplest explanation is unusually warm ocean water.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take a look at the chart below. It’s showing ocean heat in the Gulf of Mexico, which is near a record high. The red line is 2024 and the blue line is the average over the last decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And heat is a key ingredient in rapid intensification, according to <a href=\"https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/\">Brian McNoldy</a>, a climatologist at the University of Miami, who made the chart below. Put simply, hotter water evaporates more readily, and rising columns of warm, moist air from that evaporation fuel rapid intensification.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/ohc_gulf-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.589156124409,100,74.821687751182\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A chart of ocean heat content in the Gulf of Mexico | Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/products.html&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/products.html&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not entirely clear what has caused the Gulf to warm, though scientists suspect a combination of factors, including climate change — which raises the baseline ocean temperature — as well as lingering effects of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23738846/el-nino-2023-weather-heat-wave-climate-change-disaster-flood-rain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">El Niño</a>, natural climate variability, and perhaps even a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/tonga-volcano-eruption-raises-imminent-risk-of-temporary-1-5c-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">volcanic eruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another key to Milton’s explosive growth is a lack of wind shear in its path, according to <a href=\"https://people.miami.edu/profile/be7abbba52c947423b8133238c7e7b68\">Benjamin Kirtman</a>, director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine &amp; Atmospheric Studies, a joint initiative of the University of Miami and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Wind shear describes the change of wind speed and direction —&nbsp;basically, chaotic air —&nbsp;and it can disrupt hurricanes. The storm is expected to encounter more shear as it approaches Florida, which will blunt its strength and make it likely to weaken before landfall.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, McNoldy said, is that Milton is also relatively small in width. As of Monday, Hurricane-force winds extended only about <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml\">30 miles</a> from the storm center. Small hurricanes are “generally more prone to ups and downs,” he told Vox, because they’re influenced more easily by weather phenomena.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although Milton is set to grow in size before it reaches Florida (in part, through a complex process of <a href=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane_blog/paper-on-the-unusual-eyewall-replacement-cycles-in-hurricane-irma-released-online-in-monthly-weather-review/#:~:text=As%20a%20hurricane%20grows%20older,eyewall%20replacement%20cycle%20(ERC).\">eyewall replacement</a>), it likely won’t be huge when it makes landfall &nbsp;—&nbsp;again, speaking in terms of diameter. “That is all-around good news,” he said. Smaller storms tend to produce less surge, which describes a rise in sea level. Compared to Hurricane Helene, which was an enormous system, for example, forecasters expect Milton to produce less storm surge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t mean experts like McNoldy, a Florida resident, aren’t worried. As of Monday, Milton appears to be headed straight for the Tampa Bay area, the most densely populated region of the state’s west coast. This is the same region where a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-storm-surge-0284042dade78e04e453ad821e6e15c3\">dozen people</a> were killed by Hurricane Helene in recent days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is a very ominous forecast,” McNoldy said. “It will still be an extremely strong hurricane.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 8, 5:50 pm ET:</strong> This story was originally published on October 7 and has been updated with new information about Hurricane Milton’s forecast.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Americans will be casting their votes in a historic presidential race, as well as a slew of other federal, state, and local offices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before Americans cast their ballot, there are a few bits of practical information they should have on hand:<strong> </strong>They’ll want to make sure they’re registered to vote, know where their polling place is, and what forms of identification to bring with them (if any). Here’s what you should know about voting in this election.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are you registered to vote?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You must be registered to vote before stepping into the voting booth. (<a href=\"https://vote.gov/register/nd/\">Except in North Dakota</a>, which does not have voter registration.) Some states, like California, Washington, Michigan, and Maine, allow <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\">same-day registration</a> at the polls on Election Day. Other states require <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/\">voters to register</a> anywhere from 10 days (Massachusetts) to 30 days (Alaska, Arkansas, Mississippi, Ohio) ahead of the election. The <a href=\"https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/state-elections/state-election-dates-deadlines.htm\">US Vote Foundation</a> has a tool that lists election deadlines, including for voter registration, by state. Depending on where you live, you can register online, in person at a local election office, or by mail. Vote.gov has state-by-state resources on <a href=\"https://vote.gov/\">how to register to vote</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote\">In order to register to vote</a>, you must be a US citizen, at least 18 years old by Election Day, and meet your state’s eligibility requirements. In some states, people <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/voting/file/1507306/downloadhttps://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-01/voting_with_a_criminal_conviction_7.6.23.pdf\">currently incarcerated or convicted for a felony</a> do not have the right to vote. The <a href=\"https://www.usvotefoundation.org/state-voter-information\"><strong>US Vote Foundation</strong></a> has an online tool that lists voter requirements and registration options for each state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you can’t remember whether you’re registered to vote, <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/\">you can check online</a>. For people who moved, or changed their name or party affiliation, since the last election, you’ll need to <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/change-voter-registration\">update your voter registration</a>. You can change this information online via your state’s online voter registration website, by mail, by phone, or in person the same way you would to register. If you moved to another state, you will need to re-register in your new state.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Do you know how you’ll cast your vote?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How much flexibility you have about when and where you vote depends on where you live. Voters can cast their ballots in person on Election Day, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx\">in person during early voting</a>, or by mail (also referred to as voting absentee). Some states — like California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-1-states-with-no-excuse-absentee-voting.aspx\">do not require voters to list a reason to vote by mail</a>. Voters in states like Alabama and Kentucky <a href=\"https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/issues/requesting-mail-ballots\">must give a reason to vote by mail</a>, like being too sick to vote or not being in the country. Be aware of both the deadlines for requesting a mail ballot and for postmarking it in order to be counted; you can find both dates by selecting your state on the <a href=\"https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/state-elections/state-election-dates-deadlines.htm\">US Vote Foundation’s tool</a>. Either mail your ballot in via USPS, drop it off at an election office, or locate a dropbox (each county will list the locations of its ballot drop boxes online).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you are traveling or have to work a long shift on Election Day, you may want to vote early in person. <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/\">Early voting windows</a> vary from state to state (and even county to county) and can begin as early as 45 days before the election&nbsp; like in <a href=\"https://sos.vermont.gov/elections/voters/early-absentee-voting/\">Vermont</a>). Check to see your <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx\">state’s rules for early in-person voting</a> and where you can cast your vote before Election Day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For in-person voting on Election Day, you can find your polling place on your state’s board of elections website, which you can <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/\">find on Vote.org</a>. All you’ll need is to enter your name and/or address. Most states have laws allowing employees to take time off to vote, but <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/taking-time-off-voting-jury-29708.html\">specifics vary from state to state</a>. For example, workers in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Wisconsin are not paid for time off to vote. Other states, including Idaho, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, and Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/us-states-where-employers-have-to-give-you-paid-time-off-to-vote.html\">do not have laws granting employees time off to vote</a>. Workers in states like Maryland and Oklahoma <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/taking-time-off-voting-jury-29708.html\">must show their employers proof</a> that they voted or attempted to vote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A final method of voting is via a <a href=\"https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/provisional-ballots\">provisional ballot</a>. This occurs when a voter’s name is not on the voter roll but the person believes they are registered. They can cast their vote on a provisional ballot that won’t be counted until the registration status of the person is confirmed after the polls close. <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/provisional-ballots.aspx#how\">Local election officials will verify the voter’s identity</a> and the voter may have to confirm their address or other information. The <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/provisional-ballots#how\">main reasons provisional ballots are rejected</a> are when the voter is not registered in the state they are trying to vote in, or they are in the wrong jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Do you know who’s on the ballot?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Top billing for this election is voting for president. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/367990/kamala-harris-policy-positions-issues-guide\">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> is the Democratic candidate, and former President <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/368004/donald-trump-policy-positions-issues-guide\">Donald Trump</a> is the Republican nominee. You may also be voting for governor, Senate, and House of Representatives, as well as lieutenant governor, state attorney general, secretary of state, state legislators, judges, mayor, district attorney, city council, and ballot measures. You can look up a sample ballot on <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Sample_Ballot_Lookup&amp;Source=sidebar\">Ballotpedia</a> to find out which candidates are running for which seats in your district. Ballotpedia also explains the wording and interpretation of ballot measures, which can be difficult to parse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To find out where these candidates stand on important issues, you can check their campaign websites, read local news coverage, and tune in to debates.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to expect on Election Day</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before you show up to your polling place, double check the <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_(2024)\">hours the site opens and closes.</a> While it differs by state (and even by county), most polling stations open between 6 and 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm local time. Remember, if you are still in line when the polls close, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">you are allowed to vote, so don’t leave</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once inside, you’ll check in with a poll worker who will find your name on the list of registered voters. If the poll worker says they <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">can’t find your name</a>, ask if they can check a statewide list or help you make sure you’re at the correct polling place. If they still can’t find your name, ask for a provisional ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some states require voters to <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id\">show identification prior to voting</a> — like Indiana and Wisconsin — or ask that first-time voters show ID. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists the <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx\">voter ID laws for each state</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The poll worker will then show you to the <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Voting_methods_and_equipment_by_state\">voting machine or where you’ll fill out a paper ballot</a> and tell you how to cast your vote. <a href=\"https://allvotingislocal.org/poll-worker-faq/\">Poll workers are available to answer any questions</a> you may have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">Voters with disabilities</a> can ask for a chair to sit in, a quiet place to wait for their turn to vote, and to use a voting machine that assists those with vision and mobility disabilities — every polling place must have at least one. Voters with disabilities and who have trouble reading and writing English can also bring a family member or friend to offer assistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If anyone questions you about your citizenship, your criminal history, your ethnicity, your race, the language you speak, or your education level, that’s voter intimidation — and it’s illegal. <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Intimidation_of_voters\">Other examples of voter intimidation </a>include violent behavior inside and outside the polling place, blocking the entrance of a polling place, displaying weapons, threats of violence, and spreading false information of voter fraud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_pdf_file/kyr-voterintimidation-v03.pdf\">According to the ACLU</a>, “if your qualifications are challenged, you can give a sworn statement that you satisfy the qualifications to vote in your state, and then proceed to cast a regular ballot.”<br><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">Report an instance of voter intimidation</a>, whether you yourself experienced it or you witnessed it, to your local election officials and the Election Protection Hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE or 1-888-VE-Y-VOTA (en Español).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, October 8, 3:05 pm: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on September 20, 2022, and has been updated to include new information regarding the 2024 election season.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Court’s landmark Second Amendment decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf\"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a> (2022) requires courts to strike down any gun law that is not “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation,” a test so confusing that more than a dozen judges have published judicial opinions <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen\">begging the justices to explain what, exactly, <em>Bruen </em>means</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, while this Court’s approach to guns is frequently hostile to gun laws, a majority of the justices appeared to meet a gun regulation on Tuesday they are actually willing to uphold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tuesday morning’s oral argument in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/garland-v-vanderstok-2/\"><em>Garland v. VanDerStok</em></a> involves “ghost guns,” ready-to-assemble kits that can easily be used to build a fully operational firearm. These kits appear to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/372162/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok\">exist to evade two federal laws</a>, one of which requires guns to have serial numbers that can be used to track them if they are used in a crime, and the other which requires gun buyers to receive a background check before they can make that purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921\">federal law</a>, the background check and serial number requirements apply to “any weapon &#8230; which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.” They also apply to “the frame or receiver of any such weapon,” the skeletal part of a gun that houses other components, such as the barrel or firing mechanism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ghost gun kits seek to evade this law by selling a kit with an incomplete frame or receiver, though it is often <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/372162/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok\">trivially easy to convert this incomplete part into a fully operational one</a>. Some kits can be turned into a working gun after the buyer drills a single hole in the frame or receiver. Others require the user to sand off a single plastic rail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment\">most right-wing appeals court in the federal system</a>, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, concluded that a single missing hole is enough to exempt a gun from regulation. Frames missing a hole, that court claimed, are “not yet frames or receivers.” The Fifth Circuit also argued that ghost gun kits cannot “readily be converted” into a working gun because this phrase “cannot be read to include any objects that could, if manufacture is completed, become functional at some ill-defined point in the future” — even though some ghost gun kits can be converted into a firearm in a matter of minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, at least five members of the Court — and possibly one or two more — appeared to reject the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning on Tuesday. All three members of the Court’s Democratic minority seemed like clear votes for the government, which is arguing ghost guns need to be subject to the same rules as any other gun, as did Chief Justice John Roberts, who barely spoke during Tuesday’s argument, and who spent the bulk of his question time seeming to mock Peter Patterson, the lawyer for the ghost gun manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, seemed particularly unconvinced by Patterson’s arguments, at one point telling him that a key part of his proposed legal framework “seems a little made up.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If these five justices hang together against ghost guns, that won’t be a particularly unexpected plot twist. This same case already reached the Court in 2023 on the justices’ “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other issues that the Court deals with on an expedited basis. The first time <em>VanDerStok</em> reached the Court, it voted 5-4 (with Roberts and Barrett joining the Democrats) to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/8/8/23824635/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok-amy-coney-barrett-shadow-docket\">temporarily leave in place a federal rule</a> establishing that ghost guns are regulated like any other firearm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the question is whether that temporary decision will be made permanent. After Tuesday, it appears likely that it will.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>VanDerStok</em> turns on Barrett’s definition of an “omelet”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tuesday’s argument started to go off the rails for the ghost gun makers before Patterson even stepped up to the podium.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Early in the argument, while Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar was making the government’s case, Justice Samuel Alito asked her a series of hypotheticals about incomplete objects. Is a pen and a blank pad of paper a “grocery list?” Does a bunch of uncooked eggs, ham, and peppers constitute an “omelet?” Alito’s point appeared to be that, just like untouched ingredients don’t constitute an “omelet,” an incomplete firearm is not a gun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Barrett seemed unconvinced. Almost immediately after Alito finished grilling Prelogar, Barrett asked about a slightly different hypothetical. What if someone purchased an omelet kit from <a href=\"https://www.hellofresh.com/\">Hello Fresh</a>, a service that delivers ready-to-cook meal kits to people’s homes. Barrett’s point was pretty clear: While a bunch of uncooked ingredients may not always constitute an “omelet,” the answer is different when someone buys a kit whose sole purpose is to be put together into an omelet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same rule, Barrett suggested, should apply to ghost gun kits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roberts, meanwhile, was more direct than Barrett. “What is the purpose of selling a receiver without the holes drilled in it?” the Chief Justice asked Patterson. In response, Patterson claimed, somewhat implausibly, that people may buy a ghost gun kit because they enjoy the experience of building a gun much like some hobbyists enjoy working on their own car.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Roberts didn’t buy this argument at all. “Drilling a hole or two,” he dryly responded to Patterson, “I would think doesn’t give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekend.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later in the argument, after Prelogar was back at the podium, she stuck the knife in Patterson’s argument. Federal law, she noted, doesn’t ban ghost gun kits, it merely requires ghost gun sellers to follow the same background check and serial number laws as any other gun seller. So, if there were a market for law-abiding hobbyists who want to drill a couple holes before they fire their gun, those hobbyists could still get a ghost gun if they submitted to a background check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what actually happened is, once the government issued a rule stating that ghost guns are subject to the same laws as any other gun, the market for this product dried up. Turns out, hobbyists weren’t interested in buying almost-complete guns with missing holes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest wild card in the case is Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who revealed that he voted in favor of ghost guns in 2023 because he was concerned that a gun seller who was ignorant of the law might accidentally sell an unregulated kit without realizing it was illegal to do so and then be charged with a crime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, as Prelogar told Kavanaugh, a gun seller can only be charged with a crime if they “willfully” sell a gun without a serial number or if they knowingly sell a gun without a background check. So Kavanaugh’s fears appear unfounded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Will that be enough to bring Kavanaugh into the government’s camp? Unclear. But, ultimately, Kavanaugh is likely to be the sixth vote against ghost guns if he does flip. After Tuesday, it does seem like there are five solid votes for the proposition that ghost guns are subject to the same laws as any other firearm.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

By <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(21)00474-7\">some estimates</a>, the live area of coral globally has declined by half since the 1950s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the situation would almost certainly be worse if it weren’t for parrotfish.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-9130.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-1443.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">A stoplight (left) and queen (right) parrotfish on a coral reef in Bonaire. There are dozens of parrotfish species worldwide.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Parrotfish are essentially janitors who are very good at their jobs. While cruising around the reef, these animals — which live in oceans&nbsp;all over the world — scrape colonies of bacteria and algae off rocks using their beaks. If left unchecked, that algae can grow out of control, smothering reefs and preventing new corals from growing. And that makes it hard for reefs to recover after a bout of, say, extreme ocean warming kills off a bunch of coral.&nbsp;So where you find hungry parrotfish, coral has more room to grow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem is that, on many reefs, the number of parrotfish — and especially large ones in the Caribbean — has plummeted. Other algae grazers like sea urchins, meanwhile, have vanished, too. Some scientists say that’s why Caribbean reefs have failed to recover following climate-related impacts like bleaching and superstorms; there’s simply too much algae for coral to regrow.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-4893.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A small queen parrotfish cruises over the crest of a reef in Bonaire.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the flip side, these dynamics offer a bit of hope for an ecosystem that seems all but doomed: By protecting parrotfish, alongside efforts to rein in climate-warming emissions, countries might have a better shot at saving reefs.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reefs are turning green</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s one thing people know about coral reefs it’s that they’re colorful — an intricate mosaic of blues, reds, pinks, and oranges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But more and more, just one color is starting to dominate: green.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-4727-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Dead and dying coral covered with algae.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In step with the decline of coral is the rise of algae, or seaweed. When corals die, this green, plant-like organism grows quickly on top of their skeletons. And as it spreads, that seaweed can prevent corals from regrowing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Baby corals, which start their lives swimming in the ocean, need a bit of bare rock to grow on and harden into adults. When the seafloor is covered in algae, larval coral has nowhere to develop. Seaweed can also release chemicals that harm coral and, when it grows abundantly, shade out reefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The biggest enemy of corals is really seaweed,” said <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/contributors/nancy-knowlton\">Nancy Knowlton</a>, a marine scientist and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Citizens-Sea-Wondrous-Creatures-Census/dp/1426206437?ref_=ast_author_mpb\">author</a>, formerly with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. “It goes without saying that reefs will recover better if they don&#8217;t have to deal with lots of seaweed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://gcrmn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GCRMN_Souter_et_al_2021_Status_of_Coral_Reefs_of_the_World_2020_V1.pdf\">Research shows</a> that in the last 50 years or so, algae has proliferated in coral reefs worldwide, and especially in the Caribbean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Algae thrives on human waste, such as sewage, and runoff from farmland. This water pollution is full of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that algae need to grow. So as it runs into the ocean, algae booms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, one of the most voracious algae-eaters, the long-spined black sea urchin, began dying in the Caribbean in the 1980s, likely from a waterborne pathogen. Caribbean reefs lost, on average, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/marine/8/1/annurev-marine-122414-033857.pdf?expires=1727879230&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=2DB6DBB6E4DADFC68FD0EF5871149AC4\">more than 90 percent</a> of their urchins in a matter of weeks, and those populations have yet to recover.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-1433.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"A parrotfish with its mouth against a rock.\" title=\"A parrotfish with its mouth against a rock.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Parrotfish teeth are fused together and form a beak-like mouth. It’s the perfect structure to allow them to scape bacteria and algae off of rocks. \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the important job of constricting algae — of giving corals a better shot at growing and recovering from die-offs — has fallen to certain vegetarian fish, including the parrotfish. In some parts of the Caribbean, parrotfish may be the only thing standing between a relatively healthy reef and one shrouded in green noxious gunk.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Parrotfish to the rescue</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The life of a parrotfish mostly consists of munching on rocks and dead corals, grinding it into sand, and releasing it through their rear ends. Some of the world’s beaches are <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sand.html#:~:text=The%20famous%20white%2Dsand%20beaches,then%20excrete%20it%20as%20sand.\">largely made of parrotfish poop</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not totally clear what parrotfish are actually eating. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-023-02404-5\">Research suggests</a> that their main source of food is colonies of bacteria including cyanobacteria and other microbes that live on rock surfaces, often alongside more visible clumps of seaweed. Parrotfish likely don’t seek out the seaweed itself — the stuff known to be harmful to coral growth and recovery. But when they’re grazing on microbes, they still end up removing it from rock surfaces, according to Andrew Shantz, who studies parrotfish at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-1499.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An adult queen parrotfish.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Irrespective of what they&#8217;re targeting, they end up removing algae from the reef,” Shantz told Vox. “That gives room for corals to come in and settle or grow and occupy that space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s kind of like how you might weed a garden before planting seeds to give your seedings room to develop.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was produced in collaboration with the Pulitzer Center</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the third story in an ongoing series on the future of coral reefs as they face threats from climate change and disease. It was supported by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bandfdn.org/about/\">BAND Foundation</a>&nbsp;and a grant from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/\">Pulitzer Center</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read the first two stories here:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/366763/bonaire-coral-reef-caribbean-climate-change\">This coral reef has given scientists hope for years.

Can human medicine save them?</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11833\">number</a> of <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecm.1403\">studies</a> have shown that when you exclude large fish including parrotfish from a reef, it gets covered in more algae, and that appears to limit the growth of some corals. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278014153_Experiment_mimics_fishing_on_parrotfish_Insights_on_coral_reef_recovery_and_alternative_attractors\">One study</a> in Belize, for example, documented less algae and more baby corals when large parrotfish were around. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14160\">2017 study</a> in <em>Nature Communications </em>linked parrotfish to reef growth in Panama by examining historical records of fish teeth and coral fragments. The study relied on reef sediment cores: tubes of material extracted from the seafloor that contain layers of coral, sea shells, and animal remains. Those cores allowed researchers to see how fast the reef was growing and —&nbsp;by looking at the number and shape of teeth — how many parrotfish were on the reef.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-4752.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Danielle de Kool, an ecologist for an environmental group in Bonaire, surveys the reef.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Studies like this support the simple idea that parrotfish help coral reefs, yet the relationship between fish and coral is complex and somewhat controversial in marine biology. Smaller parrotfish, for example, don’t seem to limit the amount of seaweed, even if there are a lot of them. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justin-Rizzari/publication/281378099_The_parrotfish-coral_relationship_refuting_the_ubiquity_of_a_prevailing_paradigm/links/603efe7c299bf1e078512fd2/The-parrotfish-coral-relationship-refuting-the-ubiquity-of-a-prevailing-paradigm.pdf\">Some studies</a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-015-2728-3\"> have also</a> failed to find links between fishing restrictions — which typically lead to <em>more</em> parrotfish — and the amount of algae and live coral. Parrotfish also snack on live coral to an extent, though scientists don’t suspect this causes much damage to reefs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The effect of parrotfish on reef dynamics is not always clear,” said Joshua Manning, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies parrotfish. “It’s still safe to say that parrotfish are good for the reef.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What a reef full of parrotfish looks like</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People have been eating parrotfish for centuries in the tropics, and it’s <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e52092a6-3ced-40cb-b965-48e0993f4cdc/content\">still common today</a> in many coastal communities throughout the world. (They taste like sweet shellfish, according to a quick Google search). While global population data is sparse, it’s clear that overfishing has caused parrotfish —&nbsp;and especially large parrotfish, which are favored by fishermen —&nbsp;to decline in some of these regions, like <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/fish/despair-repair-protecting-parrotfish-can-help-bring-back-caribbean-coral-reefs\">Jamaica</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-022-02315-x\">Micronesia</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These declines have almost certainly contributed to the rise of algae.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are also places that have protected parrotfish for decades, where these animals are still abundant and apparently doing their job well. The Dutch island of Bonaire, for example, has banned spearfishing — a common method for catching parrotfish —&nbsp;since the early 1970s. The island, which is just east of Curacao in the south Caribbean, also outlawed the harvest of parrotfish altogether in 2010. While some of Bonaire’s large parrotfish have still declined, it has at least double the number of parrotfish compared to most other Caribbean reefs, <a href=\"https://www.dcnanature.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BioNews-StatusOfTheReefs.pdf\">according to</a> a 2018 report by the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance, a nonprofit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-0951.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-7235.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Scenes underwater in Bonaire, home to what some scientists consider the healthiest coral reef in the Caribbean.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All those parrotfish help limit the growth of algae on Bonaire’s reef, according to <a href=\"https://umaine.edu/marine/people/robert-steneck/\">Robert Steneck</a>, professor emeritus at the University of Maine, who’s been studying Bonaire’s reef for more than 20 years. That in turn has helped the coral here survive, he said. Indeed, while much of the Caribbean’s coral has died off in recent decades from bleaching and disease, the reef in Bonaire is still intact; parts of it are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/366763/bonaire-coral-reef-caribbean-climate-change\">still thriving</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, Bonaire’s reef has been able to bounce back from large-scale die-offs in the past, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00265/full\">according to</a> Steneck’s research. Parrotfish essentially make this ecosystem more resilient, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reality is more complicated. There are a number of reasons, beyond the abundance of parrotfish, why Bonaire’s reef is healthier than other parts of the Caribbean. The island lies below the path of most Atlantic hurricanes, for example.&nbsp;Bonaire’s coral is also not nearly as healthy as it once was. Bleaching has been harming the reef for years. And in the spring of 2023, a wildlife disease <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/368728/disease-coral-reefs-caribbean-bonaire-solution\">started sweeping through</a> and killing off hundreds of corals, some of which were centuries old. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Against these mounting threats, parrotfish can do very little. When coral die-offs are unrelenting and pollution continues to flow into the ocean, reefs get overcome by seaweed. Once that happens, parrotfish can’t do much to bring them back to life, Manning said. “At some point, with the intensity and frequency of these disturbances, the parrotfish grazing is not going to be able to keep pace,” he said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-5771.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The author, Benji Jones, swims over a field of staghorn coral in Bonaire.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, reefs are still better off with more of them. Saving coral reefs depends, above all, on policies and corporate efforts to slash carbon emissions, but that doesn’t mean effective fishing regulations don’t also help.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What parrotfish reveal is that individual components of an ecosystem matter.  Take one piece out and the system starts to fail. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We need to protect them, even if only to give reefs a chance,” Manning said. “As long as we have parrotfish, we might have a chance at least prolonging the potential for reefs to come back.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Forest Service-managed portions of the Appalachian Trail that were damaged by Hurricane Helene will likely be repaired by temporary workers. (Hikers are currently advised to stay off over <a href=\"https://appalachiantrail.org/news/hurricane-helenes-impacts-on-the-appalachian-trail-and-nearby-communities/\">800</a> miles of the Appalachian Trail.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Next summer, however, most of these tasks will be performed by other staff — or not done at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Due to a looming budget cut, the agency will not be hiring seasonal staff for the next fiscal year, leaving thousands of people out of work and putting essential conservation and biodiversity work at risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/09/25/congress-passes-funding-bill-avoids-government-shutdown/\">spending bill recently passed</a> by the House <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/september-2024-chiefs-all-employee-call-hiring-update\">gave the agency</a><strong> </strong>around half a billion dollars less than it requested, meaning that the Forest Service, within the Department of Agriculture, faces a large budget cut. Most other environmental and science-based federal agencies also face large cuts. Meanwhile, the money the agency received from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change\">the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, the Biden administration’s signature climate law, has already been spent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this, combined with recent cost-of-living increases for staff, means the agency is feeling strapped for cash. The next year “will not likely be a very robust budget environment,” said Forest Service Budget Director Mark Lichtenstein during <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/september-2024-chiefs-all-employee-call-hiring-update\">an all-staff call in mid-September</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This decision does not apply to the more than 11,000 temporary firefighting positions that the Forest Service hires every year. An agency spokesperson said the Forest Service hired more than 2,500 non-fire temporary employees in fiscal year 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the all-staff call, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore acknowledged that the agency will be forced to struggle without its seasonal workforce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I know that this decision will affect your ability to get some of the critical work done,” he said. “It’ll also be felt deeply by managers and units all across the agency.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the days before the call, news of the hiring freeze spread rapidly through the ranks of temporary seasonal employees. Some heard about it directly from their supervisors. Others found out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/1ffgayw/r6_temp_and_pse_fy25_info/\">on Reddit</a>, where a letter announcing the hiring freeze from the Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest region had been posted. Temporary workers who feared for their futures filled the comment sections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I was really banking on (seasonal work next summer),” said one temporary employee in an interview, asking that her name not be used, since she is still employed by the agency. “I was also banking on seasonal winter Forest Service positions to get me through the off season, and all of a sudden, all of that was completely nixed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Temporary employees often face this sort of precarity, piecing together work for the winter when they lose their jobs and health care benefits and then returning to seasonal work for the summer. In many cases, they depend on the agency not only for paychecks, but for housing, living in buildings owned or subsidized by the Forest Service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The budget cut’s impact on hiring extends beyond seasonal workers. The agency also announced that, with very few exceptions, it won’t be hiring external candidates for any position within the agency, meaning that open positions will have to be filled by current employees. And since seasonal work is a common stepping stone to a permanent role, many temporary workers who hoped for a career in public land management now find themselves at a loss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">News of the hiring freeze left longtime seasonal and permanent workers shocked and angry. In a recording of a mid-September staff meeting shared by an employee and reviewed by Vox and High Country News<em>,</em> staff at the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southern Washington stressed the importance of seasonal labor. One man, who identified himself as Trevor, said his “entire program” relies on a “large seasonal crew” and wondered how he would be able to do his job in the future. Another employee referenced years of insufficient funding from Congress that have diminished agency morale. She added the loss of temporary workers would have “agency-wide” negative impacts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We cannot operate without our seasonal staff,” she said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/52941146468_954f2c0ba4_k.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723395278369,100,78.553209443262\" alt=\"A worker uses a drip canister to light a controlled fire on a hillside surrounded by trees.\" title=\"A worker uses a drip canister to light a controlled fire on a hillside surrounded by trees.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An employee uses a drip canister to light a prescribed fire. Seasonal workers take on important reforestation and wildfire risk mitigation efforts conducted by the US Forest Service.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Seasonal workers symbolize the backbone of the </strong>Forest Service’s labor force</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They might be “temporary” in name, but the Forest Service’s seasonal employees are a vital source of institutional and local ecological knowledge for the agency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many return season after season, often to the same forests, despite the low pay — often around $15/hour for an entry-level position. Several workers interviewed for this story said they stay on in hopes of snagging a permanent role. These workers are especially vital for field operations, said Jamie Tommins, who worked for several years as a trails and wilderness lead for offices in Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Washington.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It takes most people many years of seasonal work to land a permanent job, and those higher-grade seasonals are where you find all the most knowledgeable field workers,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Permanent employees may be as highly trained, probably from being seasonals themselves first,” Tommins said, “but they’re usually busy under their own administrative load and aren’t always available to get out in the field or train the newer folks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From building and maintaining trails to planting trees and removing dangerously flammable invasive species like cheatgrass, seasonal employees shoulder much of the work of maintaining the national forests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I just can’t fathom all the skill and know-how the Forest Service is about to lose,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practice, temporary employees often wind up doing work far above their pay grade. James Bardo, a biological science technician who works with plants, said this summer in Oregon’s Fremont-Winema National Forest, due to understaffing, he found himself doing rare plant work that would be better suited to an agency botanist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’d never been to southern Oregon,” he said. “I never worked in southern Oregon or anywhere near there. And I was the authority for taxonomy there, and it was just like, I really shouldn&#8217;t be.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bardo worries what cutbacks to the agency’s already paper-thin workforce will mean for important ecological work like preserving threatened species.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It can be problematic when you&#8217;re going to be working in the forest, cutting down trees,” he said. “Do you know that this rare plant species is actually there? Or is it easily confused with something else? … It&#8217;s very concerning as a conservation botanist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Next summer, this loss of expertise will be felt in countless ways. During the all-staff call, Moore said the agency would scale back services rather than demand more of its reduced workforce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We just can’t get the same amount of work done with fewer employees,” he said. “So, in other words, we’re going to do what we can with what we have. We’re not going to try to do everything that’s expected of us with less people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are some tasks that can’t be set aside easily. A temporary employee, who asked that her name not be used, works in the visitor center at the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. She described basic chores like emptying trash, weed whacking around buildings to reduce fire risk, and directing overflow parking at the popular site. All these tasks, if left undone, could cause chaos next summer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She estimates two permanent employees will be left to do the work of five people, once the seasonal positions are cut. She imagined the possible consequences: locked gates and closed recreation access, and trails or camping sites left inaccessible. She called it a “disservice to the public” as well as to the employees who will have to deal with the fallout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You always get people coming in complaining about things,” she said, “but if we’re shutting things down, and there’s trash everywhere, that&#8217;s just going to increase, and it’s very unfair to the workforce that will remain.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/31265633634_abfe7d82f9_k.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723395278369,100,78.553209443262\" alt=\"A woman in a US Forest Service shirt and hat with a large blue hiking backpack on her back writes on a small notebook attached to a trailhead sign in a forest. \" title=\"A woman in a US Forest Service shirt and hat with a large blue hiking backpack on her back writes on a small notebook attached to a trailhead sign in a forest. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An employee signs a logbook at a popular wilderness trailhead in Mount Baker Snoqulamie National Forest. | US Forest Service via Flickr\" data-portal-copyright=\"US Forest Service via Flickr\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Important work will grind to a halt</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, the Forest Service has attempted to reduce its reliance on seasonal employees, converting approximately 1,400 temporary workers to permanent status. But even those newly permanent employees will feel the budget cutbacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of these new positions are known as “permanent seasonal” roles. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.jamietommins.com/p/seasonal-depression\">Substack</a> post about the agency’s hiring woes, Tommins compared the job to that of a public school teacher: “a permanent employee with a long” break, although that break is during the winter, not the summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In normal years, employees can extend their terms, adding hours or taking on new work for some extra money. But in its announcement of the hiring freeze, the Forest Service made it clear that permanent seasonal workers will not be able to extend their terms in the coming fiscal year. Meanwhile, many promised promotions are on hold, and some external hiring offers will have to be rescinded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scott Schell, the executive director at the Northwest Avalanche Center, worries what the cutbacks will mean for his organization, a public-private partnership that works with the Forest Service to provide weather and avalanche data in Oregon and Washington. In addition to vital avalanche data for backcountry skiers and ski resorts, the NWAC also contributes to climate research and weather forecasts for Interstate 90, one of the nation’s major transcontinental highways, which crosses the Cascade Mountains in Washington.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schell said his office had received an allowance from the federal government to bring on a handful of seasonal employees to do avalanche forecasting, but fewer than in years past.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re basically going through a kind of triaging matrix,” he said. “There is no way we can do the work we did last year.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Based in Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, Moo Deng is often seen playfully biting her zookeeper with an exasperated expression, spawning hundreds of memes and a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/09/30/the-backlash-to-the-snl-chappell-roanmoo-deng-skit-explained/\"><em>Saturday Night Live</em> segment</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Viral videos show Moo Deng biting her zookeepers, but that’s nothing new for the global sensation <a href=\"https://t.co/e8pALAoyZg\">https://t.co/e8pALAoyZg</a></p>&mdash; USA TODAY (@USATODAY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/1841693427286589529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pesto, meanwhile, is a fluffy king penguin chick who’s risen to fame for just how large he is. He lives at the Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium in Australia and is already twice his parents’ size despite only being 9 months old. He’s been the subject of numerous social media posts and developed a dedicated fan <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pesto-the-penguin-meet-australias-nearly-50-pound-baby-penguin-capturing-hearts-worldwide-with-its-hefty-fluff/#:~:text=Videos%20the%20aquarium%20has%20posted,to%20one%20of%20Perry's%20songs.\">following of millions</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Move over Moo Deng — Pesto is the fat penguin stealing hearts: ‘Chonky king’ <a href=\"https://t.co/O9wkko50ko\">https://t.co/O9wkko50ko</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nNe8TScmyG\">pic.twitter.com/nNe8TScmyG</a></p>&mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1839714562863517949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 27, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Nibi is an adorable and vivacious 2-year-old beaver who was rescued as a baby — and is the subject of a recent Massachusetts court battle. At issue was whether Nibi, who resides at Newhouse Wildlife Rescue, had to be returned to the wild. According to Newhouse, Nibi would die if they released her, because she doesn’t yet have the skills to survive. <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/protect-nibi-the-beaver-from-unnecessary-removal-from-newhouse-wildlife-do-not-donate-here?source_location=search\">Roughly 29,000 people</a> signed a petition calling for Nibi to remain at the rescue, and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey has since issued a permit allowing her to do so. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Following public outcry and involvement from Massachusetts’ highest office, Nibi, an orphaned 2-year-old beaver, will not be sent back into the wild and be allowed to become an educational beaver.<a href=\"https://t.co/WEfSEEnbVj\">https://t.co/WEfSEEnbVj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PI6Ao3AmpA\">pic.twitter.com/PI6Ao3AmpA</a></p>&mdash; Boston 25 News (@boston25) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boston25/status/1841961832191344898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a lot of cute animals out there, and humans tend to be attracted to them because of something scientists call “<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/baby-schema\">baby schema</a>,” the idea that humans generally feel warmly toward creatures that resemble babies because of how protective they are of infants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Mammals are favorably inclined toward individuals that have infant-like traits: large heads, big eyes relative to those heads, rounded features, and typically an awkward gait,” <a href=\"https://psych.uw.edu/people/2800\">David Barash</a>, a psychology professor emeritus at the University of Washington, told Vox. “These traits are characteristic of human babies and toddlers, so it’s adaptive for us to treat them favorably, to see them as especially cute.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Baby schema alone can’t explain why Moo Deng, Pesto, and Nibi have become so popular, however. While they benefit from their infant-like appearances, they also likely garnered a sizable degree of attention because they have unique personalities that reflect essential parts of the human experience, from frustration at things outside our control to delight in small pleasures. Exposure to animal content, in general, has also been found to provide stress relief, comfort, and escapism at a time when <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx\">Americans in particular are more stressed than ever</a>. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why so many people are drawn to these animals</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The cuteness factor has always been a big reason that people are drawn to animals — but the internet’s latest faves seem to have achieved a rare type of animal celebrity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And a big part of that could be tied to each animal’s strong personality. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210211-why-escapism-benefits-from-a-dose-of-pandemic-reality?utm_source=html&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=daily_post&amp;utm_content=bbc-grizzard-reality\">Researchers have found that people are attracted</a> to content and characters that validate their own experiences, and that reflect their own beliefs or feelings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We do like to see characters that are going through the same thing we’re going through,” Matthew Grizzard, a communications professor at The Ohio State University, previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210211-why-escapism-benefits-from-a-dose-of-pandemic-reality?utm_source=html&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=daily_post&amp;utm_content=bbc-grizzard-reality\">told the BBC</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to Moo Deng, for example, her expression of apparent frustration — which commonly takes the form of open-mouthed yelling — embodies the stress and annoyance that many of her fans are experiencing amid ongoing uncertainty in the world. “I love that Moo Deng is fucking annoyed all the time. I can relate,” as <a href=\"https://x.com/esjesjesj/status/1837347574040158538\">one online Moo Deng fan wrote</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nibi, too, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced0x96lew2o\">has been described as a “diva”</a> for her mischievous behavior and playful facial expressions, both of which have resonated with supporters, because they show off <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140582/nibi-beaver-massachusetts-govern-newhouse-wildlife\">a certain aspirational swagger</a>. In one TikTok post, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kashmeredanny/video/7421965843233262878\">comedian Danny Murphy compared</a> her to that of other “2024 icons” like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Pesto, in addition to his unique identity as a “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brutamerica/reel/DAlptZPu-7s/?hl=en\">chonky king</a>,” — a title some fans have given him — has also become known for <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/pesto-the-penguin-is-big-hungry-and-famous-but-his-size-might-not-last/pbkswg1qq\">how much he enjoys food</a>. According to his keepers, Pesto consumes roughly 25 to 32 fish a day, prompting internet observers to share their <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFftCYoo/\">similar love of fish and sushi</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you can assign this sort of unexpected emotion to an animal, it’s effective,” Roger Dooley, a consumer marketing expert, previously <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0730/Why-do-we-love-grumpy-animal-memes-Science-explains\">told the Christian Science Monitor</a>, about the appeal of memes like Grumpy Cat, a feline known for his dour facial expression. “I think we don’t expect our animals to be grumpy, so as a result you have that novelty factor at work too.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Broadly, animal content has also been found to have a soothing effect on people that can help relieve stress by providing distraction or comfort. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/27/us/watching-cute-animals-study-scn-trnd/index.html\">A 2019 University of Leeds Study</a>, for example, found that showing college students preparing for finals a 30-minute montage of cute animal content helped reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s no doubt that people turn to all sorts of escapist options when they&#8217;re anxious,” Barash told Vox, noting that pet adoptions and purchases also spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic when more people had heightened stress levels and were looking for support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like other viral animals that have come before them, Moo Deng, Pesto, and Nibi have gained a following both because their cuteness can be pleasing, and because they’re appearing to convey emotions that reflect how many people are feeling at the moment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

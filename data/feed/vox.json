The BBC obtained the transcript of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9jx89w490o\">two 911 calls</a> that were made from the hotel with concerns for Payne’s safety shortly before his death. Authorities later <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/liam-payne-dies-latest-former-one-direction-star-found-dead-at-buenos-aires-hotel-13234923?postid=8453189#liveblog-body\">clarified</a> that Payne died as a result of injuries from the fall.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPRvpVveEx/\">joint statement</a> posted to Instagram, the former members of One Direction — Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik — said that they were “completely devastated” by “the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly. The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a member of the massively popular UK boy band, Payne achieved a very rare level of global fame, but <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/liam-payne-dead-mental-health-drug-alcohol-abuse-rehab-quotes-b1188418.html\">faced</a> addiction struggles that he spoke about publicly following the band&#8217;s breakup. His last single, “Teardrops,” released in March, left fans <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/liam-paynes-final-lyrics-contained-30163528\">speculating</a> about his mental health. Just days before his death, Payne had <a href=\"https://people.com/liam-payne-overwhelmed-by-legal-issues-with-ex-before-death-exclusive-8729450\">received</a> a cease-and-desist order from his ex-fianceé Maya Henry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The premature death of any public figure is a collectively mourned tragedy, but when a large and devoted fandom faces this kind of loss, the ripple effects can be intense. Often, fans in this situation are met with what psychologists term <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22297792/fandom-escape-grief-psychology-complicated-lynn-zubernis-interview\">disenfranchised loss</a> — when there’s a lack of community support system for this grief because the “loss” of a celebrity or an intense parasocial relationship isn’t one that society tends to recognize as real or legitimate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In such a context, fans look online for other fans to share their experience with, which can lead to plenty of confusion and chaos. The circumstances of Payne’s death contributed to the spread of misinformation about what happened, as did coverage by tabloid media.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is Liam Payne, and how did he become famous?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Payne initially auditioned for the fifth season of <em>The X Factor </em>in 2008 with a rendition of Frank Sinatra’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBj9ctwZsX0\">“Fly Me to the Moon.”</a> He was just 14. (Girls Aloud member Cheryl Cole, with whom he would go on to share a child, served as one of the judges at the time.) Payne was dismissed and brought back to the show twice before being cut by executive producer and judge Simon Cowell. However, Cowell encouraged him to come back in a couple of years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At 16, Payne tried out again for the competition’s seventh season in 2010 where his Michael Bublé-inspired cover of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awhsOgmdq6w\">“Cry Me a River”</a> earned him a standing ovation from Cowell. He failed to advance as a solo act but received a fateful second chance when guest judge Nicole Scherzinger <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dr1-sVhC9o\">suggested</a> that he and his future bandmates — Styles, Horan, Malik, and Tomlinson — compete as a boy band under Cowell’s mentorship. One Direction made it all the way to the finals before coming in third.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-808566062.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.0791157649796,100,87.841768470041\" alt=\"Five young men, one holding a guitar.\" title=\"Five young men, one holding a guitar.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"One Direction members Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles and Niall Horan at rehearsals for The X Factor in London. | Dominic Lipinski/PA Images via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Dominic Lipinski/PA Images via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout their time on the show, the group accumulated a fervent international following on social media, especially <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23158503/one-direction-fandom-book-kaitlyn-tiffany\">Tumblr</a>. Soon after the competition, they signed with Cowell’s Syco Entertainment and released their single “What Makes You Beautiful” from the album <em>Up All Night</em> in 2011. The album was notably successful in the United States, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. They became the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/one-direction-makes-history-with-no-1-debut-on-billboard-200-499420/\">first UK group to top the US charts</a> with a debut album, marking a new British invasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout their time as a band, One Direction released five albums — their final record excluding Malik, who exited the group in 2015 — and two concert films, <em>One Direction: This Is Us</em> and <em>One Direction: Where We Are</em>. In 2015, they released their final album, <em>Made In The A.M</em>., before each remaining member embarked on a solo career. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s been happening since 1D’s split?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A year after One Direction’s final album, Payne released his solo single, “Strip That Down” featuring Quavo, from his first and only album <em>LP1</em>. The R&amp;B-tinged track was fairly successful, peaking at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 on the UK Singles charts. However, <em>LP1</em> received largely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/06/liam-payne-lp1-review-capitol\">negative</a> <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/liam-payne-lp1/\">reviews</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Payne&#8217;s solo career and celebrity were met with less buzz than his bandmates, notably Styles. He largely garnered headlines for his relationships and personal life. In 2016, he started dating Cheryl Cole and had a son, Bear, with the singer in 2017 before they split a year later. In 2021, he opened up about the “severe” addiction issues he dealt with during his boyband days on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TovCz1Qh_24\"><em>The Diary of a CEO</em></a> podcast. The singer revealed that he took a lot of “pills and booze” and experienced suicidal ideation.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-922620750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.449742936654,100,69.100514126692\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole at the 2018 BRIT Awards on February 21, 2018. | Karwai Tang/WireImage\" data-portal-copyright=\"Karwai Tang/WireImage\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The day the band ended, I was like, ‘Thank the Lord,’” he said on the podcast. “I know a lot of people are going to be mad at me for saying that, but I needed to stop, or it would kill me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The following year, he sat down for an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uux_L_pkKe4\">interview with YouTuber Logan Paul</a> on his podcast <em>Impaulsive</em> which prompted his less-than-favorable reputation among <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/liam-payne-rehab-one-direction-scramble-to-stay-relevant-1235665998/\">One Direction fans</a> in his final years. On the podcast, Payne made some questionable claims about his role in the band, stating that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMTYHlhDuMI\">idea for One Direction</a> started with him and that his first solo single <a href=\"https://x.com/PopBase/status/1531815219202170880\">“outsold”</a> the rest of the group’s debuts. He also discussed negative interactions with his ex-bandmates and discord within the group.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What happened on the day of Liam Payne’s death?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On October 16, Payne had been in Argentina for two weeks, in part to attend a Niall Horan concert. Roughly an hour after posting <a href=\"https://x.com/daujahmarie/status/1846671484984742041\">photos and video</a>s with his girlfriend, influencer Katie Cassidy, on his Snapchat, posts claiming that Payne had fallen from his hotel balcony began to circulate on <a href=\"https://x.com/NsbSo/status/1846655015316074964\">X</a>. <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/16/liam-payne-dies-hotel-balcony-one-direction/\">TMZ</a> confirmed his death with partially cropped photos of Payne’s dead body, which they later removed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a statement to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/liam-payne-one-direction-death-487239e4f0b938a6f350a7d2f14737e4\">Associated Press</a>, Buenos Aires police said that Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital at 5:07 pm local time, resulting in extremely serious injuries. Police also found medication in his room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The next day, Buenos Aires police shared a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-payne-cause-of-death-multiple-traumas-bleeding-from-fall-1235136202/?utm_source=pocket_shared\">preliminary autopsy</a> that pointed out “craniocerebral injuries were sufficient to cause death” as well as “internal and external hemorrhages in the skull, thorax, abdomen and limbs.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How did the media respond?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the news first broke, many on social media refused to believe it, in part because Payne had continued to update his accounts throughout the day until <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly25847932o\">shortly before</a> his death. That changed abruptly when TMZ published a photograph of Payne, ostensibly under the guise of identifying him and “confirm[ing] early reports from witnesses.” The outlet quickly <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/tmz-liam-payne-death-photos-breaking-taboos-drawing-condemnation-1236033681/\">unpublished</a> the photo due to public backlash, but <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/16/liam-payne-dies-hotel-balcony-one-direction/\">retained</a> a description of Payne’s body at the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The treatment of the situation by TMZ was the beginning of a flood of sensationalized reporting surrounding Payne’s death. Readers of outlets ranging from tabloids to CNN quickly learned about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/liam-payne-death-one-direction-10-17-24-intl#cm2d5dhyl000t3b6m0l6j9x1j\">damage</a> done to Payne’s hotel room, the 911 caller who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9jx89w490o\">reported</a> that Payne was allegedly &#8220;trashing the room&#8221; and had taken &#8220;too many drugs and alcohol,&#8221; and the legal battles with ex-fiancée Maya Henry that reportedly “<a href=\"https://people.com/liam-payne-overwhelmed-by-legal-issues-with-ex-before-death-exclusive-8729450\">overwhelmed</a>” Payne prior to his death. The tabloids also <a href=\"https://www.justjared.com/2024/10/16/liam-payne-previously-spoke-out-about-mental-health-addiction-sobriety-struggles-prior-to-death/\">fed speculation</a> about Payne’s mental health, referencing his past mention of suicidal thoughts and circulating reports of his “<a href=\"https://www.irishstar.com/culture/entertainment/liam-payne-acting-erratic-hours-33909077\">erratic</a>” behavior in the lead-up to the incident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Platforms like X were rife with misinformation, most notably unsourced <a href=\"https://radaronline.com/p/horrific-videos-liam-payne-plunging-death-fake-sick/\">videos and photos</a> falsely purporting to be of Payne either falling or having fallen to his death, all of which were subsequently <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/liam-payne-death-misinformation-conspiracy-1970429\">debunked</a>. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What was the controversy with his ex-fiancée?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Weeks before his death, Payne received criticism from One Direction fans online for displaying so-called <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/music/liam-payne-dissed-for-stealing-fellow-one-direction-member-niall-horans-spotlight-at-his-argentina-concert/ar-AA1rInJ8\">attention-seeking behavior</a> at Horan’s Bueno Aires show on October 2. On Snapchat, he said he announced that he was attending the show and had <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/entertainment/liam-payne-visited-argentina-to-see-former-one-direction-bandmate-niall-horan-before-fatal-hotel-balcony-fall/\">some things to “square up”</a> with Horan. In videos, Payne can be seen eagerly engaging and taking photos with fans seated outside of his suite. After the show, Payne was spotted posing for more fans outside. After the concert, Payne <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/10/16/celebrity-news/liam-payne-traveled-to-argentina-to-reconcile-with-one-direction-bandmate-niall-horan-2-weeks-before-his-death/\">posted a photo of himself</a> and Horan, stating that he was “so proud” of his former bandmate.    </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid that discussion, clips of Payne’s comments from his interview with Paul began to recirculate on TikTok and X, as well as other <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1esc02s/thinking_about_the_time_a_girl_posted_a_picture/\">ridiculed interactions</a> he had on social media. He was also still dealing with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/liam-payne-kate-cassidy-tiktok-b2596392.html\">criticism</a> from fans that he was a controlling partner after a TikTok his current girlfriend Cassidy posted in August where Payne quips that she looks “nice and covered up for once.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On October 14, his ex-fiancée Maya Henry — to whom he was engaged from 2020 to 2022 — made some troubling allegations on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4qIFdfgPM&amp;t=1299s\"><em>The</em> <em>Internet Is Dead</em> podcast</a> about her relationship with Payne, which she called “toxic.” In the most chilling moments of the interview, she accused him of <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/liam-payne-death-maya-henry-interview-youtube-video-1970552\">“play[ing] with death”</a> and threatening suicide as a “manipulation tactic.” She said she and her family offered to get him help in a rehab facility, which he ignored. She also stated that she sent him a cease-and-desist letter after he allegedly wouldn’t stop contacting her through her iCloud accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She also claimed that Payne’s family had warned her against releasing her first novel, <em>Lookin</em>g<em> Forward</em>, this past May, which she says was <a href=\"https://people.com/liam-payne-ex-maya-henry-opens-up-about-painful-abortion-experience-exclusive-8649608\">“inspired by true events.”</a> Given the book’s subject matter — a woman&#8217;s traumatizing experience with a famous man — fans speculated that it was based on her relationship with Payne. In the book, the main protagonist Mallory is coerced by her partner into receiving a painful at-home abortion. Mallory is then discouraged by her partner’s team from seeking medical treatment for hemorrhaging for fear of being spotted in public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How has the industry reacted?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of Payne’s death, social media was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/liam-payne-tributes-family-harry-styles-niall-horan-b2630993.html\">flooded</a> with entertainment industry tributes from Payne’s colleagues and friends, everyone from the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/liam-payne-death-one-direction-10-17-24-intl#cm2d283rq0000356mhjkpo6o9\">Backstreet Boys</a> to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/liam-payne-tributes-paris-hilton-charlie-puth-more-1236118186/\">Paris Hilton</a>. Dermot O’Leary, the host of <em>X Factor</em>, the British reality competition show where One Direction was famously created in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBM_0G9Nvw6/\">posted</a> to Instagram that Payne’s death was “the worst news.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I remember him as a 14 year old turning up to audition on The X Factor, and blowing us away singing Sinatra. He just loved to sing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Payne’s neighbors and close friends recounted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn4vem0l5ldt?post=asset%3A88bee5db-c602-44a9-b4c3-a327e431ad6b#post\">moments</a> of kindness and compassion, including the time he reportedly <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/liam-payne-saved-life-friend-fire-123354017.html\">saved the life</a> of a friend in a fire. “I’m devastated,” Rita Ora, who previously collaborated with Payne on the <em>Fifty Shades Freed</em> soundtrack, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBOcC6Ft7SH/\">wrote</a> on Instagram. “He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. I loved working with him so much — he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several relatives of Payne’s former bandmates reacted publicly, including Harry Styles’ mother, who <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBNIp_1ITDv/\">shared</a> a broken heart emoji on Instagram. The band itself issued a joint statement via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPRvpVveEx/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, former band member Louis Tomlinson updated Instagram with a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPRBySzeJW/\">lengthy tribute</a> to Payne, saying he was “devastated to be writing this but yesterday I lost a brother.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a statement, Payne’s family <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/global/liam-payne-death-911-call-events-before-fall-1236181064/\">described</a> themselves as “heartbroken” by the loss. “Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul,” the family stated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How have fans reacted?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the early reports of an out-of-control man endangering himself were so out of sync with the upbeat, calm social media videos uploaded to his feed from earlier in the day, many fans initially refused to believe he’d died. People magazine <a href=\"https://people.com/liam-payne-final-social-media-posts-snapchat-before-death-8729435\">reported</a> that the videos shared on Payne’s feed the day of his death had actually been created four days earlier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, it was enough to jump-start a wave of wild speculation, including the false <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21558524/conspiracy-theories-2020-qanon-covid-conspiracies-why\">conspiracy theory</a> that his death was somehow <a href=\"https://tribune.com.pk/story/2503505/conspiracy-theories-link-liam-paynes-tragic-death-to-diddys-arrest-as-old-interview-resurfaces\">connected</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/373997/sean-combs-diddy-puffy-cassie-freak-offs-conspiracy-beiber\">ongoing criminal case</a> against Sean “Diddy” Combs. Internet trolls also flooded the hotel where he died with <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/17/entertainment/hotel-where-liam-payne-fell-flooded-with-vile-reviews-mocking-his-death/\">ironic and mocking reviews</a>, while others reportedly turned to <a href=\"https://www.herzindagi.com/celebrities/liam-paynes-death-and-backlash-against-maya-henry-why-women-face-unjust-criticism-in-tragic-situations-article-1004463\">harassing</a> Henry, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/popfaction/p/DBNC_m4S6fb/?img_index=2\">flooding</a> her Instagram comments following his death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of Payne’s fans, however, were left simply reeling from the shock. Local fans turned the location of Payne’s hotel into an impromptu <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c98y6n94z01o\">memorial site</a> after his death, leaving candles, flowers, and other tributes in his memory and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/liam-payne-death-one-direction-balcony-b2630701.html\">singing his songs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I&#8217;ve always loved One Direction since I was little,” one of the fans gathered there <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/death-ex-direction-member-liam-payne-shocks-fans-around-world/15437832/\">told</a> the Associated Press. “To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another fan <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/liam-payne-death-one-direction-10-17-24-intl#cm2d1o0ve0000356muo2vwsln\">told</a> CNN that she’d been unable to see the group on their Argentine tour stop. Her visit to Payne’s memorial site, she noted, was “the only time I was able to clap for him.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It might even be an opportunity to end the fighting — but only if both sides of the war treat it that way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to preliminary Israeli media reports, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/high-likelihood-hamas-leader-oct-7-mastermind-yahya-sinwar-killed-by-troops-in-gaza/\">Sinwar, along with two other Hamas fighters, was killed</a> on Wednesday in the southern Gaza city of Rafah when Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened fire on a building where the three were holed up. The troops then ordered an airstrike against the building, collapsing it. When IDF troops entered what was left of the building on Thursday, they noticed that one of the killed Hamas members looked like Sinwar. The body’s identity was confirmed by DNA testing on Thursday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Sinwar has been described as a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de78c7a0-f8f0-403e-b0db-eb86d6e76919\">dead man walking</a>” by Israeli officials for months, he was reportedly not the target of the IDF operation and it’s very surprising that he was apparently above ground and accompanied by only a few fellow fighters. For months, US and Israeli officials <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-official-sinwar-likely-alive-in-gaza-tunnel-with-hostages-in-his-vicinity/\">have said</a> Sinwar was likely deep underground in Hamas’s tunnel network, surrounded by hostages effectively acting as human shields. Israeli authorities say they believe Sinwar <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2nm2cjkx\">had been in a tunnel</a> with six hostages who were executed by their captors in late August, though it’s not clear when exactly Sinwar left. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What will his death mean for Hamas? <a href=\"https://www.cnas.org/people/jonathan-lord\">Jonathan Lord</a>, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said that with Hamas already severely degraded after a year of Israeli assaults, Sinwar’s death, alone, would likely result in “no change to Hamas’s military capabilities.” But, he added, “politically, Sinwar’s death leaves a gaping hole in the movement, at least in the near term.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sinwar, explained</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Born in the Gaza city of Khan Younis in 1962, Sinwar had been a member of Hamas since its origination in 1987, and founded its internal security service, known as the Majd. He <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/08/12/yahya-sinwar-profile-hamas-gaza-war-israel\">acquired a reputation</a> for brutally enforcing loyalty to the movement by murdering and torturing suspected traitors and collaborators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sinwar was arrested for murder and kidnapping in 1988 and sentenced to four life terms in Israel. During his time in prison, he reportedly learned Hebrew and consumed Israeli media and books to learn more about his adversary. Sinwar was able to put those lessons to use after he became one of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in 2011 in exchange for the captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Six years after his release, he became Hamas’s leader in Gaza. Within the Hamas leadership, he was considered among the least willing to make political compromises with Israel and the closest to Iran. Sinwar was reportedly the main architect of the October 7 attacks and was the one who picked its official name, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/10/17/sinwar-hamas-gaza-dies/\">Operation al-Aqsa Flood</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Hamas’s global political leader Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli bombing in Tehran in July, Sinwar took over that role as well. Over the past year, Israeli and American authorities have often described Sinwar as the main obstacle to a ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sinwar was committed to full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, and less willing to compromise than Hamas leaders based outside of Palestine. In early October, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/sinwar-hamas-israel-hezbollah-iran.html\">New York Times reported</a> that American intelligence assessed that Sinwar did not believe he would survive the conflict, wanted to see Israel embroiled in a larger war in the Middle East, and was not interested in reaching a compromise. All of which, it seems, has been proved correct.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s next for Hamas — and the war in Gaza</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not immediately clear who will take Sinwar’s place. Many of Hamas’s senior leaders and Sinwar’s top lieutenants have also been killed over the past years. In terms of global leaders, the most obvious candidate, if only because he’s the most prominent Hamas figure still alive, is Khaled Meshaal, a founding member of the group who was chair of Hamas’s political bureau from 1996 until 2017, when he was replaced by Haniyeh. Meshaal is currently based in Qatar. It&#8217;s also possible Hamas might choose a younger face from within its politburo — the main decision-making body. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Israel, Sinwar’s death is a major political and strategic victory. “This is our bin Laden moment,” Nimrod Novik, former senior adviser to the late Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, told Vox. Novik described the killing as a tremendous opportunity for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “to declare victory” and push for a ceasefire deal and hostage release deal along the lines of the one Israel offered in late May, and which Hamas accepted — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-palestinians-gaza-ceasefire-77910b6fae70ac1ff4eb3ac278852b44\">albeit with some key alterations</a> — in early July. Talks over that deal eventually collapsed when Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/08/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands-explainer-mime-intl/index.html\">added additional conditions</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The guy that you, Bibi, kept saying is blocking the deal is gone,” said Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum. “Can you do something creative?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The message from Washington was similar. &#8220;This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,&#8221; ⁦Vice President and Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://x.com/nanditab1/status/1846979247702700489\">said</a> in a brief statement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the moment, however, that doesn’t seem to be how Netanyahu sees it. “Today, evil took a heavy blow — the mission ahead of us is still unfinished,” the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-17-2024/\">said on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, attention turns to the remaining hostages held in Gaza, with many families <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/families-israeli-hostages-fear-captives-after-sinwar-killed-2024-10-17/\">fearful that more may be killed</a> in retaliation for Sinwar’s death. Officially, Hamas is believed to be holding 101 of the 254 hostages abducted on October 7, though Israeli authorities believe as many as half of those may be dead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sinwar’s death comes at a time when Israel has increasingly been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/376206/gaza-occupation-forever-war-israel\">shifting its political attention and military resources</a> toward its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria as well as its escalating direct conflict with Iran, though strikes in Gaza — including a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5d33dmepo\">deadly one earlier this week</a> on a hospital where displaced people were sheltering — have continued.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Netanyahu has also reportedly <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-tells-lawmakers-hes-considering-generals-plan-to-lay-siege-to-northern-gaza/\">been considering a plan</a> proposed by several former generals to turn northern Gaza into a closed military zone, evacuating its entire civilian population and starving out any who remain. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has denied that Israel is moving forward with this so-called <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/14/israel-wont-impose-starvation-plan-gaza-defense-minister-says\">starvation plan</a>, which is opposed by the US. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Monday, the US <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/15/us-israel-gaza-humanitarian-conditions-military-aid-letter\">issued a statement</a> telling Israel to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza — particularly by allowing in more aid shipments, which have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-stops-processing-key-commercial-food-imports-gaza-sources-say-2024-10-17/\">reportedly slowed</a> to a trickle, or risk the supply of US weapons. On the other hand, the statement came on the same day Israel received a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/army-israel-thaad-air-defense-strains-e49a65aaaf3a4ff051b54eebb869f241\">new top-of-the-line missile</a> defense system. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This wouldn’t be the first time the White House — and Netanyahu’s Israeli critics — have hoped the prime minister would “take the win” in Gaza. In a White House statement back in May, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/\">Biden assured Israelis </a>that “Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7” and that the pursuit of “total victory” would not bring the hostages home or “bring Israel lasting security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps Sinwar’s killing will change the calculus of the Israeli government. But it’s also possible that Netanyahu and his senior officials might see this as vindication — if they’d heeded Biden’s caution back in May, Sinwar would presumably still be alive. And of course, hopes of a ceasefire will dim further if hostages are killed by Hamas in retaliation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing is for sure, the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 40,000 people, is back at the center of attention. The question is whether that means it will finally be brought to an end — or at least a pause — or if a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/376206/gaza-occupation-forever-war-israel\">more-or-less permanent reoccupation</a> of the territory is in store. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That money would go toward ramping up urgently needed conservation efforts including replanting forests and making farms more wildlife-friendly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But how exactly countries can raise that money is still an open question, and one that’s central to the modern environmental movement. Beginning Monday, world leaders will meet in Cali, Colombia, for a major United Nations event known as COP16, the world’s most important conference concerned with protecting plant and animal life. Finalizing a plan to funnel more money into the environment is one of the event’s main goals and one of its most enduring sticking points.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The good news is that $700 billion is actually not that much. At least compared to global GDP, which amounts to <a href=\"https://databankfiles.worldbank.org/public/ddpext_download/GDP.pdf\">more than $100 trillion</a>. And it’s less than the US alone spends on its <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-does-the-us-spend-on-the-military/\">military</a> each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then again, most countries don’t prioritize conserving nature compared to things like health care and infrastructure, which tend to yield more obvious and immediate benefits. While people understand the problem of a crumbling freeway, it can be harder to perceive the loss of wildlife, which may occur over decades. Plus, it hasn’t been easy for companies or financial firms to invest in ecosystems in the same way they might back, say, a renewable energy project; the value of healthy ecosystems is still overlooked and grossly underpriced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So coming up with $700 billion will be a challenge, even though the return on that investment is priceless. Every basic human need, from food to water to shelter, depends on ecosystems and animals that compose them. This is about sustaining human existence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The price of saving nature</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/376706/wwf-living-planet-decline-extinction-conservation\">most measures</a>, populations of plants and animals are collapsing, and they have been for decades. Coral reefs are disappearing, as are tropical forests. Animals are going extinct. It’s bleak.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The world’s best defense against these alarming declines is a UN treaty called the Convention on Biological Diversity, which aims to protect nature. Every two years, the convention hosts a conference with all of its members, or parties —&nbsp;which includes leaders from nearly every country, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22434172/us-cbd-treaty-biological-diversity-nature-conservation\">except the US</a> — called COP. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More stories on the biggest issues at COP16</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wrap your head around one of the most controversial topics that countries will debate: digital sequence information, or DSI. “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/372277/digital-sequence-information-dsi-cop16-explained\">DNA from wild organisms could save your life — but there’s a catch</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US is the only country that is not a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Why is that? <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22434172/us-cbd-treaty-biological-diversity-nature-conservation\">Why the US won’t join the single most important treaty to protect nature</a> (2021)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A key topic at COP16 is how to measure progress toward protecting nature. Vox looked into one of the main metrics for wildlife declines. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/376706/wwf-living-planet-decline-extinction-conservation\">A new report reveals “catastrophic” declines of animals worldwide — but is it accurate?</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In late 2022, during COP15, countries met in Montreal and agreed on a groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/article/cop15-final-text-kunming-montreal-gbf-221222\">new plan</a> to stop the global decline of nature. The plan, known as the global biodiversity framework, lays out 23 targets that countries need to achieve by 2030, including a goal to conserve at least 30 percent of all land and water on the planet. It’s ambitious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To meet those targets, countries — and especially poorer nations — need more money, to the tune of $700 billion per year, <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/cop-15-l-25-en.pdf\">according to</a> the framework. Experts say this number comes from an influential <a href=\"https://www.paulsoninstitute.org/conservation/financing-nature-report/\">report</a> published in 2020 by Cornell University and two nonprofits, the Nature Conservancy and the Paulson Institute. The report estimated that countries and companies currently spend about $133 billion a year on protecting wild animals and places, such as by restoring habitat. Yet in order to truly safeguard ecosystems, including conserving nearly a third of the planet’s land and water, they’ll need to spend more like $844 billion a year, the report found.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rounded down, the gap in spending is $700 billion a year. This is often referred to as the biodiversity finance gap, and this number is used in the highest-stake negotiations to safeguard the natural world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest chunk of that $700 billion is meant to target agriculture through a suite of efforts that would make farms and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/10/19/23403330/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-cattle-laundering\">ranches</a> more sustainable. Agriculture, which drives about <a href=\"https://wwflpr.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/2024-living-planet-report-a-system-in-peril.pdf\">90 percent</a> of deforestation in the tropics, is by far the largest driver of animal declines globally — not hunting or poaching. Industrial farms not only replace native grasslands and forests with vast fields of crops but also often rely on pesticides and fertilizers that harm animal life. Making farms more sustainable, such as by using natural pest controls, can come at high upfront costs to the agriculture industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Setting up new parks to protect land, restoring forests, and eradicating invasive plants like cheatgrass also costs many billions of dollars a year, the report found. Together these conservation efforts contribute to the $700 billion figure.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/CBD_DSI2-1378.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.3408764656368,100,87.318247068726\" alt=\"A large auditorium full of people.\" title=\"A large auditorium full of people.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"In the lead-up to COP16, country officials negotiate a plan to share benefits from digital DNA information, known as DSI. | Mike Muzurakis/IISD/ENB\" data-portal-copyright=\"Mike Muzurakis/IISD/ENB\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 2022 plan to save nature laid out what are essentially four main ways to close that funding gap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first is to ramp up money that wealthy countries and philanthropists give or loan to poorer nations for conservation, either directly or through big development banks like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. This is foreign aid.&nbsp;The second is increasing the amount of money that national governments spend on protecting nature, such as through their environmental or agriculture ministries.&nbsp;The third avenue is encouraging the private sector, including corporations and investors, to spend more on conservation efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These three categories are meant to raise $200 billion a year by 2030, according to the plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fourth way to close this gap is to shut off incentives that directly harm the natural world. Indeed, the remaining money — $500 billion a year — is meant to come from phasing out or repurposing harmful subsidies. Subsidy is a somewhat squishy term that refers to benefits that a government provides to commercial industries, such as the agriculture and oil and gas industries. Often this is in the form of direct payments but it can also include things like tax breaks and government research that ultimately benefits companies. The idea is to repurpose subsidies so that they incentivize efforts to safeguard nature. “Subsidy reform represents the single biggest opportunity to close the funding gap,” authors of the 2020 report wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During this year’s UN negotiations in Colombia, world leaders will try and figure out how to make this happen.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The funding strategies, explained</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let’s start with foreign aid, the money that would go from rich countries to poor ones. While it’s ultimately a very small piece of the pie, these payments are politically fraught. Many low-income countries, such as those in central Africa, hold much of the world’s plant and animal life, yet they often lack the resources to protect it. Meanwhile, the industries threatening that natural abundance, such as metal mining, are often stoked by wealthy nations. So developing countries say it’s only fair that wealthy countries help foot the bill for conservation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, global leaders landed on a deal. According to the biodiversity framework, rich countries like Canada and Japan will pay developing nations at least $20 billion a year for conservation by 2025 and $30 billion a year by 2030. And this money has already been flowing: Aid for conservation in developing nations reached $15.4 billion in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2024/09/biodiversity-and-development-finance-2015-2022_bef02691.html#:~:text=From%202015%20to%202022%2C%20bilateral,USD%203.8%20billion%20in%202022.\">according to</a> the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which tracks spending. The bulk of this money comes from development banks and direct payments from wealthy to poor countries. That’s a big increase from 2021, when aid for conservation reached $11.1 billion.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A flaw in the math</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The gap in funding needed to protect ecosystems and their key functions is $700 billion. That’s <em>in addition</em> to what the world is already spending. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The global plan to save nature commits nearly all countries to raising $200 billion a year toward closing that gap, in addition to reforming subsidies worth at least $500 billion a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But here’s the rub: Language in the plan doesn’t specify that this $200 billion is <em>in addition </em>to what countries are already spending. It’s a total. So even if world leaders achieve the ambitious plan to save nature, they may still be short in money.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is promising at face value: Rich countries are less than $5 billion from their aid goal. But the scale of biodiversity loss in the Global South —&nbsp;lower-income countries that are typically south of the equator — will almost certainly require a much larger increase in funding, said Brian O’Donnell, who leads the environmental group Campaign for Nature. The other problem is that much of that aid money is in the form of loans, “which is problematic, given the <a href=\"https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/world/global-public-debt-to-hit-us100-trillion-by-end-of-2024-the-imf-says.phtml\">massive debt</a> that we&#8217;re seeing in much of the Global South,” O’Donnell said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A much bigger portion of the $700 billion gap will need to come from national governments — what individual countries raise and spend within their borders. Environmental ministries, for example, will need to put more resources toward stopping cattle ranchers from razing the rainforest, whereas agriculture agencies might have to fund more sea patrols to prevent overfishing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A key question is where all that money will come from. Governments could redirect spending from other departments. They could impose new taxes on products like pesticides and close tax loopholes. They could also raise more money from their natural resources, such as by increasing entrance fees for national parks, said Onno van den Heuvel, who leads a UN nature finance project called BioFin. BioFin helps countries come up with money for conservation. “Protected area budgeting is one of the areas where there’s a lot more that countries can do,” he told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s the role of the private sector — which is where things get more complex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a whole host of new projects designed by governments and NGOs to get companies and investment firms to fund conservation. An initiative called the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), for example, was created by the UN and nonprofit leaders to help companies and investors identify how their profits depend on healthy ecosystems. The thinking is that firms are more likely to protect nature as part of their business if they know how much they depend on it. For example, a company that grows chocolate might invest in protecting insects when they learn their cacao crops depend on them for pollination. A different project called the Tropical Forest Finance Facility (TFFF), which is still under development, would help direct money from wealthy countries and investors to countries that have successfully stemmed deforestation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet another large effort, hotly debated among environmental leaders, aims to raise money for nature from something called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/372277/digital-sequence-information-dsi-cop16-explained\">digital sequence information</a> (DSI). DSI is essentially the genetic material from living organisms, in digital form. All kinds of companies, such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture firms, rely on that data to create commercial products. A proposal on the table at COP16 would funnel money from industries that rely heavily on DSI into conservation, especially in the Global South.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The last bucket of funding — which would pull money from subsidy reform — is even trickier.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The subsidy elephant in the room</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve established how important it is for world leaders to raise $700 billion to protect nature. Now consider this: Countries are collectively spending $1.25 trillion — yes, trillion — on subsidies for agriculture, fishing, fossil fuel development, industries that are known to erode biodiversity, according to a <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/61d04aca-1b95-4c06-8199-3c4a423cb7fe/content\">2023 report</a> by the World Bank. <a href=\"https://www.earthtrack.net/sites/default/files/documents/ehs_report_september-2024-update_final.pdf\">Other reports</a> suggest that the value of harmful subsidies is much higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This means that countries are subsidizing environmental harm on an enormous scale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Environmental leaders want to change this. In the 2022 biodiversity framework, they agreed to reduce subsidies that harm the environment by at least $500 billion a year by 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the challenge they face is immense, and they’ve failed at it before. In 2009, leaders of the G20, which run the world’s largest economies, <a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/ffs_g20_firstyear.pdf\">agreed to</a> phase out fossil-fuel subsidies in the medium term, but such kickbacks <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/24/fossil-fuel-subsidies-surged-to-record-7-trillion\">have since ballooned</a>. And in 2010, nearly all countries agreed to a set of environmental goals, known as the <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets\">Aichi Targets</a>, including phasing out subsidies that harm nature, by 2020. They didn’t meet that target (or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/15/every-global-target-to-stem-destruction-of-nature-by-2020-missed-un-report-aoe\">any other one</a> of the 20 Aichi Targets, for that matter).</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/CBD_DSI2-0886.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063\" alt=\"The representative from Antigua and Barbuda sits and listens from her seat and desk.\" title=\"The representative from Antigua and Barbuda sits and listens from her seat and desk.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Before meeting in Cali, Colombia, government officials negotiate language that will be finalized at COP16. | Mike Muzurakis/IISD/ENB\" data-portal-copyright=\"Mike Muzurakis/IISD/ENB\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts say there’s really only one way to make this work: Instead of getting rid of subsidies, countries should redirect them toward commercial efforts that make companies more sustainable. In other words, subsidies should incentivize conservation, said Andrew Deutz, a policy and finance expert at the World Wildlife Fund. Governments could, for example, deepen tax breaks for farmers who restore pollinator habitat instead of subsidizing the cost of pesticides.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We don’t want to remove subsidies from the agriculture sector,” Deutz said. “We’re trying to change the behavior that&#8217;s incentivized by the money.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some countries have made progress on subsidy reform, said the UN’s van den Heuvel. At least a dozen countries including Colombia have identified their subsidies that harm nature, which is the first step, he said. “There is better momentum than in the last decade,” he said. “Now countries are willing to investigate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet policy experts still worry that it will take decades to reform these systems. Part of the problem is that most governments are siloed — the agriculture and environmental ministries don’t talk to each other — and they often work against each other, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, the former minister of the environment and energy in Costa Rica. Environmental officials might be trying to protect pollinators while agricultural officials are subsidizing pollinator-killing pesticides.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And while many companies want to reduce their environmental footprint, they often don’t even know what subsidies they’re receiving, said Eva Zabey, the CEO of Business for Nature, a group that helps align corporate and environmental goals. “It will be a messy topic,” Zabey said of trying to reform subsidies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, world leaders agreed that the majority of money needed to close the finance gap — more than 70 percent — is meant to come from subsidy reform. O’Donnell says it’s “one of the biggest weaknesses in finance for the biodiversity framework.” Andrew Deutz of WWF echoed his concerns, saying that the number senior negotiators are most worried about is the $500 billion in subsidy reform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s the biggest number,” Deutz said, “and perhaps the most politically difficult one to address.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is more money enough?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Raising more money is a challenge, but there are also problems that money won’t fix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One has to do with how aid funding is managed. Much of the money that wealthy nations put toward conservation in developing countries is managed by an organization called the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). GEF disperses money to these low-income countries. Yet many of those countries say it’s burdensome to access GEF funds and argue that it’s controlled largely by wealthy nations. Developing countries want a new fund that gives lower-income countries more control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s not about developing countries begging for money,” said Lim Li Ching, a senior researcher at the Third World Network, which advocates for developing countries. “It really is about equity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Manuel Rodríguez, who now runs the GEF, says that concerns about how GEF manages foreign aid are misplaced. He says that donor countries have more power in determining where money goes “for evident and obvious reasons.” Blaming GEF, he said, is a political tactic employed by large, biodiversity-rich countries to gain more control over how funds are dispersed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Policy experts also point out that building new funds distracts from the main objective: to raise more money. “We have created a global myth that creating a new funding mechanism therefore means more funds,” O’Donnell said. “Just because you create a mechanism to distribute funds doesn’t mean someone is going to fill up the coffers.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Concerns about international aid tie into a much more fundamental problem of how global financial institutions are structured and the inequalities they perpetuate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the current environmental destruction takes place in poorer regions of the world — the Global South, for the most part. Industries in places like Bolivia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are destroying acre upon acre of forests. These countries are often blamed for that destruction; it’s their weak policies or poor enforcement that’s failing to restrict harmful activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But some scholars <a href=\"https://climatejustice.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2024/03/Exporting-Extinction-English.pdf\">argue</a> that much of the responsibility lies with the world’s big aid institutions, including development banks. These organizations, which lend money to poor regions, especially in a time of fiscal crisis, are governed by wealthy, or donor, countries. And the support they provide — whether loans or a restructuring of debt — can fuel the very industries that destroy the environment, including industrial agriculture, <a href=\"https://climatejustice.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2024/03/Exporting-Extinction-English.pdf\">according to</a> a recent report by the University of British Columbia, Third World Network, and a progressive think tank called the Climate and Community Project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, poor nations are, on the whole, in a huge amount of debt from these international lenders.&nbsp;The UN estimates that an eye-popping <a href=\"https://unctad.org/publication/world-of-debt\">3.3 billion</a> people live in countries with governments that spend more on debt interest payments than on the education or health of their citizens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Think about that statistic for a minute. It’s extreme: That’s about 40 percent of the world’s population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And all that debt they carry creates an incentive for countries to make tons of money quickly, which tends to fuel resource extraction. That’s partly because countries often need foreign currency to repay those debts, which they commonly earn through export commodities like soy that harm native landscapes. Frequently it also leads to countries loosening regulations on development in order to grow export industries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On top of all of that, loans often come with austerity measures that require countries to clamp down on public services. These cutbacks are often imposed on environmental agencies that enforce rules to safeguard nature. “The international financial architecture continues to supercharge extraction,” said Jessica Dempsey, a researcher at the University of British Columbia and one of the report authors. “That’s just making the problem worse and worse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to imagine solving environmental problems simply by raising more money. World leaders also need to upend deeply rooted systems that perpetuate wealth inequality and the harmful industries it fuels. There are a lot of ideas floating around about how to do this, from overhauling how lenders like the IMF and World Bank are governed to debt cancellation and closing tax loopholes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that won’t happen overnight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I mean, it’s a huge, huge task,” Lim said. “But then it’s also an imperative. If we don’t address it, we’ll just be [working] around the edges of making a difference.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Two years later, Nakamoto vanished seemingly forever. Since then, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-people-who-could-be-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto\">countless</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1b12azf/satoshi_nakamoto_was_john_nash_the_inventor_of/\">theories</a> on who the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/craig-wright-perjury-bitcoin-trial\">real Nakamoto</a> is have been advanced, with no single candidate coming out on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether Nakamoto’s anonymity is merely an entertaining mystery, a necessity for privacy, or a worrisome concern depends on who you ask. For filmmaker Cullen Hoback, whose documentary <em>Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery</em> premiered on HBO last week, finding the mysterious bitcoin founder is a matter of public interest — and Hoback believes he has unmasked him as a 39-year-old Canadian bitcoin developer named Peter Todd. Since the film’s release, Todd and other prominent voices in the community have dismissed Hoback’s arguments. According to them, Nakamoto remains an enigma. Many bitcoin enthusiasts prefer it that way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s obvious why the search has endured over the past 15 years. Bitcoin is far and away the most popular digital currency in the world, with a market cap of about $1.3 trillion at the time of writing. (For comparison, the second biggest, ethereum, has a market cap of $312 million.) For those who believe a decentralized alternative to government-issued currencies — like the US dollar — is crucial to protect individual privacy and freedom, Nakamoto is akin to Prometheus bringing the gift of fire from the gods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s this mind-boggling possibility: if <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-much-bitcoin-does-satoshi-nakamoto-own-number-will-blow-your-mind\">reports</a> that Nakamoto might hold as much as 1.1 million bitcoins are true, they could be sitting on a fortune of over $70 billion, making them one of the 25 wealthiest individuals on Earth, according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#495d947a3d78\">Forbes’ real-time billionaires ranking</a>. But Nakamoto doesn’t seem to have spent any of it — at least, not anything in their confirmed bitcoin wallets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What does it mean for the rest of us that such an enormous treasure chest remains in the hands of an unknown entity, whose true aims and intentions can’t be determined? Who benefits if Nakamoto remains in the shadows — and who benefits if they’re revealed?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What we know about the bitcoin creator</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The internet user Satoshi Nakamoto first appeared in 2008, when they published a paper to a cryptographic technology mailing list laying out a system that they had dubbed bitcoin. It would function as a form of digital cash that people could use to send money back and forth without involving any kind of bank. In other words, one could reliably make and receive payments completely anonymously.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was a clear ideological aim: in Nakamoto’s view, the ability to keep your financial record out of the surveillance and reach of powerful authorities, whether it’s large private banks or the government, is an important personal freedom. Such institutions, after all, aren’t infallible. In one illuminating forum post in 2009, <a href=\"https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source\">Nakamoto wrote</a> that “the root problem with conventional currency” was “trust.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve,” they continued. “We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” When Nakamoto created the very first block that would become the bitcoin blockchain, they included a message <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-genesis-block:-the-first-bitcoin-block\">referencing a headline</a> in the British newspaper The Times <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/chancellor-alistair-darling-on-brink-of-second-bailout-for-banks-n9l382mn62h\">that day</a>: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The top suspects, and why Nakamoto’s identity is still up for debate</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nakamoto’s writings indicate that they’re most likely someone with a strong understanding of economics, computer science, and modern cryptography — which involves methods and technologies for keeping information secure, like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22226618/what-is-signal-whatsapp-telegram-download-encrypted-messaging\">encrypting a message</a> that can only be unlocked with a special key. Unsurprisingly, the commonly advanced candidates for who Nakamoto could be are self-identified “cypherpunks” — a community of mainly computer scientists who advocate for using cryptography to protect digital privacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to Hoback, director of <em>Money Electric</em>, Peter Todd fits the bill. Todd is a libertarian pro-privacy advocate who, among other things, is a <a href=\"https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1646601411377999872\">huge</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1766100934503936511\">proponent</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1841832099923230804\">of using cash</a> because it’s harder for governments and banks to track your spending. As a teenager, he was already communicating with older, respected cypherpunks and seemed unusually knowledgeable about bitcoin despite his youth. Todd would have been 23 years old when the bitcoin white paper was published.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hoback builds his case primarily on the fact that Todd joined the message board Bitcointalk.org in 2010 right before Nakamoto stopped posting. But the crux of Hoback’s argument hinges on an interaction between Todd and Nakamoto on Bitcointalk. Nakamoto had <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2181.msg28729#msg28729\">posted something technical</a> about how bitcoin transactions work; about an hour and a half later, Todd <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2181.msg28739#msg28739\">replied</a> with a small disagreement. Hoback contends that the reply actually reads more like someone finishing their previous thought — that Todd had signed into the wrong account to make an addendum to the original Nakamoto post. In the film, he also points to a chat log in which Todd calls himself a foremost authority on sacrificing bitcoin, which Hoback connects to the fact that Nakamoto hasn’t done anything with their coins in all these years (at least, that we know of).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an intriguing interpretation, but not exactly a smoking gun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hoback, both in interviews and within <em>Money Electric</em>, portrays Todd as someone who enjoys playing games over whether he could be the bitcoin founder, laughing on camera as the filmmaker explains why he believes Todd is Nakamoto — at one point saying with a smirking grin, “Well, yeah. I’m Satoshi Nakamoto.” On X, though, Todd has <a href=\"https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1843789750983110697\">firmly denied</a> that he’s Nakamoto. In an email to Vox, Hoback wrote that Todd stopped speaking to him after filming this scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other main person of interest in <em>Money Electric</em> is Adam Back, a British cypherpunk in his 50s whose work toward a functional digital currency was cited in Nakamoto’s original bitcoin paper. One reason Hoback finds Back suspicious is that he became more active in the bitcoin world — specifically concerned with how to make transactions <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/27-year-old-codebreaker-busted-myth-bitcoins-anonymity/\">completely anonymous</a> — right after <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1832533#msg1832533\">speculation emerged</a> that Nakamoto controlled over 1 million bitcoins, more than previously thought. Unlike Todd, Back has stridently distanced himself from even joking suggestions that he could be Nakamoto.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other commonly floated contenders include prominent cypherpunk figures such as Hal Finney, who died in 2014 and was the recipient of the first test bitcoin transaction that Nakamoto sent, and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nick-szabo-bitcoin-hbo-satoshi-nakamoto\">Nick Szabo</a>, who came up with the concept of “smart contracts,” a crucial function of many blockchains today. One wild suggestion claims that the Japanese etymology behind Satoshi Nakamoto can roughly translate to “<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/\">central intelligence</a>,” a sign that bitcoin was in fact invented by the CIA as some sort of trap. Another conspiracy theory — practically a meme at this point — posits that Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk is the real Nakamoto. (He <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/elon-musk-denies-he-is-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto.html\">denies</a> it.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1341873890.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729780130345,100,78.540439739309\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A statue honoring the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, in Budapest, Hungary.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It isn’t clear whether Nakamoto is still alive, or even whether they’re one person rather than a group of people working together. Early this year, an unknown person <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-bitcoin-transfer-satoshi-genesis-block\">sent 26.9 bitcoins</a> (worth approximately $1.8 million today) to Nakamoto’s dormant wallet, firing up fresh excitement over where Nakamoto is and what they might be doing. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How do you track down a mystery like Nakamoto? Should you even try?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since 2011, Nakamoto hasn’t emailed or posted anywhere under their username. They also haven’t used the crypto wallets associated with that name.<strong> </strong>But even if someone is determined to remain in the shadows, and has left no obvious evidence giving them away, there are bound to be some breadcrumbs. Much of the theorizing around Nakamoto depends on analyzing their style of coding and writing. Hoback, at one point in the film, nods to the fact that <a href=\"https://mmalmi.github.io/satoshi/#email-24\">Nakamoto</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1644557915703869442\">Todd</a> both used slurs that could <a href=\"https://x.com/CullenHoback/status/1843893419443359867\">indicate immaturity</a>. Another commonly noted marker is that Nakamoto often used British English spelling (such as “favour”), and Todd is Canadian.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But other <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/reports/6858026.pdf\">linguistic comparisons</a> of <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/stylometric-analysis-satoshi-nakamoto-294926cdf995\">commonly used</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/05/who-is-the-real-satoshi-nakamoto-one-researcher-may-have-found-the-answer/?guccounter=1\">words and phrases</a> have been made that inconclusively point to other candidates. On the forum, Nakamoto often uses a double space at the start of a sentence, while Todd does not. Both Back and Todd pepper in dashes to break up clauses in a single sentence — Nakamoto doesn’t. Could the stylistic differences be a cunning, intentional misdirection? No one knows. Ultimately, none of these tics add up to definitive proof.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many in the bitcoin world conjecture that Nakamoto disappeared because WikiLeaks — the site where Julian Assange published many leaked documents — appeared poised to start accepting <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2019/04/26/how-bitcoin-and-wikileaks-saved-each-other/\">donations in bitcoin</a>, which might lead to more attention on Nakamoto. In one of their <a href=\"http://gavinandresen.ninja/eleven-years-ago-today\">last known communications</a>, Nakamoto wrote to bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, “I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle.” In the last known email, sent in April 2011, Nakamoto claimed they were no longer involved with bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s clear that Nakamoto never intend to out themselves — and, indeed, they seem to argue that there’s no point. Bitcoin is now out of their hands. So how much does their identity matter?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hoback argues that it matters a lot due to how important bitcoin has become. “Bitcoin is already being baked into our financial system,” he told Vox, referring to its acceptance as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency\">legal tender</a> in some countries and the fact that it could now be included in <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/bitcoin-funds-set-new-precedent-for-crypto-401k-ira-investing\">401(k)s</a>. Nakamoto potentially controls a significant portion of the total limited supply of bitcoin; if they one day decided to come forward and start moving (and spending) the coins in their possession, such an enormous sell-off could be destabilizing for the cryptocurrency. If they spend their riches, there’s also arguably a public interest in knowing where so much money is going, and whether it has any political impact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Acknowledging the possibility that Nakamoto could be multiple people, Hoback continued, “This group is making themselves super rich while saying no one should look into Satoshi. Isn’t that a little suspicious?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you believe that holding the powerful to account is important, then Nakamoto’s insistence on anonymity stands against the transparency that such accountability requires. It’s no secret that many of the world’s richest people have historically cleaved to remaining as private as possible, using <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/2024/3/13/24086102/billionaires-wealthy-tax-avoidance-loopholes\">elaborate financial structures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2023/1/4/23413342/us-tax-havens-billionaires-wealthy\">tax havens</a> to avoid scrutiny of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23604105/philanthropy-mackenzie-scott-elon-musk-billionaires-charity\">what their money is funding</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then again, there’s no proof that Nakamoto has spent any of their fortune. Their known bitcoin hoard is a rough value of net worth, not yet used for anything — and we know this because all bitcoin transactions are part of a public ledger. If they started cashing in their bitcoin stockpile, that could make it easier for people to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/untraceable-bitcoin-is-a-myth-11623860828\">find their real-life identity</a>, which is an incentive for Nakamoto to leave that stash untouched. (It is curious, though, that in late September about <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/satoshi-era-wallets-move-16m-075536741.html?guccounter=1\">$13 million worth of bitcoin</a> mined in the very early days of the cryptocurrency suddenly moved.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps there’s a better question than whether it matters who Nakamoto is: How important is it that the inventor of bitcoin remains a mystery?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the perspective of the cypherpunks, it’s crucial. There’s a financial motivation — the reveal of Nakamoto’s real identity could tank the price of bitcoin. But Nakamoto’s lasting anonymity is also an ideological resistance to government authority in an increasingly surveilled digital world. Many <a href=\"https://x.com/adam3us/status/1842503179130298492\">key</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/lopp/status/1753475690174058979\">figures</a> in the bitcoin community unequivocally express a desire for Nakamoto’s identity to stay a secret – according to Hoback, Todd seemed displeased that people had found Nakamoto’s million-plus bitcoin stash, and told him to leave Nakamoto alone. There’s also the potential danger someone could be in if others think they’re Nakamoto. In a comment to the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/has-bitcoins-elusive-creator-finally-been-unmasked\">New Yorker</a>, Todd told the publication that Hoback had put his safety at risk by accusing him of being a multi-billionaire, and that he would soon be doing “some unplanned travel.” (He has not responded to an email from Vox.) Todd isn’t wrong that prior attempts to unmask Nakamoto have disturbed people’s personal lives — take the case of Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a former engineer and programmer in California who was the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/face-behind-bitcoin-247957.html\">Newsweek report</a> claiming he was the bitcoin God. Dorian Nakamoto has categorically denied even knowing what cryptocurrencies are, and has said the accusation and public scrutiny caused a “great deal of confusion and stress” for him and his family. In response, Hoback told Vox that other people long suspected of being Nakamoto — like Nick Szabo and Adam Back — are fine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Toward the end of the <em>Money Electric</em>, Todd says that the hunt for bitcoin’s Nakamoto is yet another example of “journalists really missing the point.” The point, he elaborates, is “to make bitcoin the global currency.” But if that came to fruition — and it <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-ultimate-700k-portfolio-allocation\">isn’t close to becoming reality</a> yet — then ironically, Hoback’s argument for hunting down the bitcoin mastermind would only become more compelling to both the general public and almost certainly to governments around the world. The surest way to protect Nakamoto’s anonymity seems to be for bitcoin to not become a widespread alternative threatening government-issued currencies — to not become too important.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Smith</em></a>, first arrived on the Court’s doorstep in August 2023. Since then, the justices have met more than two dozen times to decide what to do about the case, and each time they’ve put the decision off until a future meeting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No one outside of the Court can know for sure why the justices keep delaying, but if you follow the Court’s Eighth Amendment cases closely, it’s easy to see how the <em>Hamm</em> case could open up all kinds of internal rifts among the justices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Eighth Amendment, which has a vague ban on “<a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-8/\">cruel and unusual punishments</a>,” is at the center of the <em>Hamm </em>case because, for decades, the Court has held this amendment forbids executions of<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html\">intellectually disabled</a> offenders (and offenders who <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/543/551/\">commit a crime while they are juveniles</a>). The idea is that both groups have diminished mental capacity, at least as compared to non-disabled adults, and thus bear less moral responsibility even for homicide crimes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That idea, however, has long been contested by the Court’s various ideological factions, and the <em>Hamm</em> case potentially reopens up all of the Court’s issues with the amendment at once. Indeed, in the worst-case scenario for criminal defendants, the justices could potentially overrule more than 60 years of precedents protecting against excessive punishments.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This Supreme Court’s ongoing battles over the Eighth Amendment, briefly explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In two 2000s decisions, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html\"><em>Atkins v. Virginia</em></a> (2002) and <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/543/551/\"><em>Roper v. Simmons</em></a> (2005), a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican justices handed down decisions that barred youths and people who are intellectually disabled from being executed. Those majority decisions came down over bitter dissents from the Court’s right flank — the same right flank that has since <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion\">gained a supermajority on the Supreme Court</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At least some of the current Court’s Republicans seem eager to use their newfound supermajority to blow up those two cases (and pretty much everything the Court has said about the Eighth Amendment in the last six or seven decades). So it’s possible that the Court is fighting over what to do with the <em>Hamm</em> case because many of the justices want a wholesale revolution in Eighth Amendment law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beginning in the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court maintained that the Eighth Amendment “must draw its meaning from the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/30/22187578/death-penalty-united-states-executions-decline-gregg-georgia-bucklew-precythe\">evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society</a>.” Thus, as a particular method of punishment grew less common, the Court was increasingly likely to declare it cruel and unusual in violation of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At least some members of the Court’s Republican majority, however, have suggested that this “evolving standards of decency” framework should be abandoned. In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf\"><em>Bucklew v. Precythe</em></a> (2019), the Court considered whether states could use execution methods that risked causing the dying inmate a great deal of pain. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion, which held that potentially painful methods of execution are allowed, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/30/22187578/death-penalty-united-states-executions-decline-gregg-georgia-bucklew-precythe\">seems to exist in a completely different universe</a> than the Court’s Eighth Amendment cases that look to evolving standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Court’s earlier opinions ask whether a particular form of punishment has fallen out of favor <em>today</em>, Gorsuch asked whether a method of punishment was out of favor <em>at the time of the founding</em>. Though his opinion does list some methods of execution, such as “disemboweling” and “burning alive” that violate the Eighth Amendment, Gorsuch wrote that these methods are unconstitutional because “by the time of the founding, these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become ‘unusual.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What makes <em>Bucklew</em> confusing, however, is that it didn’t explicitly overrule any of the previous decisions applying the evolving standards framework. So it’s unclear whether all five of the justices who joined that opinion share a desire to blow up more than a half-century of law, or if the justices who joined the <em>Bucklew </em>majority simply failed to rein in an overly ambitious opinion by Gorsuch, the Court’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22431044/neil-gorsuch-nihilism-supreme-court-voting-rights-lgbt-housing-obamacare-constitution\">most intellectually</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23184848/supreme-court-kennedy-bremerton-school-football-coach-prayer-neil-gorsuch\">sloppy justice</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, <em>Hamm</em> opens up at least two major potential divides within the Court. Smith says he is intellectually disabled; the state of Alabama wants to execute him anyway. So the case perfectly tees up a challenge to <em>Atkins</em> if a majority of the justices want to go there. Meanwhile, <em>Bucklew</em> looms like a vulture over any cruel and unusual punishment case heard by the Court, as it suggests that the Republican justices may hit the reset button on all of its Eighth Amendment precedents at any time.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So what is the specific legal issue in <em>Hamm</em>?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court receives thousands of petitions every year asking it to hear a particular appeal, and it typically <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/supreme-court-procedure/#:~:text=In%20most%20circumstances%2C%20the%20Supreme,argument%20in%20only%20about%2080.\">only grants several dozen of these petitions</a>. The vast majority of these cases are nominally discussed at one of the justices’ regular conferences, then promptly denied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, the Court often discusses a case in two different conferences before agreeing to hear it — for this reason, I and other Supreme Court reporters often watch the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/petitions-were-watching/\">list of cases the Court “relisted”</a> for a second conference to identify cases the justices are more likely to hear. Occasionally, a case may be relisted for several conferences in a row. But this is rare, and typically is a sign either that the justices are negotiating over which issues they wish to decide in a particular case — or, more often, that a justice is dissenting from the Court’s decision not to hear a case and the “relists” are really just buying that justice time to draft an opinion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Hamm</em>, however, has now been relisted in every single conference since the justices first discussed it on October 27, 2023. That is, to say the least, highly unusual. And it suggests that some particularly bitter internal negotiations are ongoing. If someone were dissenting from the Court’s decision to turn the case away, they likely would have released that dissent last July, because the justices typically try to resolve loose ends before they go on their summer vacation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Hamm </em>involves a question that would inevitably arise once the Court decided <em>Atkins</em> — though it is unconstitutional to execute intellectually disabled offenders, there will always be some offenders who are on the borderline of what mental health professionals consider an intellectual disability. The specific question before the Court is what to do with these borderline cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a general rule, someone must have an IQ of 70 or below to be considered intellectually disabled. But IQ tests aren’t particularly precise — as the Supreme Court acknowledged in <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/moore-v-texas-12\"><em>Moore v. Texas</em></a> (2017), the IQ of someone who scores 74 on a particular IQ test falls within “a range of 69 to 79.” So, if courts read IQ tests as if they can identify an offender’s IQ score exactly, an intellectually disabled person could be executed due to something as arbitrary as a measurement error.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Accordingly, the Court held in <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/hall-v-florida-7#p723\"><em>Hall v. Florida</em></a> (2014) that a capital offender with an IQ score slightly above 70 must be given “the opportunity to present evidence of his intellectual disability, including deficits in adaptive functioning over his lifetime.” That is, such an offender must be allowed to present additional evidence beyond their IQ score to show that they are, in fact, intellectually disabled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Hamm</em> is such a case. Smith took five different IQ tests, four of which showed him with an IQ in the low to mid-70s. Accordingly, two lower courts looked at additional evidence of his disability, determined he is, in fact, intellectually disabled, and ruled that he must receive a sentence other than death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In asking to execute Smith, in other words, Alabama is asking, among other things, that the Supreme Court overrule <em>Moore</em> and <em>Hall</em>, both cases that were handed down before former President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges\">remade the Court in the Federalist Society’s image</a>. If the Court agrees, that alone would be a very significant legal development, both because it could allow intellectually disabled inmates to be executed due to a testing error, and because it would be a severe blow to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/5/18/22440256/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-edwards-vannoy-abortion-criminal-justice-constitution-stare-decisis\">stare decisis</a> — the idea that judicial precedents shouldn’t be tossed out simply because the members of a court change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, this Court’s Republican majority has shown little regard for stare decisis, at least in cases that divide along partisan lines. Since Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation gave the Republican Party a supermajority on the Supreme Court in late 2020, the Court has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion\">behaved as if it was going down a checklist</a>, overruling liberal victories such as the cases establishing a constitutional right to abortion or the line of cases permitting affirmative action in limited circumstances, and replacing them with whatever outcome the GOP prefers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, while this process has been painful for Democrats and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/supreme-court/\">toxic for the Court’s approval rating</a>, it hasn’t been comprehensive — occasionally, one or more of the Republican justices signal that they will allow a previous liberal victory to remain in effect. Concurring in the Court’s decision to overrule <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, for example, Justice Brett Kavanaugh identified the Court’s past decisions <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\">protecting a right to contraception, as well as the right to marry a person of your own choosing</a>, as cases he did not intend to overrule.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of which is a long way of saying that there’s no good way to know if <em>Atkins</em> or <em>Roper</em> is on the Court’s checklist of past liberal decisions to be overruled. These justices’ approaches to specific cases are often idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and unbound by preexisting law — just look at the Republican justices’ recent decision holding that Trump was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">allowed to commit many crimes while he was in office</a>. The question of whether <em>Atkins</em> survives or falls will turn on whether there are five justices who want intellectually disabled people to be executed, and nothing else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the fact <em>Hamm</em> has been relisted so many times suggests, at the very least, that there is a vocal faction within the Supreme Court that wants to use this case to aggressively reshape the law.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can be made of <em>Bucklew</em>?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other uncertainty looming over <em>Hamm</em> is the <em>Bucklew</em> decision, which didn’t so much overrule the Court’s last six decades of Eighth Amendment precedents as pretend that they didn’t exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Bucklew</em> involved a death row inmate who claimed that the Eighth Amendment would not allow him to be executed using Missouri’s lethal injection protocol — he said he had an unusual medical condition that would cause him to experience extraordinary pain before his death. So the question was whether the Constitution allows a state to execute an inmate in a manner that may amount to torture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gorsuch’s opinion denying relief to this inmate reads like the Court’s “evolving standards of decency” framework never existed. This phrase appears nowhere in Gorsuch’s opinion, and the only citation to <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/356/86/\"><em>Trop v. Dulles</em></a> (1958), the first Supreme Court case to use that phrase, appears in Justice Stephen Breyer’s dissent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rather than follow longstanding law, Gorsuch asked whether capital offenders could be subjected to similar pain “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf\">at the time of the framing</a>.” This is the Eighth Amendment rule long favored by the Court’s rightmost flank, including in Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissenting opinion in <em>Atkins</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scalia’s <em>Atkins</em> dissent, moreover, doesn’t simply disagree with the Court’s past decisions. It lays out many examples of how the law would change — and how much easier it would be to subject even minor criminal offenders to outlandish punishments — under a framework that looks to how things worked in the 1790s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For starters, Scalia argues that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZD1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">only “severely or profoundly” intellectually disabled people</a> enjoy some protection against execution (he argues these individuals were often “committed to civil confinement or made wards of the State” rather than being criminally punished). One of the sources Scalia cites suggests that only people with an IQ of 25 or below enjoy any constitutional protection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More significantly, Scalia also argues that the Eighth Amendment only forbids “always-and-everywhere ‘cruel’ punishments, such as the rack and the thumbscrew,” and that it does not prohibit the government from imposing excessive punishments for minor crimes. Under Scalia’s framework, if the death penalty can constitutionally be applied to murderers (and he believes it can) then it can also be applied to shoplifters. If a rapist can be sentenced to life in prison, so too can a jaywalker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gorsuch’s <em>Bucklew</em> opinion elaborates on the sort of punishments that, under this <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21497317/originalism-amy-coney-barrett-constitution-supreme-court\">originalist</a> framework, are prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. He lists “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf\">dragging the prisoner to the place of execution, disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and burning alive</a>” as examples.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So there is a faction within the Supreme Court that would drastically shrink Americans’ constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. This faction would allow more people to be executed. They would apparently eliminate any concern that punishments must be proportionate to the crime. And the kinds of punishments they do offer up as examples of impermissible sanctions are the kinds of things normally depicted in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFFvI0IQpt8\">torture scenes from movies set in the Middle Ages</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Will five justices go there? It’s impossible to know. But that a total of five justices joined Gorsuch’s opinion in <em>Bucklew</em> suggests this faction could very well prevail — if and when the Court decides to take up <em>Hamm</em>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But starting in the 1960s, this class divide began narrowing gradually, as white voters with college diplomas drifted left while those without them shifted right, in a process political analysts have dubbed “<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/education-polarization-diploma-divide-democratic-party-working-class.html\">education polarization</a>.” By 2004, college graduates were more Democratic than working-class voters. And Donald Trump’s conquest of the GOP accelerated this realignment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2016, for the first time since at least 1948 when the American National Election Studies (ANES) survey began collecting data, white voters in the top 5 percent of America’s income distribution voted for Democrats at a higher rate than those in the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution. This same pattern of support repeated in 2020, according to <a href=\"https://x.com/thomasjwood/status/1375231548237213699\">an analysis</a> from Ohio State political scientist Tom Wood. In the latter election, Democrats also lost ground with nonwhite voters without college degrees, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hzqbc0gambbp7fidn3wld/wh2020_public_release_crosstabs.xlsx?rlkey=8s3u9u0o64yczmt77kya2ckx1&amp;e=2&amp;dl=0\">according to Catalist</a>, a Democratic data firm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rightward drift of America’s working class disconcerted progressives, who generated a variety of ideas for reversing it. But one of their <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2016/06/white-working-class-new-deal-racism-reagan-democrats/\">primary</a> <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/right-to-work-laws-are-killing-democrats-at-the-ballot-box/\">prescriptions</a> could be <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/democrats-paid-a-huge-price-for-letting-unions-die.html\">summarized</a> in a single word: unions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, the erosion of Democrats’ working-class support had coincided with the collapse of organized labor in the United States. There were <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/education-polarization-diploma-divide-democratic-party-working-class.html\">many reasons</a> to think the latter had caused the former.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, to prevent Democrats’ working-class support from diminishing further, the thinking went, the party needed to deliver for existing trade unions, whose demands Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/nafta-twenty-years-disaster/\">sometimes</a> <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-passes-teachers-testbarely/story?id=14003658\">defied</a>. Meanwhile, to lay the seeds for a broader realignment of working-class voters, Democrats needed to make it easier for workers to organize by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22307891/democrats-unions-pro-act-policy-feedback\">reforming federal labor laws</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration appears to have embraced this analysis. In his presidency’s first major piece of legislation, Biden <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/08/biden-teamster-federal-bailout-pension-fund/10855066002/\">bailed out</a> the Teamsters’ pension funds, effectively transferring $36 billion to 350,000 of the union’s members.

And although he failed to enact major changes to federal labor regulations, that was not for want of trying. In the estimation of labor <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2024/05/bidens-labor-report-card-historian-gives-union-joe-higher-grade-any-president-fdr/397002/\">historian Erik Loomis,</a> Biden has been the most pro-union president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the political return on Democrats’ investment in organized labor has been disappointing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last month, the Teamsters declined to make a presidential endorsement, after an internal survey found <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/18/teamsters-no-endorsement-2024-election-00179900\">60 percent</a> of its membership backed Trump over Kamala Harris. In early October, the International Association of Fire Fighters <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4914399-firefighters-union-iaff-endorsement-trump-harris-race/\">also announced</a> that they would not be making a presidential endorsement, despite backing Biden four years earlier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These high-profile snubs — both driven by rank-and-file opposition to the Democratic nominee — may reflect a broader political trend. According to a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/30/union-voters-decide-presidential-election-pro-worker-policies\">report</a> from the Center for American Progress, between 2012 and 2016, the Democratic presidential nominee’s share of union voters fell from 66 to 53 percent. Four years ago, Biden erased roughly half of that gap, claiming 60 percent of the union vote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But contemporary polling indicates that Democrats have lost ground with unionized voters since then. In fact, according to an <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnns-harry-enten-says-kamala-harris-headed-for-worst-democratic-performance-in-a-generation-among-union-voters/\">aggregation from CNN’s Harry Enten</a>, Kamala Harris is on track to perform even worse with union households than Hillary Clinton did in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some on the left have a simple explanation for why a historically pro-union presidency hasn’t bought the Democrats many union votes: Kamala Harris is not Joe Biden, and she <a href=\"https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1841940145882194018\">lacks his credibility on labor issues</a>. This theory is unsatisfying because Biden’s numbers with union voters early this year were roughly as bad as Harris’s are today. In February, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/union-households-favor-biden-closer-margin-2020-poll-finds-rcna140569\">NBC News</a> found Biden winning only 50 percent of voters from union households.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this raises the possibility that organized labor’s capacity to prevent working-class voters from drifting out of the Democratic tent is more limited than progressives had hoped. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this means that Democrats would derive no political benefit from a stronger labor movement. And it certainly does not undermine the substantive case for collective bargaining as a means of <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24587\">reducing inequality</a> and safeguarding workers’ interests. But the trends outlined above suggest that&nbsp;delivering for unions and helping them expand may be insufficient to dramatically<em> </em>improve the party’s performance with working-class voters in general and white ones in particular.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why unions don’t necessarily make their members more liberal&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Progressives have long believed that organized labor is a liberalizing force, and the notion that unions influence their members’ political views — to Democrats’ benefit — is far from baseless. The party <a href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/unions-critical-democratic-partys-electoral-success/\">consistently performs better</a> with unionized voters than nonunionized ones. Historically, this held true within demographic groups, with unionized white workers backing Democrats at higher rates than their nonunionized counterparts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many unions also actively engage in politically educating their members. Theoretically, unions that represent diverse memberships should discourage racial prejudice, as solidarity is indispensable to successful organizing and labor actions. A <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12537\">2021 paper</a> by the political scientists Paul Frymer and Jacob Grumbach found that white voters who gained union membership between 2010 and 2016 tended to display lower levels of racial resentment after getting their union cards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is reason to think that unions’ capacity to liberalize the views of non-college-educated voters has declined in the Trump era. According to the Democratic data scientist David Shor, his party’s “union premium” — the degree to which Democrats perform better with union voters, when controlling for all other demographic variables — dropped <a href=\"https://x.com/davidshor/status/1488621333101613059\">nearly to zero in 2020</a>. Democrats still did better with unionized workers than nonunionized ones that year. Extrapolating from Shor’s math, this was almost entirely attributable to the demographic traits of America’s unionized population, which is <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/who-are-todays-union-workers/\">more highly educated and less Southern</a> than the American electorate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More broadly, a <a href=\"https://elsevier-ssrn-document-store-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/24/03/06/ssrn_id4615336_code2539179.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAkaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIG%2B0dBUmWs25uMfyi4JLjMM6qVhBWKWP%2BTR0sGzKpcNiAiAw6ENx%2BVIM%2Buih8r3ETxOWBZMoI5GK02Jd%2BCjxQOifKSq8BQhiEAQaDDMwODQ3NTMwMTI1NyIMZ9yOXQY2%2Furv48xNKpkF40uSQ2OdvfepqX%2BjmssT73rDIpCr7maauFyPQ3bTesikmCtE3PpLrd0crPH8UryzYZo87MvRehVC%2F4jhLbPSnih4A1u3OwpaC3V42Uc71fSXcrzFWkezGezhizm8GpJTMPf%2Bictfrf8nOqbKNv2qoLFz1DBy0%2Bf2Sqo%2F%2FP0EyHXHQ22KwPPWhsf6dkS6KRBQlmIs5Nhh73%2FnHLBgYpX8fwEGB8eNGo1mSteC%2BwWUZuJKPxzhb4JfPY7r0DnfRgag7Np%2BibhKrV2vlsV8Rtl6f8ESnNGhvpOLJcco0ucsx8ZTxxBqRhgN6dCybOMyrZ4B0KZki8W200vYExMIgO4lmm8r7QATX7qzg3Djw1dIm0OGT7rDdpT3QUZg%2BsPz1S9HLajxsu1ReEiexhmg%2Fv65NHELIgtXhxN9B5x%2BsgZUYICKwtVvJUjNySUGVOvcQtCmkvrkzk62x3zf4UXvirHWnCnTqRZDmC2AMEhUTnkQFn35b18hz5rAqqyNaOaU2J7xTj1hRjioIKP7QgMFU5heP%2BiRZ%2Bx9zpEpq280127xMytIcVd3CHWkP6hSSK0dsRD2%2BeT3iaFvaHDxWkuqSRdy5fmEMXCnCobQxGTshW1rlduZMVKgFDoDg9mhMF1SQmBnEU2n%2BfkC54uG4gWo2cW8QtEXwuIaqlER%2FtZHDoxbJz%2BdLSEiB5M4dlu963JFCEKgrdU1dr0ZHJB38mwmDuQrTDn47ZDHQ0S%2FZaXgIvsEuYxHWenU%2B5qPjkFGNzB44ZGDohssnjR5vhfQYNRl21dWG5scP%2FUtEUxCSfUS%2FCTu4QCEJ1E%2FxlJgd13%2Ftr7xwGpQVyWMWLSlwJ5SKSmVQ6cMIgTpjr076egL4XrOJoVr7C7mH57PErrkhEAw4u2auAY6sgEmpKxu%2FrldrzDB0w2UhU5attod7Hequ5Ri4prxzhUG36VZoph1iG%2BFqL86WLmMhcH%2BlsOxD0pOqc2elFtnvy4bQfhaPjmj%2Fh1OcpX9XMo8HGzwfhNi90Anmg7hOkLdejBn7xrmmAV2Xb3LavastZXAoR4Cuadgl1XIlrclzR%2BEINp8kVptjUn6PZ5wH6mSyezQLyMKzMJv%2B%2BcuSOQnt7TIX%2Fb2P%2BLaSDWi%2FGy3JvenmAtA&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20241009T180816Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAUPUUPRWEW3TWLQYO%2F20241009%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=90ab144a83ee403c540395b1698edd13b5b7525e0271c6349c665f3144eac2ef\">recent study</a> from Alan Yan, a political science graduate student at UC Berkeley, suggests that unions’ historical tendency to liberalize their members’ views has been widely exaggerated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To evaluate the impact of union membership on voters’ political views, Yan examines 13 panel surveys — in other words, polls of the same group of voters across multiple election cycles — conducted between 1956 and 2020. He looks at voters’ preferred party and issue positions in the election year before they gained union membership and in subsequent elections, when they were unionized. Controlling for other variables, he finds that the typical voter’s views barely change at all upon joining a union.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yan also offers some theoretical arguments for why this result makes sense. For one thing, political scientists generally believe that voters’ political identities tend to crystallize in early adulthood, much earlier than they usually gain union membership. By the time a given voter arrives in a unionized shop, therefore, their political views may be largely fixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Furthermore, many unions make little effort to politicize their memberships. In the 2016 Cooperative Election Study — a large sample survey — only 20 percent of union members reported frequent political discussions with coworkers, according to Yan, while 39 percent could not remember ever being contacted by their union in the previous two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Daniel Schlozman, a Johns Hopkins University political scientist whose work has focused on the relationship between organized labor and the Democratic Party, says that he finds Yan’s results unsurprising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In many European countries in the early 20th century, unions often pervaded nearly every aspect of their members’ lives, not only mediating their workplace disputes, but providing gathering halls and clubs, <a href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095850580\">mutual aid programs</a>, and political parties. In that context, Schlozman would expect unions to shape the politics of their members more thoroughly. In the modern United States, by contrast — where unions have a light footprint outside the job site and myriad religious, ethnic, and ideological divisions inform voters’ politics — it makes sense that union leaders can’t dictate a party line to their members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In a big pluralistic country where we are not pillarized like Austria in the old days — where you join your union and then go to your social democratic stamp collecting club — union membership is just not going to be as powerful a force in determining political behavior” as other social attachments and identities, Schlozman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, there’s some reason to think that Yan’s paper understates unions’ political influence on their members. In an interview with Vox, Princeton political scientist Paul Frymer noted that during many of the years Yan studies — particularly in the 1950s and ’60s — many unions were still profoundly racist institutions, which one would scarcely expect to liberalize their memberships. “If a lot of unions are fighting integration, fighting immigrants, fighting the inclusion of Black Americans, of women,” Frymer said, “then yeah, that&#8217;s just going to create a push the other way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yan and Frymer agree that some unions do successfully promote progressive political views among their members. But this requires both a leadership committed to evangelizing for liberal politics and a membership that’s open to such political messaging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To the extent that education polarization and culture wars render many working-class union members skeptical of progressive messaging, their union leaders will have an incentive to back away from internal political advocacy. After all, such leaders ultimately need to win reelection in order to retain their positions. This could theoretically create a self-reinforcing dynamic in which the less Democratic a union’s members become, the less their leaders try to sell members on progressive politics, which then leads members to become even less Democratic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Yan notes, even teachers unions, whose members tend to be better educated than union members, often focus on compensation rather than partisan politics because the latter divides their memberships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Further, in <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/ahertel/files/ilrr_hfkk.pdf\">a 2020 survey experiment</a>, researchers from Columbia and MIT measure how workers’ interest in joining a hypothetical labor organization changed as different characteristics of that union were emphasized. When told that this union would campaign for pro-worker politicians in elections, the surveyed workers became less likely to want to join. If this result is representative, then many union leaders have a structural incentive to focus narrowly on bread-and-butter issues and keep quiet about their Democratic sympathies (to the extent that they possess them).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why unions are still good for Democrats</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this said, Democrats are still likely to benefit politically from delivering for labor unions and helping them grow. Even if such organizations can’t persuade their more culturally conservative members to vote for Democrats, they can help to mobilize the progressives within their ranks, since unions are <a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/300871_hvd_ash_union_impact_v2.pdf\">effective</a> at promoting higher voter turnout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Separately, unions are major funders of Democratic campaigns, with almost <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?ind=P\">90 percent</a> of organized labor’s political contributions going into Democrats’ coffers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it is possible that a larger and more self-confident labor movement would also be a more politically effective one. “As unions have retreated, even as they have put more efforts into politics and kept up their formal ties to the Democratic Party, their sociocultural imprint has declined,” Schlozman said. “It would not surprise me that union members feel less tied into the culture of unionism that would tie them into the Democrats.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Were Democrats to successfully promote a wave of unionization through labor law reform, unions could become more culturally relevant. Perhaps most importantly, a more powerful labor movement could nudge the Democratic Party’s issue positions into closer alignment with those of American workers. As unions have declined, power in the Democratic coalition has shifted away from organizations that represent mass working-class memberships and toward nonprofits that are accountable primarily to their wealthy, ideologically motivated donors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Labor alone can’t build a more working-class Democratic Party&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, the Biden era should temper expectations of what organized labor can politically achieve, at least by itself. Perhaps, Biden’s historically pro-union policies would have paid more dividends if he had not also presided over inflation and the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/23/biden-social-safety-net-2024-00128488\">expiration of various social welfare benefits</a> established during the Covid crisis. The president’s advanced age surely did not help matters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it remains the case that, under Biden, Democrats have seen their poll numbers with union voters decline at the presidential level, even as their support for organized labor’s interests increased. All the while, education polarization has continued apace. In the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/08/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html\">most recent New York Times/Siena poll</a>, Trump wins non-college-educated white voters by 30 points, while Harris wins college-educated ones by 23. And although the Democrat wins working-class nonwhite voters overwhelmingly, her margin among them is 8 points narrower than her margin among nonwhite Americans with college degrees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats should not lessen their support for organized labor in light of these disappointing trends. But they should lower their expectations for what they’re likely to gain from delivering for individual unions with politically diverse memberships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, education polarization does not look all that calamitous for the Democratic Party. The share of voters with college degrees is growing over time. In part because she is winning a historically large share of college graduates, Harris is currently competitive with Trump in enough states to win an Electoral College majority, <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">according to Nate Silver’s polling averages</a>. But in order to win comfortable Senate majorities and prevent figures like Donald Trump from remaining competitive in national elections, Democrats will need to improve their standing with working-class voters. Delivering for unions may be necessary for achieving that goal. But if the past four years are any guide, it will not be sufficient. <br><br><em><strong>Correction, October 17, 4:00 pm: </strong>A previous version of this story misquoted Daniel Schlozman as saying, “In a big pluralistic country where we are not polarized like Austria in the old days.” He actually said “pillarized.” </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In an appearance on <em>Special Report With Bret Baier</em>, she was asked about some of the American right’s top fascinations and talking points: gender-affirming surgeries, Joe Biden’s mental acuity, the prospect of war with Iran. And — of course — she got tough questions about immigration policy and the southern border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was in answering those questions that Harris demonstrated how much the Democratic Party is moving right — toward the ideological center on immigration — under the banner of her candidacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She chose not to defend the virtue of immigration, or of immigrants themselves, and continued to cede the playing field to the right. There were no references to the nation’s immigrant roots or the value of those immigrants (here legally or not) that Baier kept asking about. And there was no condemnation of Donald Trump’s stated plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. She didn’t mention it, even as he pitches invoking archaic laws to round up and deport millions of people living in the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, Harris used the interview to further distance herself from her past and her party’s left flank on immigration. Did she regret the immigrant-friendly positions she took in 2019 to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for driver’s licenses, qualify for free tuition at some universities, or <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/fact-check-gop-trump-charge-kamala-harris-immigrant-health-care/\">obtain</a> public health insurance under a universal plan?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not <em>no</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Listen, that was five years ago, and I’m very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again,” Harris responded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>If so</em>, Baier followed up, <em>why did she select a running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, who signed some of those same proposals into state law in Minnesota?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris paused before saying that her ticket is “very clear that we must support and enforce federal law and that is exactly what we will do.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so the pattern repeated itself: Given opportunities to defend migrants in the face of classic right-wing fearmongering (as when she was asked about “single adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes”), Harris would cede the premise and pivot to the bipartisan border bill Biden <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/5/24062710/senate-immigration-bill-border-security-ukraine-2024\">proposed earlier this year that Trump helped tank</a>. She did the same when asked if she regretted the Biden administration’s repeal of Trump-era executive orders restricting immigration — citing a bill the White House proposed that she said would’ve “fixed our immigration system.” But she omitted that it also would have provided a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1177#:~:text=This%20bill%20establishes%20a%20path,status%20of%20lawful%20prospective%20immigrant.\">pathway to citizenship</a> for certain undocumented immigrants already living in the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This all <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/kamala-harris-immigration-policy/680214/\">continues a trend</a> for Harris. Just last week, at a town hall hosted by the Spanish-language media network Univision, Harris was twice presented with opportunities to invoke and condemn Trump’s mass deportation plans when speaking to attendees who had family who were deported or unable to get health care because they lacked legal status. She passed on that chance, instead referencing her past support for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipients before pivoting to talk about reviving the bipartisan border bill. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And since becoming the nominee and headlining a national party convention that tended to reference immigration in the context of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/368138/dnc-immigration-border-security-latino-voters\">needing more hardline border policies</a>, she’s continued to push for a bipartisan border bill that many progressive and liberal immigration advocacy groups and members of her own party <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/374661/kamala-harris-immigration-border-visit-arizona-activist-problem-election\">don’t support</a>. Those critics are still biting their tongues — pointing out the need to unite to win the election and keep a roundly anti-immigrant Trump from controlling the executive branch — but that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/369177/democrats-kamala-harris-truce-immigration-progressive-border-security\">truce</a> will only hold as far as November 5.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In an age when you can buy almost anything online without interacting with another human being, where you can easily shop around for the best deal, cars remain one of the few purchases where your personal negotiation skills — as well as, sometimes, your race, gender, and income — can determine the price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/explain-it-to-me-newsletter-sign-up\">Explain It to Me newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newsletter is part of Vox’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me\">Explain It to Me</a>. Each week, we tackle a question from our audience and deliver a digestible explainer from one of our journalists. Have a question you want us to answer? Ask us <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/ask-vox\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sometimes, the tactics car salespeople use go beyond just the hard sell to the downright deceptive. One common trap is <a href=\"https://www.theconsumerlawgroup.com/blog/consumers-beware-of-bait-and-switch-tactics-by-car-dealers.cfm\">bait and switch</a> prices, where a car is initially advertised as one price (usually achieved by piling on discounts that you may not qualify for). When you run to the dealership to snag the deal, you’re told the vehicle has already been sold but there’s a similar one that’s more expensive. Or take <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/02/07/1155014842/how-car-buyers-can-become-entrapped-in-whats-known-as-a-yo-yo-sale\">yo-yo sales</a>, in which you drive your new car home only to be told a few days later that the financing fell through so you’ll have to accept a higher interest rate or make a bigger down payment. A dealer might also try to sneak unneeded <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/08/car-dealers-included-add-ons-without-consumers-consent-discriminated-against-black-latino-buyers\">add-ons</a> — like extended warranties or protective coatings — onto the total price of the car.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, the Federal Trade Commission received more than <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/federal.trade.commission/viz/TheBigViewAllSentinelReports/TopReports\">184,000</a> auto-related consumer complaints, making it the third most common category after complaints about credit bureaus, as well as banks and lenders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While there are some fair dealers, the car marketplace has “a lot of sharp and unethical business practices, and consumers are hurt by it,” says Chuck Bell, programs director of advocacy at Consumer Reports. “By the time that the consumer gets out the door, they feel like they’ve been doing battle.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why is shopping for cars done this way?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first hint that you’re on unequal footing with a car salesperson comes when they’re cagey about giving a price quote even over the phone, let alone in writing. McParland says that the dealers he calls around to for clients often tell him that he has to come to the dealership for a price. “They’re basically just telling us to go pound sand,” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dealers want you to come in because it’s much easier to upsell you that way. You’ve invested some effort into the process, and the salesperson can get a better read on how impatient you are to buy a car, how inexperienced you are with car shopping, and plenty of other factors to wield to their advantage. On the other hand, if they offer you an out-the-door price — which includes all extras and fees — before you ever meet in person, you could easily take the price to a competing dealer and ask if they can do better.&nbsp;While online used car dealers like CarMax and Carvana did make “no haggle” car prices more popular, they often come at a premium, according to McParland. Some traditional car dealers now offer fixed prices too, but it’s probably to your benefit to try to negotiate down.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How did the system get to be like this?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The general practice of negotiating car prices instead of paying a fixed price may actually stem from <a href=\"https://priceonomics.com/why-do-we-haggle-for-cars/\">horse trading</a>, in which sellers and buyers also haggled and buyers would even trade in their old horse to offset the price of the new one, much as we do with cars today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The model has endured for so long, though, in part thanks to state franchise laws that ensure these middlemen car dealerships can’t be easily cut out. Most states ban carmakers from selling directly to consumers. Tesla is the rare exception of a car company that sells directly, and it has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/23/ohio-car-dealers-challenge-teslas-business-model.html\">battled</a> with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tesla-louisiana-car-dealers-federal-court-1dc44a5917731954de18f8455b9bad0b\">car dealers</a> for the right to do so. Car dealer trade groups have considerable <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/05/rich-republicans-party-car-dealers-2024-desantis.html\">political power</a>, and they’re organized enough and deep-pocketed enough to lobby against reforms that would threaten the status quo, such as changing franchise laws that give them exclusive rights to sell a certain car brand in a particular territory. The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), for its part, argues that <a href=\"https://www.nada.org/nada/issues/franchise-system\">franchise laws</a> in fact increase competitiveness and benefit the consumer, all the while creating local jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re an enormously powerful lobby,” says Bell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just look at how the industry pushed back against enforcement curtailing auto lending discrimination. Car dealers often arrange financing for customers, but they add a mark-up to the interest rate offered by banks because they can pocket that extra money for themselves. How much of a mark-up is applied is at the dealer’s discretion, and unlike mortgage lenders, they’re not required to collect data on the race of their customers, making it much harder to see if they’re complying with fair lending laws. Research shows that car dealers often charge <a href=\"https://www.nclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/report-time-to-stop-racing-cars-april2019.pdf\">higher interest rates</a> to <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/profitwise-news-and-views/2023/discrimination-auto-loan-market\">people of color</a>. When the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau started cracking down on this practice in 2013, the industry <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/11/23/car-dealers-have-their-way-with-congress/\">fought back</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/17/17248340/congressional-review-act-auto-loan-discrimination-cfpb\">won</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Is there any hope for making the car-buying process better?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, there’s reason to be optimistic about the future of shopping for cars. Late last year, the FTC announced <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-cars-rule-combating-auto-retail-scams-dealers-guide\">new regulation</a> that takes aim at the most rampant deceptive practices used by car dealers. It would, for one, require dealers to disclose the full, out-the-door price of a car, including all add-ons, before a customer visits the dealership. The price and other terms related to purchase of the car also have to be expressed in simple language. Dealers also wouldn’t be allowed to charge customers for useless add-ons. The FTC estimates the rule will <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-announces-cars-rule-fight-scams-vehicle-shopping\">save customers $3.4 billion</a> and cut down the time spent shopping for cars by 72 million hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rule was supposed to go into effect this summer but was delayed after two car dealer trade groups, including NADA, <a href=\"https://www.nada.org/nada/nada-headlines/nada-files-federal-court-challenge-stop-ftcs-vehicle-shopping-rule\">filed a challenge</a>.<strong> </strong>The association told Vox that the rule would make the car-buying experience worse. “Consumers will have to spend an additional 60-80 minutes at the dealership, complete up to five new, untested forms, and will lose at least $1.3 billion a year in time as a result of this rule,” a spokesperson wrote in an email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Bell is confident that the rule will ultimately go into effect, and if you’re looking for a car, you should behave as though these protections already apply. McParland advises asking dealers to provide, over email, an “itemized out-the-door price” on the vehicle you’re interested in. If they refuse, “that’s usually a red flag, so move on to somebody else,” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was featured in the Explain It to Me newsletter.

But for Zoomers just entering the workforce, the challenges are also coupled with a lot of uncertainty. And that combination is what brought Carolina to us with her question on this week’s episode of <em>Explain It to Me</em>, Vox’s go-to hotline for all your questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carolina is fresh out of college and already stressing about retirement. The older people in her life give her the same advice that generations before her have gotten: start saving immediately, contribute to your 401(k), and don’t touch it for decades until you’re ready to stop working.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s sound advice, but Carolina wonders if it applies to her and the rest of her cohort. She knows the havoc the Great Recession wreaked on everyday people and the economy at large. “I think people assume the stock market is always safe,” she says. “But then it keeps crashing.” It&#8217;s understandable why someone might be hesitant to put their trust in a financial system that had <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed\">a scare as recently as this summer</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To answer this question, we enlisted <a href=\"https://www.yourrichbff.com/about-me\">Vivian Tu, a.k.a. Your Rich BFF.</a> Vivian is a former Wall Street day trader and currently hosts <em>Networth and Chill</em> (<em>Explain It to Me </em>and <em>Networth and Chill</em> are both part of the Vox Media Podcast Network).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Can you enjoy today while preparing for the future? “You&#8217;ve got the folks who say ‘I&#8217;m going to blow all my cash today. I&#8217;m going to go on a shopping spree, because who knows if I get to retire in however many years.’” Tu says. “Then there are folks on the opposite side of the spectrum that say, ‘I need to prepare. I need to only think about retirement…I will have the worst life today so I can have a better future.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We sat down with Tu to discuss how to plan for the future while enjoying the now, how to protect yourself from financial uncertainty, and how younger generations can adjust to a changing financial landscape.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can listen to <em>Explain It to Me</em> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/explain-it-to-me/id1042433083\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1vSUO6Bg4abtjRF7fnGpT1\">Spotify</a>, or <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/explainit?sid=site\">wherever you get podcasts</a>.

You are allowed to enjoy your life today. I promise you, you are not put on this big green earth to work a 9 to 5 to hate your life. That is not your ultimate purpose. You are allowed to have the little treat. You are allowed to take that trip. You are allowed to go and grab a manicure with a friend because it is fun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You do not want to have so much fun today at the expense of future you. You want to be able to have fun today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Practically, what tips do you have for young people who are thinking about retirement?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I always tell everyone, there is a special Your Rich BFF method: you need to STRIP. Everyone says, “Oh, did I pick the wrong career?” No, STRIP is an acronym.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">S stands for savings. First and foremost you want to set aside an emergency fund. In particular, I recommend putting your emergency fund into a <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/high-yield-online-savings-accounts\">high-yield savings account</a> so that your money waiting for that rainy day earns interest in the meantime. If you are a singleton, three to six months of living expenses is a good bet. If you are head of household, you have dependents, I would say closer to 6 to 12. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">T is total debt. A lot of us have debt — that is not a bad word. It is just a tool. What I say is rank it from highest to lowest interest rate. Make the minimum payment across everything to keep your credit score high. But then any additional funds you have for debt paydown goes towards the interest rate that is the highest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Up next R: retirement. Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts through your job. You can also open up an IRA or a Roth IRA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then I. This is important; it&#8217;s not enough to just open those accounts, you actually have to invest. Take the cash that you&#8217;re putting into those accounts and make investments that make sense based on your risk profile. <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/education/retirement/what-is-a-target-date-fund\">Target date retirement funds</a> or <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\">index funds</a> often make sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the last step is so critically important: P — plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You don&#8217;t get to have happily ever after, you don&#8217;t get to ride off into the sunset if you do not have a plan. Write down what your goals are, what those milestones are, what you’d like to accomplish, the amount of money it&#8217;s going to take to get you there, and then back into what you need to do to get there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How do you protect yourself and those investments from another financial crisis?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s really important that your portfolio makes sense for how far you are away from retirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So when you&#8217;re 20, yeah, you can be 100 percent or 90 percent in the stock market and have 0 percent or 10 percent in bonds. When you&#8217;re 50, it should look almost flipped. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it really depends on how much you&#8217;re making and how much you already have. Every single person is a little different.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What about people who are just getting by? How should they prioritize retirement savings?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If they are just getting by, first and foremost we want to try and maximize that income. People always balk when I say this: You need to be asking for a raise somewhere between 10 percent to 15 percent every single year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Ooof.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re getting it&nbsp; But if you ask for 10 to 15 and you get eight, that&#8217;s good, because eight is still going to help keep you above the inflation rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Retirement and savings in general are often presented as this sacrifice. You&#8217;re going without your fancy groceries now so that future you can go on cruises and golf and do whatever it is that people do when they&#8217;re retired.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">JQ&#8217;s moving to Naples in her retirement!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>But how do you find that balance? How do you prioritize those things?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think it&#8217;s about providing yourself with a life that you are happy with today while also thinking, “Hey, it&#8217;s not like saving for retirement means this money goes into a black hole.” You still get to spend it just later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;re not just setting this money aside and then getting that same number back in retirement. When you start investing your money, when it has a little bit of room and time to grow, that money gets to work really hard for you. And so you might put in $100,000. That $100,000 could be a couple million dollars in retirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Societies, for Hayek, emerge from the interplay of countless different systems and logics — creating an order so complex that no single entity, not even a government, can fully understand how it all operates. He believed that any attempt to transform such a thing by policy would invariably break part of this system, leading to unintended and often disastrous consequences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This isn’t a good argument against <em>all</em> government interference in the marketplace (as a shallow read of Hayek might suggest). But it is a powerful insight into how societies work, one that provides an especially clear explanation for why planned economies failed so badly during Hayek’s lifetime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also helps us understand why there’s an authentic strain of right-wing resistance to Trump’s “tariffs and deportations” economic agenda —&nbsp;one that attentive liberals could learn from.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hayek’s “spontaneous order” and the case against regulation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Hayek, there were basically two different types of system or order. The first is an organization, meaning a top-down planned effort where one person or entity lays out the rules for everyone to follow. The second is a “spontaneous order,” a bottom-up system in which the rules are determined over time by enormous numbers of micro-interactions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take, for example, the ecosystem of the American West. No one person set the rules by which bison, wolves, moose, prairie dogs, and the like breed and interact; in fact, no one dictated that this particular place needed to have those particular species at all. Instead, a system emerged out of thousands of years of interactions between flora and fauna, prey and predator. It has predictable rules and outcomes, but no hand at the tiller.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hayek believed that humanity operated in a similar, but even more complex, fashion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our own social order, according to Hayek, reflects centuries of interactions between hundreds of millions of different people and an impossibly diverse set of institutions, ranging from organized religion to different economic sectors to artist collectives. What we call “society” is the spontaneous order that emerges from individuals and organizations interacting and developing oft-unwritten rules that govern those interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The structure of human activities constantly adapts itself, and functions through adapting itself, to millions of facts which in their entirety are not known to anybody,” he wrote in <em>Law, Legislation, and Liberty, Volume 1</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Government, Hayek argued, plays a special role in spontaneous order: It “becomes indispensable in order to assure that [social] rules are obeyed.” The state both protects people’s rights to participate in their corner of the spontaneous order and, at times, can even guide the order toward adopting a different (and perhaps better) set of rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What the state cannot do well, in Hayek’s eyes, is interfere with discrete and specific interactions inside the spontaneous order.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the government issues “commands” telling people where and for how much they can sell their goods, for example, it is engaging in an enterprise that bureaucrats and politicians cannot and never will have sufficient knowledge to do adequately. Most economic regulation, for Hayek, is akin to the mass slaughter of wolves in the American West —&nbsp;a shortsighted move with <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/7/430/7687410?login=false\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/7/430/7687410?login=false\">destabilizing long-term consequences.</a> (Recent efforts to reintroduce wolves have been <a href=\"https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/\">an extraordinary success</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The spontaneous order arises from each element balancing all the various factors operating on it and by adjusting all its various actions to each other, a balance which will be destroyed if some of the actions are determined by another agency on the basis of different knowledge and in the service of different ends,” Hayek wrote.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hayek versus Trump</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is very easy to take this pro-market line of thinking too far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We know that certain elements of the economy, like the money supply, can in fact be effectively managed by governments. Hayek’s skepticism of government could bleed over into paranoia, as with his argument in <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> asserting that social democracy would invariably bleed into authoritarianism. In fact, he even went so far as to endorse Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile on grounds that <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/friedrich-hayek-dictatorship/\">its free-market policies</a> were worth the loss of political liberty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Hayek’s argument is essential to understanding why some government projects, like Soviet-style command economies, tend to fail so spectacularly. When an economic policy aims at fundamental transformation, one in which humans are put in charge of managing a vast swath of ordinary economic activity, the potential for the state to exceed the bounds of its knowledge is obvious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hayek did not believe that this was only a problem for socialists. In <em>The Constitution of Liberty</em>, Hayek argued that conservatives’ emphasis on preserving tradition and the nation inclined them toward dangerous forms of state control over society.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is this nationalistic bias which frequently provides the bridge from conservatism to collectivism: to think in terms of ‘our’ industry or resource is only a short step away from demanding that these national assets be directed in the national interest,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So despite unquestionably being a man of the right, Hayek rejected the label “conservative” for his politics (he preferred “liberal” on grounds that “libertarian” was too clunky). Conservatives, he argued, were dogmatic and nationalistic — useful allies against the left, but&nbsp;skeptical enough of liberty that they posed their own set of collectivist dangers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Were Hayek still alive, he would see the vindication of his concerns in the person of Donald Trump. The former president’s two most consistent policy proposals — deporting millions of migrants and imposing a 10-percent tariff on all foreign-made goods — are far more aggressive efforts at reshaping America’s spontaneous order than any tax-and-spend proposals offered by the Harris campaign. Each, in its own way, amounts to a fundamental revision of how the American state and economy operate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, there’s a reason that some of the most effective critics of Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/people/scott-lincicome\">trade</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/people/alex-nowrasteh\">immigration</a> policies work for the libertarian Cato Institute. Hayek’s heirs, at least those who take his ideas seriously, understand that Trump represents something anathema to their tradition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was adapted from the On the Right newsletter.</em>&nbsp;<em>New editions drop every Wednesday.

    "summary": "There are few more influential right-wing scholars than the economist Friedrich Hayek — and few whose work is less compatible with the right’s ascendant Trumpian strain. Born in Austria in 1899, Hayek spent his career developing a wide-ranging libertarian social theory. Societies, for Hayek, emerge from the interplay of countless different systems and logics — [&#8230;]",

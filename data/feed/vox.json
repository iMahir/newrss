At music festivals and on the lists forecasting <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/chappell-roan-5-things-know-090855914.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEefUpnkTaIJpRuEbR6dE8g5e8t3nu9bxSbG-mFk3deSmqQseg2Xmsg51irNEqZ3m3ocr0VrQCUQ5pmmLthbiscRQAPsECNMFwIwcpklVdeo-dS_3mOVBmbh0PJ6i8XuouS6Ft8w8qPXFF3zbm0RKAMXGEpx0cZJyXZ70EIFkZk5\">pop’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin\">next</a> <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/news/chappell-roan-big-year-interview-coachella-performance\">big</a> <a href=\"https://industryme.co.uk/born-this-way-the-rise-of-chappell-roan/\">thing</a>, there she is: big red hair and big powerhouse voice, unapologetically queer lyrics and exuberant drag queen aesthetic. This is the summer Chappell Roan became impossible to ignore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roan has been a working pop artist for years. Now 26, she signed her first record deal with Atlantic Records at 17 and has been putting out songs ever since — but for a long time, none of them seemed to quite hit. Last September, though, Roan released her first full album, <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em>, and set off on tour as Olivia Rodrigo’s opener. In March, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg\">her appearance on NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert series</a> went surprisingly viral (3.4 million views and counting), sending her <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-are-pop-stars-in-the-making-how-opening-tour-gigs-tiktok-and-coachella-are-keys-to-their-success-215444839.html\">Spotify monthly listeners count</a> rocketing up by 500 percent. In April, she became one of the <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/features/music-features/coachella-2024-review-best-acts-3618348\">biggest stories out of Coachella</a>. In June, she was the story of the <a href=\"https://people.com/chappell-roan-dresses-as-statue-of-liberty-governors-ball-statement-about-freedom-8660637\">Governor’s Ball</a>. She’s been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L94zTNhLnXo\">on Jimmy Fallon</a>. She’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOg93THAyE0\">performed on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em></a>. She is currently in the process of crossing the border that separates “working pop artist” and “pop star” — and finding that being a pop star comes with baggage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/chappell-roan-addresses-creepy-behavior-fans-videos/story?id=112980547\">In a pair of TikToks on August 20</a>, Roan called out her fans for overstepping boundaries in their interactions with her. “I don’t care that abuse and harassment — stalking, whatever — is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous, whatever,” she said. “I don’t care that it’s normal. I don’t care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, the career field I’ve chosen. That does not make it okay. That doesn’t make it normal. Doesn’t mean I want it. Doesn’t mean I like it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roan has such a clear-eyed relationship to her fame in part perhaps because of<strong> </strong>how long it took her to get here and what a strikingly different artist and performer she was at the beginning of the journey. Today, a Chappell Roan show plays like a joyous drag ball. A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy. She pitched her voice deep and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkyqkv/cursive-singing-tiktok-trend-explained\">sang her lyrics in smooth, diphthonged cursive</a>. In her videos, she wore her hair dark and straight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roan’s trajectory from there to here reveals a lot about why, exactly, she’s taking off so precipitously right now. It’s the story of coming of age, both artistically and personally, at exactly the right time and place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Kayleigh became Chappell</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roan grew up with the name Kayleigh Amstutz. She lived in what she sometimes describes as a <a href=\"https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny\">trailer park</a> in Willard, Missouri, <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/profile/Willard_city,_Missouri?g=160XX00US2979882\">population 6,000</a>. Her childhood was deeply conservative. She went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin\">church three times a week</a>, she said in an interview with the Guardian, and was taught that “being gay was bad and a sin.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I wish it was better. I wish I had better things to say,” <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/\">she told Rolling Stone</a> in 2022. “But mentally, I had a really tough time.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her family and peers found out she could sing when they heard her in a middle school talent show, and she signed to Atlantic Records after she was scouted posting songs to YouTube. Flying back and forth between her parents’ home in Missouri and studios in LA and New York, she got to work. She released her first single, “Good Hurt,” in August 2017, and her first EP <em>School Nights</em> a month later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Already, she had decided that she would not be performing as Kayleigh Amstutz. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/\">she created a stage name</a> in honor of her grandfather, Dennis Chappell, and his favorite song, “The Strawberry Roan.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;The picking of the name was the hardest part of this entire thing,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/\">Roan confided in her hometown newspaper</a>, The Springfield News-Leader, in the lead-up to releasing <em>School Nights</em> in 2017. &#8220;It was the most stressful part.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A few years later, Roan had a different perspective on this part of her life. All of it seemed strange to her, stressful in its own way. “I felt very unprepared,” <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/\">she told Rolling Stone</a>. “I didn’t know the consequences of how much I had to sacrifice. I didn’t do my senior year. I didn’t go to prom. I didn’t go to graduation. I missed a lot of what would have been the end of my childhood to do this job.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, the job was to sing dark, moody songs about the sadomasochistic thrill of being in love with a bad boy. “No one else compares to who I had first,” Roan sings in “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEWNgO0F9k\">Good Hurt</a>” as she submerges herself somberly in a lake of black water in the accompanying video. “All I really want is a good hurt.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Chappell Roan - Good Hurt (Official Music Video)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bmEWNgO0F9k?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roan of this era was a markedly different performer from the Roan we know now. There was no hint of queerness in her presentation yet, with her songs addressed mainly to an unnamed “<a href=\"https://genius.com/Chappell-roan-sugar-high-lyrics\">beautiful boy</a>.” With her long hair worn dark and straight, she gave off a witchy aura, an impression she magnified by gliding around in long white gowns — a far cry from the gleefully tacky drag get-ups she wears now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps most striking of all, the aesthetic Roan used in the 2010s doesn’t feel like one particular to her. She was doing a variation of the melancholy indie pop sound and look that was then in vogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467\">Roan now describes her sound of this era as</a> “really dark, angsty pop that was pretty boring.” Her magnetic presence and vocal chops were enough to garner her a small and fervent fanbase, but it wasn’t yet a group large enough to reach critical mass.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everything changed, Roan has said in interviews, when she left Missouri to live full time in Los Angeles on her own in 2018. For the first time, she was able to separate herself from the conservative ideology of her childhood.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I was told this city is demonic and Satanists live here,” <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467\">Roan told NME this February</a>. “But when I got to West Hollywood, it opened my eyes [to the fact] that everything I was afraid of wasn’t always true — especially [what I’d been told] about the queer community. Going to gay clubs for the first time, it felt spiritual.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was also in LA that Roan met the man who would become her primary creative collaborator: Dan Nigro, a music producer and former indie frontman. He and Roan&nbsp; began collaborating just a few months before Nigro broke out in a huge way for his work on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Driver’s License.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first collaboration Nigro and Roan released together was “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR3Liudev18\">Pink Pony Club</a>,” which dropped in April 2020. There, we start to see the beginning of what we now know as Chappell Roan: hair worn loose and curly, vulnerability pushed forward but shame exuberantly chased away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Chappell Roan - Pink Pony Club (Official Music Video)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR3Liudev18?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Pink Pony Club” is a story song Roan has said was inspired by her first trip to the Abbey, an institution in LA’s gay nightlife scene. She was transfixed by the go-go dancers, and so she wrote a song about a woman from a small town who leaves her scandalized mother behind to become a stripper at the Pink Pony Club. Roan had sung all her previous songs in the deep indie girl slur that was popular at the time, but she does “Pink Pony Club” in a voice so precise it starts to feel like a burlesque.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“<em>God</em>, what have you <em>done</em>?” wails the narrator’s mother in the chorus, with Roan coming down hard on the d’s and the t’s, her falsetto bright and airy. “Oh mama, I&#8217;m just having fun,” the narrator responds, and although the song is in a minor key, Roan’s voice is joyous: “On the stage in my heels, it’s where I belong.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately for Roan, April 2020 was not a time that welcomed raucous odes to the dance club. When “Pink Pony Club” dropped into the traumatic early days of the pandemic, it sank like a stone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The song was also <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467\">unpopular at her label</a>, which disapproved of Roan turning her back so abruptly on the aesthetic she’d begun to craft in <em>School Nights</em>. Roan released only two more songs with Atlantic: the light love ballad “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0SfI95-XIqU?si=xYK-CHWLXetEukRD\">Love Me Anyway</a>” and the melancholy “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GcXlN7meclE?si=7xSlEVN8IHIbaeCy\">California</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“California” is a sort of response to and inverse of “Pink Pony Club.” Like its predecessor, it tells the story of a dreamer who left her small town for a love of delicious sin in LA. Unlike the main character in “Pink Pony Club,” the narrator of “California” feels increasingly like she’s failed by coming to the city and that everything she’s sacrificed has been for nothing. “Won’t make my mama proud,” Roan sings with mounting excitement in “Pink Pony Club.” “I let you down,” she sings on a down note in “California.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ten days after “California” was released, in August 2020, Atlantic officially dropped Roan from the label. Her music, they said, was underperforming. The same week, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/\">her relationship with the man she’d been seeing for four and a half years ended</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Midwest princess rises</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I felt like a failure, but I knew deep down I wasn’t,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin\">Roan told the Guardian in 2023</a>. She moved back home to Willard, Missouri, got a job working the drive-thru window at a coffee kiosk, and plotted her next move. She wanted to give herself time to recalibrate and save money before going back to LA and trying music again. She would give herself a year there to make it before giving in and enrolling in college.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, little by little, Roan was beginning to develop a cult following, without any official backing from the music industry. “Pink Pony Club” was becoming a bona fide sleeper hit as it took off across TikTok and through word of mouth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Here’s a totally reasonable proposal for song of summer 2021: a single that dropped more than a full year ago, in April 2020, to essentially no fanfare, by a 21-year-old singer-songwriter who hasn’t even cracked 4,000 followers on Twitter,” <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/song-recommendation-chappell-roan-pink-pony-club.html\">announced Vulture in 2021</a>, describing “Pink Pony Club” as “a pop hit from an alternate timeline that somehow ended up in ours by accident.” The song wasn’t charting yet, not even close, but it was starting to get attention in all the right places.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Nigro had been helping Olivia Rodrigo craft and release her hit debut studio album, <em>Sour.</em> In November 2021, with Rodrigo launched, Nigro and Roan reunited. Roan was feeling listless and ignored, she says, and Nigro gave her the impetus she needed to start working for herself. “[Dan] was just looking at me and goes ‘You are going to run your career into the fucking ground if you don’t start doing shit on your own,’” <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/\">Roan told Rolling Stone in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In March 2022, Roan released “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/nXZuv1T8bfg?si=Sfu9KPq3laClLfbS\">Naked in Manhattan</a>,” her first song as an independent artist, without the backing of a music label. She shot the accompanying video with friends in thrifted wardrobe on the streets of New York City.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The song sees Roan crushing on a girl friend, hoping to finally cross the line and kiss her. “Boys suck, and girls I’ve never tried,” she sings. In real life, she says, the lyric was true when she wrote it. “I was dating a boy then,” <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/\">Roan told the LA Times last August</a>. “I had never even kissed a girl when these songs [“Naked in Manhattan” and “Red Wine Supernova”] were written. It was all what I wished my life could be.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Chappell Roan - Naked in Manhattan (Official Music Video)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXZuv1T8bfg?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Naked in Manhattan” continues the aesthetic project Roan found in “Pink Pony Club” and develops it. It’s Roan’s first explicitly queer song. (“Pony Club” covers its coming-out narrative in a thin veil of plausible deniability.) It’s also the first to feature the spoken word interlude that would become a go-to move for her. The accompanying video also debuts the “<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/\">thrift store pop star</a>” drag queen style that became her calling card: fire engine red hair, elaborate hyper-femme outfits cobbled together from thrift store pieces, a pinup girl burlesque cheekiness. It was a sign that Roan had at last found a new image that she loved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In March 2022, Roan was announced as the opener for Olivia Rodrigo and Fletcher. She continued releasing independent singles: “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ePsqyPMIg6I?si=d-PcUErh9GQdzuhw\">Karma</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdaKBAuO8zg\">Femininomenon</a>” in August 2022, and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfSjnsYiY_A\">Casual</a>” in October. In February 2023, she launched her own national tour.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All the while, she was developing the character of “Chappell Roan” beyond just a stage name into a fully distinct persona like those used by the drag queens she had come to idolize. “Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows. When she was performing, she stopped being Kayleigh and Chappell took over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chappell was all the things Kayleigh was ashamed of, made newly exuberant and joyful. She wore clownish white-face makeup because “that’s what the <a href=\"https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2\">country boys called gay people in my hometown. Clowns.</a>” She plays campily with the signifiers of her small-town background: <a href=\"https://5centsound.com/blog/house-of-chappell\">yodeling vocal trills and camo-print merch</a>. Perhaps most significantly, she is unapologetically sexual in ways that her creator cannot quite bring herself to be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I have such a difficult time — as Kayleigh — with sex,” she said in an <a href=\"https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny\">interview with Polyester Zine in 2023</a>. “I have a hard time watching sex scenes or flirting with people! I get really uncomfortable with hyper sexual things. But as the drag queen that I play, Chappell, she&#8217;s not like that — she is very confident and comfortable singing about those things.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In March&nbsp;2023, Roan announced that she had signed to Nigro’s new label, Amusement Records, in partnership with Island Records.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to Roan, by then, she had options. “I met with nine labels and I went in with the attitude [of], ‘This is what I need — the only thing I need right now is money,’” she told <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/features/music-interviews/chappell-roan-interview-red-wine-supernova-debut-album-radar-3458322\">NME</a>. “So if you don’t give me this, this and this, I’m just not going to sign with you because I can keep going on my own. I was very picky and I had a fuck ton of leverage.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roan wasn’t wrong. She had all that leverage because it was clear that her moment was arriving. Now, after years of trying on personas that didn’t quite fit, of working bad day jobs and living with roommates, of scrabbling studio time and music videos together without a label to back her, it’s finally here.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A drag queen pop star in a time of moral panic</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Looking back over the arc of Roan’s career, it becomes clear that her music got really good and her career started to take off once she had a strong sense of who she was as an individual. That sense of self is intertwined with Roan defining herself as a queer woman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The energy of <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em> comes from the palpable joy of finding oneself and rejecting old beliefs. “Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine,” Roan instructs her sapphic crush in “Naked in Manhattan,” adding with a verbal shrug, “Could go to hell but we’ll probably be fine.” The Chappell Roan of “Good Hurt” might have believed she would go to hell if she kissed a girl. The Chappell Roan of “Naked in Manhattan” doesn’t much care either way, even if the person who wrote the lyrics hasn’t quite gotten there herself yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If <em>Midwest Princess</em> is a celebration of finding oneself, Chappell Roan the character is the personification of that glee. Chappell, with her white-face makeup and princessy gowns that are just a little off, expresses what her creator longs for and cannot quite reach herself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The whole project is to honor my 10-year-old self. My whole persona is just me trying to honor that version of myself that I was never allowed to be,” <a href=\"https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2\">she told Paper in June</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the fame problem Roan is now facing is the downside of making a drag queen a pop star. In drag, it’s understood that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/7amnp5/how_do_you_guys_approach_queens_out_of_drag/\">you don’t approach a queen for a picture when she’s out of costume</a>. Roan has made it clear that when she stops being Chappell and starts being Kayleigh again, she expects to be left alone — but not all of her fans think that’s an appropriate ask coming from a pop star who owes her fame to her fanbase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/chappell-roan-addresses-creepy-behavior-fans-videos/story?id=112980547\">In her videos</a>, Roan implies that some fans have stalked her family and bullied her virtually after she refused to take a picture “because she has her own time.”<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m a random bitch. You’re a random bitch. Just think about that for a second, okay?” Roan said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even as Roan grapples with her fans, it is probably not a coincidence that America fell in love with Chappell Roan at the same time that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/9/7/23860447/supreme-court-drag-shows-ban-tennessee-montana-texas-florida-queens\">drag shows are becoming criminalized</a>. While lawmakers position drag queens as monstrous threats to children, Roan stands for drag as the thing that saved an unhappy child, a joy, a marvelous act of creation.

That proposal ultimately went nowhere, and Israel pushed back on Biden’s description of the plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This time, Israel has yet to publicly embrace the “bridging proposal,” though <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/19/netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands\">reports indicate</a> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is against concessions that would allow for a successful deal. President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-raise-egypt-gaza-corridor-call-with-netanyahu-axios-reports-2024-08-21/\">reportedly spoke with Netanyahu Wednesday</a>, urging him to back down on demands regarding Israeli control of parts of Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas claims <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-20-august-2024-0af8804c872792a73a5d9044634dc884\">the deal is a “reversal”</a> of previous agreements and has claimed that the US is imposing new Israeli demands upon the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Multiple rounds of ceasefire talks have already fallen through; the last successful effort to end the violence — albeit temporarily — was in November 2023, when a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/27/23976383/israel-hamas-war-hostage-ceasefire-deal-extension\">week-long pause in fighting</a> allowed for the return of 105 Israeli hostages and the release of about 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The goals of November’s agreement were limited to the prisoner exchange and getting humanitarian aid into Gaza. Now, the objective is to end the fighting that has killed at least 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The extent of the devastation, with many bodies buried under rubble, means that the real death toll is likely even higher — possibly by <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext\">tens of thousands</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The major sticking point in the negotiations, both now and earlier this summer, seems to be a fundamental disagreement about what a ceasefire might look like. Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, while Netanyahu has said an end to the fighting can <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/israel-military-gaza-war.html\">only come once Hamas is destroyed</a> —&nbsp;despite a growing consensus that such a goal is unfeasible. Furthermore, Israel has indicated it would like to have a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-demanding-control-2-gaza-corridors-cease-fire-112973629\">security presence in Gaza post-war</a>, something Hamas will not agree to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reaching a real ceasefire agreement has only become more urgent as Israeli <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/aftermath-attack-israeli-settlers-palestinian-village-reporters-notebook/story?id=112906804\">settlers in the West Bank continue to attack Palestinians</a>, and as the risk of a regional war that could come to encompass <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/21/world/israel-iran-hamas-gaza-war\">Lebanon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/middleeast/iran-response-israel-assassination-analysis-intl/index.html\">Iran</a> looks increasingly serious. But despite the renewed attention on the negotiations, there’s reason to be skeptical that this time is any different.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why the prospect of a ceasefire remains dim</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latest ceasefire news is just the latest in a long string of almost-but-not-quite proposals since November’s week-long ceasefire ended (both sides claim the other broke that agreement).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most recently, in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/18/hamas-rejects-us-ceasefire-hostage-proposal\">ceasefire proposal issued by the US on Friday</a> Israel reportedly included a demand for control over two areas of Gaza. One of these is what Israel calls the Philadelphi corridor, which runs along the border between Egypt and Gaza. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks-corridors-03deb20a6c549273fb4b8ce3475fff17\">Israel claims it needs to occupy the area</a> to prevent Hamas from using the region to resupply its war material.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other area Israel wants to control is what’s known as the Netzarim corridor, which divides northern and southern Gaza. Israel similarly says it needs security forces in that area to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-demanding-control-2-gaza-corridors-cease-fire-112973629\">block the flow of weapons</a>. For Hamas, however, additional Israeli control over Palestinian territory is likely to be a nonstarter, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23921529/israel-palestine-timeline-gaza-hamas-war-conflict\">Israeli efforts to divide the Palestinian people geographically</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Friday’s deal also did not provide for a permanent ceasefire, another of Hamas’s primary demands.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The last major ceasefire plan was initially <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/18/hamas-rejects-us-ceasefire-hostage-proposal\">negotiated back in May</a>. Hamas agreed to the proposal, and the United Nations endorsed it, but that deal was reportedly scuppered when Netanyahu introduced new conditions, including control over the Philadelphi corridor and a demand that Israel screen Palestinians returning to their homes in the north, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gex1rl6q5o\">according to the BBC</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of what has made a ceasefire deal difficult is the fact that Israel has the military edge: The balance of power in Gaza has always been asymmetrical. The Israeli military is powerful in its own right; aid from the US, including the delivery of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/10/us-israel-500-pound-bomb/\">500-pound bombs</a>, compounds the advantage. And Israel has continued attacking Gaza amid the ceasefire talks, reportedly killing <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/8/20/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-kills-35-in-gaza-as-us-buying-time\">at least 12 in an attack on a school in Gaza City Tuesday</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Hamas has a degree of leverage “they’ve never had before” in previous conflicts in Gaza, <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/joost-hiltermann\">Joost Hiltermann</a>, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the International Crisis Group, said: The group still holds 105 Israeli hostages taken in October 2023. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that hostages remain in Gaza has only been marginally effective in securing Hamas’s demands, however; a weeklong ceasefire and the return of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is a far cry from a permanent one and full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also not clear how many of those hostages are still alive; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23lgy1k22zo\">on Monday Israel retrieved the bodies of six hostages from Khan Younis</a> in Gaza. And Hamas has continued its attacks amid the ceasefire negotiations, including an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/tel-aviv-bomb-hamas.html\">apparent suicide attack in Tel Aviv Sunday</a>, for which the group has claimed credit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Further complicating negotiations is a change in Hamas’s leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following the assassination of its political leader and chief negotiator Ismael Haniyeh in Tehran last month, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html\">likely by Israel,</a> Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas’s militant wing, has assumed the top job. Sinwar, Hiltermann told Vox, is a “very stubborn fellow.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“He doesn’t give in. I think he would much rather be martyred, in their term — killed — than concede,” Hiltermann said. “So that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to cease fire, but he wants a ceasefire on terms that he thinks are good for the Palestinian cause. If he cannot get them, then he will say to Israel, ‘Continue to fight.’”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The US role in ending the war – and why talks continue to fall short</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the latest ceasefire news demonstrates, the US also remains a major player in negotiations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23916266/us-israel-support-ally-gaza-war-aid\">scale of US military assistance to Israel</a> could provide a point of leverage to push Netanyahu and Israel toward a deal; at least publicly, however, Blinken and Biden have shown little appetite to use that leverage, even while pushing for a ceasefire and telling Israel that its war is unwinnable. Vox reached out to the White House and the State Department for further clarification on the status of the bridging negotiations, but did not receive a response by publication time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, there’s no clear reason to assume a breakthrough is truly imminent. “Every public indication that the principals are giving is that we’re not close,” said <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/jon-b-alterman\">Jon Alterman</a>, the director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And that either reflects a) an underlying reality or b) the fact that each side is negotiating effectively to try to extract the maximum from its adversary — but I can’t tell you which of those is true.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But switching away from these fuels toward energy sources that don’t spew heat-trapping gases while meeting the needs of 8.5 billion and counting residents of this planet will require an enormous amount of new construction: mines, factories, ports, transmission lines, power plants, substations, grid batteries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And to do that, the government will have to give the go-ahead to many, many more projects than it’s doing now, and at a much faster clip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you care about the environment or you care about climate change, the status quo is not good,” said <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/xan-fishman/\">Xan Fishman</a>, senior director of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “We need to build all the clean new energy to transmission in order to both provide affordable electricity energy to Americans and reduce emissions.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The only way to do that,” he said, “is to build a lot of stuff.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lawmakers are well aware of the problem and have been trying to speed things up for more than a decades, with piecemeal advances like executive orders from the <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/08/31/presidential-memorandum-speeding-infrastructure-development-through-more\">White House</a> and bipartisan legislation from <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/280\">Congress</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latest effort is the <a href=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/manchin-barrasso-release-bipartisan-energy-permitting-reform-legislation\">Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024</a>, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin (I-WV) and John Barrasso (R-WY). It cleared the Senate energy committee last month in a <a href=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/energy-and-natural-resources-committee-clears-manchin-barrasso-permitting-reform-legislation-pending-nomination\">15-4 vote</a> and will head to the full Senate for consideration, likely after the November election. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If passed, it could drastically alter the energy landscape in the United States with a construction boom to meet pent-up demand for electrons and hydrocarbons. The legislation would also greet the next president with a shorter, smoother route to their preferred energy policies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Democrats convene in Chicago this week to formally nominate Vice President Kamala Harris as their candidate for president, one recurring theme has been the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/barack-obama-calls-housing-market-revolution-increase-supply-homes-1942291\">desire to build more</a>. And over the past four years, lawmakers have allocated billions of dollars to clean energy and supply chains through the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22772701/biden-infrastructure-law-environmental-funding\">2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/27/23277664/chips-act-solve-chip-shortage-biden-manufacturing\">2022 CHIPS and Science Act</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change\">2022 Inflation Reduction Act</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-creates-good-paying-clean-jobs-cuts-energy-costs-and-delivers-on-the-presidents-ambitious-climate-agenda/\">Biden White House</a> has called this “the most ambitious climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in history.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But many of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c\">projects have hit delays</a>, running into <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/technology/semiconductor-chip-factories-delays.html\">shortages of skilled workers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/critical-minerals-shortage-clean-energy/index.html\">critical materials</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/28/ev-charging-stations-slow-rollout/\">limited experience in deploying the funds</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s legacy — and Harris’s ability to build on it, if she wins the White House — could crumble if the government doesn’t figure out a way to vastly expand the suite of renewable and clean energy sources that could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action\">alter the course</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/\">world’s largest historical emitter</a> of greenhouse gases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The challenge is that permitting is an expensive, tedious, and time-consuming process, sometimes <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/series/wsj-explains/inside-the-decadeslong-permit-process-holding-back-10000-energy-projects/ECA61950-48C1-4347-BDD3-78B647D8C038\">stretching decades</a>. Developers often find there’s a lack of accountability between the local, state, and federal authorities that have a say in granting approval for things like wind energy farms or interstate power transmission lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The current system puts a lot of project developers in a frustrating limbo — not a “no,” not a “yes,” but a “maybe, we’ll see” that can stretch indefinitely. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This uncertainty makes it harder for companies to make a business case and often leads to proposals falling apart. The net result is that few things get built at all. In the past decade, the United States has built transmission lines at <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-transmission-permitting-rule-and-latest\">half the rate as in the 30 years prior</a>. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $7.5 billion to build thousands of electric vehicle charging stations, yet <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/28/ev-charging-stations-slow-rollout/\">only a handful are operating</a>. The American Clean Power Association, an industry group, reports that permitting delays have cost the US economy <a href=\"https://cleanpower.org/resources/u-s-permitting-delays-hold-back-economy-cost-jobs/\">more than $100 billion in lost investment</a>. Earlier this year, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <a href=\"https://emp.lbl.gov/news/larg-e-scale-wind-and-solar\">surveyed wind and solar power developers</a> and found that one-third of permit applications for placing wind turbines and solar panels in the ground were canceled over the past five years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These false starts cost businesses a lot of money: The average sunk cost was more than $2 million on average for a canceled solar project and $7.5 million for a scrapped wind farm. The main causes cited for these axed proposals were difficulties in getting approvals from zoning boards, in connecting to the power grid, and opposition from local communities — all issues that inhibit permitting.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This data keeps me up at night&#8230; <a href=\"https://t.co/qXzzSlfZ8I\">https://t.co/qXzzSlfZ8I</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/l79io4xvmE\">pic.twitter.com/l79io4xvmE</a></p>&mdash; Jesse D.

The idea is to change the existing system of rules — smoothing out the application process, setting tighter deadlines, reducing veto points — to get a verdict on projects faster. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Manchin-Barrasso bill contains provisions that benefit clean energy, like speeding up approvals for more power transmission. This is essential to expanding renewable energy, but also makes it easier to extract more coal, oil, and natural gas. The bill also contains specific provisions aimed to increase fossil fuel exports, which has raised the ire of some environmental groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bill’s authors acknowledge that this is a compromise. The concession will undermine some of the benefits of deploying more renewable energy. However, having both fossil and renewable energy provisions in the Manchin-Barrasso bill helped it secure votes from both parties. “Let me be clear: There’s no such thing as a perfect bill. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Sen. Manchin said during a <a href=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/energy-and-natural-resources-committee-clears-manchin-barrasso-permitting-reform-legislation-pending-nomination\">hearing last month on the permitting reform proposal</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The critical questions are whether this iteration of permitting reform will do more harm than good, and what the next administration will do with a faster process if the bill is signed into law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What the new Manchin-Barrasso permitting reform bill aims to do</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any time a developer wants to build something — particularly on public land, stretching across state lines, or destined for another country — it needs government approval. And to get a thumbs-up, the builders need to demonstrate that the project is safe, that it serves the public interest, that it doesn’t cost taxpayers too much, and that it doesn’t cause undue harm to the environment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One of the reasons it’s been difficult to solve our permitting processes is because it’s not just one problem,” Fishman said. “A lot of different things that create frictions in the mix.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the federal level, one of the most important regulations governing energy is the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/nepa/what-national-environmental-policy-act\">1969 National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA). It’s a well-intentioned law that strives for “productive harmony” between projects and their potential impacts and requires the government to consider how proposals to build highways, bridges, power lines, and dams will affect rivers, forests, air pollution, and endangered species. The review process then leads to the creation of a document called an <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/teaching-legal-docs--what-is-an-environmental-impact-statement-/\">environmental impact statement</a> (EIS), which serves as a basis for making decisions about a given project at all levels of government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The trouble is that simply doing the research needed to write an EIS can take years and the resulting document can be unwieldy. A 2020 White House analysis found that the <a href=\"https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/nepa-practice/CEQ_EIS_Length_Report_2020-6-12.pdf\">average draft EIS</a> was 575 pages long and took <a href=\"https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/nepa-practice/CEQ_EIS_Timeline_Report_2020-6-12.pdf\">4.5 years to complete</a>. And for opponents of a project, an EIS can expose weaknesses in a proposal and serve as a playbook for lawsuits, creating more opportunities for delay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For renewables, the added complication is that the power grid in many parts of the country doesn’t have the capacity to add more wind and solar energy without renovations and upgrades. Much of the US power grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, before the advent of widespread intermittent renewables. And 70 percent of power transmission lines are approaching the ends of their life cycles, according to the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/gdo/articles/what-does-it-take-modernize-us-electric-grid\">Department of Energy</a>. So clean energy developers aren’t just waiting on permits for their own hardware; they need a green light to augment the power grid as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Right now, there’s so much clean energy that wants to connect to the grid, and the interconnection queue is long because there’s not enough transmission to carry that energy from where it can be produced to where the consumers are that can use it,” Fishman said. By <a href=\"https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Transmission_2022-09-22.pdf\">one estimate</a>, if the transmission line expansion holds at current languorous rates, up to 80 percent of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the Inflation Reduction Act would be lost. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the permitting reform bill will speed up energy development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Energy Permitting Reform Act has several major provisions to boost renewable energy:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It sets a 150-day statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit to challenge an energy project once it has been approved.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Federal agencies like the Interior Department, the Agriculture Department, and the Energy Department have firm deadlines for approving or denying applications.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There’s a target of deploying 50 gigawatts of renewable energy on federal lands by 2030.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The bill harmonizes regional and national project review standards.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Agencies have to waive certain review requirements under NEPA for infrastructure around smaller geothermal energy projects.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transmission projects also get some carve-outs from the NEPA process if they follow existing routes.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Interior Department must offer at least five lease sales for offshore wind each year, with a goal of building 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The bill removes some of the regulatory barriers preventing renewables from connecting to the power grid.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, some of these provisions also accelerate fossil fuel<em> </em>development. In addition, the bill contains measures that directly benefit energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Energy Department has 90 days to rule on approving a natural gas export facility after it has completed the NEPA process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Land that’s cleared for renewable energy installations must also be open to fossil fuel leasing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Interior Department must hold at least one auction per year for offshore oil and gas drilling rights.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Manchin-Barrasso bill addresses these obstacles to clean energy development in several ways. It replaces the open-ended project review process at federal agencies with deadlines, shrinks the window for filing lawsuits against a project, and sets targets for deploying more renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the measures that accelerate approvals for wind and solar power also clear the route for coal, oil, and natural gas. Major portions of the bill are also targeted specifically at fossil fuels, like requiring the Interior Department to auction leases for on- and offshore oil and gas extraction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why some groups oppose the permitting reform bill, and why it’s still not enough</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is the trade-off worth it? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fishman noted that there are currently nearly three times as many renewable energy projects in the pipeline waiting for permits than fossil fuel proposals, so unblocking the logjam would likely be a net benefit for the climate. The vast majority of energy being added to the grid right now <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-nearly-all-new-us-power-plants-built-in-2024-will-be-clean-energy\">comes from zero-emissions sources</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I understand that environmentalists don’t love every element of the bill, but ​​if you look at the bill as a whole, there&#8217;s so much more to love than there is to dislike in the bill,” Fishman said. “Not accepting a bipartisan deal like this is choosing to instead accept our status quo.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, making it easier to develop more fossil fuels does run contrary to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22397364/earth-day-us-climate-change-summit-biden-john-kerry-commitment-2030-zero-emissions\">US’s goals to curb its greenhouse gas emissions</a>. The US is already the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24098983/biden-oil-production-climate-fossil-fuel-renewables\">largest oil and gas producer in the world</a>. Opponents also note that the Manchin-Barrasso bill facilitates fossil fuel exports, particularly liquefied natural gas. These exports aren’t counted toward the US’s carbon footprint since other countries end up buying and burning the fuel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, the Biden administration put a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24055711/lng-export-pause-biden-liquefied-natural-gas-climate-change\">pause on approvals for new LNG export terminals</a> pending a review from the Energy Department. Even with the pause, the US is on track to double its LNG exports by 2030.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The permitting reform bill will hit “play” on even more LNG shipped abroad. “Our bill permanently ends President Biden’s so-called ‘pause’ on new American LNG exports,” Sen Barrasso said in a <a href=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/barrasso-permitting-reform-act-will-boost-american-energy-production-lower-costs-for-families\">hearing last month</a>. “President Biden’s ‘pause’ has been a gift to Russia and Qatar — the world’s other leading LNG exporters.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the bill doesn’t guarantee that an agency will rule one way or another on an export license, it does shift the balance toward approval. “This bill is written to set [the Energy Department’s] default to ‘yes’ and make sure that these massive LNG facilities are built,” said <a href=\"https://www.symonspa.com/jeremy-symons-principal\">Jeremy Symons</a>, who used to work on the Senate environment committee and is now principal at Symons Public Affairs, an environmental consulting firm. “You can’t sling climate pollution over the fence and expect it to just go away.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Symons conducted an <a href=\"https://www.symonspa.com/post/assessing-the-climate-impacts-of-the-manchin-barrasso-bill-s-lng-title\">analysis of the LNG export section of the bill</a> and found that it would lead to greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 165 coal-fired power plants and undo the benefits of dozens of major transmission lines for renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A confounding factor is that LNG is cleaner than some fossil fuels but worse for the environment than renewables. The <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-does-bidens-lng-pause-mean-for-global-emissions/\">net impact to the climate</a> depends on whether the exported LNG is displacing coal and oil or if it’s competing with wind, solar, and nuclear power. It’s unclear how this will shake out, since exports are also governed by market and geopolitical forces. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The permitting reform bill is also not meant to solve all the problems with getting the go-ahead for building out energy production and infrastructure. While it enforces timelines for making decisions based on NEPA reviews, it doesn’t make any changes to NEPA itself. Though it addresses the federal government’s role in permitting, a lot of the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/eight-facts-about-permitting-and-the-clean-energy-transition/\">hold-ups for renewables are at the state and regional levels</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the bill has built up some momentum and it might come up for a vote after the election. If Biden signs it, it will be a fitting coda to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/362478/joe-biden-climate-change-legacy\">his environmental legacy</a>, a big jump forward that then takes several steps back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Lopez and Affleck were reportedly living separately and extremely unhappy with being married to each other. He allegedly wants a life away from the spotlight, and she can’t stop living in it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it’s all eerily similar to what happened 20 years ago when the couple, known as Bennifer, first broke up. After a magnetic first meeting on a movie set, the two began dating and quickly became one of the most sought-after celebrity couples. Gossip rags and paparazzi were there to capture their every breath. The couple eventually called it quits, blaming the outsize media attention for their demise. And now it feels like we’re once again back at the original Bennifer breakup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bennifer isn’t the first celebrity couple nor will they be the last, but they represent something rare<strong> </strong>in Hollywood:<strong> </strong>a real — and really dramatic — relationship. Something that wasn’t made for PR, but captures so, so much of it.<strong> </strong>They are two very famous people in love who have tried to live and love authentically in an industry where that’s extremely risky. Their relationship also reflects our fixation with realness and relatability: If they didn’t have either, we wouldn’t be so engrossed by them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the current media fervor, here’s a look at what the two represent — solo, together, split — that makes us so obsessed with them some 20 years later.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The complete relationship timeline of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, a.k.a. Bennifer</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>December 2001–November 2002: The birth of Bennifer</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Affleck and Lopez meet on the set of <em>Gigli</em>, which begins shooting in December 2001. Originally, Halle Berry had been offered Lopez’s role, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflict with 2003’s <em>X-Men</em> sequel <em>X2</em>. Lopez is married to backup dancer Chris Judd at the time, but files for <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2002/07/26/j-lo-files-divorce/\">divorce in summer 2002</a>, ending their 10-month marriage. Lopez and Affleck officially begin dating shortly after.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The media refers to the couple as “Bennifer,” a combination of their first names. Allegedly, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-smith-on-coining-bennifer-and-trying-to-save-his-hero-stan-lee?source=entertainment&amp;via=rss\">director Kevin Smith coined</a> the portmanteau while directing the two on the set of his movie <em>Jersey Girl</em>. Bennifer starts a trend of the media bestowing celebrity couples with mashed-up nicknames like Brangelina (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) and TomKat (Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes).</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-182344892.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,22.92863446618,100,54.142731067641\" alt=\"Lopez in a white fur coat waves with purse in hand, while Affleck, behind her, also waves.\" title=\"Lopez in a white fur coat waves with purse in hand, while Affleck, behind her, also waves.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck at the &lt;em&gt;Maid in Manhattan&lt;/em&gt; premiere in 2003. | James Devaney/WireImage\" data-portal-copyright=\"James Devaney/WireImage\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On November 5, 2002, Lopez premieres her music video for “Jenny From the Block” on <em>TRL</em>. The video stars Affleck, and is about how Lopez and Affleck can’t find any privacy. They’re hounded by paparazzi at every turn. The video is also a flex because they are styled elegantly and doing glamorous things like hanging out on a yacht and lounging by the pool with a bottle of champagne. The gist: Everyone wants a piece of them because they’re the It couple.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>November 10, 2002: Bennifer’s engaged&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an exclusive interview with <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132029&amp;page=1\">ABC News’s Diane Sawyer</a>, Lopez confirms that she and Affleck are engaged. At first, Lopez plays coy, telling Sawyer that the two were very “secure” in their relationship. According to ABC News, Lopez calls Affleck during a break in the interview, and they decide to go on the record about their engagement. Lopez tells Sawyer that Affleck’s proposal “was traditional, but also in a very spectacular way, as of course Ben would do it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>August 2003–January 2004: Bennifer bombs out</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bennifer is now the most famous couple in Hollywood that isn’t married. Tabloids love them. Their wedding plans are in every magazine. Her engagement ring, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/jlo-ben-affleck-engagement-ring/index.html\">a Harry Winston pink diamond</a> the size of a meteorite, seems to have its own gravitational pull. The wedding is reportedly going to be a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2003/09/11/altared-state-ben-and-jen-put-off-wedding-date-2/\">gigantic, multimillion-dollar</a> Hollywood affair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The plan is to tie the <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/revisit-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-2003-wedding-plans/\">knot in September</a>, right after the August release of <em>Gigli</em>, the movie the two worked on together. People ostensibly want to see <em>Gigli</em> to witness the spark that created Bennifer, captured onscreen. <em>Gigli</em>, unfortunately,<em> </em>turns out to be an awful film, one of the worst movies that a group of humans has ever created. Critics ravage the often offensive <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/dead-ends-for-jlo-and-co-7436444.html\">idiocy of the script</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/01/movies/film-review-an-offer-of-love-he-can-t-refuse.html\">its flat camera work</a>, and its <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2003/08/should-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-apologize-for-gigli.html\">supernatural ability to bore</a>.&nbsp; It flops at the box office, bringing in only<a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1012172289/\"> $7 million worldwide</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every tabloid focuses on how Bennifer was handling <em>Gigli</em>’s absolute failure. Then in early August, Affleck visits Brandi’s Exotic Nightclub in Vancouver, Canada. Reportedly Lopez is upset, but through their spokespeople, the couple says <a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/jen-and-bens-very-bad-week-continues/\">everything is fine</a> and that he had always planned to go to the strip club. Whispers of Lopez’s uneasiness sharpen into tabloids declaring that there is trouble in paradise, and Bennifer is rapidly deteriorating ahead of their storybook wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-109933234.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,2.9571638946639,100,36.282722513089\" alt=\"Affleck and Lopez looking at each other on the red carpet, as they stand close, with Affleck&#039;s arm wrapped around her waist.\" title=\"Affleck and Lopez looking at each other on the red carpet, as they stand close, with Affleck&#039;s arm wrapped around her waist.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez at the &lt;em&gt;Gigli&lt;/em&gt; premiere in 2003. | Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Days before the ceremony, post-<em>Gigli</em> and post-Brandi’s, the couple sends an announcement officially postponing their nuptials. “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date,” <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101039&amp;page=1\">Lopez and Affleck say</a> in a joint statement. “We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The couple officially calls it quits in January 2004.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>January 2004–April 2021: The solo days (kind of)</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apart, the couple moves on. Lopez marries singer Marc Anthony in June 2004; the two have twins in 2008, but divorce in 2014. In 2019, she gets engaged to former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, breaking up in early 2021. As of early 2021, her career is on the up, as she stars in <em>Hustlers</em> and performs at the Super Bowl.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Affleck marries actor Jennifer Garner (a Bennifer reboot, of sorts, with new casting) in June 2005, and they have three children. After his public struggles with alcoholism, their divorce is finalized in 2018. Affleck’s career over this period is a little more uneven, with high highs and low lows — <em>Argo</em>, which he directed, wins the Best Picture Oscar in 2012, but he also becomes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22238820/sad-ben-affleck-ana-de-armas-cardboard-cutout\">the reluctant hero of inescapable, existential sadness</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>&nbsp;April 2021: Bennifer reunites</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April 2021 — the same month that Lopez and Alex Rodriguez <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/see-alex-rodriguezs-cryptic-posts-following-split-from-jennifer-lopez/\">announce</a> they’ve broken up — the pair reunite, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-ben-affleck-tabloid-timeline\">after</a> Affleck provides a glowing quote for an <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/jennifer-lopez/may-2021-cover\">InStyle profile</a> about Lopez.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2021/05/11/inside-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopezs-romantic-montana-getaway/\">Lopez visits Affleck in Montana</a> in early May, which is a big deal because that is allegedly one of Affleck’s most favorite places on Earth. According to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/05/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-vacation-montana-intense-chemistry-reconciliation-vax-live\">unnamed sources</a>, the reunion between the two is intense and the chemistry between Lopez and Affleck is, like the first time, indescribably strong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The public is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22629442/bennifer-jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-reunion-explained\">rooting</a> for the Bennifer reunion. Perhaps it’s the post-pandemic-lockdown earnestness or remorse over the general schadenfreude we seemed to feel at the end of Bennifer 1.0, but there’s a feeling that these two are good for each other. Her resurgent success is just what Sad Affleck needs. Post-A-Rod, Sad Affleck’s secluded life is just what Lopez needs. In a world that doesn’t make much sense, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez being together does.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>April 2022–February 2023: Bennifer engaged (again) and finally married&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Around a year after Bennifer reunite, the pair informs the public — <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-engaged/\">via People</a> — that they are engaged in April 2022. Lopez <a href=\"https://x.com/JLo/status/1512610660026257409\">also teases</a> the news in her personal newsletter OnTheJLo. A few months later, in July, the two marry <a href=\"https://www.laineygossip.com/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-subverted-expectations-this-weekend-with-surprise-casual-wedding-in-vegas/71329\">in Las Vegas</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The wedding is the complete opposite of the one the couple postponed and never had 18 years earlier. Instead of a full-blown, glitzy affair, the ceremony happened on a seemingly random Saturday in Sin City, taking the public by surprise. The small, unannounced, private nuptials seem to symbolically suggest that Affleck and Lopez realized the deleterious effects of media hoopla from 2004 — that they have grown up and are doing things on their own terms. The wedding adds to the idea that, this time, Bennifer are two people who have learned lessons about love and life and are determined to make it work. They seem more destined than ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In August, the two have a <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a40887916/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-marry-georgia-ceremony/\">second wedding ceremony</a> in Georgia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We moved in together, the kids moved in together, so it’s been like a really kind of emotional transition,” Lopez <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/jennifer-lopez-says-its-been-an-emotional-transition-after-moving-in-with-husband-ben-affleck/\">tells</a> People about her 2022. “But at the same time &#8230;  all your dreams coming true, it’s just been a phenomenal year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>February 2023–February 2024: The honeymoon phase</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The way Affleck makes Lopez happy and Lopez makes Affleck happy seems to be reflected in their public-facing personas. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQgCl_MAgBM\">Affleck lands a Dunkin’</a> gig consisting of commercials that poke fun at his New England grump image (one includes <a href=\"https://www.today.com/food/ben-affleck-pop-star-dunkin-donuts-commercial-2024-rcna137100\">Lopez</a>). Sad Affleck would never make fun of himself like this. Only happy men have fun at their own expense. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jennifer-lopez-launches-jlo-beauty-301199839.html\">Lopez not only launches and maintains a beauty line</a>, but also begins work on an opus, seemingly ready to build upon the momentum from <em>Hustlers</em> and the Super Bowl.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>February 2024: This Is Them… Now</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The way Ben Affleck’s breath smells after drinking Dunkin’ coffee, the exact shade of his phoenix tattoo when it’s hit by the Los Angeles afternoon sun, the way his voice shifts up an octave when he talks about the funny thing Matt Damon just did — these are some of the intimate secrets that maybe only Jennifer Lopez will ever know. But if you ever wanted to know how loving Ben Affleck makes Jennifer Lopez feel, Lopez’s three-part <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24075110/jennifer-lopez-movie-this-is-me-now-love-story-review\"><em>This Is Me… Now</em></a> multimedia experience exists to be consumed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an album and a movie musical adaptation of the album (titled<em> This Is Me&#8230; Now: A Love Story</em>),<strong> </strong>Lopez figures her love affair with Affleck like a myth from the ancient world: She compares them to Alida and Taroo, lovers from a Puerto Rican legend separated by fate and feuding families.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her first breakup with Affleck is reflected in a physically catastrophic motorcycle crash that breaks Lopez’s “heart factory,” a steampunk-styled industrial foundry full of workers whose job it is to feed Lopez’s mechanical organ rose petals so that she can continue to love. With the help of a zodiac council (featuring Jane Fonda as Sagittarius), archetypal friends, a therapist played by Fat Joe, and a visit to the Bronx where Lopez meets her younger self and a hummingbird, her romantic cardiac complex is restored.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With her heart machine full of rose petals, Lopez is ready to love Affleck when he enters her life again. Because she loves him now with a full understanding of herself, the motorcycle — the avatar of their love — does not crash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, Lopez releases the movie’s documentary accompaniment, <em>The Greatest Love Story Never Told — </em>all about the money she spent to tell us how in love she is with Ben Affleck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Lopez explains, she had to spend roughly $20 million of her own money to make the film because studios and streamers were not interested in the allegorical retelling of her marriage. The doc, which <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/jlo-and-the-greatest-love-story-never-told-review-famous-and-owning-it\">some critics</a> say is an example of Lopez’s blazing narcissism, makes a case that the only thing that Lopez loves more than Affleck is being able to tell the world about Affleck.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lopez doesn’t seem to care whether that is what the world wants from her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s not like anyone is clamoring for the next J.Lo record,” Lopez tells the camera person in a moment of blistering self-awareness, before using the film’s other 85 minutes to spend a small fortune to not only give people that record, but an album and two films that no one is “clamoring” for.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-2009263294.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.9750621103455,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez attend the 2024 Los Angeles premiere of &lt;em&gt;This Is Me... Now: A Love Story&lt;/em&gt;. | Monica Schipper/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Monica Schipper/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most prescient and icy observation in the film, though, belongs to Affleck. It’s about his wife’s need for fame. He likens her constant performance — whether it’s acting, singing, dancing, playing the Super Bowl halftime show, or even making this documentary —&nbsp;to an addiction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The thing you discover, like you do &#8230; with alcohol, is that there isn’t enough alcohol in all the liquor stores in the world to fill up that thing,” he says, astutely connecting Lopez’s need for celebrity to his own battle with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24075110/jennifer-lopez-movie-this-is-me-now-love-story-review\">drinking</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“And I think in Jennifer’s case, I don’t think there’s enough followers or — or movies or records or any of that stuff — to still that part of you,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While promoting her films, Lopez talks about her reservations about having Affleck participate in the doc. He had told her that revealing so much of her personal life was not a choice he would make. She says that including him in the doc and showing his personal feelings — like that addiction comparison — was frightening but necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I told him he was crazy, not me. But I know that I’m a crazy one. I get that part,” <a href=\"https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-reluctant-participant-greatest-love-never-told-documentary-8600797\">she tells a Los Angeles audience</a> in February. “But I really feel like as an artist, you have to be vulnerable. You have to, even when you’re playing a role, have to get down to the real parts of yourself to share what it’s like to be human. And that is a scary thing to do.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lopez’s multimedia art project turns out to be a bust. Even though the movie musical received surprisingly <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/this_is_me_now_a_love_story\">good reviews</a>, it failed to have a lasting impact. The album is the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/03/01/jennifer-lopezs-new-album-is-the-lowest-charting-of-her-career/?sh=6ae773f054df\">lowest charting</a> one of her career, and her accompanying arena tour suffered dismal ticket sales. As <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/jennifer-lopez-this-is-me-now-tour-greatest-hits-rebrand-1235958543/\">Variety reports</a>, Lopez rebranded the concert as a greatest hits show in an effort to sell more seats. The timing of Lopez’s magnum opus flopping&nbsp;is strangely akin to the way <em>Gigli</em> took a nosedive when Affleck and Lopez were together in 2004.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>May 2024: Bennifer separation rumors begin (again)</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the celebrity tabloid world, people are paid to watch certain famous people’s every move. According to a <a href=\"https://people.com/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-not-photographed-together-publicly-47-days-8649895\">People magazine report</a> this month, Bennifer has not been photographed together for 47 days. There are also <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a60868051/why-jennifer-lopez-is-upset-with-ben-affleck/\">reports</a> that the two are currently living apart, and even though <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/ben-affleck-feels-like-jennifer-lopez-has-a-hard-time-feeling-satisfied-source-says-225881\">Lopez was recently photographed</a> with a wedding ring on, the undertone was that she was doing it to hopefully quash the insistent rumors that they’re going through a rough patch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through a variety of unnamed sources, the problem between the two is, once again, the ongoing attention from the media. A source told Entertainment Tonight that Affleck feels as though his wife is too engaged with being a celebrity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Ben feels like Jen has a hard time feeling satisfied and that’s one of the issues they’re facing,” the anonymous <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/ben-affleck-feels-like-jennifer-lopez-has-a-hard-time-feeling-satisfied-source-says-225881\">source told ET</a>. “Ben is one of the only people who feels comfortable enough to be honest and real with Jen. It’s part of why Jen loves him, but also why she’s upset with him.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That quote is extremely similar to what Affleck said in the documentary: that no amount of attention or praise is ever going to be enough for his wife. It’s also aligned with the ongoing narrative about Affleck and Lopez. He wants a quiet life away from the spotlight. She wants to be a star.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-2121052565.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are seen out and about on March 30, 2024. There haven&#039;t been as many pictures of them together since. | MEGA/GC Images via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"MEGA/GC Images via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another anonymous source echoed that statement <a href=\"https://people.com/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-marriage-not-in-best-place-exclusive-8651551\">with People</a>, telling the mag: “She likes to open her heart to her fans and to the world. He is more introspective and private. This has been difficult day-to-day.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The outlook for the two doesn’t look good. <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/ben-affleck-has-come-to-his-senses-in-jennifer-lopez-marriage/\">Page Six</a> had a scathing quote from an insider, asserting that Affleck is just about done: “If there was a way to divorce on grounds of temporary insanity, he would. &#8230; He feels like the last two years were just a fever dream, and he’s come to his senses now and understands there is just no way this is going to work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neither Affleck nor Lopez have officially commented on the state of their relationship. Lopez was asked about divorce rumors while on a promotional tour for her sci-fi movie <em>Atlas</em>. She <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-rumours-b2550245.html\">dismissed the question</a>, saying it was inappropriate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On May 31, a “heartsick” Lopez announced in <a href=\"https://onthejlo.com/en/home/sc2e368d4-827c-4019-8a0d-4508bbbcaa4c\">her newsletter</a> that she was canceling her tour to spend more time with her kids. <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/05/31/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-cancels-tour-to-spend-times-with-kids-amid-ben-affleck-split-rumors/\">Page Six</a> reported that sources close to the singer denied that poor ticket sales were to blame for the thwarted tour, pointing instead toward the impending split from Affleck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>August 2024: The Bennifer divorce</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After a summer of rumors, in which the couple was not photographed together, it was announced that Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck on August 20, 2024, the second anniversary of their second wedding ceremony in Georgia. News outlets obtained <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jennifer-lopez-files-divorce-ben-affleck-after-2/story?id=111512204\">documents</a> confirming the legal split, which show that Lopez filed herself — <a href=\"https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-unusual-divorce-filing-legal-source-exclusive-8699103\">without a lawyer</a>. According to <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/20/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-file-divorce/\">TMZ</a>, the couple did not have a prenup. Neither Lopez nor Affleck have officially commented. The divorce filing comes two years and one month after the couple’s 2022 wedding.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why we care so much about Bennifer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hollywood is an industry where we don’t see many people genuinely be themselves. Actors make a living and win awards on how convincing they are playing someone else. From auditions to promotional tours, they’re constantly selling themselves, luring people to buy into their public personas. And while it seems like we have more access to celebrities’ personal lives than ever — everyone is on Instagram at this point — it’s an illusion that masks how curated these people’s lives are and how carefully they’re presenting themselves to the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The thing about Bennifer is that it genuinely feels like Affleck and Lopez do love each other in a very authentic way. After the first go-around, their agents, managers, and inner circles would have advised them against getting into a relationship because that’s not good business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Why would someone with a logical mind risk going through another round of bad press and harsh scrutiny? Why would someone spend $20 million of their own money making a movie about getting back together? Why would someone who hates the spotlight publicly get married to one of the most famous women in the world and star in her documentary about them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And to risk this all for it to possibly blow up in your face? Again?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That has to be love, right?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the millions of dollars and awards and homes in Montana, this makes Bennifer strangely relatable. So many people were so invested in them getting back together because, despite the trappings, it feels like a love story that could happen to anyone: getting a second chance with your soulmate because you’ve both learned from your past mistakes. Their story is enough to make us wistful for a romance we’ve had or maybe even ones that we haven’t had yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tough times are relatable, too. While a fairytale reunion with the one that got away can be a story that resonates, so can the experience of getting back with an ex only to have it implode. Loving someone immensely is different from having a loving relationship with them. Perhaps we don’t always change and learn from our mistakes. Watching it play out with Affleck and Lopez just makes it all that much clearer. And we can’t stop watching because we need to see how it all ends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, August 21, 2024, 12:50 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This piece, initially published on May 26, 2024, has been updated multiple times, most recently</em> <em>to reflect further details of Lopez’s divorce filing from Affleck. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Who was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._B._Cooper\">DB Cooper</a> and what happened to him? Who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_theft\">robbed the Gardner Museum</a> of its Vermeer and Rembrandts in 1990? And, most pressingly: where are the <a href=\"https://www.amjtransplant.org/article/S1600-6135(23)00462-8/abstract\">thousands of pancreases</a> taken out of Americans’ dead bodies in 2021, 2022, and 2023 that were never transplanted into anybody?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let me back up. Pancreata (the correct plural form of “pancreas”) are one of those organs you can’t live without. Without one, you don’t have insulin to regulate blood sugar or enzymes necessary to digest food. So all donated pancreata come from dead people who register as organ donors. In the US, we outsource the job of collecting organs from dead bodies to private groups called organ procurement organizations, or OPOs. Each OPO has a monopoly on organs in a particular geographic area; there are <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/?memberType=Organ%20Procurement%20Organizations&amp;organType=%27AL%27&amp;state=0&amp;region=0\">56 groups total</a>, some of which only cover part of a state and some of which cover multiple states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For some time now, independent analysts and investigative reporters have argued that OPOs are underusing deceased donor organs by the tens of thousands. One report from 2019 estimated that every year <a href=\"https://www.bridgespan.org/bridgespan/Images/articles/reforming-organ-donation-in-america/reforming-organ-donation-in-america-12-2018.pdf\">28,000 usable organs</a> (mostly kidneys but also pancreata, hearts, livers, etc.) from deceased donors are never used; another put <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/organ-transplant-shortages/?utm_term=.806b23dd755d\">the number at 75,000</a>. This, when the national waitlist for organs is <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics\">more than 100,000 people long</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, OPOs have faced perverse incentives. For instance, they were most often evaluated on the basis of how many organs are recovered per “eligible death,” but “eligible death” is a determination made by the OPOs themselves. That made it easy to juice the stats by, for instance, classifying some deaths as “ineligible” even when the organs were perfectly usable. That made “organs recovered per eligible deaths” go up without actually getting more people organs. OPO contracts with the federal government are <a href=\"https://archive.triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/taxpayers-help-pay-for-organ-donor-groups-parties-rose-parade-expenses/\">quite lucrative</a>, which means OPO executives have ample reason to <a href=\"https://www.pogo.org/investigations/heartless-organ-donation-contractors-lobby-against-a-popular-health-care-initiative-while-pocketing-pandemic-relief-loans\">fight hard</a> to retain them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2019, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/10/20687507/triump-kidney-disease-transplant\">issued a quite good executive order</a> instructing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees OPOs, to change the way they’re evaluated. The order led to two new metrics that were meant to be harder to game. The rule was finalized in December 2020, and — after also being reviewed and approved by the <a href=\"https://www.pogo.org/investigations/americas-transformative-new-organ-donation-rule-goes-into-effect-over-objections-from-monopolistic-contractors#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Medicare%20and,effective%20on%20March%2030%2C%202021.\">Biden administration</a> — <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/02/2021-02180/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-organ-procurement-organizations-conditions-for-coverage-revisions-to\">took effect in March 2021</a>. It came with real teeth: OPOs that did particularly badly would face decertification, meaning another OPO with a better track record of serving patients would take over their territory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rule had the potential to force OPOs to collect more organs and save thousands more lives every year. But the OPOs quickly figured out a new loophole.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The birth of the pancreas loophole</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rule’s new metrics were meant to be based on objective criteria. It asked OPOs to tally the total number of deceased people 75 and younger with causes of death compatible with donation, and then estimate the number of deceased donors each year as a share of that total population, and the number of organs actually used as a share of that total population. The denominator was now something that OPOs couldn’t tamper with. That meant, hopefully, that they’d be judged solely on how many organs they recovered and transplanted into people — on how many thousands of lives they saved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while OPOs couldn’t muck with the denominator anymore, they could still muck with the numerators. Being a donor generally means that your organs are used in a transplant, but there’s a carveout for one organ: the pancreas. A <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-108publ362\">narrow 2004 law</a> allows researchers running clinical trials to conduct transplants of islet cells (the parts of the pancreas that produce insulin) as a potential cure for diabetes. Because of that law, OPOs could “recover” pancreases for islet cell transplant research, and get credit for recovering more organs under the new rule. But the federal government never asked for any proof that these organs were part of any FDA-approved research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sure enough, the total number of pancreata that OPOs labeled as for “research” grew from 513 in 2020 to a whopping 3,238 in 2023. The number of donors whose only recovered organ was a pancreas designated for research grew from 25 to 429, according to the <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/\">Organ Procurement &amp; Transplantation Network</a>. That’s an over tenfold increase in three years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"OPOs reported many more pancreas recoveries right after the government started judging them on how many organs they recovered\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QrbaT/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"412\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, Lenny Bernstein, a reporter at the Washington Post who’s been watching this scandal closely, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/03/20/organ-transplant-groups-pancreas-collection/\">talked to pancreatic researchers</a> who all reported there was no sudden surge in need for pancreases in research projects. Indeed, if you look at the <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/?memberType=Transplant+Centers&amp;state=-1&amp;region=0\">small handful of medical centers</a> that use research pancreata for islet cell transplants, you find that there were only 24 transplants conducted in all of 2023: 22 at the University of Chicago Medical Center, and one each at City of Hope Medical Center outside Los Angeles, and at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s 3,238 pancreata recovered for islet cell transplant research in 2023, and only 24 actual transplants conducted that year. Where did the other 3,214 pancreata go? Where did the nearly 7,000 pancreata taken from dead Americans’ bodies over the past three years and not used for transplants go?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The waiting list for people needing just pancreata is <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics/detailed-description#fig1\">barely 800 people</a>. That number could be zero if these organs were better allocated. Where are they?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I asked the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (AOPO), a kind of trade group for the organ procurers, for an explanation. “CMS developed and implemented the current rule governing the use of pancreata for research in 2021. As is required, OPOs have been complying with the rule since that time,” AOPO’s president Dorrie Dils told Vox in a statement. “OPOs have always followed CMS guidance and will continue to do so.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s one interpretation. Another is that we could be seeing an attempt by OPOs to get around regulations, and avoid being decertified because they don’t facilitate enough donations. That’s certainly how the <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-cardin-young-raise-alarm-over-dramatic-increase-in-pancreata-procurement-\">Senate Finance Committee</a>, where a bipartisan group of senators has been investigating the matter, sees it. In a letter to OPOs sent last year, the committee quoted from a listserv of OPO employees. In a thread discussing the new rules, an OPO employee wrote, “If you have a donor with only a pancreas for research, that is an organ donor for the Donor Rate. Otherwise, a donor is any donor with at least 1 organ transplanted. Savvy (or cynical?) OPOs ought to start a pancreas for research program immediately.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Savvy (or cynical?) indeed! In a <a href=\"https://aopo.org/wp-content/uploads/AOPO-SFC-Pancreas-Research-Statement-03-21-2023.pdf\">reply to the committee</a>, AOPO protested that “OPOs have been operating according to the rule” and that the research donations mean “the organ does not go to waste.” Have they not gone to waste? The committee asked OPOs to report back which specific research studies they gave the pancreata to; I know of no OPO that has put out data formally tying each pancreas to a specific study.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This past January, <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-24-04-opo.pdf\">CMS sent a letter to OPOs</a> reminding them that they could only count pancreases that were actually used for research. But it should go a step further and do what the <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-cardin-and-young-call-on-cms-to-strengthen-protections-against-excessive-and-unnecessary-recoveries-of-pancreata-from-organ-donors\">Senate committee is urging</a>: clarify that only pancreata donated to research approved by the FDA counts under the rule. That is, OPOs cannot make themselves look better and avoid decertification just by recovering pancreata and then sticking them in a freezer. They have to actually get the pancreata into the hands of scientists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a very simple change, but it could mean the difference between rules that lead to thousands more organs going to people who need them, and rules that let the current system of unaccountable OPOs continue unabated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In that period, Harris has at times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/media/kamala-harris-press-interviews.html\">briefly answered questions</a> from reporters publicly — and has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2024/08/07/why-harris-isnt-taking-questions-00173115\">reportedly spoken</a> to her traveling press pool off the record. But she’s done no formal interviews and held no formal press conferences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fairness, she’s been quite busy. Over just a few scant weeks, Harris has had to take over a campaign, hit the trail, pick a running mate, develop a policy platform and message, and oversee preparations for a convention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On August 8, Harris <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/media/kamala-harris-press-interviews.html\">said</a> she wanted “to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.” With so much in flux, it’s perhaps not surprising that high-stakes reporter Q&amp;As aren’t at the top of the priority list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But should they be?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you zoom out from the electoral stakes, of course it’s bad for democracy if politicians avoid talking to the press. Of course we should, in the abstract, expect the next potential future president to publicly answer questions about their proposals and other topics in the news.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, with Harris’s campaign starting so unusually late, the public deserves to learn more about her. If she’s seen mainly in the tightly controlled and scripted settings of ads, rally speeches, and social media clips, we may not learn much about her views on issues and topics she prefers not to address, or assess how she responds to unplanned events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while it’s tempting to say (and convenient for journalists to argue) that Harris doing more press is both the right thing to do and the strategically smart thing for her to do, things may not align so neatly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Interviews and press conferences are risky for any politician. There is no guarantee they will go well, and for Harris in particular, some in recent years <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2021/06/08/kamala-harris-tells-nbcs-lester-holt-weve-been-to-the-border-he-responds-you-havent/\">have gone infamously poorly</a>. As a candidate trying to win an election (against an opponent who is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term\">hostile to democracy</a> and uses his own press appearances <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/fact-check-trump-bedminster-news-conference/index.html\">to lie and exaggerate wildly</a>), she will naturally weigh the risks and rewards of what might help, or harm, her campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what’s arguably the right thing to do for the health of our democracy — facing down some difficult media questions — really may not be the best strategy to help Harris win. However, remaining unavailable indefinitely poses its own strategic risks, and is likely unsustainable over the longer term.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interviews gone awry have haunted Harris in the past</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since Harris joined the race, she has jumped <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">out to a small lead</a> in polls and has benefited from overwhelmingly positive media coverage. The Democratic base has rallied around her and swing voters so far seem to like what they see. And all that has happened without a single formal press conference or interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With things trending so positively, interviews and press conferences appear to present mainly downside risk. That is: the campaign probably calculates that it’s unlikely many undecided voters will be persuaded by anything she says in such formats (as opposed to messaging Harris can more fully control, like rallies and ads), while a botched answer could generate a great deal of new negative coverage and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has suffered such fates in the past.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In January 2019, at the start of her presidential campaign, anchor Jake Tapper <a href=\"https://x.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1090090364420136960\">asked at a CNN town hall</a> whether her support of Medicare-for-all meant she wanted to eliminate private health insurance. Harris responded by saying that, yes, you won’t have to go through a private insurance company anymore: “​​Let’s eliminate all that. Let’s move on.” That answer, and the topic of health care generally, would dog her in the months to come (she <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/28/kamala-harris-reverses-answer-abolishing-private-health-insurance-saying-she-misheard-question/\">would eventually backtrack</a> on her answer).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Accounts of Harris’s vice presidency typically treat a <a href=\"https://x.com/TODAYshow/status/1402224936136187907\">June 2021 interview</a> with Lester Holt of NBC News as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-president.html\">the moment</a> that put her off interviews in general. Tasked by President Joe Biden with addressing root causes of unauthorized immigration, Harris came prepared to discuss that policy matter and her <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/kamala-harris-foreign-trip/index.html\">recent trip</a> to Guatemala and Mexico. But Holt pressed her on a different question: why hadn’t she gone to the border herself yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The question was of questionable relevance — how much can a president or vice president really learn from a brief border drop-by? And Harris <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc\">had been tasked</a> with addressing “root causes” and migration-related diplomacy with the Mexican and Guatemalan governments, not border security logistics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris answered strangely. Rather than simply batting it away by giving a vague answer that she planned to visit the border later on, she said she’d go at some point but then <a href=\"https://x.com/TODAYshow/status/1402224936136187907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1402224936136187907%7Ctwgr%5E5523f213c4be80c2e5c7170e8599b0319d4d92c1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2021%2F06%2F08%2F1004504140%2Fharris-tries-to-turn-the-focus-to-migration-but-gets-bogged-down-in-border-quest\">asserted</a> “We’ve been to the border,” repeating that sentence four times. Holt naturally followed up by saying that she hadn’t, in fact, been to the border. Harris responded: “And I haven’t been to Europe,” and laughed, before saying she didn’t understand Holt’s point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris seemed to be trying to say that you don’t always have to physically go somewhere to learn a lot about a policy issue, and that she had only been in office for a few months and couldn’t have traveled everywhere yet. Regardless of what she meant, that exchange instantly became the only thing anyone focused on about that interview, and it earned Harris much mockery and criticism. Unsurprisingly, she did far fewer interviews like that afterward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Accounts of Harris’s thinking suggest she intensely prepares for such interviews, that she’s highly concerned things may go wrong, and that she believes racism and sexism give her less leeway to make a mistake. “She felt as if she would be unfairly punished by the press corps if she ever faltered — and that her slipups might make it difficult for every Black woman who followed in her path,” Franklin Foer wrote in his book about the Biden administration, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534055/the-last-politician-by-franklin-foer/\"><em>The Last Politician</em></a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris may feel she has to give interviews to avoid negative coverage for not giving interviews</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Politicians in certain situations have good reasons to talk to the press. Some seek to increase their prominence and name recognition. Some are hoping to turn around their numbers because they are losing. Some want to promote their ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of these currently apply to Harris, who has gotten a ton of coverage since unexpectedly becoming the new Democratic nominee, who is currently leading in polls and who is still honing her ideas for a campaign and governing agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is actually a strategic case that doing more press could have its benefits for Harris — or at least, that it could avert possible future pitfalls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, if a candidate does not have ample practice doing press in unscripted settings, he or she may get rusty and perform worse when such settings are unavoidable. (This may have been one factor explaining Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358652/biden-drop-out-debate-harris-convention\">candidacy-destroying performance</a> at the June debate.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, if Harris keeps avoiding interviews, grumbling from the press will likely increase, and the narrative that she’s too afraid or incompetent to do interviews could catch on, generating negative coverage of a kind she’s mostly avoided so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, the post-convention period is arguably the optimal time for Harris to do press, since as Election Day draws nearer, the media typically frames coverage far more as a binary choice for the voters between the two nominees. That’s a frame Harris likely prefers, as she can focus on prosecuting the case against Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, expect Harris to do more press soon after the convention ends. But probably not too much more — unless she sees something in it for her.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his 2024 Democratic National Convention address on Tuesday night, former President Barack Obama made no secret of his disdain for Donald Trump. But his speech was more than just a partisan broadside: It was a philosophical brief in defense of liberalism, a kind of first-principles moral argument that no other major convention speaker offered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Liberal, in this context, does not refer to the term’s use in partisan American politics. It refers instead to the centuries-old philosophical tradition that sees politics as fundamentally oriented around the values of freedom and equality. Government, for liberals, exists to enable people to live according to their own vision for their lives; it has no business telling people what god to worship or giving certain groups of people more rights than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Obama was a <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/books/edition/A_Thousand_Small_Sanities/6N1sDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=gopnik+liberalism&amp;printsec=frontcover\">thoroughly liberal president</a>,&nbsp;and Trump a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/9/20750160/liberalism-trump-putin-socialism-reactionary\">thoroughly illiberal one</a>. This clearly troubled Obama — troubled him so much, in fact, that he dedicated this most high-profile speech to explaining why Trump must be defeated not just politically but also philosophically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The stakes of 2024, according to Barack Obama</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Obama is hardly the first person to declare Trump a mortal enemy of liberalism. Ever since 2016, there’s been a library’s worth of books published on liberalism’s Trump-induced crisis and how it ought to be resolved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of Obama’s remarks followed this literature rather closely. Like many, Obama sees Trump’s divisive political style as opposed to liberalism’s core principle of equality: that all citizens deserve to be treated equally, each free to pursue a good life in the way they see fit (as long as they don’t hurt others in doing so).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, Obama says, draws an elemental distinction “between the real Americans, who of course support [Trump], and the outsiders who don’t.” And that Trump and his allies believe “one group’s gain is another group’s loss,” and that “freedom means the powerful can do pretty much whatever they please.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, Obama says, is wrong. It’s wrong not just for Democrats and progressives, but for Americans — citizens of a country whose <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691176604/the-expanding-blaze?srsltid=AfmBOoo3VtHFH5avX3a7GKBKl_8qJXDIPWg6RkSFl0u3EQL5bxCBUGx5\">very existence grew out of liberal thought</a>. The Harris campaign, in his telling, is tapping into a fundamental liberal impulse that permeates the American body politic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The vast majority of us do not want to live in a country that’s bitter and divided,” Obama said. “We want something that’s better. We want to be better. And the joy and excitement surrounding this campaign tells us that we’re not alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Living this liberal vision, for Obama, means accepting the diversity inherent to a large society made up of people with all sorts of beliefs and worldviews: recognizing that “our fellow citizens deserve the same grace we hope they’ll extend to us.” It means understanding “true freedom” as something that gives all of us the right “to make decisions about our own life [and] requires us to recognize that other people have the right to make decisions that are different than ours.” And it means seeing democracy as more than “just a bunch of abstract principles and a bunch of dusty laws in a book somewhere,” but rather “the values we live by.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, to be clear, is not a case that Trump is un-American and thus will definitely lose: Obama took great pains to emphasize that the race was still close and could go either way. Rather, Obama is saying that what Trump stands for contradicts many of the values that Americans claim to hold dear — our core sense of what our country is about and what it stands for. That America’s truest identity is liberal, and that this identity can transcend those things that divide us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I want to agree with that. But as I <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/\">argue in my recent book</a>, there is a deeply illiberal strain in American politics — an ideology born out of the essential contradiction between America’s stated liberal ideals and the reality of chattel slavery at its founding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This tradition, like Trump, rejects core liberal-democratic ideals about equality. It is no more and no less American than our loftier stated ideals; both represent authentic aspects of America’s identity, and both have triumphed at different times throughout our country’s history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The question, then, is not whether American liberalism can reassert its naturally dominant place. It is whether the America that Obama believes in will triumph in this round of a centuries-old struggle against an authoritarian twin.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "During his 2024 Democratic National Convention address on Tuesday night, former President Barack Obama made no secret of his disdain for Donald Trump. But his speech was more than just a partisan broadside: It was a philosophical brief in defense of liberalism, a kind of first-principles moral argument that no other major convention speaker offered.

It’s the contagious power of hope!” she said, adding: “America, hope is making a comeback.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rhetoric harkened back to Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008 — when Democrats ran on hope and change. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But when you think about it, it’s kind of brutal toward Kamala Harris’s predecessor as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Michelle Obama was quite clearly implying that the party, and perhaps the country, had lost hope under Joe Biden, and that it took Harris to bring that hope back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Few Democrats have gone so far as to openly admit how bad the vibes had gotten. Even before Biden’s disastrous debate with Donald Trump in June, his polling had been quite poor for nearly a year. More and more people in the party began to view defeat as highly likely, if not inevitable. Since then, hope has indeed returned, but in this new era of good feelings, few Democrats have publicly dwelled on how bleak things had been.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The speech crystallized something fascinating about how the presidential contest has changed in the past month — namely, that Harris seems to have become the “change” candidate who can channel hopes for the future, even though her administration currently runs Washington and she is the incumbent vice president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In part, that’s because Harris is younger — not being an octogenarian or even a septuagenarian — and because her election would be a demographic first. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s also because her opponent Donald Trump has already served as president, and has incessantly dominated the nation’s politics and much of its mental mindshare for the past decade. Not only is Trump obsessed with relitigating controversies and grudges from his first term, but he also has too much of a political history at this point to credibly promise he could lead the country in a truly new direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the public is dissatisfied, a newer, lesser-known change candidate can have a real advantage. Without having been in power, such a candidate can be all things to all people; they can represent the public’s hopes, having not yet disappointed them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Barack Obama thought this was crucial in his rise to political prominence, “I serve as a blank screen,” he wrote in his 2006 book <em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, “on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has benefited from a similar dynamic. She has given Democrats, and voters generally, who were disappointed or disillusioned under Biden a reason to hope she will be different in a way that they like. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was on display Tuesday, when both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault spoke effusively about Harris not too far removed from each other. It’s also been evident in how protests of Biden’s Israel policies have been far less of a factor at the convention than many expected. And it’s front and center in the campaign’s rhetoric that Harris wants to go forward, not back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The risk of being the change candidate is that you are less experienced, but being the incumbent veep helps Harris with that. Currently, she appears to be getting the benefits of experience from serving under Biden without the downsides of being held accountable for his record.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump team now very much wants to recouple Harris and Biden — blaming her for the inflation, foreign crises, and border chaos that have occurred in the past four years. In the face of these attacks, Harris’s task is to ensure voters keep viewing her as the new and hopeful future, rather than the past. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

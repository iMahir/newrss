The announcement comes one day after the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://time.com/7010665/mpox-health-emergency-africa/\">declared</a> mpox a continent-wide public health emergency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although many countries outside of Africa rapidly contained an mpox pandemic that began <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/7/25/23277404/worldwide-monkeypox-outbreak-2022\">in 2022</a>, large outbreaks continued unabated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. Unfortunately, the strain circulating there is a deadlier version of the one that earlier made its way to the US and Europe. In recent months, this strain has spread from the DRC into four other east and central African nations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease closely related to but much less severe than smallpox, and is suspected to originate in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html#:~:text=Monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered%20in,regions%20where%20mpox%20is%20endemic.\">African rodents and non-human primates</a>. Mpox <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html\">spreads</a> through close contact with an infected person, including from sexual and skin-to-skin-contact. Pregnant people can also pass the virus to their child during pregnancy and after birth. The most common <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/symptoms/index.html\">symptom</a> of mpox is a blister-like rash that typically lasts for two to four weeks. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle aches, cough, and sore throat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.\">For decades</a>, mpox caused sporadic cases and outbreaks in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and several&nbsp;other African countries.<strong> </strong>There are two <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/mpox#:~:text=Mpxv%20virus%20variants%20are%20referred,Clade%20IIa%20and%20Clade%20IIb.\">main strains</a> of mpox: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html\">clade I</a>, which causes more severe illness and has historically been confined to central Africa, and clade II, which has historically caused infections in west Africa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox\">May 2022</a>, countries outside of Africa suddenly started recording mpox cases which were caused by the clade II type. That July, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern for the first time. By May 2023, more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/response/2022/world-map.html\">100 countries</a> had recorded nearly 90,000 mpox cases and over <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/mpox\">150 deaths</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fortunately, public health agencies around the world acted quickly to improve disease surveillance efforts, increasing awareness among high-risk populations, particularly men who have sex with men, and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/monkeypox-response-in-europe\">encouraging</a> safe sex practices. In the US and Europe, where there were just over 30,000 and 25,000 mpox cases respectively between May 2022 and May 2023, officials also disseminated over a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a2.htm\">million</a> vaccine doses. Consequently, mpox transmission in most countries quickly dwindled. In <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox\">May 2023</a>, the World Health Organization lifted the emergency status.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although at the time the World Health Organization no longer considered mpox an international health emergency, countries around the world continued to report cases. In June 2024, there were 175 cases reported across North, Central, and South America; 100 cases were reported in Europe, and 11 cases were reported in Southeast Asian countries, according to a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true\">situation report</a> published by the World Health Organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522\">outbreak</a> in the DRC remained particularly bad. Unlike in the rest of the world, the mpox strain causing infections in the DRC is the more severe <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true\">clade I type</a>. As of May 2024, there have been <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522\">7,851</a> mpox cases and 384 deaths reported in the country.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding mpox</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vox diligently covered the outbreak of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, back in 2022.

Let’s talk about it.</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the past few months, the clade I mpox spread from the DRC to <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153141\">four countries in east Africa</a> — Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda — which spurred concerns that a deadlier mpox pandemic might be on the horizon and triggered the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to designate the ongoing mpox outbreaks as health emergencies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Africa CDC is the public health <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/\">agency</a> of the African Union, which represents 55 African states. It is the first time the agency has designated any outbreak a continental emergency.&nbsp;Other African countries are also facing resurging mpox outbreaks caused by the clade II virus. In May, there were a total of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true\">465</a> mpox cases documented across all African countries and in June there were 567, a 22 percent increase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We declare today this public health emergency of continental security to mobilize our institutions, our collective will, and our resources to act swiftly and decisively,” said Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya in a press briefing Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But outbreak response efforts in the DRC and other African countries have once again been hamstrung by the same challenges health officials faced during previous outbreaks and pandemics, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22759707/covid-19-vaccine-gap-covax-rich-poor-countries-boosters\">including Covid</a>: a lack of global solidarity and an unwillingness to share life-saving resources. While vaccine doses were rapidly disseminated in the US and Europe in 2022, vaccines are only now starting to trickle into the DRC. But even so, only a couple hundred thousand vaccines will be available for a population of more than <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL\">100 million</a> people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Slowly, national governments and multinational organizations such as the African Union are working to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/24/24048361/mpox-covid-outbreak-africa-cdc-public-health\">improve</a> domestic public health infrastructure and technical capacity and to reduce dependency on donor countries. While Africa CDC’s unprecedented move to designate the mpox outbreaks a regional health emergency signals a continuation of these efforts, it is unclear if the designation will help spur the rapid influx of resources needed to respond to the mpox outbreaks.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Mpox origins and unknowns</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mpox was first discovered in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.\">1958</a> in a colony of monkeys in a research facility in Denmark, and the first case of mpox in a human — a nine-month-old infant — was not documented until <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html\">1970</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Researchers and physicians could <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2480792/pdf/bullwho00192-0028.pdf\">not determine</a> exactly how the infant became infected; however, close contact with an infected monkey may have caused the infection. Small rodents, monkeys, and mammals <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html\">can pass</a> the virus on to humans but outbreaks typically take off when humans infect each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2005, additional mpox cases in humans were recorded in the DRC, and thousands of suspected cases have been reported every year since then. Since 2017, mpox has also caused frequent infections in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although mpox has been around for a long time, there are still many unknowns about how the virus spreads and why it suddenly spread around the world in 2022. What researchers do know is that the virus has been rapidly mutating in recent years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Interestingly and maybe worryingly, while most genetic mutations have no effect at all, some can cause viruses to become deadlier or more effective at spreading. When geneticists compared the 2022 mpox genome to a sample collected in 2017, they <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02456-8\">found</a> some <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/\">40</a> genetic <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01675-2#Sec4\">mutations</a> had occurred. Some researchers have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mpox-why-the-viruss-continued-rapid-mutation-since-the-2022-global-outbreak-remains-a-concern-228338\">suggested</a> that these mutations have improved how easily the virus can spread from person to person, but it seems that there is no firm <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/\">consensus</a> yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In September 2023, an entirely new mpox clade I variant, tentatively called clade IB, was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522\">discovered</a> in the DRC. The World Health Organization has not confirmed if the new variant causes more severe disease or can be spread more easily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rosamund Lewis, the mpox technical lead at the World Health Organization, posits that genetic mutations are not behind the sudden global surge of mpox. Instead, she suggests that the virus happened to start infecting new populations — sex workers and men who have sex with men — and that has in turn fueled wider transmission. Mpox is reminiscent of the origins of HIV, when <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234451/#:~:text=Approximately%20one%20century%20ago%20in,the%20AIDS%20pandemic%20in%20humans.\">chimpanzees</a> infected humans in southwestern Cameroon before taking firm <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-kinshasa-1920s-was-perfect-place-hiv-go-global-180952953/\">root</a> in the booming urban center — and among the large sex worker population — of Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sexual transmission among adults may only be one of the main drivers of mpox transmission. In the DRC, some <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/mpox-risk-assessment.html\">70 percent</a> of mpox cases recorded this year were among children who were likely exposed through close contact with infected animals or household members who were infected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the biggest risk factors for severe mpox infection and <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00273-8/fulltext\">death</a> is preexisting <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/hiv.html\">HIV infection</a>. Unfortunately, about <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids#:~:text=There%20are%2025.6%20million%20people%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%20the%20African%20region.&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20about%20380%2C000%20people,AIDS%20related%20illness%20in%202022.\">25.6 million</a> people in Africa have HIV, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363716/africa-hiv-aids-sub-saharan-progress\">more</a> than any other region in the world,<strong> </strong>meaning many African nations may experience deadlier outbreaks than other parts of the world. The dual burden of mpox and HIV was also a major factor that prompted the Africa CDC to declare the mpox outbreaks a continental emergency, Kaseya explained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>There is an mpox vaccine shortage. Will emergency designations help?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are at least two vaccines — <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos\">Jynneos</a>, also called <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imvanex\">Imvanex</a> in Europe, which is made by Danish company Bavarian Nordic, and <a href=\"https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/lc16-kmb-mpox-smallpox-vaccine#:~:text=LC16%20is%20a%203rd%20generation,emergency%20investigational%20new%20drug%20program.\">LC16</a>, which is manufactured by Japanese company KM Biologics — that are effective against mpox. The US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-live-non-replicating-vaccine-prevent-smallpox-and-monkeypox\">approved </a>the Jynneos vaccine for use against smallpox and mpox in 2019.&nbsp;LC16 was developed for smallpox but is also effective against mpox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the US and Europe started recording mpox cases in 2022, health officials quickly disseminated millions of doses of existing vaccines. For the first two years of the pandemic, however, no vaccines were available in the DRC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DRC, like most countries in Africa, <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/\">does not have</a> the infrastructure to produce its own vaccines nor can it afford to pay for millions of doses. (The mpox vaccine costs just under $100 per dose, according to Kaseya; GDP per capita in the <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CD\">DRC is just $649</a>.) Thus, these countries must rely on donations from the US, Europe, and other countries. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the Africa CDC started leading <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/\">efforts</a> to fill this crucial gap, but progress has been slow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the void, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries have been carrying on their outbreak responses without vaccines. It wasn’t until last month that the first shipments of mpox vaccines started arriving in the DRC. But the country received only 200,000 doses, according to Lewis, forcing personnel to cobble together a plan outlining how they will utilize such finite resources. Kaseya did not elaborate on how Africa CDC will aid in this process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Donor governments have been providing technical and financial support for mpox outbreak responses in Africa. Last week, the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, announced that it will surge <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-07-2024-united-states-announces-424-million-additional-assistance-democratic-republic-congo\">$10 million</a> in funds to support the mpox response in DRC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It remains unclear if the new emergency designations will have any impact on mpox vaccine availability. Still, the Africa CDC and World Health Organization are increasing financial resources for the mpox response.  Earlier this month, the African Union released <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Emergency-Approval-of-10.4-Million-to-Africa-CDC-for-Mpox-Outbreak-Respons.pdf\">$10.4 million</a> in funds for the mpox response. The World Health Organization has promised <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153176\">$1.45 million</a> in emergency funds, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, with more to follow in the coming days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is a fight for all Africans and we will fight it together,” Kaseya said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, August 14, 3:30 pm: </strong>This story, originally published August 13, has been updated with news of the WHO&#8217;s emergency declaration.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Stocks rose on Thursday following a morning report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that inflation eased more than expected in June. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Economic data released this week suggests inflation is continuing to cool, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would relieve some of the pressure high borrowing costs put on consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released Wednesday, year-over-year inflation dipped to 2.9 percent overall, lower than any month since March 2021. The CPI captures the change in prices of representative goods and services purchased by consumers compared to the same month in the previous year and is considered a standard measure of inflation. Though the report found costs associated with <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/cpi-report-for-july-inflation-expected-to-rise-again-after-last-month-s-surprise-fall/card/child-care-costs-keep-rising-faster-than-overall-prices-4wnNJD91W3xygHPTPbbU\">child care</a> and <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/cpi-report-for-july-inflation-expected-to-rise-again-after-last-month-s-surprise-fall/card/shelter-inflation-increase-disappointing-but-not-worrying-economists-say-UoGbmaBktFEPNbh6Jjyg\">renting a home</a> continue to rise at a higher rate than prices overall, inflation has dropped significantly since its peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, and it is now inching closer to the Fed’s 2 percent target rate. And if it were not for rental inflation, the overall inflation rate would be below that 2 percent target. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It follows another good day of data on Tuesday, when the latest Producer Price Index report, which measures the change in prices for goods and services sold by producers to retailers, indicated that wholesale inflation had also come down to 0.1 percent, on par with low pre-pandemic levels. High wholesale inflation can sometimes indicate that prices will rise for consumers because retailers have to recoup higher costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These numbers suggest a better economy for consumers, but the overall picture certainly isn’t perfect. The US only added <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/economy-recession-jobs-unemployment-c7f1985b1ab3a7b781920c2693cd0438\">114,000 jobs</a> in July, below expectations of about 150,000, and unemployment rose to 4.3 percent — higher than any month since October 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These numbers are not in and of themselves a crisis: The unemployment rate is still relatively low, and the underperformance in hiring isn’t catastrophic, but both have been taken as signals that the US economy might be showing some cracks.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What low inflation means for the economy and interest rates</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This week’s news has many economists and finance experts arguing that the time has come for the US Federal Reserve — which sets interest rates, manages the money supply, and purchases assets as a steward of the US economy — should cut interest rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Today’s inflation data provides further support for aggressive Fed rate cuts beginning in September,” said Morningstar’s chief US economist Preston Caldwell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An interest rate cut would make it easier for consumers and businesses alike to pay off debt and borrow money. That could eventually improve hiring and lead to overall economic growth. But there’s some uncertainty about just how much a rate cut would help the overall economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fed chair Jerome Powell has been making statements in the last month that left open the possibility the Fed will cut rates at its September 17 meeting without fully committing. “The overall sense of the committee … is that we&#8217;re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial back restriction. We&#8217;re not at the point yet,” he said on August 1. “We want to see more good data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Caldwell said that Morningstar is projecting a 0.25 percent cut in September, rather than the 0.5 percent cut that other analysts are expecting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The urgency of cutting rates has increased in recent weeks given the troubling job numbers as well as a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed\">brief global stock market meltdown</a> linked to trading activity in Japan. Both were seen as signs the economy could use a little stimulation. But even lower interest rates might not immediately relieve the existing pressures on the economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is growing unease, among both financial analysts and consumers, that a recession is on the horizon. Caldwell said Morningstar is projecting a deceleration in economic activity in the next year. Some other analysts warn that the US economy could <a href=\"https://qz.com/ubs-ceo-sergio-ermotti-slowdown-1851621953\">see a downturn</a> even without an official recession — which is defined as two straight quarters of negative economic growth.

As Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed\">recently told me</a>, households and businesses have handled their debt relatively well, and hiring has remained solid for much longer than most people anticipated.

However, like many other dogs in American history, pit bulls have gone through cycles of stigmatization driven by both societal and cultural forces. Before pit bulls were demonized, the first dog that caused the public to panic was the Spitz — a pomeranian-like breed that’s now considered a “toy” dog. But back in the 19th century, they were called “venomous beasts” on the pages of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1876/11/17/archives/a-venomous-beast.html?searchResultPosition=1\">the New York Times</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So how did pit bulls go from family friend to national foe?

But no one counted on Raygun — the newly infamous, 36-year-old, last-place Australian b-girl (as breakers are called) whose <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jwdaddy80/status/1822828281617666084\">performance</a> on the Paris stage included bizarre floor-writhing, awkward freezes, and “original” moves like kangaroo hops.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">my five year old niece after she says “watch this!” :  <a href=\"https://t.co/KBAMSkgltj\">pic.twitter.com/KBAMSkgltj</a></p>&mdash; alex (@alex_abads) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex_abads/status/1821945716064821450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 9, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Raygun, real name Rachael Gunn, instantly became a viral sensation — notoriety that only skyrocketed when the public learned that Gunn, who won none of her Olympics battles, actually has a PhD in breakdancing. <a href=\"https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/rachael-gunn\">Yes, really</a>. Gunn’s performance has not only overshadowed the two actual breaking gold medalists, Japan’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gfc_ami/\">Yuasa Ami</a> and Canada’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXMkP2zTXY0\">Phil Wizard</a> (plus 16-year-old Australian b-boy <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/j__attack/?\">Jeff Dunne</a>), it’s arguably become the defining moment of a Parisian Games <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/sports/364856/olympics-boxing-imane-khelif-angela-carini\">marked</a> by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/sport/jordan-chiles-bronze-olympics-controversy-explained/index.html\">controversy</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2024-olympics-seine-river-illness-02d937f2d5f0fd20efafbf2250264aea\">absurdity</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But alongside widespread mockery of Gunn herself runs speculation that Gunn’s presence at the Games had to be some sort of mistake, even corruption. Surely, this couldn’t be the best Australia had to offer? How did Raygun wind up at the Olympics when, for example, last weekend in Melbourne a couple of b-girls were serving these moves?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-j58k_SuxM/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-j58k_SuxM/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-j58k_SuxM/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Ayvee (@__ayvee__)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To answer this question, we have to go on a bit of a deep dive — so let’s (sorry) hop on in.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reports Raygun manipulated her way into the Olympics couldn’t be further from the truth…</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For decades, the WDSF was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/366017/breaking-olympic-sport-what-to-know\">devoted to ballroom dancing</a>. The association started in the late ’90s with a focus on winning a place in the Olympics for ballroom dancing before its subsequent pivot, around 2017, toward breaking. A quizzical backstory, yes — but it doesn’t make the organization less legitimate. <a href=\"https://www.worlddancesport.org/Officials/Te-Hiiritanga-Robert-Wepiha-5ea90df8-2e8b-4bc4-adfe-ae66008749d0\">Te Hiiritanga Wepiha</a>, a.k.a. Rush, one of the judges in the women’s breaking final for the Oceania championship Gunn won, posted a 90-minute livestreamed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-nA98kS4lL/?igsh=eWJuNTltMXZseW40\">Instagram commentary</a> on Tuesday in response to the controversy. He pointed out that the WDSF judging system, used in the Olympics and its breaking qualifiers, requires judges to be veterans in the breaking scene, both as competitors and as judges, as well as to pass multiple exams. “You have to be trained to be a judge,” he insisted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This wasn’t Gunn’s first rodeo either. Prior to her Olympics appearance, she represented Australia at multiple World Championship competitions between 2021 and 2023. She <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hnj1cNLL4\">judged</a> Red Bull’s preeminent BC One breaking contest. She’s an established local champ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet following Gunn’s appearance at the Olympics, a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/hold-raygun-rachel-gunn-anna-mears-accountable-for-unethical-conduct-olympic-selection\">petition</a> circulated claiming, without sources, that Gunn and her husband, breaking coach Samuel Free, had manipulated the entire WDSF system in order to gain a spot at the Olympics. The petition falsely claimed Gunn had judged herself at the qualifying Oceania championship competition — despite the judges’ list for the event being <a href=\"https://www.worlddancesport.org/Competitions/Officials/Oceania-Championship-Sydney-Adult-Breaking-1vs1-B-Girls-60318\">readily available</a> on the WDSF website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other rumors further <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CLouvres/status/1823211157014085981\">alleged</a>, again without any apparent sourcing, that Gunn and her husband were the masterminds behind the Australian Breaking Association, better known as <a href=\"https://ausbreak.org/\">AUSBreaking</a> — another <a href=\"https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/charities/582aa363-5afb-e911-a811-000d3ad1f29c/people\">easily debunked</a> claim. An AUSBreaking spokesperson further confirmed to Vox in an email that Gunn and her husband did not found the organization. Gunn doesn’t appear to be directly responsible for managing, or funding, any breaking group, which likely also negates the petition’s claim that she denied travel funding to a marginalized dance crew from Australia’s Northern Territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>…But that doesn’t mean it’s easy to understand how she got there</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The subtext of this criticism — that Gunn benefited from her whiteness — has merit. Gunn was educated at one of Sydney’s most elite high schools; she had the opportunity to get a PhD in an obscure field, and the wealth to fund appearances at international breaking competitions. Her white privilege in a dance scene rife with cultural appropriation makes her an easy target for criticism. At the same time, some have tried to argue she represents exactly the opposite — a “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iudBeuoA2RA\">diversity hire</a>” and Australian “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConceptualJames/status/1823012007324385763\">wokeness</a>” gone wrong. “People have jumped on and used her as the new scapegoat to further their cause,” Wepiha observed in his livestream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We never thought this would happen,” he told me. “She’s getting torn down by a lot of people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, while the rest of the world has put Gunn through the ringer since her Paris appearance, the actual breaking community seems to have <a href=\"https://www.ktiv.com/2024/08/12/breaking-community-defends-b-girl-raygun-breaking-is-all-about-originality-bringing-something-new-table/\">rallied</a> behind her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is what happens when people outside of our dance want to control the narrative but have absolutely no expertise of technical knowledge on our dance, particularly in an Oceania context,” Dujon Cullingford, a veteran New Zealand breaker who attended the Oceania qualifiers, told me. Cullingford <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10160560771447967&amp;id=536182966&amp;mibextid=WC7FNe&amp;rdid=HzSLKjOFKIwxikNK\">wrote a Facebook post</a> arguing against the idea Gunn benefited from any factor besides a small talent pool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He emphasized that Oceania’s breaking community is tiny; one of Gunn’s own <a href=\"https://research-management.mq.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/338493337/Publisher_version.pdf\">articles</a> placed the number of Australian breakers at around 400, total, and Wepiha claimed the WDSF had to “get people out of retirement in order to make up the numbers” of competitors. One of the main criticisms being bandied about concerns a public <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MorhA98eK7M&amp;lc=Ugxxry-kM60vXoyI98V4AaABAg\">perception</a> that the WDSF must not have been promoting their events among “real” breaking scenes, but rather elitist communities like universities. But both Cullingford and Wepiha rejected this idea. “It’s very easy to know if there’s a jam on because the scene is tiny,” Wepiha said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Down here, like other countries, we feel the squeeze of cost of living, and the breaking scene is small so it doesn&#8217;t produce a lot of people who have time to teach, lead crews, and mobilize the community in the same way,” Cullingford said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He noted that, further diminishing the small talent pool, many breakers chose not to compete in the Olympics qualifiers because they didn’t want to shell out the cash needed to travel to the competition in Sydney last November. Additionally, many breakers simply had no interest in participating due to the feeling that the efforts of the establishment to rope breaking into the rigid organizational structure of the Games was antithetical to street dance culture. According to Wepiha, many dancers felt informal jams are more expressive with less strict judging — the kind of breaking they want to do, as opposed to Olympic-level battling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there was Raygun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“She rocked up like everybody else,” Wepiha said in his livestream regarding Gunn’s Oceania qualifier. “She won fair and square.” He pointed out that of the 10 judges at the event, only one was white and none were Australian — a fact AUSBreaking also confirmed to Vox. “She won by majority decision, she battled like everyone else … it’s not that deep.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can judge for yourself: in the Oceania Championships Raygun won which secured her spot in the Olympics, she netted 51 overall points to 50 scored by her opponent Holy Molly (Molly Chapman). The crucial final points came in this battle when the pair faced off, with Raygun winning two of three rounds.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"RAYGUN VS MOLLY | FINAL BGIRL | WDSF OCEANIA BREAKING CHAMPIONSHIPS 2023\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MorhA98eK7M?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since Gunn became a viral sensation, many people have watched this battle and claimed that Molly was the clear winner, but it’s not so simple. For one thing, these judges had seen their overall performances throughout the competition. If Molly was recycling moves from previous battles while Raygun kept things unique, the judges probably would have favored Raygun. Other factors to keep in mind include things like who was more on beat, which dancer spent more time on floor moves as opposed to the transitional dance moves called toprock, whose movements were stronger and more fluid, whose moves were crisper and more precise, and whose transitions were more interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to this, both Chapman and Gunn competed in the World Championships in Belgium in September 2023. While neither of them qualified then, out of 80 competitors, Gunn <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/celebrity/the-inside-story-of-how-raygun-broke-into-the-olympics-20240812-p5k1mg.html\">ranked</a> 64th — a full 15 slots ahead of Chapman, who came in next to last.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this means, despite the viral narrative that’s attached to her, it isn’t as simple as writing Gunn’s Olympics entrance off as a hilarious fluke or a mark of privileged corruption. Indeed,&nbsp;according to Gunn, she intended to bring a style of movement to the Paris Games that was less about meeting expectations and more about making an indelible impact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What I wanted to do was come out here and do something new and different and creative — that’s my strength, my creativity,” Gunn <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40798973/paris-2024-olympics-raygun-fails-fire-breakdancing-breaking-debut\">told ESPN</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I was never going to beat these girls on what they do best, the dynamic and the power moves, so I wanted to move differently, be artistic and creative because how many chances do you get … in a lifetime to do that.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Score by score, Raygun’s dancing isn’t actually that bad. Really.</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gunn has been reflecting on what her style is for some time. In one of her academic articles on breaking, she <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305519064_Don't_Worry_it's_Just_a_Girl_Negotiating_and_Challenging_Gendered_Assumptions_in_Sydney's_Breakdancing_Scene\">argues</a>, “Gender norms both articulate and limit my corporeal potential.” Gunn has also written about what she sees as the dance’s “normative construction” of masculinity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, the weirdness of Gunn’s dance … might be the whole point. Moreover, in more informal breaking venues, it’s not even that weird. “What Raygun showcased at the Olympics is that breaking is a spectrum,” Wepiha said in his livestream. He argued her style represents that more informal, self-expressive side of street dance. “She went up there and did what a lot of you complaining could never do. She was her authentic self.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You may well ask: But don’t we have to hold Olympians to a higher standard of excellence? Even if that excellence is forged from a masculinist construction of athleticism and dance?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well… do we? There’s every indication Gunn is currently the most famous b-girl in the world, and while most people are laughing at her, not with her, somewhere in the wide vast world of breaking, other b-girls may feel inspired rather than shamed and mortified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, even by the Olympic standards, Gunn didn’t do that badly. If you look at the <a href=\"https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/results/breaking/b-girls/gpb-000200--\">judges’ scoring</a>, for example, of her battle with US breaker Logistx, you can see that while she nabbed zero rounds, a handful of judges had her beating Logistx in some subcategories, usually originality. Meanwhile, while Logistx won most categories, she typically<em> </em>only won by a few percentage points at best.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, Gunn arguably held her own at the Olympics under a once-in-a-lifetime amount of pressure, and she did it while trying out her own unique style.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Was it great? No. Was it bad? Evidently not as bad as we thought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ambiguity leaves us with a mess; many (though certainly <a href=\"https://x.com/wrong_speak/status/1823002717905711398\">not all</a>) of the people heaping criticism upon Gunn are people who barely knew what breaking was a fortnight ago, while many of the people rushing to defend her are breaking veterans. In between are the people who just want to meme. The situation has some Australian breakers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/14/raygun-breaking-paris-olympics-australian-dance-industry\">worried</a> the backlash will drive away sponsors and support — which, Wepiha told me, was already a concern given the lack of government funding for breaking as an art form.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for Gunn, “Above all she’s a human being,” Wepiha said. “We first and foremost just hope that she’s all right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet if there’s one thing we know about breaking, it’s that it takes a lot more than ridicule to, well, break it.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But have you heard about the online soap opera surrounding a rumored rift among the film’s cast, its director and co-star Justin Baldoni, and possibly Deadpool?&nbsp;Once again, a film’s press tour is already stirring up more conversation than the movie itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The week leading up to the <em>It Ends With Us</em> premiere is already bringing back memories of the weeks-long, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/chris-pine-harry-styles-spit-gate-dont-worry-darling-memes-1235338698/\">spit-covered</a> scandal surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/9/6/23339631/dont-worry-darling-wilde-pugh-feud-explained\"><em>Don’t Worry Darling</em></a> in 2022.

But the internet is still having a ball speculating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It all started with <em>It Ends With Us</em>’s New York premiere on August 6, when fans noticed that Lively and Baldoni hadn’t been photographed on the red carpet together, nor have they been paired for interviews. Initially all signs of trouble pointed to Baldoni, but the narrative began to shift when a <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/news/1405851/blake-lively-reveals-ryan-reynolds-wrote-iconic-it-ends-with-us-scene\">quote</a> from Lively about her husband Ryan Reynolds’s involvement in the film’s script went viral. And on Friday, insiders <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-drama-what-we-know-1235969708/\">confirmed</a> to the Hollywood Reporter that there was a power struggle between the two parties when it came to the film’s final cut. At the same time, remarks from Baldoni <a href=\"https://x.com/people/status/1821568076267085985\">praising Lively</a>, while also hinting at a creative overhaul, are coming out. Most recently, Baldoni <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-justin-baldoni-melissa-nathan-blake-lively-1236039853/\">hired</a> crisis publicist Melissa Nathan, who represented Johnny Depp during his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23043519/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-fairfax-county-domestic-abuse-violence-me-too\">highly publicized defamation trial</a> in 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite any PR manager’s recent attempts to smooth out drama, the internet has already made up its mind. It’s maybe not surprising that this has turned into yet another game of optics and who has the most goodwill online. It speaks to the quick, sometimes dangerous escalation of gossip in the post-Deuxmoi world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is Justin Baldoni — and does his cast hate him?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before we get into whether the<em> It Ends With Us</em> cast hates Baldoni, some information about the actor-turned-director. You might recognize Baldoni from the hit CW <em>Jane the Virgin</em> where he played Rafael, the hunky father of Jane’s child. In 2019, he co-founded the production company Wayfarer Studios with billionaire entrepreneur Steve Sarowitz. Baldoni has directed and produced a few movies under his Wayfarer banner, including the teen cancer romance <em>Five Feet Apart</em> in 2019 and the 2020 Disney+ musical drama <em>Clouds</em>. In 2022, it was reported that Sarowitz <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/wayfarer-studios-125-million-investment-justin-baldoni-steve-sarowitz-1235295142/\">invested $125 million</a> into the independent production company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even with all this power, you might still be wondering why this fairly new director was selected to helm such a massive IP about a woman’s experience with domestic abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answer seems to partially lie in his extracurricular work. As a vocal feminist ally, discussing women’s issues — or more accurately, men’s issues — has been a huge, if not defining, part of Baldoni’s brand. In 2017, the actor launched a panel series called <em>Man Enough</em> through Wayfarer, featuring actors Matt McGorry and Javier Munoz, exploring, in his words, “what it means to be a man.” In 2021, he published a memoir titled <a href=\"https://manenough.com/podcast/\"><em>Man Enough? Undefining My Masculinity</em></a> about his journey overcoming the expectations of traditional manhood. He later launched a podcast of the same name with co-hosts Jamey Heath and former Vox political correspondent Liz Plank. Like McGorry, he’s one of several self-identifying male feminists who emerged during the Trump era and gained both praise for their activism and criticism for a <a href=\"https://pittnews.com/article/130284/opinions/editorial-justin-baldonis-feminism-male-focused/\">male-centered</a>, “<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/iexplorer/woke-bae-day\">mansplain-y</a>” approach to that activism.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-800668332.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.3509154173848,100,81.29816916523\" alt=\"Actor Justin Baldoni speaks into a microphone, wearing a gray suit and white shirt, in front of a red-curtain backdrop.\" title=\"Actor Justin Baldoni speaks into a microphone, wearing a gray suit and white shirt, in front of a red-curtain backdrop.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Actor Justin Baldoni speaks onstage at the 2017 NALIP Latino Media Awards. | Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for NALIP\" data-portal-copyright=\"Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for NALIP\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, it seems appropriate that Baldoni would go after Hoover’s novel about domestic abuse. After he sent Hoover a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/it-ends-with-us-author-colleen-hoover-says-justin-baldoni-struggled-a-little-bit-with-idea-of-playing-ryle-184652889.html\">letter</a> about his love for the book, his production company <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-movie-jane-the-virgin-1203268293/\">optioned the project</a> in 2019. Blake Lively was brought on as an executive producer in 2017, and from there, the project seemed to descend into chaos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the press tour, Baldoni has been noticeably isolated not just from Lively but the entire main cast, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/gallery/it-ends-with-us-premiere-red-carpet-photos/it-ends-with-us-new-york-premiere-arrivals/\">posing by himself</a> on the red carpet (or with other people not involved in the film) and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nc-wVlkAGGA?feature=shared\">giving</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/niSOhLp-jdE?feature=shared\">solo</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dpD9OEzZFZc?feature=shared\">interviews</a>. His co-host Plank was also at the premiere but was not photographed with Baldoni. Baldoni and Plank did not immediately respond to Vox’s requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Lively has been doing press with her co-stars Jenny Slate and Brandon Sklenar and author Colleen Hoover. When Lively and Sklenar appeared on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DrE3Ih46Y0\"><em>CBS Mornings</em></a> to promote the film, as well as other media outlets, there was no mention of the director. A <a href=\"https://x.com/camis_unicorn/status/1821272044866039992\">video of Slate</a> at the premiere sparked further speculation, when she gave an indirect response to a reporter’s question about working with Baldoni as a boss and screen partner. Lively and Slate did not immediately respond to Vox’s requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The cast’s Instagram activity doesn’t look great for Baldoni either. Based on quick searches, it looks like none of the main cast — aside from comedian Hasan Minhaj, who has a supporting role — are following him on the platform. Slate also made a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C-V5m85yUhl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">post</a> on Instagram earlier this week, shouting out Lively with no acknowledgement of Baldoni. The director is also absent from Sklenar’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C93CsR8yDi6/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2\">recent</a><em> It Ends With Us</em> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C8aMoXDyT4x/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2\">posts</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How is Deadpool involved in this?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reynolds’s supposed involvement in this scandal went from confusion to outrage. A claim from Lively that her husband wrote the movie’s “iconic rooftop scene” at the premiere began to circulate. “He works on everything I do,&#8221; Lively told <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/news/1405851/blake-lively-reveals-ryan-reynolds-wrote-iconic-it-ends-with-us-scene\">E! News</a>. “I work on everything he does. So his wins, his celebrations are mine, and mine are his. He’s all over this film.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People began to theorize that Lively and Reynolds seized creative control of the film from Baldoni, which led to the rift — although, that wouldn’t exactly explain why the rest of the cast has seemingly distanced themselves from him. At the premiere, Baldoni also made a telling comment about Lively. When asked about directing <em>It Ends With Us</em>’s inevitable sequel, he <a href=\"https://people.com/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-direct-it-ends-with-us-sequel-8693095\">said</a>, “I think that there are better people for that one. I think Blake Lively’s ready to direct, that’s what I think.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2165630299.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Actors Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds, from left to right, stand in front of a promotional backdrop.\" title=\"Actors Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds, from left to right, stand in front of a promotional backdrop.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Actors Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds attend the&lt;em&gt; It Ends With Us&lt;/em&gt; New York premiere on August 6, 2024. \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lively’s comments about Reynolds set off a wave of <a href=\"https://x.com/valyonce/status/1821731891537703305\">accusations</a> that Reynolds was <a href=\"https://x.com/stonelovebot/status/1821670994748026882\">too</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/choneybuttr/status/1821635870493163742\">involved</a> in Lively’s career. It also sparked discourse on whether the pair were appropriately promoting a film about domestic violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Based on their combined marketing efforts, it seems that Lively and Reynolds were looking to create their own “Barbenheimer” with the closely timed releases of <em>Deadpool vs. Wolverine</em> and <em>It Ends With Us</em> this summer. Leading up to the premiere, Blake Lively and her husband’s co-star Hugh Jackman covered <em>Vogue</em>. Jackman also made a cameo at the <em>It Ends With Us</em> premiere, while Reynolds filmed a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C-VeN9WJhmG/?hl=en\">skit</a> where he pretended to interview Sklenar for the film. Lively also released her new hair care line, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/shopping/blake-lively-haircare-brand-blake-brown-beauty-launch-date-pricing-collection-1235963366/\">Blake Brown</a>, during the movie’s press run, a move some <a href=\"https://x.com/gnuyear/status/1821706923596525866\">online</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/SailorSammy93/status/1821521540606828950\">critics</a> found insensitive given the film’s subject matter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Don’t Worry, Darling</em></strong><strong> is written all over this scandal&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s fair to say that the <em>Don’t Worry, Darling</em> kerfuffle both destroyed our brains and heightened our thirst for this kind of behind-the-scenes drama. It’s hardly the first time that the rumors of hostility between co-stars have made headlines, especially on <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellendurney/jamie-dornan-dakota-johnson-friendship-update-fifty-shades\">high-profile romantic films</a>, although, typically, they do not cause this much of a hullabaloo. The specific players involved in the <em>Don’t Worry, Darling</em> fiasco — namely, director Olivia Wilde, her ex-fiancé Jason Sudeikis, and her co-star Harry Styles — seemed to color everyone’s assessments of who was guilty and who was innocent, to the point where the internet was supporting <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/shia-labeouf-denies-fired-olivia-wilde-dont-worry-darling-1235350529/\">claims</a> about Wilde made by alleged abuser <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/fka-twigs-shia-labeouf-abuse.html\">Shia LaBeouf</a>. Social media’s perceptions of the people and relationships involved seemed to matter more than whatever actually occurred on-set.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You could argue that is happening with the suspicion toward Lively and Reynolds, but for perhaps more legitimate reasons than Wilde dumping Ted Lasso. Despite their power in Hollywood, Lively and Reynolds don’t have a ton of goodwill on social media — mainly for their controversial plantation wedding in 2012 that they eventually <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/news/1185191/a-look-at-blake-lively-and-ryan-reynolds-deeply-controversial-wedding\">apologized for in 2020</a>. (There was also that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6969341/blake-lively-preserve-slavery-antebellum\">weird write-up</a> celebrating antebellum fashion on Lively’s now-defunct lifestyle website Preserve.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, the internet — although, certainly not <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/08/deadpool-wolverine-global-box-office-milestone-mcu-top-10-1236033748/\">moviegoers</a> — has seemingly had enough of Reynolds’s snarky take on Deadpool. There’s also the couple’s highly documented friendship with <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/taylor-swifts-friendship-with-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-pics/\">Taylor Swift</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether we’ll actually get to the bottom of Baldoni and Lively’s alleged issues, the internet has already taken sides. As with <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>, we’ll probably end up discovering that there are no winners in this whole mess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, August 14, 9:50 am ET:&nbsp;</strong>This story was originally published on August 9 and has been updated to include Baldoni’s hiring of publicist Melissa Nathan.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Rick Bamman/Pioneer Press/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report on their <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/dstr/index.html\">2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey</a> (YRBS). The report includes data on a wide range of health-related behaviors of high school students in the United States, and breaks down these behaviors across different demographics. The results underscore the fact that we’re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis that has been <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/01/trends-improving-youth-mental-health\">steadily worsening for years</a> — one that is particularly acute for LGBTQ+ youth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the report, 41 percent of LGBTQ+ teens seriously considered suicide during the previous 12 months, 32 percent made a plan to do so, and 20 percent attempted to end their own life. By comparison, 13 percent of cisgender and heterosexual students seriously considered suicide, 11 percent made a plan, and 6 percent attempted suicide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While LGBTQ+ representation and rights have improved in the last few decades, large swaths of queer and trans kids are still living in an environment that is deeply hostile to their very existence. There’s a long and ongoing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/9/1/23853694/war-on-woke-wokeness-republicans\">conservative culture war</a> that aims to reverse what progress has been made in recent years for the LGBTQ+ community, culminating in legislation and policies that harm LGBTQ+ youth, like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/23631262/trans-bills-republican-state-legislatures\">restricting gender-affirming health care</a>, forcing schools <a href=\"https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/youth/forced_outing\">to out queer and trans students</a> to their parents, and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/report-lgbtq-content-drove-book-banning-efforts-2023/story?id=108992375\">banning books</a> that have LGBTQ+ content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To understand how we can help bring down these stark mental health disparities for LGBTQ+ teens, it’s critical that we first look at the overall youth mental health crisis, and the unique challenge that LGBTQ+ teens are facing on top of it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The state of youth mental health</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s never been easy to be a teenager, but today’s youth are clearly facing a mental health crisis. Suicide <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-by-the-numbers/\">is one of the leading causes</a> of death for teens in the United States. They’re more <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/data.html\">depressed and anxious</a>. And it’s only been getting worse since the early 2010s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the 2023 report, which is conducted every other year, over 20,000 questionnaires were filled out by students from 155 schools across the US. The CDC researchers found that while some improvements have been made for youth health and well-being, largely all other mental health indicators worsened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We shouldn’t overlook the small glimmers of hope, though. Hispanic youth who made a plan to kill themselves dropped from 19 percent in 2021 to 16 percent in 2023. And in that same time period, Black students who attempted suicide dropped from 14 percent to 10 percent.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Worried about a child or teen’s mental well-being? Here are some online resources to learn more about symptoms, treatment strategies, and how to help.</h5>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://effectivechildtherapy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Effective Child Therapy</a> is a resource from the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. The website has information on the emotional concerns, symptoms, and disorders that commonly impact teens (divorce, bullying, body image, anxiety, depression, and more) — and the evidence-based therapies that can help.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</a> has information for parents on how to spot symptoms of mental health issues, and where to seek help.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mghclaycenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds</a> has educational articles on mental health issues, as well as many links for <a href=\"https://www.mghclaycenter.org/where-to-turn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">where to turn</a> when searching for particular support groups, programs, and therapies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Crisis Text Line</a> is a text messaging-based service for people enduring “any type of crisis.” And the <a href=\"http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> is a phone-based service.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Trevor Project</a> is a crisis helpline for LGBTQ+ youth. It can be reached at 1-866-488-7386.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But for LGBTQ+ youth — which the report indicated had higher rates of suicidality than all other groups —&nbsp; there just isn’t enough comparable data yet to show a trend over time in the YRBS. 2015 was the first year that the CDC started measuring sexuality as a demographic, but it only included lesbian, gay, and bisexual as options to pick from. In 2021, they adjusted that to include students who were questioning their sexuality. Only this most recent report now includes transgender students. Because of these changes in measurement, it will take years for us to get a more accurate picture of how LGBTQ+ mental health is faring.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And while the report gives us a lot of helpful information, it doesn’t give us data for youth who hold multiple identities, like LGBTQ+ youth of color — who face unique challenges of their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Queer youth of color, trans youth of color, are dealing with stigma tied to not just being queer and youth of color, but also the intersecting stigma of both,” said <a href=\"https://ehe.osu.edu/human-sciences/directory?id=mallory.102\">Allen Mallory</a>, an assistant professor of human development at Ohio State University. Navigating the intersection of these identities can be stressors for LGBTQ+ teens of color, Mallory says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no one singular force to blame for why teens are suffering from poor mental health and suicidal thoughts, but researchers have some hypotheses. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/05/09/smartphone-social-media-mental-health-teens/\">big debate</a> in youth mental health is the use of social media and smartphones, with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/353979/this-is-your-kid-on-smartphones\">some researchers</a> pointing to these digital tools as a major driver in worsening trends. But <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00902-2\">other experts argue</a> that phones and social media are not the driving force behind declining mental health for youth — and have pointed out that for kids who lack connection in real life, finding community online is a real solace.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The developmental collision</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It might seem surprising that LGBTQ+ youth mental health appears to be worsening even as the social atmosphere on LGBTQ+ rights has <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx\">largely improved in recent decades</a>. So why hasn’t that translated to improved mental health?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The apparent paradox may have an explanation. Broader acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has allowed for more visibility and for people to come out as queer or trans at younger ages. That means instead of coming out as a young adult or even later on, kids are coming out in early adolescence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that particular period of human development — being a teenager — is a heightened time of self-consciousness and peer regulation, especially for precisely those younger teens who are also in the process of coming out. <a href=\"https://he.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/14-human-ecology/2391-russell-stephen?Itemid=1481\">Stephen Russell</a>, a professor and director of University of Texas at Austin’s School of Human Ecology, calls this “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786797/\">developmental collision</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Kids are coming out right at this time that, developmentally, is the most they’re most attuned to regulating each other,” says Russell. For LGBTQ+ youth, this period of peer regulation can mean facing bullying and discrimination from their classmates on the basis of their sexuality or gender — a unique challenge that comes on top of typical teenage challenges. (Staying in the closet isn’t a solution, either. Kids deserve to be their authentic selves, not shamed into hiding.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The dynamic of coming out at a younger age in these times elicits and invites and creates the possibility for wonderful things, but also for stigma and other kinds of vulnerability,” he added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other bigger, structural and environmental issues play a part in this mental health crisis. From <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/climate-change-mental-health-children-2023\">climate change</a> to growing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/gun-violence-shootings\">gun violence</a>, finding safety and stability — crucial for mental and physical well-being — has taken a toll. The Covid-19 pandemic, in which <a href=\"https://www.covidcollaborative.us/initiatives/hidden-pain\">over 200,000 kids under 18 lost a parent or caregiver</a> as of 2022, can’t be ruled out either. And <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/9/1/23853694/war-on-woke-wokeness-republicans\">a culture war on “wokeness,”</a> raised by conservative politicians and pundits, has aimed to reinvigorate animosity toward youth of color<em> </em>and LGBTQ+ teens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be clear, the fault is not on these teenagers for going through basic developmental periods, or for being LGBTQ+, or for struggling with big issues. What it does mean is that LGBTQ+ youth are facing unique challenges that must be recognized when creating and implementing interventions for their mental health.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How to help LGBTQ+ youth</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The field of LGBTQ+ youth mental health is still evolving, and along with it, how to approach the subject from a clinical and public health perspective. But there are a lot of promising interventions to tackle this crisis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From a more macro perspective, implementing practices that reach people in their day-to-day life is key. For teens, a big part of everyday life involves school. One simple (and almost painfully obvious) practice to start with is inclusive, enumerated policies for LGBTQ+ youth — basically, protection from bullying and discrimination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These policies we see at the state and school district level have really big implications for how LGBTQ youth experience school in their day to day life,” said <a href=\"https://sph.umd.edu/people/jessica-fish\">Jessica Fish</a>, an associate professor and the director of the <a href=\"https://sph.umd.edu/research-impact/laboratories-projects-and-programs/sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-health-sogi-health-research-group#:~:text=LGBTQ%20Young%20People-,The%20Sexual%20Orientation%2C%20Gender%20Identity%2C%20and%20Health%20(SOGI%20Health,of%20Maryland%20Prevention%20Research%20Center.\">Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Health Research Group</a> at University of Maryland’s School of Public Health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://storiesandnumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/StoriesandNumbersReport_English.pdf\">Multiple</a> studies <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6555145/\">have shown</a> that LGBTQ+ students at schools with <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/health_and_academics/bullying/anti_bullying_policies_infobrief-basic.htm\">inclusive, enumerated policies</a> experience less victimization and bullying — two things that can really impact a kid’s mental health. But according to the <a href=\"https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/safe_school_laws\">Movement Advancement Project</a>, a nonprofit think tank focused on equality and democracy,<strong> </strong>53 percent of LGBTQ+ people live in a state with no law protecting LGBTQ+ students from bullying in school, and 42 percent live in a state with no law protecting these teens from discrimination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If tackling state law feels too big, starting with an individual school community can work too. Take gender and sexuality alliances (GSAs, formerly known as gay-straight alliances). They’re student-led clubs that give LGBTQ+ and allied students a way to connect, support one another, and learn from each other. All of the public health experts I spoke to brought up GSAs — and there’s a lot of strong evidence that shows these groups can create a safer school climate and <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0044118X20951045\">lower the risk of suicide and depression</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While researchers<strong> </strong>have a lot of good information on what’s working for improving the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth, there’s still a lot of room for more data. This is especially true when it comes to understanding what works for trans youth and LGBTQ+ youth of color.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also important to note that while there is absolutely a mental health crisis for LGBTQ+ youth, many go on to become content, productive adults. It’s not their identity that sentences them to depression or suicide — it’s the stigma and discrimination they face in their homes, schools, and institutions, at a time when their age makes them deeply vulnerable and reliant on their surroundings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are many barriers to getting clinical help or implementing measures in schools. Understandably, that can feel like an uphill battle for LGBTQ+ youth and their families. But nothing is impossible, says Fish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These are things that will take mobilization, that will take a large degree of advocacy and grassroots support within the community,” she told me. “So I do think all of these are possible, but I think it&#8217;s just trying to figure out where the vantage point for change is.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Now, as he campaigns to retake the presidency, he is once again politicizing long-held best practices for stopping infectious diseases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Covid-19 again <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/18/latest-covid-spike-update-new-variants-fewer-novids/\">on the upswing</a> and amid <a href=\"https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2024/08/07/oregon-measles-outbreak-records-at-least-23-cases-since-june/\">an ongoing measles outbreak</a>, the former president is taking aim at school vaccine requirements from the campaign stump, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-vows-to-defund-schools-requiring-vaccines-for-students-if-hes-reelected\">promising</a> to defund the districts that mandate students receive certain vaccines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The real danger in Trump’s words is not any actual loss of education funding — that threat is toothless, experts say — but the continued normalizing of anti-vaccine attitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People are already losing trust in vaccines: Only 40 percent of Americans <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx\">believe</a> it is extremely important for parents to get their children vaccinated, down from 64 percent in 2001. It is perhaps the most worrying trend in public health right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have the tools to stop many infectious diseases —&nbsp;if we take advantage of them. Trump’s words are making it less likely that people will.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Could Trump really defund schools over vaccines?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump had a famously complicated relationship with Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic. While he officially endorsed them, and his administration played a critical role in their development, he simultaneously <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/19/politics/donald-trump-covid-19-vaccines/index.html\">indulged vaccine hesitancy</a> on the right, where a tangle of conspiracy theories cast the shots as a part of a sinister public health agenda. Prior to being elected, he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/09/17/the-origins-of-donald-trumps-autismvaccine-theory-and-how-it-was-completely-debunked-eons-ago/\">entertained</a> theories (advanced by his frenemy in the 2024 presidential race, RFK Jr.) about a link between vaccines and autism. Recently leaked footage <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/16/g-s1-10927/trump-rfk-vaccines-leaked-video\">suggests</a> he still privately shares those views.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Trump is promising to make it a priority to take action against schools with vaccine or mask mandates and those that “teach” critical race theory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, and I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,” he <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-vows-to-defund-schools-requiring-vaccines-for-students-if-hes-reelected\">told</a> the Christian Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative Christian group, in July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I heard Trump’s comments, I immediately thought: That can’t be right.<br><br>I’ve <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18223129/2020-presidential-candidates-policies-cory-booker-newark-schools-2020\">covered education policy</a> over the years, and I knew the federal government provides relatively little of the money — 10 percent or so — for public education in this country. Most of it comes from state and local governments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Trump can’t just do whatever he wants with federal education dollars, either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bulk of federal funding is authorized by <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/essa?src=rn\">the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</a>, the federal law that has set most of federal education policy since the 1960s (with several updates over the decades). That spending has fairly specific strings attached, leaving the federal government with a very limited say over how state and local jurisdictions spend their much larger share of school funding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That would limit Trump’s ability to conjure up some justification for withholding funding from schools if he tries to follow through on his threat, <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/kevin-carey/\">Kevin Carey</a>, who leads education policy at the New America Foundation and is an occasional Vox contributor, told me. (Desegregation is a rare example of Washington, DC, using <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/brown-v-board-of-education-the-first-step-in-the-desegregation-of-americas-schools\">the withholding of funding</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Carey worries Trump could still influence local school decisions, especially if he’s elected and even if he can’t actually block funding, because he could still use his bully pulpit to make school administrators fear litigation or more subtle retaliations if they defy the federal government’s wishes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump can shape vaccine attitudes — positively and negatively</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That kind of softer influence is where the real risk lies. Trump’s words reach a lot of people. So much so that there is a small library’s worth of research on how Trump affected the Covid-19 information ecosystem and the public’s attitudes toward vaccines. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/21497221/donald-trump-covid-19-coronavirus-news-misinformation-study\">One meta-review</a> of 1 million news articles about the pandemic found that nearly 40 percent of them featured Trump and one of the false claims attributed to him. Coverage of specific subjects, such as miracle cures or the deep state, paralleled whatever fixation Trump had at a given time or the enemies he was railing against.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w29896\">Several</a> studies <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257988\">linked</a> messages that featured Trump’s endorsement of Covid-19 vaccines with an increase in actual vaccinations — another measure of his influence. On the flip side, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103119302628\">being a Trump voter</a> was associated with a lower likelihood of getting vaccinated, which reflects festering conspiracy theories and anti-public health sentiments in Trump’s base. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One Pew survey <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/09/23/americans-who-relied-most-on-trump-for-covid-19-news-among-least-likely-to-be-vaccinated/\">found</a> that people who trusted Trump the most for pandemic information were the least likely to be vaccinated. This may help to explain why the Trump-voting parts of the US <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/19/1098543849/pro-trump-counties-continue-to-suffer-far-higher-covid-death-tolls\">saw more deaths adjusted for population during the pandemic</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Trump starts to badmouth not just Covid-19 vaccines, but also routine childhood vaccinations that have been around for decades and proven their efficacy in preventing deadly diseases, he is adding fuel to a dangerous fire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccinations — the common “MMR” shot that is <a href=\"https://vaccines.procon.org/state-by-state-vaccinations-required-for-public-school-kindergarten/#:~:text=49%20states%20and%20DC%20require%20the%20MMR,only%20state%20to%20not%20require%20the%20MMR\">required by almost every state</a> — have been <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20240223/increase-in-measles-cases-tied-to-drop-vaccination-rates\">dipping</a> since the 2019-2020 school year. They are now below the 95-percent coverage threshold that experts consider to be necessary for herd immunity that would stop the viruses’ wide transmission. The number of exemptions granted to families who do not wish to vaccinate their children has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/09/health/kindergarten-vaccine-exemptions/index.html\">reached</a> record levels. States, mostly those with conservative politics, have been <a href=\"https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/05/20/as-states-loosen-childhood-vaccine-requirements-health-experts-worries-grow/\">proposing further loosening</a> of the vaccine requirements that currently exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, measles cases in the US <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/measles-cdc-outbreak-chicago-mmr-vaccine-7ecdfef41e6dbd659c7ac8b80d5de38f\">matched their 2023 total</a> over just the first few months of 2024. A local outbreak in Oregon has seen <a href=\"https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2024/08/07/oregon-measles-outbreak-records-at-least-23-cases-since-june/\">nearly two dozen cases</a> since June; at least two people have been hospitalized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A disease that was once effectively eradicated in the US — and which school mandates helped to stamp out — is mounting a comeback.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Donald Trump could choose to wield his tremendous influence to try to restore people’s faith in vital public health measures. He did it, if half-heartedly, during the pandemic and it had the desired effect. Instead, he’s stoking doubts about the value of vaccines, and courting the dangers vaccine hesitancy brings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story originally appeared in&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Today, Explained</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Last month, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate\">Hurricane Beryl</a> landed in Texas and galloped across the country. As it faded, almost 2,000 miles from Houston, Beryl soaked Vermont with more than 6 inches of rain, creating <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-flooding-6e85b0dff85e00938a3de7d15b61d197\">deadly floods</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These destructive storms spooled up in an <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season\">unusually active hurricane season</a>, driven by <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/more-year-north-atlantic-has-been-running-fever#:~:text=Sea%20surface%20temperatures%20have%20been,been%20experiencing%20a%20marine%20heatwave.\">extreme heat in the Atlantic Ocean</a> and a shift to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific\">La Niña in the Pacific Ocean</a>, which create the ideal air and water conditions for cyclones. But <a href=\"https://www.uvm.edu/cas/geography/profiles/lesley-ann-dupigny-giroux\">Lesley-Ann L. Dupigny-Giroux</a>, the Vermont state climatologist, explained that there’s actually a long history of hurricanes leaving their mark across New England — even far inland from the ocean, most recently Tropical Storm Lee in 2011 and Nate in 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Hurricane-Tracks-Vermont.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.874058667432,100,66.251882665137\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though states around the Gulf Coast bear the brunt of most hurricanes, even storms that enter the US from the south can have a long reach inland and northward. Beryl and Debby show how they can wreak death and destruction even after they’re downgraded to tropical storms or depressions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Average temperatures are rising due to climate change, and because warmer air can hold onto more moisture, the most damaging elements of these storms — the flooding caused by extraordinary rainfall and towering storm surges — will continue to worsen. That means hurricanes will carve a greater swath of destruction, putting people in danger who were not vulnerable before. Understanding the mechanisms behind hurricanes is a key step in preparing for future storms and preventing their worst devastation far from the shore.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How hurricanes move over land</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/how-hurricanes-form.html\">Atlantic hurricanes</a> begin as waves of low atmospheric pressure moving westward from Africa over warm, tropical waters. Lower pressure from the atmosphere allows for more air to rise, carrying moisture with it. That rising, warm, damp air then cools off as it climbs, condensing into clouds that can form thunderstorms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To turn into a hurricane — a spinning storm with wind speeds greater than 74 miles per hour — a couple more factors need to fall into place. There needs to be very little <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/ilx/swop-springtopics\">wind shear</a>, a phenomenon where wind changes speed and direction with altitude. A strong wind shear can rip up hurricanes before they form, but when the wind is minimal, a storm can accumulate strength. The water at the surface of the ocean also needs to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter. This creates the reservoir of thermal energy that powers a hurricane’s churn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This year, the Atlantic Ocean <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/more-year-north-atlantic-has-been-running-fever\">was so hot</a> that Hurricane Beryl reached <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php\">Category 5 strength</a>, with sustained winds of 157 miles per hour, <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/category-5-hurricane-beryl-makes-explosive-start-2024-atlantic-season\">earlier than any hurricane on record</a>. It also ramped up quickly and further east than most hurricanes. Typically, the Atlantic Ocean doesn’t get warm enough to fuel such powerful storms until later in the summer or early fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once they spool up, trade winds push the storms westward, and as they move over patches of exceptionally warm water, hurricanes can <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml\">rapidly intensify</a>, with wind speeds picking up by at least 35 miles per hour in a day or less.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As hurricanes approach North America, they start to face westerlies, winds that blow from west to east in the mid-latitudes. “They interact with these storms that are moving west, northwest, and kind of pick them up and start moving them northward,” said <a href=\"https://staff.ucar.edu/users/rozoff\">Christopher Rozoff</a>, a project scientist at the National Science Foundation’s National Center for Atmospheric Research. That often puts hurricanes on a hook-shaped path.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as Beryl and Debby showed, that path can extend a long distance over land, even though the hurricane does not have as much warm ocean water to feed on. What keeps the engine running? “This is a really intricate question,” Rozoff said. “We don’t have all the answers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, scientists have observed a few ways this plays out. Hurricanes like Debby are large enough that even if the bulk of it is over land, a portion can extend over the ocean, providing the storm with some of the warm water it needs to keep running.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/74724134007-2024221111020242211700-abial-042024-geocolor-1000-x-1000.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"NOAA\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A hurricane may also cease to be a well-defined tropical cyclone over land, but can still carry on as a severe rainstorm. “Once a tropical system makes landfall, it will dissipate as it rains itself out and is cut off from the energy and moisture of being over a warm body of water,” Dupigny-Giroux said. “Tropical systems can transition to become ‘extra-tropical’ and ‘post-tropical’ in nature, which means that their internal characteristics are no longer those of a warm core system.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.undrr.org/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/mh0031\">Extratropical cyclones</a> are spinning storms that form further from the equator and have cooler air at their cores. Instead of drawing on the ocean’s heat, the <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-jet-stream\">jet stream</a> — a fast-moving, high-altitude air current — can continue driving the remnants of a hurricane over land, similar to the mechanism behind major winter storms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Warm water basins, like big lakes or wetlands, on land can fuel hurricanes as well. “You could take the storm and put it over a land surface that is swampy or has a lot of moisture, and it can keep the storm going for some time,” Rozoff said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another factor to consider is whether the hurricane is holding at a steady intensity or whether it’s in the process of gaining strength. “If it’s intensifying at landfall, we often see that the storm continues to be really potent and vicious over land,” Rozoff said. On the other hand, a cyclone that’s been churning at the same pace for a while tends to weaken as it hits the coast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As if that’s not bad enough, hurricanes climbing out of the sea and onto the shore can <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/climate/hurricanes-tornadoes.html\">spawn tornadoes</a>. Land is relatively rough compared to the surface of the ocean and that creates friction for a hurricane’s winds. As the winds closer to the ground slow down while the winds higher up keep blowing fast, it induces wind shear that can create a spinning air column that can then produce tornadoes. Because they are relatively small and form quickly, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/356119/climate-artifical-intelligence-forecasting-tornadoes\">tornadoes are notoriously difficult to predict</a>, making it harder to issue warnings to get people to shelter, further exacerbating the toll of a hurricane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beryl and Debby are the latest compound disasters to wallop the US</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though Beryl and Debby were extraordinary storms, part of the reason they were so damaging was that they struck places with less experience with hurricanes, and thus less preparation for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The hard lessons are that communities far from the ocean still need to invest in more robust infrastructure, forecasting, and early warning systems. People evacuating from the coast may have to move further to get out of the path of danger. The complication is that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23372996/hurricane-ian-tampa-florida-miami-storm-surge-flood\">populations are growing</a>, particularly in coastal regions. That means tropical storms can end up causing greater property damage and<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23389508/hurricane-ian-death-toll-storm-florida-landfall-climate\"> in some cases lead to more deaths</a>.&nbsp; And because of climate change, hurricanes are causing higher levels of <a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/hurricanes-and-climate-change\">storm surge due to sea level rise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/366041/climate-hurricane-debby-drenches-the-southeast\">more rainfall due to warmer air</a>. Together, these factors lead to more extensive and costly flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s important to keep in mind that the effects of hurricanes can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous\">compound on top of other disasters</a>. Florida’s Big Bend region, where Debby made landfall, is still recovering from last year’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification\">Hurricane Idalia</a>. Beryl knocked out power to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/360181/climate-hurricane-beryl-blackout-houston-flood\">Houston during a heat wave</a>, leaving thousands of residents without cooling as the temperature and humidity reached dangerous highs. That extends the devastation of the storm beyond its wind and rainfall totals alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And while hurricanes hog the headlines, it’s important not to lose sight of the fact a storm doesn’t have to be a hurricane to wreak havoc. “Post-Tropical Storm Beryl actually produced less rainfall than that which led to the <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/btv/The-Great-Vermont-Flood-of-10-11-July-2023-Preliminary-Meteorological-Summary\">July 2023 flooding across Vermont</a>,” Dupigny-Giroux said. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heavy-precipitation\">Heavy precipitation events </a>are also getting more severe as average temperatures rise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a result, many people may be far <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/364660/natural-weather-disaster-climate-fire-hurricane-flood\">more vulnerable to disasters than they realize</a>. But with enough planning, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23150467/natural-disaster-climate-change-early-warning-hurricane-wildfire\">worst effects can be avoided</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Landlocked Vermont might not be the first state that comes to mind for hurricanes, but the recent major storms made clear that it’s not immune from their havoc.&#160; Hurricane Debby made landfall at Category 1 strength in Florida on August 5, but days later, its windy remnants knocked out power for nearly 25,000 people in [&#8230;]",

The interview on Spaces, X’s platform for live audio conversations, covered everything from illegal immigration to union busting. At one point, Trump and Musk underscored the need for an American leader who would inspire fear in other countries. Over the course of two hours, the richest man in the world and the former president of the United States reminded us that they share some striking similarities — giant egos, a love of attention and social media, yet at the same time a sense of victimhood. (Vice President Kamala Harris might love Venn diagrams, but she’d have to hate this intersection.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Trump had been banned following the events of January 6, and reinstated when Musk took over, he only returned to the platform in text for yesterday’s conversation. Both Musk and Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1822827074299584955\">promoted</a> the interview as a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112949391274078319\" rel=\"nofollow\">marquee</a> entertainment <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1823073478481965199\">event</a>, with Musk promising that it would be “unscripted with no limits on subject matter, so should be highly entertaining!” Yet the two men gabbed mostly about the predictable topics: the US border, crime, and then still more about the border. The interview was yet another opportunity for Trump to spew insults and make false statements, with no pushback from his interviewer — not even when Trump told Musk, the CEO of an EV company, that he planned to “drill, baby, drill” in his second term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The livestream started nearly an hour late due to technical difficulties. Almost 20 minutes after it was set to begin, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1823152153445404990\">wrote</a> that there appeared to be a “massive DDOS attack on X.” (A DDoS attack intentionally disrupts a site by flooding it with traffic; it wouldn’t be accurate to call it a DDoS attack if a lot of people organically wanted to tune in.) Previous Spaces events on X have been rife with glitches, too — a live convo between Musk and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last May, in which DeSantis announced his presidential bid, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/24/tech/twitter-desantis-meltdown/index.html\">crashed</a> when over 500,000 people tried to listen in. Before the Trump interview, Musk said that X would be conducting stress tests to ensure the livestream could handle the traffic. Top livestreams on YouTube and Twitch have handled <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/will-smith-performance-helps-ibai-break-twitch-viewership-record-with-an-incredible-385-million-concurrent-viewers\">millions of concurrent viewers</a> before, and the most popular streamers on those platforms regularly enjoy <a href=\"https://twitchtracker.com/channels/viewership\">hundreds of thousands</a> of viewers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, Trump returned to Truth Social, the social media site that he has a majority stake in, to praise Musk and <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112955510502595799\" rel=\"nofollow\">lash out against the media</a> for reporting on the technical issues that delayed the livestream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I absolutely HATE the Fake News Media,” he wrote. “So bad for our Country!”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Trump and Musk’s rocky history</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and Musk haven’t always been on good terms. In the run-up to the presidential election in 2016, Musk said in a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/04/donald-trumps-character-reflects-poorly-on-united-states-says-elon-musk.html\">CNBC interview</a> that Trump was “not the right guy,” noting that he didn’t have the “sort of character that reflects well on the United States.” Still, once Trump was in office Musk initially fostered a friendly relationship with the president, even agreeing to join <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/827330589191704576\">two White House advisory councils</a>. He quickly <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/870369915894546432\">stepped down</a> after Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, at a rally in 2022, Trump claimed that Musk had told him he voted for him in 2016, calling the billionaire a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3551329-trump-elon-musk-another-bulls-artist/\">bullshit artist</a>.” Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/s-time-trump-sail-sunset-says-musk-rcna37798\">sniped back</a> that Trump should “sail into the sunset,” and in response Trump wrote on Truth Social that Musk had come to the Oval Office to ask for help “on all of his many subsidized projects,” and that he could have told Musk to <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108636743295734643\" rel=\"nofollow\">drop to his knees and beg</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A fact-check on Trump and Musk on immigration</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One topic the two men continually returned to was immigration, and the insistence that there’s a scourge of crime committed by undocumented immigrants sweeping the nation. Trump said that over 20 million people have illegally crossed the US border under President Joe Biden, far outpacing <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/12/51-million-border-illegally-biden-fact-check/74595944007/\">estimates from experts</a>. He repeated the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-fact-check.html\">unsubstantiated claim</a> that many of them were coming from jails and mental institutions and called them “stone cold killers in many cases.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and Musk also agreed that migrant crime was “destroying” cities like New York and San Francisco. “They just let violent criminals out in New York,” said Musk. “The only one they’re going to prosecute is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations\">Donald Trump</a>,” the former president interjected. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/366622/violent-crime-dropping-pandemic-wave-2024\">violent crime in US cities</a> has plummeted in the first half of 2024.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that appears to be water under the bridge now. Musk officially <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1812256998588662068\">endorsed</a> Trump in July on the day of his attempted assassination, and is backing a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/inside-elon-musks-hands-on-push-to-win-800-000-voters-for-trump-0a7d55b3\">super PAC</a> aiming to get 800,000 Americans in swing states to vote for Trump. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3\">Wall Street Journal</a> recently reported that the two speak on the phone several times a month now to discuss topics such as “immigration, technology and science.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why the two see eye to eye</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the conversation wound down, Trump congratulated Musk on getting “60 to 70 million” listeners, appearing to mistake the number of passive views the event got on X with the number of people who had tuned in (a little over 1 million). Musk mused that the total number of views the interview would eventually get would be in the hundreds of millions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was a moment that summed up what the two men have in common — a tendency to self-aggrandize and <a href=\"https://x.com/jwhittenbergK5/status/1730035694507376811\">inflate their accomplishments</a>. They both have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/trump-christians-vote-ingraham.html\">a habit</a> of saying <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981928/elon-musk-ad-boycott-go-fuck-yourself-destroy-x\">incendiary</a> things, whether on camera or online, and have used social media to grow a fervent fan base around their cult of personality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has been mostly absent on X even after being reinstated in November 2022, posting primarily on Truth Social. He’s under an exclusivity clause that limits non-political posts he can make outside of Truth Social — but this interview appears to fall under an exemption because it’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/madelinehalpert/2022/05/16/trump-agrees-to-post-on-truth-social-before-any-other-sites-with-some-caveats/\">related to politics</a>. Yesterday, in the lead-up to the interview, Trump made multiple posts on X boosting his presidential campaign, pinning a campaign ad to the top of his profile.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Are you better off now than you were when I was president?<br><br>Our economy is shattered. Our border has been erased. We&#039;re a nation in decline.<br><br>Make the American Dream AFFORDABLE again. Make America SAFE again. Make America GREAT Again!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823034723867713700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote> \n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to August 12, Trump hadn’t posted on X in almost a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, though, Musk and Trump are also united by a sense of personal grievance and persecution. Trump complained that the Democrats had weaponized the legal system against him, referring to the many criminal investigations he’s under. “The Biden administration did something that’s never been done in this country, and that’s go after their political opponent — me — with this nonsense,” Trump said. A few days ago, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1822352993422901402\">posted a graphic</a> (the source of which is unclear) on X portraying himself and his political views as the side resisting oppression — much like Luke Skywalker in <em>Star Wars</em>, Katniss Everdeen in <em>The Hunger Games</em>, or Neo in <em>The Matrix</em>. “When it’s fiction you understand,” the picture reads. “You refuse to see it when it’s the reality you’re living in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk groused that people painted him as a “far-right guy, which is absurd because I’m, like, making electric vehicles,” he said. “I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama’s hand when he was president.” While Musk said he used to vote for Democrats, in 2022 he <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1526997132858822658?lang=en\">announced</a> he would start voting Republican because the Dems had become the party of “division &amp; hate.”<strong><em> </em></strong>In the past year he has repeated rhetoric echoing the white supremacist <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24111405/elon-musk-great-replacement-conspiracy-immigration-don-lemon\">“great replacement” theory</a>, which alleges that there’s a conspiracy to replace white people by bringing <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1770030227390914624\">undocumented immigrants</a> into the US. He has also consistently been dismissive of LGBTQ+ equality, showing <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1671370284102819841\">particular</a> contempt for <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1286869404874088448\">transgender</a> people. Musk’s daughter, who is trans, has criticized his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/musk-transgender-vivian-grimes/\">treatment of her gender identity</a> on Instagram’s Threads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>A fact-check on Trump and Musk on inflation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Turning to the economy, both men blamed excess government spending during the pandemic as the primary cause of inflation. Economists <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-caused-the-u-s-pandemic-era-inflation/\">generally attribute</a> recent US inflation to a mix of reasons — not just government spending, but also supply chain interruptions combined with a surge in consumer demand. The $2.2 trillion <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21196202/house-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">CARES Act</a>, one of the major Covid-19 stimulus packages, was signed into law by Trump.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There were plenty of strange asides that the two men touched on during the conversation on X, highlighting their shared chaos — such as when Musk brought up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/12/8/23498861/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnels-finished\">building tunnels</a> to “solve traffic.” Trump praised China’s high-speed rail system, but Musk was referring to tunnels for Tesla cars, like the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-02-26/elon-musk-las-vegas-loop-tunnel-has-construction-safety-issues\">Las Vegas Loop</a>. Both agreed that Harris was a “far left” politician, with Trump repeating <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/362062/biden-drop-out-republicans-accuse-democrats-coup\">his accusation</a> that Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race was a “coup” conducted by the Democratic Party. While on the subject of government overspending, Trump declared that he would shutter the Department of Education and “move education back to the states” during his second term. The former president also appeared to praise Musk for his <a href=\"https://time.com/6224380/elon-musk-twitter-open-letter/\">mass firing of disgruntled Twitter employees</a> in late 2022. “I won’t mention the name of the company,” he said, “but they go on strike and you say, ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone.’” After the X interview, the United Auto Workers filed <a href=\"https://uaw.org/uaw-files-federal-labor-charges-against-donald-trump-and-elon-musk-for-attempting-to-intimidate-and-threaten-workers/\">federal labor charges</a> with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing Trump and Musk of “illegal attempts to threaten and intimidate workers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the top of the interview, Musk said that he wanted to show what Trump was like outside of an adversarial interview, despite the fact that the former president is famous for holding <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-trump-rally/\">countless rallies</a> where he speaks without restraint. “It’s hard to catch a vibe about someone if you just don’t hear them talk in a normal way,” Musk claimed, adding that the event was aimed at “open-minded independent voters.” It remains to be seen how many voters were impressed by Trump’s and Musk’s vibes.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And the Biden administration’s attempts to rein in junk fees are a way for it to make the case that Democrats are addressing Americans’ concerns about high prices before the election. Limiting fees is popular on a bipartisan basis: a December <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2023/12/12/voters-support-initiatives-to-lower-drug-costs-ban-junk-fees-and-strengthen-supply-chains\">Data for Progress poll</a> found that 77 percent of voters — including 81 percent of Democrats, 78 percent of independents, and 72 percent of Republicans — said they supported legislation banning junk fees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Essentially in all of these practices, the companies are delaying services to you or, really, trying to make it so difficult for you to cancel the service that they get to hold on to your money longer and longer,” Tanden said. “And what that means is, ultimately, consumers, the American public, is losing out.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How the policy would work</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration’s proposals would prohibit companies from billing customers without their consent, failing to disclose cancellation policies, and making cancellation difficult by, for example, requiring customers to cancel in person or endure long holds on the phone with customer service. Companies that fail to comply with the rule could <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2023-0033-0001\">face civil penalties</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/01/if-your-company-received-ftc-notice-penalty-offenses-take-notice-action\">like those</a> the FTC has sought in recent cases <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/proposed-ftc-order-will-prohibit-telehealth-firm-cerebral-using-or-disclosing-sensitive-data\">related to advertising</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The FTC is currently reviewing public comments on its <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring\">proposed rule</a>, which would require companies to allow customers who sign up online for a service to also cancel that service online in no more steps than it took them to sign up. Companies would be allowed to make additional offers when a customer tries to cancel, but only if they first ask if a customer is open to hearing them. Companies would also have to provide reminders before subscriptions are automatically renewed if they are not for any physical good.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That rule could go into effect in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the FCC opened an inquiry Monday into pursuing a similar rule that would apply to the communications industry. If the FCC decides to do so, that rule might not go into effect before Biden’s term ends, though if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election, she would likely advance it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Biden’s subscription cancellation policy is part of a broader pro-consumer agenda</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to his latest move on subscriptions, Biden has pursued a still-pending <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees\">broad regulation</a> to combat junk fees overall, as well as regulations aimed at industry-specific junk fees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a rule to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2024/1/17/24042169/biden-overdraft-fee-banks-nsf-amount\">curb overdraft fees</a> incurred when consumers withdraw more than the available funds in their bank account — a move that might save customers about $3.5 billion a year overall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration’s efforts have hit some barriers, however. Airlines recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/major-airlines-sue-biden-administration-over-fee-disclosure-rule-2024-05-13/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20May%2013%20(Reuters),carriers%20and%20the%20Biden%20administration\">sued</a> the Biden administration over a new final rule that requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose upfront any fees associated with booking a plane ticket. And a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/credit-card-fee-limit-blocked.html\">temporarily blocked</a> a Biden administration rule that would limit fees on late credit card payments to $8 per month, which the CFPB said would cut costs for Americans by $10 billion a year. Bank and credit card company lobbyists, supported by <a href=\"https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/credit-debit-card-transaction-fees-congress-cfpb-payments-biden-chopra/709691/\">some Republican members of Congress,</a> had argued that the rule was unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though those lawsuits are meant to limit the administration, Biden has also used the courts in an aggressive antitrust pro-consumer strategy. His administration has filed a flurry of sweeping lawsuits against major companies, including four Big Tech companies, on the grounds that they are harming competition in their industries and, therefore, American consumers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration recently won a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/big-tech/365575/google-monopoly-search-case-biden-big-tech\">major ruling against Google</a> in which the judge found that the company’s search business constituted an illegal monopoly. Other antitrust lawsuits are pending against Google over its ads business, Meta over its acquisitions of Instagram and Whatsapp, Apple over its alleged anticompetitive practices in the smartphone market, and Amazon over its restrictions on third-party sellers that have served to keep prices higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration has also filed a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/4/16/24132509/ticketmaster-live-nation-lawsuit-swift-bad-bunny-beyonce-rodrigo\">seeking to break up Live Nation</a>, Ticketmaster’s parent company, accusing it of operating an illegal monopoly through anticompetitive behavior that has harmed everyone from consumers to concert venues to artists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The durability of Biden’s consumer protection initiative may depend in part on the November election. A Harris administration would likely uphold these policies and could continue to pursue these antitrust lawsuits and then some. But if former President Donald Trump wins the election, it’s probably a different story — the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/354668/biden-economy-antitrust-junk-fees-consumer-protection\">Trump administration didn’t make consumer protection a priority</a> in its first term, and has not made doing so in a second term central to its campaign.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden has made taking on “junk fees” — hidden fees on everything from airline bookings to concert tickets — a key part of his domestic agenda. His administration has already tried to limit fees on things like bank overdrafts and late credit card payments, and Monday, it turned its attention to making subscriptions [&#8230;]",

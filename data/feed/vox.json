Steve Scalise; the Donald Trump supporter <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/cesar-sayoc-sentenced-to-20-years-for-sending-bombs-to-trump-critics.html\">who sent mail bombs</a> to more than a dozen prominent Democrats in 2018; a right-wing militia’s <a href=\"https://www.wsoctv.com/news/trending/fbi-thwarts-militia-plot-kidnap-michigan-governor/O7K7A7CZ55GJTC6TQM5DWQNL4U/\">plot to kidnap</a> Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020; the abortion rights supporter who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/kavanaugh-roske-arrest-warrant/index.html\">attempted to kill</a> Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at this home in 2022; and the QAnon adherent who attacked Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/11/14/paul-pelosi-nancy-david-depape-assault/\">while attempting to target her,</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That violence is having a clear impact on how American politics is conducted. Spending on security by House and Senate campaigns <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/18/congress-security-spending-violence-threats/\">increased by 500 percent </a>between 2020 and 2022, according to the Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nor is this just an American phenomenon: There’s been a global wave of recent assassinations as well. The UK has seen two members of parliament killed in recent years: Jo Cox, a Labour MP murdered by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-slow-burning-hatred-led-to-jo-cox-murder\">right-wing extremist</a> days before the Brexit vote in 2016, and David Amess, a Conservative MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/david-amess-verdict-terrorist-attack-ali-harbi-ali-guilty\">fatally stabbed by an Islamic State</a> supporter in 2021. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/06/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-far-right-presidential-candidate-stabbed\">survived a stabbing</a> during his campaign for president in 2018. In 2021, Haitian Prime Minister Jovenel Moïse was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57762246\">assassinated by mercenaries</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year saw the<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/10/ecuador-presidential-candidate-killed\"> killing of Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio</a>, and former <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shinzo-abe-japan-government-homicide-assassinations-8267d689b9f63d5461bddf4f880dddc3\">Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a>. In January of this year, South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-opposition-chief-stabbed-during-visit-busan-yonhap-2024-01-02/\">survived being stabbed in the neck</a>, while Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/18/1252307692/the-assassination-attempt-on-slovakian-pm-is-the-latest-example-of-violence-in-e\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/18/1252307692/the-assassination-attempt-on-slovakian-pm-is-the-latest-example-of-violence-in-e\">shot and nearly killed</a> in May. In Mexico, where political violence is rampant on a scale far beyond most other countries, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/americas/mexico-election-candidates-killed.html\">at least 36 candidates seeking offices</a> throughout the country were killed ahead of the country’s recent elections, according to the New York Times. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there are the numerous alleged plots <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy#:~:text=In%20May%202024%2C%20two%20Ukrainian,hostage%20and%20kill%20the%20President.\">targeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The growing threat of assassination</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite all that, it’s difficult to say for sure if political killings are on the rise. There’s a data problem: Assassinations are still relatively rare compared to other forms of political violence — violent protests, terrorist bombings — and attempts that succeed in killing their target, or even come close enough to succeeding, are even rarer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is some data to suggest they’re getting more common. According to the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, which includes incidents of political violence from 1970 to 2020, the <a href=\"https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?expanded=no&amp;casualties_type=b&amp;casualties_max=&amp;dtp2=all&amp;success=yes&amp;attack=1&amp;ob=GTDID&amp;od=desc&amp;page=1&amp;count=100#results-table\">number of assassination incidents around the world</a> fell dramatically from more than a thousand per year in the early 1990s to less than 100 per year in 1999, then started to creep up again, jumping to more than 900 in 2015. This trend has roughly corresponded with a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia\">global uptick in international armed conflict</a>, which also dipped through the 1990s before rising more recently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Threatened acts of violence have increased even faster. In the United States, the Capitol Police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/us-political-violence-threats-against-lawmakers\">reported 9,625 threats</a> against members of Congress in 2021, compared to just 3,939 in 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What could be driving this trend? Political violence researcher Rachel Kleinfeld of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rise-of-political-violence-in-the-united-states/#f2\">argues</a> that political violence, including assassinations, becomes more common in countries where there are highly competitive elections that could shift the balance of power, where partisan politics becomes a dominant social identity, and where there are weak institutional constraints on violence. All of those reasons fit the US now, which is why Kleinfeld suggests the country is particularly vulnerable to a surge in political violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kleinfeld also notes that a difference between today’s political violence and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2015/07/the-1970s-and-the-birth-of-contemporary-terrorism.html#:~:text=During%20the%20recent%20surge%20from,and%20184%20people%20were%20killed.\">previous periods</a> where it was common — such as the 1970s, the high point of terrorist violence within the US with more than 1,470 attacks compared to 214 in the decade following 9/11 — is that today’s perpetrators are more likely to not belong to any formal organization, but rather to self-radicalize via online engagement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Georgetown University terrorism researchers Bruce Hoffman and Jacob Ware argued in an <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2022/08/the-accelerating-threat-of-the-political-assassination/\">article</a> published two years ago that political assassination is becoming more common around the world in part to the emergence of so-called “accelerationism” — the deliberate effort to foment political chaos or societal collapse in order to accelerate political transformation — as a more prominent strategy for extremists. They write, “For extremists seeking to sow chaos and speed up some cataclysmic societal collapse, high-profile politicians provide an attractive target” because they personify the political order these extremists are trying to tear down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Previous waves of political violence happened in eras when security was more lax and politicians more accessible. Think of John F. Kennedy’s open motorcade in Dallas, which no president would think of doing today. But Hoffman and Ware also note that even as politicians and governments invest more in security, new technologies are making assassination attempts easier. Consider the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/diy-gun-used-kill-japans-abe-was-simple-make-analysts-say-2022-07-09/\">homemade gun used to kill Abe</a>, which the assassin put together with parts and instructions he found online, or the attempted assassination of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45073385\">using explosive drones </a>in 2018. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an email to Vox, Hoffman said that the attempt on Trump “does fit into the trend … where attacks on elected officials are becoming more commonplace and, dare one say, even accepted as a norm in our politically polarized/divided country.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What comes next</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Political violence is a phenomenon that tends to feed on itself. Attacks create justifications for more attacks, leading to long periods of violence, such as Italy’s infamous “<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/11/27/italians-are-still-haunted-by-the-years-of-lead\">years of lead</a>,” from the late ’60s through the ’80s, when assassinations, kidnappings, and bombings by right-wing and left-wing extremist groups were disturbingly common.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another very inconvenient fact about political assassinations is that when successful, they often accomplish their political goals, if not always in ways the assassin might intend: The murder of Abraham Lincoln and his replacement by pro-states rights Southerner Andrew Johnson utterly changed the course of post-Civil War Reconstruction. The right-wing Israeli who killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, in the wake of the historic Oslo Accords, dealt a serious, perhaps fatal, blow to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The killing of Abe <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/10/shinzo-abe-assassination-japan-unification-church-moonies/675114/\">led to a dramatic political reckoning in Japan</a> with the assassin’s primary target: the controversial Unification Church.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We still don’t know the specific motivations of the shooter who attempted to kill Trump, or what impact the event will have on the upcoming election or American politics generally. But it’s safe to say the impact, whatever the gunman’s intentions, would have been far greater if he had adjusted his aim by just a few inches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the stakes of political contests start to seem existential, and political violence of all kinds more permissible, an increase in assassination attempts — in the US and abroad — seems almost inevitable.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The main question it asked was simple: What does giving $4,000 a year, unrestricted, to families with young kids do for them?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first research from the experiment <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22893313/cash-babies-brain-development\">came out in 2022</a> and suggested that the cash might have led to more brain activity in infants whose families got more cash. That conclusion received <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22904345/pre-k-cash-baby-brain-social-science\">a fair bit of criticism</a>. Luckily, the babies, who were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/upshot/stimulus-children-poverty-brain.html\">recruited</a> by canvassing for low-income moms in hospital maternity wards, are now about 6 years old and we can measure a lot more than just their brainwaves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So &#8230; what did the cash do? My read of the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01915-7\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4188131\">papers</a> the experiment’s large group of authors have <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/729364\">released</a> so far is that it generally had the positive effects we expect extra cash to have. Parents getting the cash worked a little bit less, but not too much less. Their incomes (inclusive of the cash) were considerably higher. They spent more on goods for their kids.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In some ways, the more interesting findings in the papers are the nulls: the things that cash doesn’t do. It doesn’t make using child care any more or less likely, for instance. It doesn’t change breastfeeding rates. And (this is one that really surprised me) it doesn’t seem to reduce mothers’ stress levels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are some areas where we know a lot about what cash-giving does. This research is particularly informative on questions where we know less, and it offers a useful dose of humility. Cash is very helpful, but it’s not a miracle drug, and we should be clear-eyed about what it can and can’t do.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The big findings</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Usually, when I talk to researchers about new papers of theirs, I have questions for them. When Lisa Gennetian, a professor of public policy at Duke and one of the lead researchers on Baby&#8217;s First Years, reached out a few weeks ago to talk about the experiment&#8217;s latest findings, she was calling with a question for me<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The researchers had a slew of interesting findings, she explained, but the picture those findings painted was messy and nuanced. How, Gennetian asked me, do we get that across, especially in an environment where simple messages like<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/25/20973151/givedirectly-basic-income-kenya-study-stimulus\"> “this program worked”</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/7/9/23200337/cash-transfer-study-us-covid\">“this program failed”</a> are easier to spread?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t know that I have a great answer to her question, but I’ll try my best to lay out the nuances she was highlighting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The team had two main theories of how giving cash could help kids develop. The first is the investment pathway: Cash gives parents resources they can invest in spending that helps kids, like child care or books, and might let them spend more time with their kids, either by working fewer hours or using money to pay for time-consuming tasks (cooking, say) that detract from time with the kids.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second was the stress pathway: There’s plenty of reason to think that <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay0214?casa_token=R1Pi7gvToDUAAAAA:08PHUM-ocEFtf9AQyuFHxz0-gc8XMYiywLzGcyl_x6jQoWbUCa2T0_But6-Dk_YmYVUlWCM6Z5ohMyN-#sec-2\">poverty increases stress levels</a> and that stress leads to worse decisions and home environments. If cash transfers reduced stress among parents, that might improve outcomes for kids in the long run.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The experiment so far has found a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01915-7\">decent amount of evidence</a> for the investment pathway. The researchers found that mothers receiving $333 a month ($4,000 per year) were as likely to work as mothers receiving $20 a month (the control group, given a nominal amount in part to ensure they replied to follow-up surveys). However, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000951\">they reported working fewer hours, in particular during the pandemic</a>. That means they might have had more time to spend with their kids.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Time spent on learning and enrichment activities with kids (like reading to them, telling stories, playing with building toys, playing pretend, etc.) was higher among moms getting more cash. That said, the absolute amount of the increase was not large — only 11.3 more minutes per week, compared to the control group, a 5.2 percent increase from the roughly three and a half hours per week baseline. Perhaps the most encouraging finding is that moms getting the bigger cash amount spent $67.80 more per month on child-specific purchases, like clothing, toys, books, and so on. Given that the high-cash group got $313 more per month than the low-cash group, that suggests that about one in five of the additional dollars was spent directly on kid-related stuff.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So cash lets people invest more time and money into their kids. What about stress? Here’s where the results get murkier. Mothers getting more money did not report being happier or more satisfied with their lives than mothers getting less. The results were insignificant and, often, the magnitudes were negative: The data shows the high-cash moms being ever-so-slightly less happy, not more. I know of relatively few studies of the effect of cash transfers on happiness in rich countries, but in poor countries giving cash seems to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01252-z\">increase happiness a modest amount</a>. The right takeaway there is “it had no effect” rather than “money makes people sadder,” but it’s still not the result you’d want to see if you’re worried about maternal stress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4188131\">earlier paper</a> examined the effects of the cash on self-reported stress and levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, in mothers’ hair. There was no significant difference between moms getting a lot of cash and moms getting a little bit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While cash transfers might help kids develop by letting their parents spend more time and money on them, the idea that it’s an effective stress-reducer is looking more dubious.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cash as tool versus cash as panacea</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I really tried to write this whole article without using the phrase “cash is not a panacea.” I hate it when journalists or researchers describe something as “not a panacea” or “not a cure-all.” Nothing is a cure-all! That’s a ridiculous standard to judge anything by! You wouldn’t condemn aspirin because it doesn’t destroy brain tumors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cash transfers have, over the past decade, gone from an underrated and simple policy tool to so hyped that some advocates are claiming that it cures things it absolutely does not cure. Take homelessness, for instance. The <a href=\"https://www.denverbasicincomeproject.org/research\">Denver Basic Income Project</a> offered $1,000 a month for a year to one group of initially homeless residents of that city. A second group got the same total amount, but much of it as a big lump sum, and a third group got $50 a month for a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If big cash transfers reduced homelessness, we’d expect the first two groups to be more likely to have housing after a year than the third group. That <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64f507a995b636019ef8853a/t/6671a15eec7a812dee108e7c/1718722914185/FINAL_DBIP+Year+One+Quantitative+Research+Report.pdf\">wasn&#8217;t true</a>: 43 percent of the $50 per month group was housed after 10 months, compared to 44 percent of the $1,000 per month group. The difference was minimal and not statistically significant. Nonetheless, the project was <a href=\"https://x.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1805313666339979501\">hailed as a huge success</a>; Business Insider’s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-basic-income-reduces-homelessness-food-insecurity-housing-ubi-gbi-2024-6\">headline</a> was, “Denver gave people experiencing homelessness $1,000 a month. A year later, nearly half of participants had housing.” That’s about the most misleading way I can imagine to write about a project that did not have a significant effect on the problem it was trying to solve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is the takeaway that homeless people don’t need cash assistance? Of course not — but learning that cash alone is not enough to get homeless people homes is valuable and important. The high share of all groups getting housing suggests that many were going through a temporary shock, like getting laid off or leaving a partner, but could eventually find shelter again once the shock passed. It might also suggest that the housing support services that all groups in the experiment received were useful, maybe more so than raw cash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The point of these studies shouldn’t be to generate clickable headline results that show how great cash is. The point should be to detail what cash can and can’t do, and build better programs that take into account those limitations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the spirit with which we should take the findings on stress and maternal happiness in the Baby’s First Years study, too. Cash really seemed to help the moms in that study in important ways. They were less likely to be poor, and any effects on work were small. They spent more money and time on their kids. Addressing their mental health effectively might require different types of programs, like access to psychotherapy or more in-person social time to assuage loneliness. Cash can’t do everything — and what’s more, it shouldn’t have to.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Quality shut-eye is <a href=\"https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.9476\">essential for mental and physical health</a>, but when it’s hot, our sleep can suffer. When we’re preparing to go to bed, our body temperature naturally drops, says <a href=\"https://weillcornell.org/mebben\">Matthew R. Ebben</a>, an associate professor of psychology and clinical neurology at Weill Cornell Medical College. But when the temperature and humidity in your bedroom are high, it’s difficult for your body to cool down — and stay cool — which interrupts sleep. Research shows that globally, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332222002093\">warmer temperatures reduce sleep</a>, with older adults, women, and those from lower-income countries most affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most effective way to get restorative sleep when it’s hot outside, experts say, is to stay cool inside. Here are some tips for how to sleep soundly during the summer.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make your room comfortably cool&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In general, people tend to sleep better in cooler temperatures, says <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/rafael-pelayo\">Rafael Pelayo</a>, a clinical professor at Stanford University’s Sleep Medicine division and the author of <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/rafael-pelayo-md/how-to-sleep/9781579659578/\"><em>How to Sleep: The New Science-Based Solutions for Sleeping Through the Night</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The easiest way to cool down your bedroom is with air conditioning. If you don’t have central AC, Ebben suggests installing a <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Heating-Venting-Cooling-Mini-Split-Air-Conditioners/N-5yc1vZc4m1\">mini split air conditioner</a> — a <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners\">ductless air conditioning system</a> that can be installed in individual rooms — which is often quieter than window units. Of course, window and portable air conditioners are just as effective and come with a lower price tag. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the exact temperature varies from person to person, Ebben suggests keeping your room in the high 60s or low 70s during the night. If you’re still warm or have difficulty falling and staying asleep, you may need to lower the temperature even more. Some experts, however, argue that a higher temperature — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358898/best-thermostat-setting-save-energy-money-ac\">around 78 degrees</a> — is comfortable enough when you factor in fans and lightweight clothing. Setting your thermostat a little higher can also offset energy costs and lower emissions that contribute to climate change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Keeping <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358898/best-thermostat-setting-save-energy-money-ac\">a room cool</a> for the duration of the evening can still be an expensive proposition. For those who are unable to afford AC units, check to see if your state, town, or city has <a href=\"https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/tables/FY2013/cooling.htm\">cooling assistance initiatives</a> or programs that help eligible residents with their energy bills. For instance, New York City <a href=\"https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-02552\">provides eligible residents</a> with air conditioning units or fans. The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/help-with-energy-bills\">helps residents with their cooling bills</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Add a <a href=\"https://time.com/6985139/how-to-use-fan-air-conditioning/\">fan (or multiple)</a> to help circulate cool air. <a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/ilene-rosen\">Ilene M. Rosen</a>, an associate professor of medicine in the division of sleep medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests placing a small fan on a nightstand or bedside table and pointing it directly at your face. “A lot of people think I need the biggest fan I can get so that it’s blowing in my whole room,” she says. “It just has to be that you personally feel cooler.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the day, <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/sleeping-when-its-blistering-hot\">keep your curtains closed</a> to prevent sunlight from warming your bedroom. If you’re using a window or mini split unit, keep the door to your bedroom closed to keep the cool air contained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ebben doesn’t recommend attempting to acclimate to sleeping in warmer temperatures. “We just don’t know whether that is an effective way to address this issue,” he says. “I think probably not.” If you spend your waking hours working in an air conditioned environment, a hot bedroom will feel even more stifling. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cool your body as much as possible</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are ways to help encourage your body’s natural cooling process before bedtime. Take a cool or lukewarm bath or shower one to two hours before bedtime, which has been shown to help <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552?via%3Dihub\">lower body temperature</a> and promote sleep, Rosen says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Try to avoid exercising within three hours before bedtime, since working out also prevents your body temperature from dropping, Rosen continues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Your nighttime accessories can help you avoid overheating, too. Sleep in loose, lightweight cotton pajamas with only a thin top sheet, Pelayo says. (Feel free to sleep nude if that suits you, too, Rosen says.) If you’re due for new pillows, you might want to make a swap to a cooling pillow — one made from materials designed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeYtq3bJtrk\">whisk heat away from your body</a> or to better allow air to circulate through the pillow. A recent study found that <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/47/Supplement_1/A483/7655132\">participants who used a cooling pillow</a> — specifically the <a href=\"https://www.mattressfirm.com/signature-sub-0-triple-cooling-pillow/5637495584.p?variantid=5637495587\">Sleepy’s Signature</a> SUB-0° Triple Cooling Pillow — got more REM sleep and reported cooler, higher-quality sleep. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Remember to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23800261/tips-extreme-heat-heatwave\">stay hydrated</a>, as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274063254_What_effect_does_hydration_have_on_body_temperature\">dehydration causes higher body temperature</a>, which can make it hard to fall asleep. Don’t worry about a full bladder interrupting your sleep. “People who are healthy sleepers typically don’t get up to urinate,” Pelayo says. Consistently rising throughout the night to use the bathroom might be a signal that something else is waking you up, whether it’s the dog barking, a child crying, snoring (your own or a partner’s), or stress from work, he continues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If heat is what wakes you up, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13704\">research</a> <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01209-5/fulltext\">suggests</a> spraying yourself with cold water or placing a cool washcloth on your neck, which can help cool you down so you can fall asleep again. Try turning on a fan if you haven’t already, Rosen says. You may also want to take a cool shower (just make sure your lights are dim and you’re extra careful not to slip).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This advice is applicable for children too, Pelayo says, though it’s quite likely they haven’t noticed the heat in the first place. “Children sleep deeper than adults do,” he says. “This issue of not being able to sleep as it’s too hot is uncommon in a child, because, again, they sleep so deeply.” Just make sure their pajamas aren’t too heavy; if you notice the back of their head and neck are sweaty in the morning, you might need to switch to more lightweight pajamas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Should you still feel uncomfortable despite a cool room, lightweight pajamas, and a cold compress, Rosen suggests speaking to your doctor about any potential underlying issues that might cause heat intolerance, like thyroid disease or sleep apnea. Some medications, like those that treat blood pressure, she says, may also impact your heat tolerance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The unbearable heat may make sleep a little harder to come by, but with the right toolkit, you can get some shuteye no matter the weather conditions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Or <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals\">Walmart’s July deals</a>? TikTok Shop just had its <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/announcing-deals-for-you-days\">Deals For You Days</a> from July 9 through 11, while <a href=\"https://www.temu.com/\">Temu Week</a>, running through July 18, slashes prices by up to 90 percent. Now, this week, Amazon Prime Day is upon us. All this comes not a moment after retailers’ July Fourth holiday sales, turning the entire month into a blur of bargains. It’s time to shop because it’s never not time to shop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this is an accident. Much like when big-box retailers suddenly announced they were <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/352116/whats-really-happening-to-grocery-prices-right-now\">finally lowering grocery prices</a> to combat inflation, it’s business strategy 101 to react to what the competition is doing. July has become a season for Big Blowout Deals because no store wants to be the one selling an air purifier at full price when Amazon has it for 25 percent off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon’s famous Prime Day sale is, in many ways, proof of the e-commerce giant’s sheer power: It invented a new holiday — now happening twice a year — that consumers have come to observe every summer and fall. It’s still the marquee sales event of the season, complete with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSzVXIQpBN0\">Megan Thee Stallion ad</a> in which she raps about how much she loves Prime, but competitors are trying harder and harder to steal some of its spotlight — and it’s been working. A <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/data-drop-5-charts-on-amazon-prime-day-2024\">new report</a> from market research firm eMarketer forecasts that, for the third year in a row, Amazon’s share of all online purchases made between July 16 and 17, when its Prime Day sale is taking place, will shrink. This speaks to other retailers’ success in pulling customers to their storefronts instead. Prime Day is still a blockbuster 48-hour period of sales — but not just for Amazon anymore.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Prime Day then and now</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The inaugural Prime Day was a one-day sale on July 15, 2015, pegged to Amazon’s 20th anniversary and billed as <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/06/amazon-marks-its-20th-birthday-with-its-own-black-friday.html\">bigger than Black Friday</a>. It was a clever marketing maneuver&nbsp;— instead of competing only during already-established holiday sale seasons, Amazon carved out its own moment smack dab in the middle of the summer. (Walmart immediately announced its <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/deals-amazon-prime-day-walmart/story?id=32463899\">own July sale</a> that same summer).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prime Day was also a big billboard for a Prime subscription, which 40 million people had signed up for by 2015, according to the market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). Today, CIRP estimates, there are about <a href=\"https://cirpamazon.substack.com/p/we-definitely-spoke-too-soon-amazon\">180 million Prime members in the US</a>, which is a little more than half the total population of the country. This nation of loyal Prime subscribers helped make Amazon, for many years a textbook case of an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-worth-billions-unprofitable-tesla-uber-snap-2019-11\">unprofitable tech company</a>, into a juggernaut. In the first quarter of 2024, the company netted a profit of <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon-reports-10-4-billion-profit-in-first-quarter-2024/\">$10.4 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The original Prime Day deals were apparently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/business/more-fizzle-than-sizzle-as-amazons-prime-day-lurches-to-halfway-mark.html\">something of a</a> <a href=\"https://observer.com/2015/07/amazon-prime-day-turned-out-to-be-the-internets-worst-clearance-rack/\">disappointment</a> compared to the hype — it pushed a lot of Fire TV Sticks, still a Prime Day staple — but nevertheless Amazon sold <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/14714/amazon-global-revenue-on-prime-day/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/14714/amazon-global-revenue-on-prime-day/\">about $900 million</a> worth of stuff that day. Since then, consumers have been giving Amazon ever-increasing billions on Prime Days, hitting a record of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/prime-day-shopping-numbers/index.html\">$12.7 billion</a> over 48 hours last July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think Amazon this year is largely sticking to its tried-and-tested Prime Day playbook,” says Sky Canaves, a principal analyst at eMarketer. That means offering good deals that, in turn, drive more Prime sign-ups. Some of the biggest discounts this year are invite-only deals from big brands that only Prime members can request access to: The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Original-Peloton-Stationary-Immersive-Touchscreen/dp/B0C4ZB3WT5?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1\">Peloton</a> bike is 30 percent off, while a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Cappuccino/dp/B0BSGQL41X\">pair of Sony headphones</a> is 55 percent off, and a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Eco-Drive-Weekender-Chronograph-Preforated/dp/B0CZ7LNYH8\">Citizen chronograph watch</a> is discounted by a pretty massive 60 percent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can also expect a lot of beauty products to go on sale. “Amazon has got more premium brands involved this year, especially in categories like beauty,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at the consulting firm GlobalData. Clinique, for example, just recently became <a href=\"https://www.elcompanies.com/en/news-and-media/newsroom/press-releases/2024/03-27-24\">available on Amazon</a>, joining the ranks of popular beauty brands like Dermalogica and Laneige already on the platform.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">When there’s always a sale, is there ever a sale?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Prime Day, Amazon introduced a new calendar event into the lives of American consumers. The problem is that when everyone’s throwing a sale sometime in mid-July, those sales lose some luster.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prime Day “used to be bigger,” says Michael Levin, one of the cofounders of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. “People got a little more acclimated to it,” he says, both because Amazon added a second Prime Day event in October starting in 2022 and because every competitor started following the Prime Day playbook. “I think that the excitement has worn off overall,” adds CIRP cofounder Josh Lowitz.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that Prime Day sales growth has slowed way down may be a reflection of that acclimation. Last year’s Prime Day revenue was 6.7 percent higher than it was in 2022 — still growing, though slowly.<strong> </strong>But in 2018, the sales event brought in a whopping 78 percent more revenue than it did the year before, according to a <a href=\"https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/amazon-prime-day-statistics\">Capital One Shopping report</a>. <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%22prime%20day%22&amp;hl=en\">Google Trends data</a> also shows that searches for “Prime Day” peaked around July 2018.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon itself is partly to blame for dulling some of the Prime Day fervor. Not only are there multiple Prime Days per year now but it also held a major <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/amazon-spring-sale-2024-rcna143414\">spring sales event</a> that was open to all customers, not just Prime members, and has been doing smaller, more category-specific sales, too. “These incremental sales can have some minor dampening effect on Prime Day,” says Canaves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon probably doesn’t mind too much, though, because having more frequent sales means it can take advantage of smaller but more frequent purchases on its site, whether of beauty products or health supplements, which come with a handy auto-replenish purchase option. At time of writing, it’s not actually Prime Day yet, but Amazon already has plenty of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24186583/amazon-prime-day-2024-best-tech-deals-sales\">“early” Prime Day deals</a> available, too, further smudging the line of when the sale really kicks off and ends. Even outside of the big sales, products on Amazon are often discounted, its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/24105250/fast-food-restaurants-dynamic-pricing-algorithm-wendys\">prices fluctuating</a> millions of times per day. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Creuset-Signature-Enameled-Cast-Iron-Stainless/dp/B00VA5HEQC?th=1\">Le Creuset Dutch Oven</a> in Cerise is currently on sale for $297 instead of $460, and it’s not marked as a Prime Day deal. Online sites like Camelcamelcamel or Keepa make it trivially easy to set up an alert for price drops that you can set and forget rather than waiting for a sales event to launch. According to Keepa, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Levis-Mens-Relaxed-Straight-Jean/dp/B00UV3TH00\">these Levi jeans</a> see an average of six price drops per month, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coway-AP-1512HH-Mighty-Purifier-White/dp/B01728NLRG/\">Coway air purifier</a> about eight times per month, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Premier-Protein-Shake-Chocolate-11-5/dp/B07MJL8NXR/\">Premier Protein Shakes</a> — a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/electronics/prime-day-top-products-sold-1076028/\">bestseller</a> during the October 2023 Prime Day —&nbsp;a dizzying 32 times per month. If you miss a good price, don’t worry. Just wait a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Everyone’s an Amazon competitor</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Online retailers have come out in full force to offer their answer to Prime Day — and Amazon is clearly paying attention to the upstarts nipping at its heels. The Information recently <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-to-launch-temu-like-discount-section-with-direct-shipping-from-china?rc=eh9iin\">reported</a> that the American e-commerce giant is launching a cheaper apparel and home goods section with slow shipping directly from China, much in the same way Temu does business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon has so long been synonymous with convenience: You can buy things with one click to be delivered, sometimes the very same day. It makes sense to offer customers a new slow shipping option if they want it, but it’s also a partial capitulation from Amazon that maybe consumers <em>don’t</em> actually need lightning fast delivery for everything. Price is king, and the Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu making inroads in the US have an edge here. Whether you’re shopping on Amazon or Temu, whatever you buy is likely <a href=\"https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazons-significant-reliance-on-chinese-sellers\">coming from a Chinese seller</a> anyway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another area where Amazon’s competitors have an advantage: making shopping entertaining. “We like to say that Amazon is a better place to buy things than to shop for things,” says CIRP’s Lowitz. “If you know what you want, Amazon is a fantastic place to buy. It’s easy, it’s reliable.” It’s not such a great store for coming across new products that catch the eye. To buy something on Amazon, first you hit up the shopping blogs, Reddit comments, Wirecutter, and TikTok influencers to surface the best finds. This is where Temu and the newer TikTok Shop stand to excel. Chinese e-commerce retailers tend to be “very discovery-driven, rather than search-driven,” says Canaves. Amazon has tried to incorporate some of TikTok’s social shopping aspects into its platform, including a scrolling feed of shoppable products called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Inspire/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=24672145011\">Inspire</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/live\">livestream shopping</a>, but these features haven’t quite made waves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce operation in the US, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be concerned about other much smaller retailers. “Taken cumulatively, the new entrants in the market — Temu, TikTok Shop, and Shein — <em>are</em> having an impact on sales,” says Canaves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last few decades, Amazon has become an unstoppable force. But maintaining its dominance as the Everything Store might be the greatest challenge the company faces now, according to Lowitz. Amazon sells everything, but can it do better in ultra-cheap fast fashion than Shein? Better in furniture than Wayfair? Better in pet products than Chewy? Better in groceries than Walmart?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One competitor may not chip away much at Amazon’s dominance, but taken all together, it adds up. The evolution of Prime Day is one example of that — Amazon may have kicked it off, but now it’s every retailer’s Prime Month.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Did you enjoy Target Circle Week last week? Or Walmart’s July deals? TikTok Shop just had its Deals For You Days from July 9 through 11, while Temu Week, running through July 18, slashes prices by up to 90 percent. Now, this week, Amazon Prime Day is upon us. All this comes not a moment [&#8230;]",

For amateurs, it may be the culmination of years of saving to afford the steep $10,000 entry fee for the main event, which has drawn a record-breaking 10,112 participants this year. The <a href=\"https://www.wsop.com/tournaments/payouts/?aid=2&amp;grid=5504&amp;tid=23257&amp;dayof=232578&amp;rr=-1\">top 1,517 players</a> will walk away with at least $15,000, while the overall winner will claim $10 million at the final table on July 17.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To get “in the money” — that is, to make more than they paid to enter the tournament&nbsp; — even the best players need a fair bit of luck. These days, though, most poker players are not heedless, risk-seeking gamblers. They’re diligent students of the game who have often spent thousands of hours drilling the most optimal strategies, often with the help of a computer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It used to be that poker was a game played by degenerates, people who live on the edge,” said Doug Polk, a professional player who has won a WSOP event three times. “But what’s funny about that is, if you boil down poker to its essence, it’s a math game. And so that means that nerds are going to eventually win.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve come a long way from the image of a tuxedoed James Bond sipping his shaken-not-stirred martini in <em>Casino Royale</em>. Real-life players are instead reaching for Red Bull to power through 10 straight hours of play amid the constant clinking of poker chips. On the windowless casino floor, they don sunglasses to shield any glimpse of their eyes that could give away their position to other players and wear noise-canceling headphones to silence everything but the calculations running in their heads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They are trying to play, albeit imperfectly, a strategy computer algorithms have revealed as game theory optimal, what players call GTO: the mathematically proven way to become unexploitable to other players while maximizing winnings. How closely players can hew to GTO can often determine their success, especially since the competition has never been fiercer: Anyone can now study GTO with an app on their phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We&#8217;ve really seen a shift away from sort of the old-school gambler vibe toward a much more intelligent and sophisticated group of players,” said Polk, who is also a co-founder of the poker training company <a href=\"https://upswingpoker.com/about-us/doug-polk/?_gl=1*1lxz6pw*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTA2MjI4MTcwOS4xNzIwNTg1NjIw*_ga_19RXF7CJJ2*MTcyMDU4NTYxOS4xLjEuMTcyMDU4ODI0Ny4wLjAuMA..\">Upswing Poker</a> and co-owner of the <a href=\"https://thelodgepokerclub.com/\">Lodge Card Club</a> in Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But has the relentless pursuit of optimization also made poker a bit &#8230; robotic?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How poker became so damn huge&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Poker in some form dates back a thousand years, but French colonists imported its European predecessor Poque to the southern US in the 1800s, after which English speakers <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/where-did-poker-originate\">adopted the game and made it their own</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It took hold in the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/where-did-poker-originate\">saloons on the American frontier</a> in the 1870s. US soldiers in World War I <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/where-did-poker-originate\">made the game more broadly popular</a>. After 1970, when the <a href=\"https://www.wsop.com/history/\">first World Series of Poker was held</a>, poker tournaments became more commonplace, producing star players like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/sports/amarillo-slim-five-time-poker-world-series-winner-dies-at-83.html\">Amarillo Slim</a> and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-apr-15-me-pearson15-story.html\">Puggy Pearson</a> (who dropped out of school in the fifth grade). This growth in popularity also spawned the<a href=\"https://www.pokernews.com/news/2017/09/nolan-dalla-10-most-important-poker-strategy-books-18297.htm\"> first generation of poker strategy books</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 1990s saw poker go mainstream as tournaments were increasingly <a href=\"https://www.pokerlistings.com/blog/every-poker-tv-show-ever-ranked\">televised in the style of live sports</a>. Films like <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128442/\"><em>Rounders</em></a>, where Matt Damon’s character plays underground poker games to help his friend repay a loan shark, elevated the game in popular culture. The <a href=\"https://poker.com/features/the-history-of-online-poker/\">first online poker sites emerged</a>, paving the way for a poker boom in the 2000s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No-Limit Hold’em became the most popular version of the game. In case you’re unfamiliar, here’s how it works:</p>\n\n<div class=\"c-image-slider alignnone wp-block-vox-media-image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"c-image-slider__caption\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_01.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_012.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_013.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_014.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_015.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_016.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_017.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Poker_Vox_018.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the rules suggest, poker is a game of incomplete information. Players know there are 52 cards in a deck, divided into four suits with 13 cards each. While they can calculate the probabilities of certain cards being in their opponent&#8217;s hand or appearing on the table, they cannot know these outcomes for certain. The choices they make around whether to fold, check, bet — and how much to bet — depend on these probabilities, as well as their anticipation of how their opponents will play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, poker players primarily relied on intuition and experience to make these decisions. They adapted their strategies to exploit any patterns they observed in their opponents’ play. For instance, a player might bluff too often; any opponent who realizes this will exploit that tendency by calling more often and not folding outright, forcing the player to show their weak hand at the end of the betting rounds. Players might also provide subconscious <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VW6ZzzOaxY\">visual tells</a>, such as glancing at their chips when they’re feeling good about their hand and are planning to bet or raise. An opponent might want to proceed cautiously in challenging them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this style of play, known as “exploitative play,” isn’t an exact science. Many players developed idiosyncratic styles rooted in their own strengths and weaknesses, leading to diverse approaches and debates about the optimal strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I do have some nostalgia for the days when you could just put your pants on and go play,” said Eric Seidel, a pro player who won his first of 10 WSOP events in 1992 and has been inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame. “There weren’t really any solutions to things. People were just making things up as they went along and getting by on experience and judgment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rise of GTO and computer solvers, however, completely changed the game.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Time for some game theory</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Game theory itself isn’t new. Mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/neumann.html\">developed</a> it in the 1950s to establish a mathematical way to understand optimal strategies in competitive games, and their work has been applied to a wide range of fields from international relations to the study of animal behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A key concept in game theory that you may remember if you’ve ever taken Economics 101 is a Nash Equilibrium: a state in which each player&#8217;s strategy is optimal given the strategies of all other players. In games like poker, a player is unexploitable in this state — it is their best strategy to maximize their winnings in the long run, and no other player can do better by changing their strategy alone. That doesn’t mean they won’t lose a particular hand since luck of the card draw still plays a role, but over many hands, they’ll do better than they would pursuing any other strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Bill Chen’s seminal book <em>The Mathematics of Poker</em> came out in 2006, top players increasingly started incorporating game theoretical concepts in their play. But GTO really exploded in the mid-2010s with the development of computer poker solvers such as PioSolver or Simple Postflop. These solvers use profit-maximizing algorithms that analyze and predict players&#8217; strategies and payoffs to essentially find the Nash Equilibrium at any point in a game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Players can practice by running past hands by the solver or asking it to spit out optimal strategies in a certain scenario. They can also play against a computer with apps like <a href=\"https://gtowizard.com/g1/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw4ri0BhAvEiwA8oo6F98A2Q5ICPUe8HZGXjtWvj5Fq29vOV_fxCLWI3ZSNLUItWdY9jHGcxoCiA4QAvD_BwE\">GTO Wizard</a>, which will then tell them what they should have done to play optimally. With repetition, GTO strategies start to sink in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Some top players spend hours running simulations and memorizing the solutions,” said Liv Boeree, a former professional poker player and the only woman in history to win both a WSOP event and a European Poker Tour event. “This is vastly different to the old-school days where players ‘trained’ through playing, and perhaps honing, general principles. We now have access to much more granular data on optimal play in specific situations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Poker, she added, has “evolved from an art into a science.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, no human can actually play perfect GTO strategy. Performing the necessary calculations without the help of a computer is just too complicated. That’s because there is an astronomical number of game states in poker: depending on the betting rules and the number of their chips, a player can make a bet of any size and so can their opponents, and there are 2,598,960 possible hands. In practice, players are only approximating GTO; at best, that’s what their opponents are doing as well. This means that players can deviate from textbook GTO to exploit weaknesses in other players and maximize their profits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some players do this exceptionally well. Take <a href=\"https://www.wsop.com/news/2012/Jul/3929/IVEY-LEAGUE-A-ONE-ON-ONE-INTERVIEW-WITH-THE-WORLDS-BEST-POKER-PLAYER-PHIL-IVEY.html\">Phil Ivey</a> or <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070430012421/http://www.azstarnet.com/accent/149415.php\">Daniel Negreanu</a>, who came on the scene before GTO was widespread but are still top poker players known for their abilities to read and exploit their opponents. But deviating from GTO can also be risky because it can backfire and open a player to exploitation themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The beauty of poker is that there are so many different situations that can arise and so many different ways to think about the different spots and the combinations of hands and how likely things are that even if you’re really good, you’re going to be constantly making mistakes,” Polk said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, however, Polk said that even simplified GTO strategies can allow a player to reap many of the benefits of textbook GTO. This means that, for most successful players, “poker has become more about executing the math and those strategies at a high level, rather than staring your opponent down in the eye and knowing that he doesn&#8217;t have the goods.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Where does poker go from here?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not all of the changes wrought by GTO are for the better of the game. For one, it raises a practical problem: It’s now easier than ever to cheat, especially online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2011, the US government cracked down on unregulated online poker sites in an event known by the poker community as “<a href=\"https://www.pokernews.com/news/2022/11/full-tilt-poker-cheating-scandal-42534.htm\">Black Friday</a>.” But such sites have nonetheless proliferated internationally — take the Canada- and Ireland-based site <a href=\"https://ggpoker.com/\">GG Poker</a>, for which Negreanu is a spokesperson — and made a major resurgence during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some more reputable sites, including GG Poker, have tried to implement <a href=\"https://poker.com/poker-industry-news/poker-sites-to-combat-real-time-assistance-cheating-in-online-poker/\">anti-cheating software</a> to detect when players are using computer solvers to assist them in real time, banning some accounts and confiscating their winnings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But enforcement can be spotty, and determined individuals can still find ways to cheat. In one 2020 case, Fedor Kruse, a former video game streamer who became prominent in online high-stakes tournaments, was <a href=\"https://www.pokernews.com/news/2020/09/fedor-kruse-solver-cheat-high-stakes-cash-37966.htm\">accused</a> of using real-time assistance software to play GTO by using a second computer that he allegedly called the “dream machine.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polk said the only way for a poker player to protect themselves from rampant cheating is to not play online at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s really much harder for people to be successful online than it used to be,” Seidel said. “The majority of players are honest, but the ones that aren’t are definitely a problem. And some sites are better than others at policing that kind of thing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But beyond cheating, some players think GTO has changed the soul of poker in a way that makes it less fun to play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think it’s worse for the game, frankly, because the days of just no one having any idea are gone,” said Polk, who has somewhat stepped back from the game and focused on his businesses after playing what he estimates to be 7 to 8 million hands of poker in his lifetime. “It’s just turned into who wants to spend the time necessary to execute a high level. I don&#8217;t love that &#8230; I just don&#8217;t feel like it’s that interesting anymore.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Boeree agrees that GTO “takes away a bit of [poker’s] romantic Wild West character.” But she said it’s not all bad; just different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one thing, GTO players tend to play more aggressively than old-school players. That’s because the theory incorporates a balanced mix of frequent value bets and bluffs: GTO players tailor their bet sizes to extract maximum value from their strong hands by encouraging calls from worse hands, using bluffs to keep opponents guessing and prevent exploitation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This can be exciting to watch in that it frequently leads to bigger pots, crazier bluffs, and dramatic showdowns. For amateurs who don’t know what they’re doing, it’s a lot easier to make costly mistakes when facing GTO opponents. Sometimes, hands are resolved more quickly because a big bet could intimidate players into folding. But thinking through GTO strategy on the spot can also be time-consuming, making some hands go slower.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When playing opponents who came on the scene in the 1990s, Polk said he has noticed that their “style tends to be more conservative. It tends to be more of wait till you have a good hand.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Whereas the modern poker strategies, they’re very aggressive. They really go after people in places. They bluff a lot. They attack pots. They make your opponent’s life difficult,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The democratization of poker knowledge has made top players’ “edges much smaller and the competition fierce,” Boeree said. If every player at a table is playing GTO, the play becomes more about focusing on maintaining GTO and less about reading opponents, which can seem mechanical.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’d argue it’s also made it more intellectually fascinating, as the mathematical building blocks of the game are now truly visible for the first time,” she said. “There’s still plenty of room for creativity, especially in live play where you’re dealing with real human faces and emotions. Even the best players still make mistakes and give off tells that can in theory be exploited!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Seidel said he doesn’t have as much time to sit in front of a computer and study GTO in the way that some younger players might. His experience has helped balance that out, ensuring he’s still one of the world’s best players: He has already notched <a href=\"https://www.pokernews.com/news/2024/04/erik-seidel-us-poker-open-win-45752.htm\">two major tournament victories this year</a>. The changes in the game, however, are part of what keep him coming back after more than three decades of playing professionally at a top level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I do find it’s an exciting time to play with players who have really studied the game,” he said. “It’s really interesting to me because I feel like, as much as I’m a player, I’m also a fan of the game. I really enjoy watching the game develop and trying my best to keep up.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

J.D. Vance (R-OH) blamed President Joe Biden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination,” Vance, the <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/8069/Who-will-win-the-2024-Republican-vice-presidential-nomination\">odds-on favorite</a> to be Trump’s vice president, <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1812280973628965109\">wrote on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance was <a href=\"https://x.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1812319239526572502\">not alone</a>. Rep. Mike Collins (R-GA) wrote that “Joe Biden sent the orders.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wrote that “Democrats wanted this to happen.” Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy <a href=\"https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1812277655271809243\">said something similar</a>. So did <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorTimScott/status/1812294854350635361\">Sen. Tim Scott</a> (R-SC).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates\">happened Saturday night</a>, before we knew a single thing about the shooter’s identity or motive. Since then, the Secret Service has identified him as a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man named Thomas Matthew Crooks,&nbsp;and we still don’t know much about his motive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202102049425405473\">Federal data</a> shows he gave <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/heres-what-we-know-about-thomas-matthew-crooks-suspected-trump-rally-shooter-2024-07-14/\">$15 to a progressive PAC in 2021</a>, but more recent <a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/eab599d76197b932/4bf3303b-full.pdf\">Pennsylvania voter records</a> list him as a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/heres-what-we-know-about-thomas-matthew-crooks-suspected-trump-rally-shooter-2024-07-14/\">registered Republican</a>. A classmate <a href=\"https://x.com/MeghanKDKA/status/1812508130745716962\">told local news</a> that he was a bullied loner who frequently wore “hunting” outfits to school. None of these crumbs establish why he might have targeted the former president, and so far no one has found any online accounts under Crooks’s name that could help make sense of his actions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So we can be confident that none of this speculation was even remotely connected to the facts at the time it happened. Prominent Republicans were conjuring up a Democratic boogeyman, all but openly telling their supporters that Biden and his allies were behind the attack on Trump’s life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s dangerous. Very, very dangerous. And it should cause us to reflect more broadly on how our political leaders should respond to political violence in our country.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When is blaming leaders for violence appropriate?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On one level, what Republicans are saying might seem to make sense. <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo163195227.html\">Research on political violence</a> does suggest that when leaders call for violence or condone it, they create a permission structure for their angriest and most deranged supporters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats have used this logic to blame Republicans for political violence in the past. After the 2022 shooting at a supermarket in a majority-Black area of Buffalo, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/16/democrats-gop-rhetoric-buffalo-shooting-maga-00032895\">rushed to blame Republicans</a> who had been promoting the idea of a “Great Replacement” of whites by non-whites. Later that year, Democrats also blamed heated <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/democrats-criticize-republicans-attack-pelosis-husband-many-people-sta-rcna54712\">Republican attacks on then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> for the assault on her husband Paul Pelosi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s a critical difference between those cases and the present one: evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Buffalo shooter penned a detailed manifesto explaining how <a href=\"https://www.icct.nl/publication/buffalo-attack-analysis-manifesto\">replacement theory motivated his actions</a>; his motives were <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/buffalo-ny-mass-shooting-latest-b2079245.html\">known by the night of the attack</a>. In the days after the Pelosi assault, Democrats <a href=\"https://x.com/RepSwalwell/status/1586500369848442880\">cited</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1586352697107783680\">revelations</a> about the attacker’s Facebook page and his <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-28/pelosi-attack-suspect-david-depape-shared-conspiracy-theories\">stated opinions</a> to justify their claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At present, no similar evidence exists linking Biden’s rhetoric to Crooks’s actions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such evidence could indeed come to light. While right-wing political violence is far more common in the contemporary United States, there are recent examples of violence coming from the other side — most notably in 2017, when <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/6/14/15799256/steve-scalise-shot-gunfire-congressional-baseball\">an angry left-winger opened fire</a> at the GOP House baseball team’s practice and seriously injured House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the question is not whether Democratic rhetoric might have played a role in the shooting; it’s whether it actually did. At present, there’s simply nothing justifying the speculation coming from folks like Vance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this sense, the Republican behavior recalls a different — and less defensible — response from Democrats to political violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) was shot in 2011, liberals and Democrats rushed to blame the attack on <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/01/did-sarah-palin-s-target-map-play-role-in-giffords-shooting/342714/\">a graphic</a> released by former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin’s PAC. The graphic highlighted with a bullseye the names of Democrats they hoped to defeat. Republicans argued that this is absurd: The bullseye was used to signal that they were “targeting” particular candidates electorally rather than with literal violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Subsequent evidence <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/06/15/the-bogus-claim-that-a-map-of-crosshairs-by-sarah-palins-pac-incited-rep-gabby-giffordss-shooting/\">has supported the Republican line</a>. Giffords’s attacker, Jared Lee Loughner, was a man with mental illness who abused substances and had no clear political views. He had become dangerously obsessed with Giffords after a brief interaction at a 2007 constituent meet-and-greet and plotted her assassination for reasons comprehensible only to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats should not have been speculating about Republican culpability before they had any evidence to back up their claims. It was irresponsible and politically inflammatory, a case study in how not to respond to an assassination attempt on an elected official under conditions of uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Republicans are now repeating that mistake at a much more politically charged time.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pouring gasoline on a fire</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In libel law, truth is an absolute defense: You can’t be held legally responsible for damaging someone’s reputation if what you’re saying is actually true.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same should hold true for Democrats’ rhetoric about Trump. Donald Trump really is a threat to democracy. He tried to overturn the 2020 election, incited a riot at the US Capitol, and is currently putting forward a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">2025 policy agenda</a> that could place dangerous amounts of power in his personal hands. Democrats not only should say that; they also have an obligation to voters to make it the centerpiece of their case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, it’s the parlous state of American democracy that makes the Republican response to Trump’s shooting so dangerous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump dominates the Republican Party because a critical mass of the party’s base <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22274429/republicans-anti-democracy-13-charts\">really, really hates Democrats</a>. They believe that the Democratic Party is out to get them and destroy their way of life, and are willing to entrust power to a cruel demagogue in order to defeat the left. A small portion of this base believes this so deeply that they’re willing to commit actual violence in order to stop Democrats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How else to describe the events of January 6?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In such a moment, blaming Democrats without evidence for the attempt on Trump’s life is extraordinarily dangerous. It’s waving a red flag in front of the most radical Republicans, directing their attention toward a target and outlet for their rage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This would remain true even if evidence emerges that Trump’s attacker was a left-winger. When your rhetoric carries potentially serious consequences, you have a moral obligation to be especially careful in deploying it. Speculating wildly under such tense circumstances is wrong, even if the speculation is eventually vindicated by future revelations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What Vance et al. are doing is beyond irresponsible. It is pouring a bucket of gasoline on a campfire and hoping that the forest doesn’t burn.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The last was President Ronald Reagan, who, like Trump, survived an attack by a lone shooter. But that was in 1981 — a decidedly different political moment than today’s highly polarized environment. And that means it’s uncertain that the political benefits Reagan saw after surviving his attempt will come to Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On March 30, 1981, Reagan was exiting the Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC, where he had just given a speech before members of the AFL-CIO. As he raised his arm to salute the crowd gathered outside, six shots were fired toward him. President Reagan and three others were hit, including press secretary James Brady, who was left disabled. The bullet that hit Reagan narrowly missed his heart, but struck his rib, leading to a punctured lung. Reagan was rushed to the hospital, and emergency surgery saved his life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The shooter was John Hinckley Jr., who was later found <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hinckley-not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity\">not guilty</a> of attempted murder on account of insanity. He had no political motive: He had become obsessed with the actress Jodie Foster and thought he could impress her by shooting the president, just 18 years after President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-771913.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.069615290176,100,77.860769419648\" alt=\"In a photo from 1981, agents in navy and gray suits with guns surround two men who lie on a sidewalk.\" title=\"In a photo from 1981, agents in navy and gray suits with guns surround two men who lie on a sidewalk.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Chaos surrounds shooting victims immediately after the assassination attempt on President Reagan, outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC. | Dirck Halstead/Liaison/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Dirck Halstead/Liaison/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chaos ensued in the immediate aftermath. While Reagan was incapacitated in surgery, there was a real question of who was running the country — and who controlled the nuclear arsenal at a time when Cold War tensions were at a near all-time high, in part because Reagan had entered office taking a tougher line on Moscow. Al Haig, Reagan’s secretary of state, <a href=\"https://adst.org/2014/03/al-haig-and-the-reagan-assassination-attempt-im-in-charge-here/\">erroneously claimed that he was in charge</a> because Vice President George H.W. Bush was on his way back from Texas; under the Constitution’s succession clause, power passes to the speaker of the House after the president and vice president.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But once Reagan came through surgery and the immediate confusion disappated, the assassination attempt had a temporary <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/03/30/avlon.reagan.shooting/index.html\">unifying effect</a> on the country. Reagan was able to project strength throughout the crisis and his recovery, solidifying his image as a leader for all Americans. That generated goodwill on both sides of the aisle and helped him advance key parts of his agenda in Congress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the assassination attempt on Trump Saturday, there has been a <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/dont-believe-cynics-most-democrats-are-horrified-attempt-trumps-life-opinion-1924984\">similar outpouring</a> of statements from public officials offering their well wishes for the former president and urging the country to come together to end political violence. But unlike in 1981, it’s unclear that much will change politically.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Both Reagan and Trump refused to be knocked down</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has sought to project strength in the aftermath of the assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After the shooter failed to hit him directly, Trump stood up amid the huddle of Secret Service agents encircling him to raise a fist in the air, blood dripping from his face, in a gesture of defiance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Sunday, he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112786183121187515\">announced</a> that he would not allow the assassination attempt to change his travel schedule for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which begins Monday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reagan similarly projected resilience after facing the attempt on his life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reagan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/us/reagan-wounded-chest-gunman-outlook-good-after-2-hour-surgery-aide-2-guards-shot.html\">walked into the hospital</a> just after the shooting, despite having just coughed up blood in the limousine ride there. He cracked jokes that endeared him to the public: “Honey, I forgot to duck,” he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/us/reagan-wounded-chest-gunman-outlook-good-after-2-hour-surgery-aide-2-guards-shot.html\">told</a> first lady Nancy Reagan. <a href=\"https://www.reaganfoundation.org/store/an-american-life-the-autobiography-by-ronald-reagan/c-24/p-2928\">In his memoir <em>An American Life</em></a><em>, </em>he recounted how he had told one of his doctors that he hoped they were a Republican, to which they replied, “Today, Mr. President, we’re all Republicans.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless of party affiliation, Americans rallied around him during his recovery. Four days after the assassination, he was captured smiling and standing up, clutching his wife’s hand, in a widely circulated photo from his time in the hospital. Upon his return home, he walked from the car to the White House residence to show how well he was doing.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-127980631.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.542310177458,100,34.915379645084\" alt=\"In a 1981 photo, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, both in suits and coats, hold hands outside a hospital.\" title=\"In a 1981 photo, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, both in suits and coats, hold hands outside a hospital.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Nancy Reagan and President Ronald Reagan as they smile and hold hands at George Washington University Hospital, four days after the president had been shot in an assassination attempt, in 1981. | Mike Evens/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Mike Evens/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Wearing a bright red sweater over a white shirt, the president waved to the spectators and turned to walk into the White House, resembling, as an aide later put it, a ‘championship golfer strolling toward the eighteenth green,’” writes Del Quentin Wilber in his 2011 book about the assassination attempt, <em>Rawhide Down</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">1981 was a different time</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite some parallels between Trump and Reagan’s responses to their attempted assassinations, Trump is operating in a totally different political environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reagan had been catapulted to office in the 1980 election on a promise to “make America great again,” a slogan later adopted by Trump. It resonated at a time when many believed America’s best days were behind it amid high inflation, stagnant economic growth, the Iran hostage crisis, and rising Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union, which Reagan would go on to <a href=\"https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/reagan-evil-empire-speech-text/\">label an “evil empire.”</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though there were divides between Democrats and Republicans on many of these issues, it was nothing like the current environment in which identity politics reigns. Bipartisanship and moderates on both sides of the aisle were more common, and the media environment was more homogenous and far less around-the-clock than it is today. Though Reagan was a champion for socially conservative values, issues like abortion and immigration didn’t animate the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/why-tribalism-took-over-our-politics-5936f48e\">same kind of tribalism in US politics</a>. Reagan himself would go on to pass major immigration reforms in 1986 (something unthinkable in today’s divided Congress), and voter support for abortion <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2135282\">didn’t fall neatly along party lines</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By mid-March of 1981, before the assassination attempt, Reagan was earning approval ratings <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/11887/ronald-reagan-from-peoples-perspective-gallup-poll-review.aspx\">as high as 60 percent</a>. (Trump’s approval, on the other hand, is hovering <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/\">around 42 percent</a>.) But the assassination attempt and the way Reagan responded to it galvanized greater bipartisan support behind him and contributed to what ultimately became a hopeful national mood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“On April 14, three days after I got home, the space shuttle <em>Columbia</em> returned to Earth in triumph after its maiden voyage,” Reagan wrote in his memoir. “The landing touched off tremendous excitement around the country, convincing me more than ever that Americans wanted to feel proud and patriotic again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later that month, he delivered a <a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-joint-session-congress-program-economic-recovery-april-1981\">televised address</a> to a joint session of Congress — his first speech since the assassination attempt —&nbsp;in which he received repeated ovations from the crowd. He laid out an economic recovery plan that <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-we-learned-from-reagans-tax-cuts/\">included major tax cuts</a> and later passed despite Democratic opposition, acknowledging the “<a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-joint-session-congress-program-economic-recovery-april-1981\">spirit of candor, openness, and mutual respect</a>” that characterized the congressional negotiations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Thanks to some very fine people, my health is much improved. I’d like to be able to say that with regard to the health of the economy,” he <a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-joint-session-congress-program-economic-recovery-april-1981\">said in the address</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By that May, Reagan’s approval rating had <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/11887/ronald-reagan-from-peoples-perspective-gallup-poll-review.aspx\">reached 68 percent</a>. Though that did not last due to ongoing concerns about the economy, it was clear that Reagan had “turned a near tragedy into a political triumph,” Wilber writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump might hope to experience a similar political boost in the coming months. But it’s not clear how much more of an edge he can get in today’s hyperpartisan environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Democrats, Trump still poses what they believe to be an existential threat to democracy in the November election. Trump’s Republican base believes that the former president needs their support now more than ever. And that means both parties are still on the same, ever more treacherous collision course.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Shortly after, Secret Service agents rushed the stage, and Trump was escorted off — his face smeared with blood.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two people were killed, including the shooter — <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-incident-in-butler-pennsylvania\">identified by the FBI</a> as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year old from Pennsylvania. Two other rally attendees <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/secret-service-spectator-killed-critically-injured-after-attacker-111918828\">were critically injured</a>.

Trump is seen touching his ear and then with blood on his face; he was quickly swarmed by Secret Service agents and soon escorted offstage.

On Sunday afternoon, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro identified the rally attendee who was killed as Corey Comperatore, a father of two whom <a href=\"https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/former-fire-chief-shot-killed-trump-rally/HJXCL4CSN5AZJIPZCT6GWFQ4JE/\">local news sources identified</a> as a former fire chief.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trump himself was brought to a local hospital afterward to be examined, but he <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-released-from-hospital-after/\">was released</a> late Saturday.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hours after the shooting, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112782066045321247\">posted on Truth Social</a> that he had been “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.

That gunman, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/cxe27v3gr2ro\">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a>, proceeded to fire several bullets at Trump, injuring the Republican’s ear, killing a male rallygoer, and wounding another. Security forces then shot Crooks dead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is a tragedy for those directly harmed. Crooks stole life from a person and thus, a loved one from many other people. And he almost certainly traumatized many others, not least the Republican standard-bearer himself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Saturday’s events are also a nightmare for the country. While riven by increasingly bitter political conflict over the past two decades, the United States had managed to avoid deadly assassination attempts against presidential candidates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Keeping America’s “culture war” purely metaphorical is not easy. Fights over questions as fundamental as “Who counts as an American?” and “When does human life begin?” are not easily contained within the bounds of the democratic process. Occasionally, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1107244499/storycorps-remembering-a-murdered-doctor-who-performed-abortions\">they get people killed</a>. Erode the taboo against resolving these disputes through force, and you clear a path to mass death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is therefore vital for all of America’s political factions to forswear political violence. In the wake of this weekend’s assassination attempt, however, some have called on partisans to do more than this: They have suggested that we must not merely condemn violence, but also avoid rhetoric that could hypothetically inspire it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of these calls are patently cynical. For example, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1812280973628965109\">argued</a> Saturday that the “central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs” and that this “rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time of Vance’s statement, nothing was known about the shooter’s motives. Thus, the senator did not know whether what he was saying was true. And in fact, he appears to have been entirely wrong. Four former classmates of the shooter told the <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/thomas-matthew-crooks-trump-shooter-id-butler-20240714.html#:~:text=FBI%20probing%20motives%2C%20background%20of,used%20belonged%20to%20his%20father.\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a> that he was a &#8220;conservative&#8221; and a &#8220;loner.&#8221; As of this writing, Crooks had no discernible political motive. We have no evidence he was motivated by rhetoric on the left or the right or even by politics at all; it&#8217;s possible he was simply a young man looking to give his life historical significance through violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More fundamentally, though, it is absurd for an ardent supporter of Donald Trump to feign a principled opposition to incendiary rhetoric. The former president has likened his political enemies to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/12/trump-rally-vermin-political-opponents/\">“vermin</a>,” accused Joe Biden of trying to “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-bidens-border-policies-are-conspiracy-overthrow-us-2024-03-02/\">overthrow the United States”</a> by orchestrating mass immigration, and said that if the Democrat wins, “our country doesn’t stand a chance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, not all calls for cooler rhetoric were disingenuous. The great science writer Robert Wright, whose politics are decidedly left of center, <a href=\"https://x.com/robertwrighter/status/1812277878748299340\">posted on X</a> Saturday, “Why don’t we just skip the argument about which side has used more extreme rhetoric about the other side, which side used it first, etc. There’s been way too much on both sides. If you agree, maybe the best thing to do is politely discourage people on your own side from using it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This sentiment is understandable but imprecise. It is wrong to say things that are untrue, and when dishonest rhetoric is also politically incendiary, it is especially irresponsible. But we cannot have an honest and open debate about our political disagreements without saying things that an unhinged person might construe as a rationale for violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Donald Trump really does present a threat to the norms of liberal democracy and the welfare of millions of US residents. Joe Biden truly supports the legality of medical procedures that some Christian conservatives believe to be murder. Rhetoric that describes in good faith our polity’s disputes will imply that our elections have life-or-death stakes — because they do. Political violence is not wrong because our conflicts aren’t profound. It’s wrong because it undermines democracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Biden’s most heated rhetoric about Trump is defensible</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no question that Joe Biden has denounced Trump in explosive terms. In late June, the president <a href=\"https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1806745000971296833\">posted on</a> X, “Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation. He’s a threat to our freedom. He’s a threat to our democracy. He’s literally a threat to everything America stands for.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s last sentence here was arguably hyperbolic, but the president’s other claims are defensible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many Americans reasonably believe that people who are compelled to carry a pregnancy to term are not free. Through his Supreme Court appointments, Trump is personally responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court\">curtailment of reproductive rights</a> in many parts of the United States. Although he has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/trump-says-he-wouldnt-sign-federal-abortion-ban/index.html\">disavowed</a> all intentions of further restricting abortion at the federal level, he is nevertheless <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/4/8/24124454/trump-abortion-policy-video-truth-social\">closely aligned</a> with a movement that aims to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has also promised to carry out “<a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform\">the largest deportation operation in American history</a>.” This policy would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html\">reportedly involve</a> rounding up longtime US residents, confining them to detention camps, and then deporting them. Many undocumented immigrants were brought to the US as children and know no other home. It seems reasonable to say that Trump presents a threat to their freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That Trump poses a threat to democracy should go without saying. As president, he attempted to block the peaceful transfer of power by <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-demands-georgia-secretary-state-find-votes-hand/story?id=75027350\">manipulating vote counts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23513019/january-6-committee-report-trump-2020-election-insurrection\">instigating a riot on Capitol Hill</a>. He has also outlined <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/us/politics/trump-plans-2025.html\">plans for undermining</a> the independence of federal law enforcement while vowing to enact “<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-dark-retribution-pledge-center-2024-bid-make/story?id=108315702\">retribution</a>” on his movement’s enemies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is highly unlikely that a second Trump administration would lead to the death of American democracy, as our nation’s federated system of government makes establishing an authoritarian regime exceptionally difficult. But it’s reasonable to say that putting an insurrectionist back into the Oval Office — after he’s had four years to assemble <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/trump-loyalists-2024-presidential-election\">a cadre of loyalists</a> to staff the executive branch — would pose an intolerably high threat to US democracy, even if that threat is remote. Most of us would not engage in any activity that came with a 1 percent risk of death if we could help it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Heated rhetoric is an inextricable feature of democratic life</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My point here is not to say that Democrats’ incendiary rhetoric is always legitimate while Republicans’ is not. What matters is whether a given statement is plausibly true. We cannot honestly debate our nation’s core political disagreements without saying things that could inspire intense passion in partisans. Political passion is the kindling for political violence, but public officials must not compound the unavoidable hazards of democratic life by saying explosive things that are untrue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2018, Donald Trump suggested that Democrats were orchestrating an invasion of the United States by violent <a href=\"https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1009071403918864385?lang=en\">“illegal immigrants”</a> because they viewed such criminals as “potential voters.” Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz argued that the Jewish, Democratic megadonor George Soros might be paying immigrants to “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/repmattgaetz/status/1052629557826736129\">storm the US border @ election time</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shortly thereafter, a neo-Nazi who believed that Jews were orchestrating an invasion of the United States by violent Central American migrants — as part of a broader plan to render the white race incapable of reclaiming power in the US — murdered <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/what-we-know-about-robert-bowers-alleged-synagogue-shooter.html\">11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fundamental problem with Trump’s and Gaetz’s claims was not that they were liable to inspire violent malcontents to commit such atrocities. The problem was that they were spreading baseless conspiracy theories. If it were true that Democrats were orchestrating an invasion of the United States as part of a plan to enact mass voter fraud, Trump and Gaetz would be right to say so, even though this could provoke acts of violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it wasn’t true. Falsely claiming that your political opponents are trying to steal an election through mass voter fraud is wildly irresponsible; implying that conservative Americans should see immigrants as threats to their democratic freedom is something even worse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By contrast, if a Republican were to say that Biden posed a massive threat to human life as defined by conservative Christian theology, they would be telling the truth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do not believe that a fetus is a person, but many Americans subscribe to a worldview in which it is. There can be no simple, scientific truth about a question as philosophical as when human life begins. In a pluralistic democracy, conservative Christians must be allowed to articulate the implications of their theology, even if that means portraying Democratic supporters of abortion rights as would-be mass murderers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a democracy with polarized politics, many legitimate forms of advocacy will imply that preventing an adversarial politician from taking power is of life-or-death importance. In a country with more guns than people, such political speech presents genuine hazards. If we find those risks unacceptable, we should curtail gun ownership before we constrict honest debate.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

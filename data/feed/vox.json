With wind speeds pushing <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml\">180 miles per hour</a> Monday afternoon, before weakening slightly Tuesday, Milton is one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Forecasters expect Milton, which is once again a Category 5 storm as it churns in the Gulf of Mexico, to make landfall in western Florida<strong> </strong>on Wednesday night. The storm may lose steam before then as it faces disruptive winds and dry air, yet Milton is still expected to be an “extremely dangerous” hurricane upon arrival, <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/071735.shtml?\">according to</a> the National Hurricane Center. Storm surge in the densely populated Tampa Bay, which could see a direct hit, could reach <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml\">15 feet</a>, the Center said in an advisory Monday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Milton is not the typical Atlantic hurricane, according to <a href=\"https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/jonathan-lin\">Jonathan Lin</a>, an atmospheric scientist at Cornell University. “It is exceedingly rare for a hurricane to form in the western Gulf, track eastward, and make landfall on the Western coast of Florida,” he said in an email Monday. “There are not really any hurricanes on record that have done this and made landfall at a Category 3+ status.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s even more unusual is how quickly the storm intensified, defying forecasts and gaining more than 100 miles per hour in wind speed between Sunday morning and early Monday afternoon. Milton had “some of the most explosive intensification this forecaster has ever witnessed!” a National Weather Service forecaster <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSAtlanta/status/1843324138230014357\">wrote on X Monday</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why Milton intensified so quickly</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The simplest explanation is unusually warm ocean water.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take a look at the chart below. It’s showing ocean heat in the Gulf of Mexico, which is near a record high. The red line is 2024 and the blue line is the average over the last decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And heat is a key ingredient in rapid intensification, according to <a href=\"https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/\">Brian McNoldy</a>, a climatologist at the University of Miami, who made the chart below. Put simply, hotter water evaporates more readily, and rising columns of warm, moist air from that evaporation fuel rapid intensification.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/ohc_gulf-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.589156124409,100,74.821687751182\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A chart of ocean heat content in the Gulf of Mexico | Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/products.html&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/products.html&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not entirely clear what has caused the Gulf to warm, though scientists suspect a combination of factors, including climate change — which raises the baseline ocean temperature — as well as lingering effects of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23738846/el-nino-2023-weather-heat-wave-climate-change-disaster-flood-rain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">El Niño</a>, natural climate variability, and perhaps even a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/tonga-volcano-eruption-raises-imminent-risk-of-temporary-1-5c-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">volcanic eruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another key to Milton’s explosive growth is a lack of wind shear in its path, according to <a href=\"https://people.miami.edu/profile/be7abbba52c947423b8133238c7e7b68\">Benjamin Kirtman</a>, director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine &amp; Atmospheric Studies, a joint initiative of the University of Miami and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Wind shear describes the change of wind speed and direction —&nbsp;basically, chaotic air —&nbsp;and it can disrupt hurricanes. The storm is expected to encounter more shear as it approaches Florida, which will blunt its strength and make it likely to weaken before landfall.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, McNoldy said, is that Milton is also relatively small in width. As of Monday, Hurricane-force winds extended only about <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml\">30 miles</a> from the storm center. Small hurricanes are “generally more prone to ups and downs,” he told Vox, because they’re influenced more easily by weather phenomena.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although Milton is set to grow in size before it reaches Florida (in part, through a complex process of <a href=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane_blog/paper-on-the-unusual-eyewall-replacement-cycles-in-hurricane-irma-released-online-in-monthly-weather-review/#:~:text=As%20a%20hurricane%20grows%20older,eyewall%20replacement%20cycle%20(ERC).\">eyewall replacement</a>), it likely won’t be huge when it makes landfall &nbsp;—&nbsp;again, speaking in terms of diameter. “That is all-around good news,” he said. Smaller storms tend to produce less surge, which describes a rise in sea level. Compared to Hurricane Helene, which was an enormous system, for example, forecasters expect Milton to produce less storm surge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t mean experts like McNoldy, a Florida resident, aren’t worried. As of Monday, Milton appears to be headed straight for the Tampa Bay area, the most densely populated region of the state’s west coast. This is the same region where a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-storm-surge-0284042dade78e04e453ad821e6e15c3\">dozen people</a> were killed by Hurricane Helene in recent days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is a very ominous forecast,” McNoldy said. “It will still be an extremely strong hurricane.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 8, 5:50 pm ET:</strong> This story was originally published on October 7 and has been updated with new information about Hurricane Milton’s forecast.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Many of the residents in afflicted communities have never experienced a disaster like this before and are now navigating layers of government bureaucracy to get supplies, relief money, and to begin rebuilding. It’s creating frustration and confusion, leaving the door open to <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/blog/addressing-hurricane-helene-rumors-and-scams\">misinformation and scams</a> around the relief effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene is also creating a political problem as politicians look to blame each other for hiccups in the response and residents try to figure out who to hold accountable. A lot of attention has focused on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and its role in the disaster recovery. This week, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper met with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell and military officials to <a href=\"https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/07/governor-cooper-fema-administrator-criswell-meet-military-leaders-western-north-carolina\">discuss the recovery work underway</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These dynamics are already creating a lot of pressure, and it’s poised to get even more chaotic as Hurricane Milton, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/376323/hurricane-milton-category-5-tampa-florida\">spooled up to category 5 strength this week,</a> heads toward the Florida coast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just a matter of finger-pointing; knowing whether to press local, state, or federal officials is essential to getting help to the people who need it now, and learning from past disasters can soften the devastation from future catastrophes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Collectively, governments around the world are actually getting better at disaster response. We’ve seen over the past century that, in general, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23150467/natural-disaster-climate-change-early-warning-hurricane-wildfire\">natural disasters are killing fewer people</a>. However, the destructive potential of something like a hurricane is growing now that more people are living in their paths. Asheville, North Carolina, which experienced extensive flooding after Helene, experienced <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/04/03/asheville-is-2-in-the-country-for-highest-move-in-vs-move-out-ratio/73144952007/\">a big population spike in the past decade</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as average temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, extreme events like hurricanes spool up faster into monstrous storms and dish out more rainfall and drive more storm surge into coastal areas than they would otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that there are so many variables in natural disasters and the communities they afflict, how do you gauge whether your government is doing a good job against a force of nature? And when things go sideways, when should you blame your mayor, your governor, or your president? I posed these questions to <a href=\"https://ccie.ucf.edu/person/claire-connolly-knox/\">Claire Connolly Knox</a>, who founded the Emergency and Crisis Management program at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. She spoke to me from her home in Florida where she was making preparations for Milton’s arrival. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given how different every disaster is, it&#8217;s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison between them. It also seems like expectations are all over the place of who should be responding to what after a disaster. What do you make of the responses to some of the recent disasters we&#8217;ve seen? I&#8217;m thinking specifically about North Carolina after Helene. What do you think is worth highlighting?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a number of things. This is going to be one for the record books. One is that it highlights that so much of the conversation focuses on disasters, hurricanes specifically, and the immediately impacted area. Everyone was really concerned about Florida and the Big Bend and Tallahassee, and rightly so, because everyone primarily looks at where the eye of the storm is going and then looking at those initial brunt forces and the impacts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think what this hurricane is teaching us is that there’s so much more to hurricanes that we sometimes forget: That&#8217;s the rain. That&#8217;s the storm surge. That is the spin-off tornadoes. Those cascading impacts we frequently do not focus on. With the Helene system going into North Carolina, the amount of rain that fell is very reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/360921/hurricane-beryl-houston-blackout-centerpoint-outage\">Hurricane Harvey</a> with the amount of devastation and the flooding that took place.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">North Carolina is a place that’s infrequently hit by hurricanes. I would expect Florida to have a lot of resources ready but maybe it’s excusable that North Carolina was caught a little bit off guard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How would you evaluate their response? Are they graded on a curve when it comes to a disaster like this? And should FEMA have seen this coming and done more?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every disaster starts and ends locally, so every disaster response starts at the local level, and it ends at the local level. A lot of people don’t realize that. They think immediately of FEMA. FEMA has the purse strings, they help pay for a lot of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the response is local. It goes to the state if locals can&#8217;t handle it. The state then does an emergency declaration to release additional funds. If it’s going to be more than they can handle, they go to their FEMA region. That then goes up to FEMA national, and then to the president for an emergency declaration or disaster declaration depending on which is needed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every state adheres to the same standards set forth by FEMA to have a comprehensive emergency management plan to train their local emergency managers to have the capacity to respond to a disaster.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Every disaster response starts at the local level, and it ends at the local level. A lot of people don’t realize that.”</p><cite>Claire Connolly Knox</cite></blockquote></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So you start local, and then if you need more resources, you go to the state, and then you go to your local FEMA administrator, then you go to the federal government for an emergency declaration. Is that typically how you escalate?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, that is in the statute of the <a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/consumer/insurance/the-stafford-act-explained.html\">Stafford Act</a>, the process that disaster assistance goes through. In addition to that more formal setup, you also have mutual aid agreements between local governments, between states. For example, when Hurricane Katrina happened, you had emergency management staff and first responders from other states poised and ready to enter the impacted area. You&#8217;ve seen that happening [in North Carolina], not only amongst the public sector, but also the private and nonprofit sectors. Emergency management is all about facilitating and being able to bring together everyone who can help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is this process necessarily reactive, or is there a way that you can be proactive?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both. However, you’re seeing more proactive responses. That&#8217;s really a big lesson learned from Hurricane Katrina. You saw <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/archive/person/w-craig-fugate\">Craig Fugate</a>, the FEMA administrator during Superstorm Sandy, preemptively set up stuff, and he actually got criticized for that, but that has now become more of the norm, trying to be as prepared and to preemptively set up resources so that they could quickly enter and reduce the amount of lives lost.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What was the criticism for being preemptive there?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea was they were setting up resources in advance, and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bushs-former-fema-head-criticizes-obamas-response-to-sandy/\">some people said that was not the role of the federal government</a>. Some said it was a waste of resources. However, on the flip side, you also had <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-katrina-anniversary/heck-job-brownie-where-disgraced-fema-head-now-n400436\">former FEMA administrator Michael Brown</a> who was heavily criticized during Hurricane Katrina for not being responsive. There are critics on both sides of the fence.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the federal government is already getting involved at the front end, then is it in charge of the disaster response at that point? Or how does the hierarchy of responsibility work?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s all local. So it’s your city, county, and your state who are the leaders when it comes to a major disaster. FEMA has to be invited in. They’re not siloed though. If you look at a local city or county, their emergency operations center has seats for all of the different sectors: communications, transportation, utilities, law enforcement, fire, health. You’re going to have someone, a representative from the federal government, either virtually or someone in the room, as well. Each of FEMA’s regions has staff that could be deployed to assist those local governments.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When a disaster strikes, how do you evaluate the response? Is there a metric? How do I know what was reasonable for emergency managers to do? How do I know if they dropped the ball?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s where my research comes in. I study <a href=\"https://emilms.fema.gov/is_0552/groups/114.html\">after-action reports</a>, or things that went well and things that did not go well during a disaster. They frequently include an implementation plan, so taking those lessons learned, who is the lead to implement this lesson, if there’s any funding needed, and a timeline of when to expect that particular lesson to be implemented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, an after-action report is not required after every disaster. What I have found is that in areas that tend to be heavily destroyed — looking at Asheville, North Carolina — I would not anticipate an after-action report coming from them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a lower priority?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It tends to be. For example, after Hurricane Charlie, I reached out to local governments over in Tampa and Florida&#8217;s Gulf Coast. Their immediate response was “I’m not going to sit down and write a report. I need to be helping people.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you have a major disaster like this, FEMA does an after-action report, your state government does an after-action report. A lot of the lessons learned will be captured in those reports and those documents after the fact. That tends to be one of the ways in which you measure the effectiveness of response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve seen over time where a lot of those lessons learned that have been documented make their way into local, state, and federal policy. After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, there was the <a href=\"https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FCJEI/Programs/SLP/Documents/Full-Text/Williams.aspx\">Lewis report</a> with 94 recommendations that changed our building codes, how we do land use planning,&nbsp; emergency management. We’ve seen that happen after Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, after Harvey, Irma, Maria, etc. After all these major disasters, about a year or two later major policy changes come out.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How are we doing in disaster response in general in the US? Is it improving over time? Are we seeing any patterns? Are there places we still keep getting tripped up over and over?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I really love that you asked this question. We’re really good at identifying the lessons learned. We’re really good at saying what went well and what did not go well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, we’re not really good at implementing those lessons learned, and we’re really not good at evaluating whether we’ve actually implemented them. And usually the test is the next disaster. It tests whether we’ve actually done what we’ve said we&#8217;re going to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Who then is to blame, or who gets credit, during a disaster response? Is there somebody that we can hold accountable in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a very, very hard question to answer. I say it depends. I think a lot of people don&#8217;t realize emergency management touches on every aspect of our life and our society, and so it makes it really hard to answer that question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Making decisions during a crisis is not easy. You have incomplete information. You are trying your best to be able to make decisions very quickly, very rapidly, while dealing with misinformation or incomplete information. I think you’re asking a very important question, but it’s very hard to answer.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re also in an era where average temperatures are rising, and then many types of disasters are reaching greater extremes, and that more people are experiencing hazards that they may not have experienced before. People have pointed out that <a href=\"https://www.ashevillenc.gov/news/100-years-after-the-flood-of-1916-the-city-of-asheville-is-ready-for-the-next-one/\">North Carolina did flood like this back in 1916</a>, but it’s a completely different world now. How do you prepare for the future when that risk profile just looks so drastically different?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are lots of free resources and data and models available through FEMA, through NOAA, through the National Hurricane Center to help with planning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To cope with future disasters, we have to think more holistically. In emergency management, we teach and we practice “<a href=\"https://www.iafc.org/membership/iCHIEFS/iCHIEFS-article/a-whole-community-approach-to-all-hazards-planning\">all hazards, whole community</a>.” It is a networked approach to responding to a disaster, not just the public sector. You have the private sector and nonprofit sector that are engaged in the response efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of it is to be aware there are so many local jurisdictions that can only think about emergency management and disasters when it&#8217;s on their doorstep. For a mayor, I would have them find out if they know who their emergency manager is. Is it someone who is a police chief or fire chief who happens to wear the emergency management hat only when there&#8217;s a disaster? Unfortunately, in a lot of our small rural communities, there is not a single dedicated emergency manager. It&#8217;s someone who was also wearing two or three other hats. It would help to have a dedicated person networking, setting up mutual aid agreements, doing all those things that get activated when there&#8217;s an actual disaster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Umair Irfan</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Are there any interesting case studies here worth highlighting, or aspects of a disaster response we tend to overlook?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Claire Connolly Knox</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would look at Florida’s response to Hurricane Maria. A lot of communities may prepare for a disaster themselves, but they don&#8217;t prepare a response for their neighbors getting a disaster. Being able to be a receiving community for evacuees, being able to deploy resources to your neighboring community is critical. When you look at the individuals evacuated from Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria in 2017 here in central Florida, you had these resource centers that are now known as the national standard of how do you take care of that neighboring community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s very important because, especially with climate change, we’re already seeing a shift of the population. Central Florida is the receiving community for all these coastal communities. As our coastlines change, as sea level rise increases and our vulnerability increases in these coastal zones, the interior communities need to be ready to receive them, and if they don&#8217;t do it well, that could potentially be a disaster within a disaster.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Americans will be casting their votes in a historic presidential race, as well as a slew of other federal, state, and local offices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before Americans cast their ballot, there are a few bits of practical information they should have on hand:<strong> </strong>They’ll want to make sure they’re registered to vote, know where their polling place is, and what forms of identification to bring with them (if any). Here’s what you should know about voting in this election.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are you registered to vote?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You must be registered to vote before stepping into the voting booth. (<a href=\"https://vote.gov/register/nd/\">Except in North Dakota</a>, which does not have voter registration.) Some states, like California, Washington, Michigan, and Maine, allow <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\">same-day registration</a> at the polls on Election Day. Other states require <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/\">voters to register</a> anywhere from 10 days (Massachusetts) to 30 days (Alaska, Arkansas, Mississippi, Ohio) ahead of the election. The <a href=\"https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/state-elections/state-election-dates-deadlines.htm\">US Vote Foundation</a> has a tool that lists election deadlines, including for voter registration, by state. Depending on where you live, you can register online, in person at a local election office, or by mail. Vote.gov has state-by-state resources on <a href=\"https://vote.gov/\">how to register to vote</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote\">In order to register to vote</a>, you must be a US citizen, at least 18 years old by Election Day, and meet your state’s eligibility requirements. In some states, people <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/voting/file/1507306/downloadhttps://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-01/voting_with_a_criminal_conviction_7.6.23.pdf\">currently incarcerated or convicted for a felony</a> do not have the right to vote. The <a href=\"https://www.usvotefoundation.org/state-voter-information\"><strong>US Vote Foundation</strong></a> has an online tool that lists voter requirements and registration options for each state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you can’t remember whether you’re registered to vote, <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/\">you can check online</a>. For people who moved, or changed their name or party affiliation, since the last election, you’ll need to <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/change-voter-registration\">update your voter registration</a>. You can change this information online via your state’s online voter registration website, by mail, by phone, or in person the same way you would to register. If you moved to another state, you will need to re-register in your new state.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Do you know how you’ll cast your vote?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How much flexibility you have about when and where you vote depends on where you live. Voters can cast their ballots in person on Election Day, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx\">in person during early voting</a>, or by mail (also referred to as voting absentee). Some states — like California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-1-states-with-no-excuse-absentee-voting.aspx\">do not require voters to list a reason to vote by mail</a>. Voters in states like Alabama and Kentucky <a href=\"https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/issues/requesting-mail-ballots\">must give a reason to vote by mail</a>, like being too sick to vote or not being in the country. Be aware of both the deadlines for requesting a mail ballot and for postmarking it in order to be counted; you can find both dates by selecting your state on the <a href=\"https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/state-elections/state-election-dates-deadlines.htm\">US Vote Foundation’s tool</a>. Either mail your ballot in via USPS, drop it off at an election office, or locate a dropbox (each county will list the locations of its ballot drop boxes online).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you are traveling or have to work a long shift on Election Day, you may want to vote early in person. <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/\">Early voting windows</a> vary from state to state (and even county to county) and can begin as early as 45 days before the election&nbsp; like in <a href=\"https://sos.vermont.gov/elections/voters/early-absentee-voting/\">Vermont</a>). Check to see your <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx\">state’s rules for early in-person voting</a> and where you can cast your vote before Election Day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For in-person voting on Election Day, you can find your polling place on your state’s board of elections website, which you can <a href=\"https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/\">find on Vote.org</a>. All you’ll need is to enter your name and/or address. Most states have laws allowing employees to take time off to vote, but <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/taking-time-off-voting-jury-29708.html\">specifics vary from state to state</a>. For example, workers in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Wisconsin are not paid for time off to vote. Other states, including Idaho, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, and Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/us-states-where-employers-have-to-give-you-paid-time-off-to-vote.html\">do not have laws granting employees time off to vote</a>. Workers in states like Maryland and Oklahoma <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/taking-time-off-voting-jury-29708.html\">must show their employers proof</a> that they voted or attempted to vote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A final method of voting is via a <a href=\"https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/provisional-ballots\">provisional ballot</a>. This occurs when a voter’s name is not on the voter roll but the person believes they are registered. They can cast their vote on a provisional ballot that won’t be counted until the registration status of the person is confirmed after the polls close. <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/provisional-ballots.aspx#how\">Local election officials will verify the voter’s identity</a> and the voter may have to confirm their address or other information. The <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/provisional-ballots#how\">main reasons provisional ballots are rejected</a> are when the voter is not registered in the state they are trying to vote in, or they are in the wrong jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Do you know who’s on the ballot?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Top billing for this election is voting for president. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/367990/kamala-harris-policy-positions-issues-guide\">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> is the Democratic candidate, and former President <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/368004/donald-trump-policy-positions-issues-guide\">Donald Trump</a> is the Republican nominee. You may also be voting for governor, Senate, and House of Representatives, as well as lieutenant governor, state attorney general, secretary of state, state legislators, judges, mayor, district attorney, city council, and ballot measures. You can look up a sample ballot on <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Sample_Ballot_Lookup&amp;Source=sidebar\">Ballotpedia</a> to find out which candidates are running for which seats in your district. Ballotpedia also explains the wording and interpretation of ballot measures, which can be difficult to parse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To find out where these candidates stand on important issues, you can check their campaign websites, read local news coverage, and tune in to debates.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to expect on Election Day</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before you show up to your polling place, double check the <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_(2024)\">hours the site opens and closes.</a> While it differs by state (and even by county), most polling stations open between 6 and 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm local time. Remember, if you are still in line when the polls close, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">you are allowed to vote, so don’t leave</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once inside, you’ll check in with a poll worker who will find your name on the list of registered voters. If the poll worker says they <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">can’t find your name</a>, ask if they can check a statewide list or help you make sure you’re at the correct polling place. If they still can’t find your name, ask for a provisional ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some states require voters to <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id\">show identification prior to voting</a> — like Indiana and Wisconsin — or ask that first-time voters show ID. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists the <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx\">voter ID laws for each state</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The poll worker will then show you to the <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Voting_methods_and_equipment_by_state\">voting machine or where you’ll fill out a paper ballot</a> and tell you how to cast your vote. <a href=\"https://allvotingislocal.org/poll-worker-faq/\">Poll workers are available to answer any questions</a> you may have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">Voters with disabilities</a> can ask for a chair to sit in, a quiet place to wait for their turn to vote, and to use a voting machine that assists those with vision and mobility disabilities — every polling place must have at least one. Voters with disabilities and who have trouble reading and writing English can also bring a family member or friend to offer assistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If anyone questions you about your citizenship, your criminal history, your ethnicity, your race, the language you speak, or your education level, that’s voter intimidation — and it’s illegal. <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Intimidation_of_voters\">Other examples of voter intimidation </a>include violent behavior inside and outside the polling place, blocking the entrance of a polling place, displaying weapons, threats of violence, and spreading false information of voter fraud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_pdf_file/kyr-voterintimidation-v03.pdf\">According to the ACLU</a>, “if your qualifications are challenged, you can give a sworn statement that you satisfy the qualifications to vote in your state, and then proceed to cast a regular ballot.”<br><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">Report an instance of voter intimidation</a>, whether you yourself experienced it or you witnessed it, to your local election officials and the Election Protection Hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE or 1-888-VE-Y-VOTA (en Español).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, October 8, 3:05 pm: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on September 20, 2022, and has been updated to include new information regarding the 2024 election season.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Court’s landmark Second Amendment decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf\"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a> (2022) requires courts to strike down any gun law that is not “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation,” a test so confusing that more than a dozen judges have published judicial opinions <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen\">begging the justices to explain what, exactly, <em>Bruen </em>means</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, while this Court’s approach to guns is frequently hostile to gun laws, a majority of the justices appeared to meet a gun regulation on Tuesday they are actually willing to uphold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tuesday morning’s oral argument in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/garland-v-vanderstok-2/\"><em>Garland v. VanDerStok</em></a> involves “ghost guns,” ready-to-assemble kits that can easily be used to build a fully operational firearm. These kits appear to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/372162/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok\">exist to evade two federal laws</a>, one of which requires guns to have serial numbers that can be used to track them if they are used in a crime, and the other which requires gun buyers to receive a background check before they can make that purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921\">federal law</a>, the background check and serial number requirements apply to “any weapon &#8230; which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.” They also apply to “the frame or receiver of any such weapon,” the skeletal part of a gun that houses other components, such as the barrel or firing mechanism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ghost gun kits seek to evade this law by selling a kit with an incomplete frame or receiver, though it is often <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/372162/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok\">trivially easy to convert this incomplete part into a fully operational one</a>. Some kits can be turned into a working gun after the buyer drills a single hole in the frame or receiver. Others require the user to sand off a single plastic rail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment\">most right-wing appeals court in the federal system</a>, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, concluded that a single missing hole is enough to exempt a gun from regulation. Frames missing a hole, that court claimed, are “not yet frames or receivers.” The Fifth Circuit also argued that ghost gun kits cannot “readily be converted” into a working gun because this phrase “cannot be read to include any objects that could, if manufacture is completed, become functional at some ill-defined point in the future” — even though some ghost gun kits can be converted into a firearm in a matter of minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, at least five members of the Court — and possibly one or two more — appeared to reject the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning on Tuesday. All three members of the Court’s Democratic minority seemed like clear votes for the government, which is arguing ghost guns need to be subject to the same rules as any other gun, as did Chief Justice John Roberts, who barely spoke during Tuesday’s argument, and who spent the bulk of his question time seeming to mock Peter Patterson, the lawyer for the ghost gun manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, seemed particularly unconvinced by Patterson’s arguments, at one point telling him that a key part of his proposed legal framework “seems a little made up.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If these five justices hang together against ghost guns, that won’t be a particularly unexpected plot twist. This same case already reached the Court in 2023 on the justices’ “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other issues that the Court deals with on an expedited basis. The first time <em>VanDerStok</em> reached the Court, it voted 5-4 (with Roberts and Barrett joining the Democrats) to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/8/8/23824635/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok-amy-coney-barrett-shadow-docket\">temporarily leave in place a federal rule</a> establishing that ghost guns are regulated like any other firearm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the question is whether that temporary decision will be made permanent. After Tuesday, it appears likely that it will.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>VanDerStok</em> turns on Barrett’s definition of an “omelet”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tuesday’s argument started to go off the rails for the ghost gun makers before Patterson even stepped up to the podium.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Early in the argument, while Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar was making the government’s case, Justice Samuel Alito asked her a series of hypotheticals about incomplete objects. Is a pen and a blank pad of paper a “grocery list?” Does a bunch of uncooked eggs, ham, and peppers constitute an “omelet?” Alito’s point appeared to be that, just like untouched ingredients don’t constitute an “omelet,” an incomplete firearm is not a gun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Barrett seemed unconvinced. Almost immediately after Alito finished grilling Prelogar, Barrett asked about a slightly different hypothetical. What if someone purchased an omelet kit from <a href=\"https://www.hellofresh.com/\">Hello Fresh</a>, a service that delivers ready-to-cook meal kits to people’s homes. Barrett’s point was pretty clear: While a bunch of uncooked ingredients may not always constitute an “omelet,” the answer is different when someone buys a kit whose sole purpose is to be put together into an omelet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same rule, Barrett suggested, should apply to ghost gun kits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roberts, meanwhile, was more direct than Barrett. “What is the purpose of selling a receiver without the holes drilled in it?” the Chief Justice asked Patterson. In response, Patterson claimed, somewhat implausibly, that people may buy a ghost gun kit because they enjoy the experience of building a gun much like some hobbyists enjoy working on their own car.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Roberts didn’t buy this argument at all. “Drilling a hole or two,” he dryly responded to Patterson, “I would think doesn’t give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekend.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later in the argument, after Prelogar was back at the podium, she stuck the knife in Patterson’s argument. Federal law, she noted, doesn’t ban ghost gun kits, it merely requires ghost gun sellers to follow the same background check and serial number laws as any other gun seller. So, if there were a market for law-abiding hobbyists who want to drill a couple holes before they fire their gun, those hobbyists could still get a ghost gun if they submitted to a background check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what actually happened is, once the government issued a rule stating that ghost guns are subject to the same laws as any other gun, the market for this product dried up. Turns out, hobbyists weren’t interested in buying almost-complete guns with missing holes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest wild card in the case is Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who revealed that he voted in favor of ghost guns in 2023 because he was concerned that a gun seller who was ignorant of the law might accidentally sell an unregulated kit without realizing it was illegal to do so and then be charged with a crime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, as Prelogar told Kavanaugh, a gun seller can only be charged with a crime if they “willfully” sell a gun without a serial number or if they knowingly sell a gun without a background check. So Kavanaugh’s fears appear unfounded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Will that be enough to bring Kavanaugh into the government’s camp? Unclear. But, ultimately, Kavanaugh is likely to be the sixth vote against ghost guns if he does flip. After Tuesday, it does seem like there are five solid votes for the proposition that ghost guns are subject to the same laws as any other firearm.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

By <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(21)00474-7\">some estimates</a>, the live area of coral globally has declined by half since the 1950s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the situation would almost certainly be worse if it weren’t for parrotfish.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-9130.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-1443.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">A stoplight (left) and queen (right) parrotfish on a coral reef in Bonaire. There are dozens of parrotfish species worldwide.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Parrotfish are essentially janitors who are very good at their jobs. While cruising around the reef, these animals — which live in oceans&nbsp;all over the world — scrape colonies of bacteria and algae off rocks using their beaks. If left unchecked, that algae can grow out of control, smothering reefs and preventing new corals from growing. And that makes it hard for reefs to recover after a bout of, say, extreme ocean warming kills off a bunch of coral.&nbsp;So where you find hungry parrotfish, coral has more room to grow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem is that, on many reefs, the number of parrotfish — and especially large ones in the Caribbean — has plummeted. Other algae grazers like sea urchins, meanwhile, have vanished, too. Some scientists say that’s why Caribbean reefs have failed to recover following climate-related impacts like bleaching and superstorms; there’s simply too much algae for coral to regrow.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-4893.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A small queen parrotfish cruises over the crest of a reef in Bonaire.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the flip side, these dynamics offer a bit of hope for an ecosystem that seems all but doomed: By protecting parrotfish, alongside efforts to rein in climate-warming emissions, countries might have a better shot at saving reefs.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reefs are turning green</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s one thing people know about coral reefs it’s that they’re colorful — an intricate mosaic of blues, reds, pinks, and oranges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But more and more, just one color is starting to dominate: green.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-4727-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Dead and dying coral covered with algae.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In step with the decline of coral is the rise of algae, or seaweed. When corals die, this green, plant-like organism grows quickly on top of their skeletons. And as it spreads, that seaweed can prevent corals from regrowing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Baby corals, which start their lives swimming in the ocean, need a bit of bare rock to grow on and harden into adults. When the seafloor is covered in algae, larval coral has nowhere to develop. Seaweed can also release chemicals that harm coral and, when it grows abundantly, shade out reefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The biggest enemy of corals is really seaweed,” said <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/contributors/nancy-knowlton\">Nancy Knowlton</a>, a marine scientist and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Citizens-Sea-Wondrous-Creatures-Census/dp/1426206437?ref_=ast_author_mpb\">author</a>, formerly with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. “It goes without saying that reefs will recover better if they don&#8217;t have to deal with lots of seaweed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://gcrmn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GCRMN_Souter_et_al_2021_Status_of_Coral_Reefs_of_the_World_2020_V1.pdf\">Research shows</a> that in the last 50 years or so, algae has proliferated in coral reefs worldwide, and especially in the Caribbean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Algae thrives on human waste, such as sewage, and runoff from farmland. This water pollution is full of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that algae need to grow. So as it runs into the ocean, algae booms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, one of the most voracious algae-eaters, the long-spined black sea urchin, began dying in the Caribbean in the 1980s, likely from a waterborne pathogen. Caribbean reefs lost, on average, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/marine/8/1/annurev-marine-122414-033857.pdf?expires=1727879230&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=2DB6DBB6E4DADFC68FD0EF5871149AC4\">more than 90 percent</a> of their urchins in a matter of weeks, and those populations have yet to recover.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-1433.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"A parrotfish with its mouth against a rock.\" title=\"A parrotfish with its mouth against a rock.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Parrotfish teeth are fused together and form a beak-like mouth.

In some parts of the Caribbean, parrotfish may be the only thing standing between a relatively healthy reef and one shrouded in green noxious gunk.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Parrotfish to the rescue</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The life of a parrotfish mostly consists of munching on rocks and dead corals, grinding it into sand, and releasing it through their rear ends. Some of the world’s beaches are <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sand.html#:~:text=The%20famous%20white%2Dsand%20beaches,then%20excrete%20it%20as%20sand.\">largely made of parrotfish poop</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not totally clear what parrotfish are actually eating. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-023-02404-5\">Research suggests</a> that their main source of food is colonies of bacteria including cyanobacteria and other microbes that live on rock surfaces, often alongside more visible clumps of seaweed. Parrotfish likely don’t seek out the seaweed itself — the stuff known to be harmful to coral growth and recovery. But when they’re grazing on microbes, they still end up removing it from rock surfaces, according to Andrew Shantz, who studies parrotfish at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-1499.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An adult queen parrotfish.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Irrespective of what they&#8217;re targeting, they end up removing algae from the reef,” Shantz told Vox. “That gives room for corals to come in and settle or grow and occupy that space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s kind of like how you might weed a garden before planting seeds to give your seedings room to develop.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was produced in collaboration with the Pulitzer Center</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the third story in an ongoing series on the future of coral reefs as they face threats from climate change and disease.

The study relied on reef sediment cores: tubes of material extracted from the seafloor that contain layers of coral, sea shells, and animal remains. Those cores allowed researchers to see how fast the reef was growing and —&nbsp;by looking at the number and shape of teeth — how many parrotfish were on the reef.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-4752.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Danielle de Kool, an ecologist for an environmental group in Bonaire, surveys the reef.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Studies like this support the simple idea that parrotfish help coral reefs, yet the relationship between fish and coral is complex and somewhat controversial in marine biology. Smaller parrotfish, for example, don’t seem to limit the amount of seaweed, even if there are a lot of them. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justin-Rizzari/publication/281378099_The_parrotfish-coral_relationship_refuting_the_ubiquity_of_a_prevailing_paradigm/links/603efe7c299bf1e078512fd2/The-parrotfish-coral-relationship-refuting-the-ubiquity-of-a-prevailing-paradigm.pdf\">Some studies</a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-015-2728-3\"> have also</a> failed to find links between fishing restrictions — which typically lead to <em>more</em> parrotfish — and the amount of algae and live coral. Parrotfish also snack on live coral to an extent, though scientists don’t suspect this causes much damage to reefs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The effect of parrotfish on reef dynamics is not always clear,” said Joshua Manning, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies parrotfish. “It’s still safe to say that parrotfish are good for the reef.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What a reef full of parrotfish looks like</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People have been eating parrotfish for centuries in the tropics, and it’s <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e52092a6-3ced-40cb-b965-48e0993f4cdc/content\">still common today</a> in many coastal communities throughout the world. (They taste like sweet shellfish, according to a quick Google search). While global population data is sparse, it’s clear that overfishing has caused parrotfish —&nbsp;and especially large parrotfish, which are favored by fishermen —&nbsp;to decline in some of these regions, like <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/fish/despair-repair-protecting-parrotfish-can-help-bring-back-caribbean-coral-reefs\">Jamaica</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-022-02315-x\">Micronesia</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These declines have almost certainly contributed to the rise of algae.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are also places that have protected parrotfish for decades, where these animals are still abundant and apparently doing their job well. The Dutch island of Bonaire, for example, has banned spearfishing — a common method for catching parrotfish —&nbsp;since the early 1970s. The island, which is just east of Curacao in the south Caribbean, also outlawed the harvest of parrotfish altogether in 2010. While some of Bonaire’s large parrotfish have still declined, it has at least double the number of parrotfish compared to most other Caribbean reefs, <a href=\"https://www.dcnanature.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BioNews-StatusOfTheReefs.pdf\">according to</a> a 2018 report by the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance, a nonprofit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-0951.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-7235.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Scenes underwater in Bonaire, home to what some scientists consider the healthiest coral reef in the Caribbean.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All those parrotfish help limit the growth of algae on Bonaire’s reef, according to <a href=\"https://umaine.edu/marine/people/robert-steneck/\">Robert Steneck</a>, professor emeritus at the University of Maine, who’s been studying Bonaire’s reef for more than 20 years. That in turn has helped the coral here survive, he said. Indeed, while much of the Caribbean’s coral has died off in recent decades from bleaching and disease, the reef in Bonaire is still intact; parts of it are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/366763/bonaire-coral-reef-caribbean-climate-change\">still thriving</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, Bonaire’s reef has been able to bounce back from large-scale die-offs in the past, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00265/full\">according to</a> Steneck’s research. Parrotfish essentially make this ecosystem more resilient, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reality is more complicated. There are a number of reasons, beyond the abundance of parrotfish, why Bonaire’s reef is healthier than other parts of the Caribbean. The island lies below the path of most Atlantic hurricanes, for example.&nbsp;Bonaire’s coral is also not nearly as healthy as it once was. Bleaching has been harming the reef for years. And in the spring of 2023, a wildlife disease <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/368728/disease-coral-reefs-caribbean-bonaire-solution\">started sweeping through</a> and killing off hundreds of corals, some of which were centuries old. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Against these mounting threats, parrotfish can do very little. When coral die-offs are unrelenting and pollution continues to flow into the ocean, reefs get overcome by seaweed. Once that happens, parrotfish can’t do much to bring them back to life, Manning said. “At some point, with the intensity and frequency of these disturbances, the parrotfish grazing is not going to be able to keep pace,” he said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/adler_final-5771.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The author, Benji Jones, swims over a field of staghorn coral in Bonaire.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, reefs are still better off with more of them. Saving coral reefs depends, above all, on policies and corporate efforts to slash carbon emissions, but that doesn’t mean effective fishing regulations don’t also help.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What parrotfish reveal is that individual components of an ecosystem matter.  Take one piece out and the system starts to fail. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We need to protect them, even if only to give reefs a chance,” Manning said. “As long as we have parrotfish, we might have a chance at least prolonging the potential for reefs to come back.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Forest Service-managed portions of the Appalachian Trail that were damaged by Hurricane Helene will likely be repaired by temporary workers. (Hikers are currently advised to stay off over <a href=\"https://appalachiantrail.org/news/hurricane-helenes-impacts-on-the-appalachian-trail-and-nearby-communities/\">800</a> miles of the Appalachian Trail.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Next summer, however, most of these tasks will be performed by other staff — or not done at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Due to a looming budget cut, the agency will not be hiring seasonal staff for the next fiscal year, leaving thousands of people out of work and putting essential conservation and biodiversity work at risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/09/25/congress-passes-funding-bill-avoids-government-shutdown/\">spending bill recently passed</a> by the House <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/september-2024-chiefs-all-employee-call-hiring-update\">gave the agency</a><strong> </strong>around half a billion dollars less than it requested, meaning that the Forest Service, within the Department of Agriculture, faces a large budget cut. Most other environmental and science-based federal agencies also face large cuts. Meanwhile, the money the agency received from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change\">the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, the Biden administration’s signature climate law, has already been spent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this, combined with recent cost-of-living increases for staff, means the agency is feeling strapped for cash. The next year “will not likely be a very robust budget environment,” said Forest Service Budget Director Mark Lichtenstein during <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/september-2024-chiefs-all-employee-call-hiring-update\">an all-staff call in mid-September</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This decision does not apply to the more than 11,000 temporary firefighting positions that the Forest Service hires every year. An agency spokesperson said the Forest Service hired more than 2,500 non-fire temporary employees in fiscal year 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the all-staff call, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore acknowledged that the agency will be forced to struggle without its seasonal workforce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I know that this decision will affect your ability to get some of the critical work done,” he said. “It’ll also be felt deeply by managers and units all across the agency.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the days before the call, news of the hiring freeze spread rapidly through the ranks of temporary seasonal employees. Some heard about it directly from their supervisors. Others found out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/1ffgayw/r6_temp_and_pse_fy25_info/\">on Reddit</a>, where a letter announcing the hiring freeze from the Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest region had been posted. Temporary workers who feared for their futures filled the comment sections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I was really banking on (seasonal work next summer),” said one temporary employee in an interview, asking that her name not be used, since she is still employed by the agency. “I was also banking on seasonal winter Forest Service positions to get me through the off season, and all of a sudden, all of that was completely nixed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Temporary employees often face this sort of precarity, piecing together work for the winter when they lose their jobs and health care benefits and then returning to seasonal work for the summer. In many cases, they depend on the agency not only for paychecks, but for housing, living in buildings owned or subsidized by the Forest Service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The budget cut’s impact on hiring extends beyond seasonal workers. The agency also announced that, with very few exceptions, it won’t be hiring external candidates for any position within the agency, meaning that open positions will have to be filled by current employees. And since seasonal work is a common stepping stone to a permanent role, many temporary workers who hoped for a career in public land management now find themselves at a loss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">News of the hiring freeze left longtime seasonal and permanent workers shocked and angry. In a recording of a mid-September staff meeting shared by an employee and reviewed by Vox and High Country News<em>,</em> staff at the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southern Washington stressed the importance of seasonal labor. One man, who identified himself as Trevor, said his “entire program” relies on a “large seasonal crew” and wondered how he would be able to do his job in the future. Another employee referenced years of insufficient funding from Congress that have diminished agency morale. She added the loss of temporary workers would have “agency-wide” negative impacts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We cannot operate without our seasonal staff,” she said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/52941146468_954f2c0ba4_k.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723395278369,100,78.553209443262\" alt=\"A worker uses a drip canister to light a controlled fire on a hillside surrounded by trees.\" title=\"A worker uses a drip canister to light a controlled fire on a hillside surrounded by trees.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An employee uses a drip canister to light a prescribed fire. Seasonal workers take on important reforestation and wildfire risk mitigation efforts conducted by the US Forest Service.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Seasonal workers symbolize the backbone of the </strong>Forest Service’s labor force</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They might be “temporary” in name, but the Forest Service’s seasonal employees are a vital source of institutional and local ecological knowledge for the agency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many return season after season, often to the same forests, despite the low pay — often around $15/hour for an entry-level position. Several workers interviewed for this story said they stay on in hopes of snagging a permanent role. These workers are especially vital for field operations, said Jamie Tommins, who worked for several years as a trails and wilderness lead for offices in Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Washington.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It takes most people many years of seasonal work to land a permanent job, and those higher-grade seasonals are where you find all the most knowledgeable field workers,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Permanent employees may be as highly trained, probably from being seasonals themselves first,” Tommins said, “but they’re usually busy under their own administrative load and aren’t always available to get out in the field or train the newer folks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From building and maintaining trails to planting trees and removing dangerously flammable invasive species like cheatgrass, seasonal employees shoulder much of the work of maintaining the national forests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I just can’t fathom all the skill and know-how the Forest Service is about to lose,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practice, temporary employees often wind up doing work far above their pay grade. James Bardo, a biological science technician who works with plants, said this summer in Oregon’s Fremont-Winema National Forest, due to understaffing, he found himself doing rare plant work that would be better suited to an agency botanist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’d never been to southern Oregon,” he said. “I never worked in southern Oregon or anywhere near there. And I was the authority for taxonomy there, and it was just like, I really shouldn&#8217;t be.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bardo worries what cutbacks to the agency’s already paper-thin workforce will mean for important ecological work like preserving threatened species.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It can be problematic when you&#8217;re going to be working in the forest, cutting down trees,” he said. “Do you know that this rare plant species is actually there? Or is it easily confused with something else? … It&#8217;s very concerning as a conservation botanist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Next summer, this loss of expertise will be felt in countless ways. During the all-staff call, Moore said the agency would scale back services rather than demand more of its reduced workforce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We just can’t get the same amount of work done with fewer employees,” he said. “So, in other words, we’re going to do what we can with what we have. We’re not going to try to do everything that’s expected of us with less people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are some tasks that can’t be set aside easily. A temporary employee, who asked that her name not be used, works in the visitor center at the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. She described basic chores like emptying trash, weed whacking around buildings to reduce fire risk, and directing overflow parking at the popular site. All these tasks, if left undone, could cause chaos next summer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She estimates two permanent employees will be left to do the work of five people, once the seasonal positions are cut. She imagined the possible consequences: locked gates and closed recreation access, and trails or camping sites left inaccessible. She called it a “disservice to the public” as well as to the employees who will have to deal with the fallout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You always get people coming in complaining about things,” she said, “but if we’re shutting things down, and there’s trash everywhere, that&#8217;s just going to increase, and it’s very unfair to the workforce that will remain.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/31265633634_abfe7d82f9_k.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723395278369,100,78.553209443262\" alt=\"A woman in a US Forest Service shirt and hat with a large blue hiking backpack on her back writes on a small notebook attached to a trailhead sign in a forest. \" title=\"A woman in a US Forest Service shirt and hat with a large blue hiking backpack on her back writes on a small notebook attached to a trailhead sign in a forest. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An employee signs a logbook at a popular wilderness trailhead in Mount Baker Snoqulamie National Forest. | US Forest Service via Flickr\" data-portal-copyright=\"US Forest Service via Flickr\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Important work will grind to a halt</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, the Forest Service has attempted to reduce its reliance on seasonal employees, converting approximately 1,400 temporary workers to permanent status. But even those newly permanent employees will feel the budget cutbacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of these new positions are known as “permanent seasonal” roles. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.jamietommins.com/p/seasonal-depression\">Substack</a> post about the agency’s hiring woes, Tommins compared the job to that of a public school teacher: “a permanent employee with a long” break, although that break is during the winter, not the summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In normal years, employees can extend their terms, adding hours or taking on new work for some extra money. But in its announcement of the hiring freeze, the Forest Service made it clear that permanent seasonal workers will not be able to extend their terms in the coming fiscal year. Meanwhile, many promised promotions are on hold, and some external hiring offers will have to be rescinded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scott Schell, the executive director at the Northwest Avalanche Center, worries what the cutbacks will mean for his organization, a public-private partnership that works with the Forest Service to provide weather and avalanche data in Oregon and Washington. In addition to vital avalanche data for backcountry skiers and ski resorts, the NWAC also contributes to climate research and weather forecasts for Interstate 90, one of the nation’s major transcontinental highways, which crosses the Cascade Mountains in Washington.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schell said his office had received an allowance from the federal government to bring on a handful of seasonal employees to do avalanche forecasting, but fewer than in years past.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re basically going through a kind of triaging matrix,” he said. “There is no way we can do the work we did last year.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Based in Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, Moo Deng is often seen playfully biting her zookeeper with an exasperated expression, spawning hundreds of memes and a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/09/30/the-backlash-to-the-snl-chappell-roanmoo-deng-skit-explained/\"><em>Saturday Night Live</em> segment</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Viral videos show Moo Deng biting her zookeepers, but that’s nothing new for the global sensation <a href=\"https://t.co/e8pALAoyZg\">https://t.co/e8pALAoyZg</a></p>&mdash; USA TODAY (@USATODAY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/1841693427286589529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pesto, meanwhile, is a fluffy king penguin chick who’s risen to fame for just how large he is. He lives at the Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium in Australia and is already twice his parents’ size despite only being 9 months old. He’s been the subject of numerous social media posts and developed a dedicated fan <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pesto-the-penguin-meet-australias-nearly-50-pound-baby-penguin-capturing-hearts-worldwide-with-its-hefty-fluff/#:~:text=Videos%20the%20aquarium%20has%20posted,to%20one%20of%20Perry's%20songs.\">following of millions</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Move over Moo Deng — Pesto is the fat penguin stealing hearts: ‘Chonky king’ <a href=\"https://t.co/O9wkko50ko\">https://t.co/O9wkko50ko</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nNe8TScmyG\">pic.twitter.com/nNe8TScmyG</a></p>&mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1839714562863517949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 27, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Nibi is an adorable and vivacious 2-year-old beaver who was rescued as a baby — and is the subject of a recent Massachusetts court battle. At issue was whether Nibi, who resides at Newhouse Wildlife Rescue, had to be returned to the wild. According to Newhouse, Nibi would die if they released her, because she doesn’t yet have the skills to survive. <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/protect-nibi-the-beaver-from-unnecessary-removal-from-newhouse-wildlife-do-not-donate-here?source_location=search\">Roughly 29,000 people</a> signed a petition calling for Nibi to remain at the rescue, and Massachusetts Gov.

While they benefit from their infant-like appearances, they also likely garnered a sizable degree of attention because they have unique personalities that reflect essential parts of the human experience, from frustration at things outside our control to delight in small pleasures. Exposure to animal content, in general, has also been found to provide stress relief, comfort, and escapism at a time when <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx\">Americans in particular are more stressed than ever</a>. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why so many people are drawn to these animals</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The cuteness factor has always been a big reason that people are drawn to animals — but the internet’s latest faves seem to have achieved a rare type of animal celebrity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And a big part of that could be tied to each animal’s strong personality. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210211-why-escapism-benefits-from-a-dose-of-pandemic-reality?utm_source=html&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=daily_post&amp;utm_content=bbc-grizzard-reality\">Researchers have found that people are attracted</a> to content and characters that validate their own experiences, and that reflect their own beliefs or feelings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We do like to see characters that are going through the same thing we’re going through,” Matthew Grizzard, a communications professor at The Ohio State University, previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210211-why-escapism-benefits-from-a-dose-of-pandemic-reality?utm_source=html&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=daily_post&amp;utm_content=bbc-grizzard-reality\">told the BBC</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to Moo Deng, for example, her expression of apparent frustration — which commonly takes the form of open-mouthed yelling — embodies the stress and annoyance that many of her fans are experiencing amid ongoing uncertainty in the world. “I love that Moo Deng is fucking annoyed all the time. I can relate,” as <a href=\"https://x.com/esjesjesj/status/1837347574040158538\">one online Moo Deng fan wrote</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nibi, too, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced0x96lew2o\">has been described as a “diva”</a> for her mischievous behavior and playful facial expressions, both of which have resonated with supporters, because they show off <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140582/nibi-beaver-massachusetts-govern-newhouse-wildlife\">a certain aspirational swagger</a>. In one TikTok post, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kashmeredanny/video/7421965843233262878\">comedian Danny Murphy compared</a> her to that of other “2024 icons” like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Pesto, in addition to his unique identity as a “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brutamerica/reel/DAlptZPu-7s/?hl=en\">chonky king</a>,” — a title some fans have given him — has also become known for <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/pesto-the-penguin-is-big-hungry-and-famous-but-his-size-might-not-last/pbkswg1qq\">how much he enjoys food</a>. According to his keepers, Pesto consumes roughly 25 to 32 fish a day, prompting internet observers to share their <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFftCYoo/\">similar love of fish and sushi</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you can assign this sort of unexpected emotion to an animal, it’s effective,” Roger Dooley, a consumer marketing expert, previously <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0730/Why-do-we-love-grumpy-animal-memes-Science-explains\">told the Christian Science Monitor</a>, about the appeal of memes like Grumpy Cat, a feline known for his dour facial expression. “I think we don’t expect our animals to be grumpy, so as a result you have that novelty factor at work too.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Broadly, animal content has also been found to have a soothing effect on people that can help relieve stress by providing distraction or comfort. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/27/us/watching-cute-animals-study-scn-trnd/index.html\">A 2019 University of Leeds Study</a>, for example, found that showing college students preparing for finals a 30-minute montage of cute animal content helped reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s no doubt that people turn to all sorts of escapist options when they&#8217;re anxious,” Barash told Vox, noting that pet adoptions and purchases also spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic when more people had heightened stress levels and were looking for support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like other viral animals that have come before them, Moo Deng, Pesto, and Nibi have gained a following both because their cuteness can be pleasing, and because they’re appearing to convey emotions that reflect how many people are feeling at the moment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Back in June, before President Joe Biden exited the race, the first presidential debate moderator asked both candidates <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/classroom/document/?22809\">how they’d help families</a> better afford child care, noting that prices averaged over $11,000 per child in 2023. (Both Biden and former President Donald Trump dodged the question.) New care policy proposals then surfaced on the campaign trail over the summer, as vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/\">endorsed an expanded child tax credit</a> (CTC), followed by Vice President Kamala Harris endorsing her own expanded credit on top of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-child-tax-credit-6000-dnc-what-to-know/\">a new CTC</a> for families with newborns. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-16/trump-harris-campaigns-struggle-to-tackle-child-care-costs?sref=qYiz2hd0\">Both</a> campaigns <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/24/kamala-harris-care-economy-biden/\">have said</a> they’d fight for paid family leave and Harris recently said she’d <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/child-care-harris-7-percent-cap/index.html\">cap child care costs at 7 percent</a> of a family’s income.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If some of these ideas sound familiar, it’s because the push for &#8220;care economy&#8221; policies — ranging from paid family leave and an expanded CTC to affordable child care, universal preschool, elder care, and higher wages for care workers — was a central focus for advocates and Democrats during the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/10/28/22748554/biden-budget-build-back-better-democrats-child-care-taxes\">Build Back Better Act negotiations</a>. However, those <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/12/19/22844969/manchin-build-back-better-setback-biden-social-spending-bill\">talks fell apart</a> after Democratic leadership failed to reach a deal with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who had concerns over the size and scope of the package. The following year, care policies were ultimately excluded from the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23293725/kyrsten-sinema-inflation-reduction-act-climate-taxes\">$740 billion Inflation Reduction Act</a> Democrats passed into law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Advocates are now pressing politicians to redouble their commitment to care legislation — <a href=\"https://www.ffyf.org/2024/05/16/new-polling-on-child-care-and-the-2024-election/\">citing</a> <a href=\"https://bpcaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-Caregiving-Poll-Results.pdf\">polling</a> that suggests such investments are not just good policy but smart politics. Care organizations are particularly pinning hopes on Harris winning in November, as a Democratic victory increases the chances for significant new federal spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But should Harris actually win and advocates get another opportunity to push for federal policy, what, if anything, would they do? How, if at all, are they reflecting on their last failed push, and preparing for the future, especially given the strong chance that Republicans <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50573-republicans-favored-win-senate-democrats-win-yougov-model-mrp-polls\">win the Senate</a>? The odds of a Democratic trifecta are low.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past several months Vox has been speaking with lawmakers, strategists, philanthropic funders, congressional aides, think tank experts, and leaders of care advocacy groups to gauge the future of federal care policy. The interviews revealed a simmering debate over whether advocates should narrow their focus to one or two agenda items in a future legislative push or whether compromise represents premature capitulation, a sign of adopting a limiting &#8220;scarcity mentality.&#8221; Beyond the tactical debate, deeper tensions have surfaced over whether future efforts should focus on the most vulnerable families or build out new programs for more people, and broader&nbsp;questions have emerged about who sets the agenda in Democratic policymaking, and whether there’s room in the party for real dissent.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should Democrats have prioritized more?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the summer and fall of 2021, as congressional negotiations for Build Back Better were heating up, activists saw a major opportunity to push new investments in paid family leave, child care, elder care, universal preschool and an expanded CTC. How exactly to describe this sweeping legislation wasn’t clear. “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/06/us/politics/democrats-biden-social-safety-net.html\">Cradle-to-grave</a>” social welfare? A jobs and climate package? <a href=\"https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Build-Back-Better-Economic-Growth-Fact-Sheet.pdf\">Human infrastructure</a>?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Sen. Manchin had signaled <a href=\"https://npr.org/2021/10/13/1044543025/united-against-higher-spending-centrist-democrats-dont-agree-on-what-to-cut-or-k\">he opposed spending as much</a> as the White House and House Democrats were prepared to invest ($3.5 trillion over 10 years) and that he disapproved of budget tricks including temporary programs he suspected leaders would try to make permanent later on, advocates were optimistic that with enough pressure, Manchin would come around on most things. Manchin had also emphasized that he opposed expanding the CTC <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2021/10/17/scoop-manchins-red-lines\">in a way that eliminated its connection to work,</a> but activists believed he’d ultimately cave on that as well, given emerging research that showed how a CTC without work requirements successfully <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/01/27/1075299510/the-expanded-child-tax-credit-briefly-slashed-child-poverty-heres-what-else-it-d\">reduced child poverty by 30 percent</a> during the pandemic. Both the White House and Senate Democrats were staking out political capital in declaring an extension of the pandemic CTC to be their top priority, too.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/gettyimages-1359569124.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.72626853884,100,78.54746292232\" alt=\"Manchin walks in a Capitol hallway flanked by masked reporters and aides on December 17, 2021.\" title=\"Manchin walks in a Capitol hallway flanked by masked reporters and aides on December 17, 2021.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Sen. Joe Manchin is followed by reporters as he leaves a caucus meeting with Senate Democrats at the  Capitol on December 17, 2021, in Washington, DC. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So when negotiations for Build Back Better ultimately collapsed in late December 2021, care advocates, White House officials, and Senate Democrats insisted there was ultimately nothing else they could have done, that Manchin had been disingenuous and never intended to strike a deal in the first place. (Manchin had expressed openness to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/12/20/manchin-biden-child-tax-credit/\">policies like a permanent expansion of preschool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/24/west-virginia-manchin-child-tax-credit/\">a larger CTC</a> with a work requirement.) By the time January rolled around, care advocates were loath to adopt any new strategy, insisting they just needed to keep fighting and that eventually Manchin would come to his senses. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22996474/inflation-federal-reserve-nairu-ngdp-powell\">Inflation was soaring</a> by that point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Anyone who challenged this strategic consensus faced consequences. In February 2022, Patrick Gaspard, the president of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank, acknowledged <a href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/The-Path-Forward-on-BBB-Gaspard-FINAL.pdf\">in a memo</a> that the House’s version of the Build Back Better Act had no path in the Senate, and urged lawmakers to focus on lowering health care costs, addressing the climate crisis, and reducing child care expenses through initiatives like universal pre-K. Shortly after, a coalition of care advocates voted to expel CAP from their group for throwing its weight behind a proposal that didn’t include an expanded CTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Also in February 2022, representatives <a href=\"https://www.ececonsortium.org/\">from an umbrella group</a> representing large, private child care providers spoke with Manchin about possibly moving forward on expanding the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) — a longstanding federal program aimed at reducing child care costs for low-income families. Other care economy advocates grew furious, and accused the group of sabotaging their larger, more progressive agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(While CCDBG has <a href=\"https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-burr-introduce-bill-to-expand-families-child-care-options-build-on-existing-bipartisan-program\">bipartisan support</a> in Congress and <a href=\"https://www.ffyf.org/2022-state-fact-sheets/\">is massively underfunded</a>, many liberal child care advocates oppose its work requirement and want to see policymakers increase public subsidies to all or most families, not just poor households.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That was probably one of the ugliest negotiations I’ve seen in terms of stifling folks,” said one child care advocate who requested anonymity to describe their private coalition calls. People who held very senior positions in the Obama administration on child care were saying the same things about moving forward on CCDBG, the advocate added, “and were being met as some sort of public enemy #1.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A Democratic Senate aide, speaking anonymously to describe their own private conversations, recalled hearing through the congressional grapevine in the winter of 2022 that Manchin might be open to a deal on expanding CCDBG. This sounded encouraging to the aide, who had already accepted that the window for some sort of investment on the scale of the House’s version of Build Back Better had passed. But when this aide broached the idea of a new path forward with care advocacy groups, they too were met with backlash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We had some really tough conversations with outside advocates when we tried to change course and got some very bad reactions,” the aide told Vox. “The idea to expand and pump out CCDBG, I think, fell really short of what they were trying to do.” The aide had hoped that, given their boss’s record on championing care policies, advocates would have been more understanding about a strategic pivot, and see it more as an effort to be nimble and respond to an evolving situation, and not about throwing groups under the bus. “Honestly those were very bad conversations and I look back at that time with a lot of sadness,” the aide said. “These things can get kind of intense and personal.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, after more than five months of resisting a new plan, and more than three months after Manchin expressed openness to reviewing a proposal on expanding CCDBG, Sens. Patty Murray and Tim Kaine <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Revised%20Child%20Care%20and%20Preschool%20Reconciliation%20Proposal%20One%20Pager_%20FINAL.pdf\">released a proposal</a> to expand CCDBG aid <a href=\"https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/child-care-early-education-reconciliation-proposal-could-reach-1-million-children/\">for more than a million</a> new children. But most political observers felt it was too little, too late, and that the door for reaching a deal had closed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I mean, it was like a Hail Mary, you could see the window was closing and that’s finally when [advocates] came to try and find some compromise,” said one leader who supported pivoting much earlier. “There was this mentality that if you show your willingness to compromise early it’s going to kill your chances, and I think it was ultimately their unwillingness to compromise earlier that killed it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When does perfect become the enemy of good?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The last few years seem to have revealed that within the Democratic Party, there’s not much space for debating competing care policy ideas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the fall of 2021, as advocates began circling the wagon to get their policies through congressional negotiations, Matt Bruenig, the founder of the left-wing People’s Policy Project, came out with a number of critiques about the package — for instance, that the Senate’s paid leave bill would <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2020/03/08/family-act-would-deny-benefits-to-one-third-of-new-parents/\">exclude at least 30 percent</a> of new parents, that <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/09/09/the-house-paid-leave-proposal-is-awful/\">the House’s version</a> was full of giveaways to insurance companies, that the proposed child care bill could lead to <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/10/20/democratic-child-care-plan-will-spike-prices-for-the-middle-class-by-13000/\">massive hikes in cost</a> for middle-class families, and that pre-K and child care bills were crafted in ways that <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/11/22/build-back-better-does-not-implement-the-child-care-and-pre-k-plans/\">made adoption by Republican states unlikely</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democratic lawmakers and care advocates “mov[ed] quickly to dull a dagger,” as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/democrats-defend-child-care-plan-516568\">Politico put it at the time</a>. Child care proponents publicly dismissed Bruenig, arguing he wasn’t closely reading the legislation and was spreading “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/democrats-defend-child-care-plan-516568\">a viral set of misinformation</a>.” Paid leave advocates <a href=\"https://prospect.org/health/paid-leave-advocates-wont-push-back-on-payouts-to-private-insurance/\">similarly declined</a> to raise any concerns. “I trust the judgment of the Ways and Means Committee and of politicians who need to square the fact that there are lots of different interests at play,” one national paid leave advocate told the American Prospect when questioned about the insurance giveaways. Another said they were <a href=\"https://prospect.org/health/paid-leave-advocates-wont-push-back-on-payouts-to-private-insurance/\">not “choosing fights”</a> as negotiations progressed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bruenig wasn’t the only person to notice weaknesses in the bills. When another think tank analyst raised issues, they <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/rigorous-accurate-policy-analysis\">were similarly told to keep quiet</a>. Anyone raising concerns at this vulnerable negotiating stage was <a href=\"https://x.com/JulieKashen/status/1465707544643395595\">letting perfect</a> be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22744837/house-senate-democrats-build-back-better-child-care\">the enemy of good</a>, or not grasping that this was the best possible version lawmakers could pass at this time, and that modifications could always be made later.<br><br>Except a few weeks after Bruenig&#8217;s critique about rising child care costs for unsubsidized families, Senate Democrats quietly revised their bill, significantly raising the income threshold to address that concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similar dynamics emerged the next year when attempts to strike a new deal with Manchin were met with fierce outcry. The incentives to keep one’s head down and go along with the coalition were real.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bruenig has called this policymaking apparatus both dysfunctional and undemocratic. “If this nightmarish process actually generated good policy that was put into law, maybe you could forgive people for engaging in it,” he wrote <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/05/democrats-policymaking-apparatus-is-wildly-dysfunctional-and-undemocratic\">in May of 2022</a>. “But in reality, it keeps generating extremely broken policies that mostly don’t pass anyway and that fail to live up to expectations even when they do.”<br><br>Even if some believe it’s unwise to debate legislative details during ongoing negotiations, since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, there’s been little space or energy to explore alternative ideas. “Now is allegedly supposed to be the time when people are to say, ‘Okay, let’s hash it out,’ but it still doesn’t happen,” Bruenig told Vox.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Care advocates think they deserve more credit for coming close</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As it became even clearer over the summer of 2022 that child care investments were not going to be part of what ultimately became the Inflation Reduction Act, child care advocates began ramping up threats of economic calamity. A <a href=\"https://www.ffyf.org/2022/07/18/joint-statement-senate-must-make-good-on-promise-to-solve-child-care-crisis/\">letter sent that July</a> from 26 national organizations warned lawmakers that omitting child care aid from the reconciliation package would push the early childhood sector “closer to a catastrophic funding cliff that will affect America’s entire economy” and “preven[t] countless moms from pursuing economic security — let alone economic success.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These warnings continued to escalate over the next two years. The following summer, <a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/\">advocates warned</a> that if Congress failed to renew expiring Covid-19 child care funding, then 70,000 child care programs would likely close, resulting in 3.2 million children losing access to care, and mothers in particular would be forced to quit their jobs or work part-time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This “child care cliff” idea originated with the left-wing Century Foundation and was echoed by Democratic and union leadership like Sen. Murray and AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. It was repeated in more than a dozen national news outlets, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/upshot/child-care-daycare-disruptions.html\">the New York Times</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/27/child-care-funding-crisis/\">Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/09/20/child-care-cliff\">Axios</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-06/child-care-funding-expiration-risks-disrupting-women-s-work-force-gains?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=qYiz2hd0\">Bloomberg</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/as-pandemic-funds-expire-child-care-centers-struggle-to-survive-6cefdf5b\">Wall Street Journal</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-child-care-cliff-us-economy-rcna103631\">MSNBC</a>. As I reported at the time, leading experts quietly disagreed with the scope of the projected closures, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/23892133/child-care-daycare-pandemic-emergency-providers\">were staying quiet</a> so as to not upset others in their child care coalition. And indeed, industry-wide collapse never followed, while more moms with <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/post/prime-age-women-are-going-above-and-beyond-in-the-labor-market-recovery/\">preschool and school-age children</a><strong> </strong>subsequently joined the labor force. Jobs in the child care sector continued <a href=\"https://cscce.berkeley.edu/publications/brief/child-care-sector-jobs-bls-analysis/\">to grow, too</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Looking back, White House aides maintain they did all they could have done to reach a deal with Manchin on care policies, as evidenced by the fact that they were ultimately able <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23955967/joe-manchin-climate-change-senate-biden-inflation\">to negotiate successfully with him</a> on climate change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Leading care advocates also deny any missteps. They say that, upon reflection, they are proud of all they have accomplished over the last four years, despite losing the bruising reconciliation fight. They point to wins like the new Biden <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/02/29/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-rule-reduce-costs-more-than-100000-families-receiving-child-care-subsidies.html\">administration rule</a> to lower child care costs, a <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2023/04/pump-act-what-it-does-lactating-workplace/\">new law protecting nursing parents</a>, and that care agenda policies have remained a top priority lawmakers regularly highlight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In the Build Back Better fight, the care community was able to get care policies out of the US House, even though that was not assured for quite a long time, and we lost by just one vote in the US Senate,” said <a href=\"https://www.momsrising.org/blog/users/kristin\">Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner</a>, the executive director of MomsRising, a national advocacy group. “As a community we were punching above our weight. We did get care through the administrative level and through the House so what that means is we have to double down now.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a post-mortem of the Build Back Better fight published by the progressive think tank New America, care leaders interviewed similarly praised the coalition for being small and mighty. “While the outcome of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better (BBB) social agenda is widely known, much of the progress care advocates made given their minuscule financial resources is a big success story that deserves more attention,” <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/reports/a-playbook-to-transform-how-america-cares/key-findings\">the report said</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though some have argued advocates erred in refusing to pick one or two policies to focus on, activists publicly maintain that they are ultimately stronger if they push multiple programs all together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In their <a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/commentary/the-top-six-lessons-from-arpas-care-economy-investments/\">own post-mortem</a> of the American Rescue Plan, the Century Foundation pointed to historic levels of funding for child care and home care as evidence that “a holistic framework across care movements and strategies is impactful.” The liberal think tank argued that trying to silo aspects of the care agenda from one another “creates a scarcity myth and a fight for resources and helps maintain unfair power structures.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What care advocates see in the climate movement</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://elliothaspel.com/\">Elliot Haspel</a>, the author of <em>Crawling Behind: America&#8217;s Child Care Crisis and How to Fix It</em>, says part of the challenge of figuring out strategy is that child care advocacy does not have a single leader or single organization. “In some ways [this] means more voices can be heard, more small-d democratic, but it also can create challenges,” he told Vox, contrasting this with the 1990s, when the Children Defense Fund, and specifically its leaders Marian Wright Edelman and Helen Blank, “were basically the child care points of contact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Past legislative battles may offer insight: following the <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.14.1.66\">defeat of universal health care</a> under President Bill Clinton and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/science/earth/26climate.html\">cap-and-trade for carbon emissions</a> under President Barack Obama, advocates for health care reform and climate went through years of painful reflection and recalibration of their tactics and goals. To get legislation through the legislative process, leaders agreed, they’d have to change course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Health care proponents had to figure out how to bypass a strong suspicion of socialized medicine. So, with the past failed health care push top of mind, lawmakers drafted the Affordable Care Act to allow for a market-based approach with industry buy-in. Meanwhile, climate advocates realized that they had <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/biden-pass-climate-legislation-1140934/\">overestimated the power of businesses</a> in the GOP coalition &nbsp;An <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/16/why-has-climate-legislation-failed-an-interview-with-theda-skocpol/\">influential 2013 report</a> by a Harvard scholar helped push the climate movement in its next decade to embrace grassroots activism, while practical experience led climate groups to negotiate more concertedly with Manchin in 2022 to get the IRA over the finish line.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The care movement has had no comparable recalibration, at least yet. If anything, top care leaders point to the climate movement not as a coalition that had to make tough strategic compromises but as an example of the power of big political spending and a commitment to fighting over many years. “What’s the difference between the climate change movement and the care movement?” Rowe-Finkbeiner, of MomsRising, asked <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/reports/a-playbook-to-transform-how-america-cares/key-findings/\">in the New America report</a>. “Tens of million dollars and several decades [of concerted organizing].”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The report noted that the top three environmental lobbying groups outspent care lobbying groups in 2021 and 2022 about three to one. In addition to investing more political dollars, the New America review recommended building a bigger coalition including more faith leaders and businesses, working with Hollywood to feature more diverse characters and storylines about caregiving, and getting serious about publicly battling the opposition, such as large industry groups that fight corporate tax increases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An aide for Sen. Murray also pushed back on the idea that there’s not enough room to update ideas, noting their boss’s Child Care for Working Families Act, which <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1354\">has 42 co-sponsors</a>, has evolved based on feedback, with <a href=\"https://www.murray.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Child-Care-for-Working-Families-Act-Summary.pdf\">newer changes including</a> the expansion of eligibility and increased grants to providers.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/gettyimages-1247642689.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.198952879581,100,75.602094240838\" alt=\"Sena.

Patty Murray (D-WA) speaks on stage as activists gather in DC to advocate for federal care legislation in 2023. | Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Caring Across Generations\" data-portal-copyright=\"Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Caring Across Generations\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This was the product of countless discussions with other Senate offices, unions, policy experts, and other stakeholders,” the aide said. “Murray wanted to write a bill that could win the most possible support to actually get passed into law.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where things might go after the election</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In interviews with advocates, aides and policy experts, I’ve tried to glean a clearer sense of what might happen with care policies should Harris win in November. Some activists declined to discuss hypothetical scenarios at all, saying they would not “negotiate against themselves” by publicly signaling what they might compromise on, but others were willing to get more specific.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Assuming Harris wins but lacks a Washington trifecta, the two most commonly cited ideas I heard were an expansion of the CCDBG program for low-income families — as that’s something Republicans generally support — and an expansion of the child tax credit, as that bipartisan program is also set to expire next December, so Congress will likely plan to reauthorize it in some form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One area of tension will likely be over whether to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), which helps parents offset the cost of child care. Supporters of expanding the credit say it will make any deeper investments in the CCDBG go further, by making child care both more affordable and more accessible. Rates for CDCTC <a href=\"https://www.ffyf.org/resources/2024/09/understanding-the-difference-between-the-child-tax-credit-and-the-child-care-tax-credit/\">were last set in 2001</a>, so they have not kept up with inflation and other increases in care costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is a monumental opportunity that should not be squandered,” said <a href=\"https://www.ececonsortium.org/bio/radha-mohan/\">Radha Mohan</a>, the executive director of the Early Care and Education Consortium, which is lobbying for the expansion of the CDCTC. Other progressive child care groups have opposed it, as they see it as further entrenching a child care financing system they want to ultimately move away from. The White House declined to endorse expanding the CDCTC in its latest budget, favoring a new child care entitlement instead, though Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-child-tax-credit-awareness-day-and-releases-guidance-for-unprecedented-american-rescue-plan-investments-to-support-parents-and-healthy-child-dev/\">did support increasing the tax credit</a> in the American Rescue Plan.<br><br>Aides say there is a real sense within the Democratic caucuses that lawmakers need to do <em>something</em> on care, since it was so clearly left on the cutting room floor in 2022. Some child care advocates worry that lawmakers might try to frame existing proposals to expand the CTC as sufficient. The National Women’s Law Center <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resource/the-child-tax-credit-is-great-but-it-wont-solve-the-child-care-crisis/\">put out a brief</a> last week on this concern, arguing that the CTC and child care should not be seen as interchangeable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(There’s no doubt that many of these policies and acronyms can be confusing. In the first presidential debate, Biden mistakenly referred to the CTC, which can be used for any costs associated with raising kids,&nbsp; as <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/tax-credit-update-biden-wants-make-new-savings-permanent-1926151\">a “child care tax credit”</a> — causing stress among child care advocates that the two will continue to be conflated.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other care advocates are looking at the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act next year as a fresh opportunity for advancing their own priorities, since Republicans likely will agree to new social spending in exchange for renewing their business tax breaks. The real question is how much money will exist to support care policies given other commitments. Harris, for her part, has already pledged to bring back the pandemic-era CTC and create a new CTC for newborns, two items that could cost <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/kamala-harris-tax-plan-2024/\">up to $1.6 trillion</a> over 10 years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some experts say lawmakers should not be afraid to go back to the drawing board. There is a tendency for groups to become “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence\">path dependent</a>” on old ideas, even if there are better, more effectively designed policies out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bruenig, for example, <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/family-fun-pack/\">advocates for</a> universal free child care along with home care allowances for those who don’t want to send their kids to day care. He believes these policies would&nbsp;be easier and fairer to implement than&nbsp; Democratic proposals aimed at <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-26/the-problem-with-harris-plan-to-cap-child-care-costs?sref=qYiz2hd0\">capping costs at 7 percent</a> of a family’s income. He also says <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2023/05/minnesota-paid-parental-leave-income-benefit-exclusion\">there’s no reason</a> all the Democratic paid leave bills have to exclude nearly a third of new parents.

Vaughn Stewart, with Bruenig’s help, will be introducing a bill to close that loophole in Maryland’s paid leave law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A divided government may force advocates to embrace more bipartisan solutions, and there are some signs that such work has already started. A new bipartisan working group of 30 child care experts and analysts convened throughout 2023 <a href=\"https://convergencepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Convergence-Collaborative-on-Supports-for-Working-Families-Blueprint-for-Action.pdf\">to try and find common ground</a>, and new bipartisan working groups <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3771742-regardless-of-party-moms-in-congress-agree-its-time-for-paid-family-leave/\">in the House</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/press-releases/gillibrand-cassidy-houlahan-bice-lead-bipartisan-bicameral-paid-leave-working-group-to-request-input-on-paid-leave-proposal\">Senate</a> also launched last year to focus on paid leave.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether advocates would push for some or all of their care priorities together remains an open question. Rowe-Finkbeiner stressed that it’s important “the policies move together,” saying&nbsp;it’ll take a combination of them to&nbsp; help families the most.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sen. Murray is optimistic that if Democrats win the Senate, it will be a Democratic majority that’s “markedly different” from the last time, and one that’s ready to make serious, long-term investments in child care. But if they don’t win the Senate, Murray told me, Democrats will still act. “I will always talk to anyone and everyone to make progress on child care in every single way possible,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This work was supported by a grant from the Bainum Family Foundation.

And now, another life-threatening storm, Hurricane Milton, a Category 5, approaches the Florida coast. Amid the overwhelming destruction and the mounting chaos expected from these back-to-back storms, and a death toll of at least <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc\">227 people across six states</a>, one group risks being overlooked in the scramble: the homeless population, those already vulnerable before the storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disaster relief for people who were homeless prior to a hurricane has always been lacking, as FEMA, the main federal agency tasked with providing aid, has a policy that <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_iappg-1.1.pdf\">explicitly excludes</a> those unhoused people from most forms of help, including housing and direct assistance. In recent years, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has stepped up to try to plug some of those gaps in social safety, but a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr1605/BILLS-118hr1605ih.pdf\">new bill moving</a> through Congress <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/HR_1605_Sign_on_Letter_Final.pdf\">threatens these efforts</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These dynamics have grown more pressing as major hurricanes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/natural-disaster/374366/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-beryl-storms-climate\">increase in frequency</a> and the number of unsheltered Americans <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html\">continues to grow</a>. In June the US Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing\">issued a landmark decision</a> in <em>Grants Pass </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, greenlighting local governments’ legal authority to clear out <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/3/8/23618237/homelessness-tent-encampments-housing-affordable\">homeless tent encampments</a> even if a city lacks any available housing or shelter for the unhoused person to stay in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since then, more jurisdictions have passed laws criminalizing homelessness, part of a broader effort to crack down on those sleeping outside. Just this month <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/20/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-address-homelessness-and-protect-the-public-and-quality-of-life-for-floridians/\">a new law</a> in Florida —&nbsp;that bans sleeping on public property anywhere in the state — took effect. While the law <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/1365/?Tab=BillText\">includes exceptions</a> during emergencies like major storms, those protections end when the hurricane order is no longer in place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practical terms, this means that when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis or a county official lifts Florida’s emergency hurricane order, Floridians who were homeless before Helene and Milton — <a href=\"https://fchonline.org/the-issue/\">roughly 31,000</a> people —&nbsp;could face new criminal penalties. Local homeless advocates say there are countless questions and rumors circulating about how the new law will be interpreted and enforced in the wake of climate disasters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most people experiencing homelessness were aware the new anti-camping law was set to take effect, according to Martha Are, the executive director at the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. “Some people are already trying to relocate their encampments to harder-to-find areas,” she told me in mid-September, about a week before Helene <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water\">made landfall</a> in Florida’s Big Bend region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>Leaders like Are have little idea yet what to expect, and she hears unofficially that most jurisdictions are in wait-and-see mode, watching to see which city gets sued first and what the judge who reviews that lawsuit decides. (Under the new Florida law, any citizen or business can sue beginning in January if they feel the anti-camping ban is not being properly enforced.)&nbsp;<br><br>“It’s going to be a challenge for how leaders actually enforce these [anti-camping] laws, like if I’ve lost my house from a hurricane and I’ve lived in that town for a decade, will I be found in violation of the law and are they going to arrest me?” asked Noah Patton, the manager of disaster recovery at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “These laws create significant complications, will really make aid more difficult to sort out, and what I have been saying is it makes a community less resilient to disasters.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moving homeless people to safety when a hurricane hits is difficult — and the anti-camping laws make that harder</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s always a stressful scramble to try and reach homeless people when a hurricane is coming. “A lot of people have phones but they don’t have data, they aren’t getting texts,” said Kelly Young, the CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston and Harris County.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, homeless outreach workers will try and go out to spread the word, and existing homeless shelters will work to make extra room, sometimes allowing people to sleep in places like the kitchen and hallways. Unhoused individuals can usually seek refuge in convention centers and public schools, or at newly-erected Red Cross emergency shelters. Some governments and nonprofits arrange transport for unhoused people to get indoors, while others leave it on the individual to figure out their own travel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We had up to 13,000 people at George R. Brown Convention Center <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning\">after [Hurricane] Harvey</a> and there was no distinguishing between the homeless versus people who had just lost their homes and needed a place to be,” said Larry Satterwhite, who leads the Houston Mayor’s Office of Public Safety and Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not everyone experiencing homelessness gets the information they need, and not everyone living outside <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Understanding-Encampments.pdf\">feels comfortable going to a shelter</a>, said Eric Camarillo, the executive director of SALT Outreach, which works with unsheltered homeless people in Orlando and central Florida. Some people fear losing their personal belongings, while others may have had traumatic prior experiences at shelters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The face of homelessness is not the same as it was 50 years ago,” Camarillo added. “These are single moms who can’t afford day care, these are seniors in their 70s and 80s on fixed incomes who can’t afford their rent increases, and youth and young adults.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new anti-camping laws are intensifying the already tumultuous disaster response situation, as many homeless people living outside now try to become less visible to avoid jail time. The punitive laws are also expected to increase distrust between local government and homeless individuals, making it even more difficult for people to accept help if they are found.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These laws exist, in my opinion, to push people away and out of sight which makes our job tougher,” said Eric Samuels, the president of the Texas Homeless Network. (Texas passed its statewide camping ban in 2021.) “And if people are badly hurt and they’re miles from public view because they don’t want to get a ticket, then emergency crews might not be able to get out to help.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disaster aid for those already experiencing homelessness faces an uncertain future</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">FEMA has the primary responsibility of providing disaster relief and works with states and local communities to manage emergency shelters, <a href=\"https://maps.redcross.org/website/maps/ARC_Shelters.html\">which are mostly run by</a> the Red Cross. FEMA prohibits housing assistance from going to those who were already homeless — “because the need for housing was not caused by the disaster,” as their policy states — though homeless individuals may qualify for temporary transportation, funeral, child care, and medical aid.<br><br>FEMA policy does permit those who lived, pre-disaster, in “non-traditional forms of housing” like “tents, certain types of huts, and lean-to structures” to apply for a few months of rental assistance. But to receive this FEMA money, applicants must obtain verification of their pre-storm situation from “a credible or official source” which, according to Patton, makes accessing the aid virtually impossible.<br><br>“People do not apply,” he said. “It’s an exceptionally burdensome and administratively difficult process.”<br><br>Recently, in light of this, and after years of advocacy by housing organizations, HUD stepped up to establish the <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/news/rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-notice/\">Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing</a> (RUSH) program, using unspent funds from <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/esg\">another emergency grant program</a>. RUSH aims to help those who were homeless prior to a storm or other climate disaster, and the first grants <a href=\"https://www.nhlp.org/resources/nlihc-and-nhlp-release-report-on-huds-rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-program/\">were deployed</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23389508/hurricane-ian-death-toll-storm-florida-landfall-climate\">wake of Hurricane Ian</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We were very pleased to have the ability to launch the program because we see that people who are doubled up or experiencing homelessness during the disaster often don’t access FEMA funds or receive support from FEMA for long,” said Marion McFadden, HUD’s principal deputy assistant secretary for community planning and development. “By providing funds specifically for these situations, we’re filling in gaps.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>The other way HUD comes in is through its <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/cdbg-dr\">Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery</a> program (CDBG-DR), which is a highly flexible, long-term disaster aid program that can be used to provide months of rental assistance and build new affordable housing well after FEMA is gone. However the program is not permanently authorized — meaning it relies on periodic appropriations from Congress, which are often delayed and insufficient. The Biden administration has called for Congress to permanently authorize CDBG-DR, and a bipartisan bill in Congress <a href=\"https://www.naco.org/news/bipartisan-bills-introduced-support-counties-disaster-recovery-process\">has called for the same</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1605\">a separate bill</a> currently moving through Congress seeks to move much of this longer-term disaster recovery work back over to FEMA, something low-income housing advocates believe will threaten those who are homeless before a hurricane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are concerned that the bill, as written, may lead to the misuse of scarce federal recovery funds and prevent critically needed long-term recovery assistance from reaching low-income disaster survivors,” more than 35 national<strong> </strong>housing advocacy groups wrote in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U15ZfvjLRefLildANBu3ij7zRXRGjL_51893RBYPTaE/edit\">a congressional letter</a> in late September. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">McFadden, of HUD, said there’s “a real role” for her agency to play in supporting communities after disasters. “We are making billions of dollars in grants every year and we understand the unique needs of low-income people and of low-income housing,” she told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">FEMA was noncommittal when I inquired about the agency’s plans for unhoused individuals during a disaster if Congress granted them new authority, or whether they’d reconsider their stance on aiding the pre-disaster homeless.<br><br>“If additional or new authority is passed by Congress and signed into law, FEMA would then develop guidance necessary to implement the new authority,” an agency spokesperson said. “FEMA would focus on supporting communities’ recovery in addressing needs resulting from a disaster and adhering to the intent of Congress in approving any new authority.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As climate change escalates, communities across the US face increasing threats not only from hurricanes but also from heat waves, floods, and wildfires. Advocates <a href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/energy-justice/pdfs/EMBARGOED_FEMA-Petition-on-Heat-and-Wildfire-Smoke.pdf\">have been petitioning</a> FEMA over the last year to expand its criteria for disaster aid to include heat and smoke, emphasizing the need for more adaptable responses to these challenges. The nation’s severe shortage of affordable housing worsens the struggles of both the newly displaced and the long-unsheltered, and addressing these intertwined crises of climate resilience and housing stability has never been more urgent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 7, 5:40 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published on October 3 and <em>has been updated with the current death toll of Hurricane Helene and new information as Hurricane Milton approaches the Florida coast.</em></em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

What’s unsettling about the case is that the patient — hospitalized on August 22 and later released — is the first among <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/h5-monitoring/index.html\">15 people infected in the US</a> who didn’t report having contact with animals. That raises the possibility that the illness has already begun spreading among humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not yet clear whether the virus involved is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/2020s.html\">H5N1 influenza subtype</a> that has infected wild birds, poultry, and dairy cows worldwide since it was first identified in 2020 and raised flags among experts about another potential pandemic. If it is, though, there’s concern about what the Missouri case could represent. “There’s a few steps before this potentially becomes a pandemic threat,” says <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/ceid/about-the-center/team/nahid-bhadelia-md-mald/\">Nahid Bhadelia</a>, who directs the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. “But I’m a lot more worried about it than I was.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bird flu’s threat to most people remains pretty low. Still, here’s what makes this case concerning to experts, and what you can do to keep yourself safe.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What experts are worrying about</strong></h2>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Missouri patient was sick enough to be hospitalized</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the virus first spread to American dairy cows in January of this year, all 13 of the bird flu cases identified in humans before last Friday caused <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-07192024.html\">pretty mild disease</a> — eye redness, otherwise known as conjunctivitis, and in one person, a cough without a fever. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s where the latest case is different: The patient was hospitalized, suggesting severe disease. The Missouri health department noted the adult patient “has underlying medical conditions,” but we don’t know their age or other risk factors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a flu virus to cause a human pandemic, says <a href=\"https://med.emory.edu/directory/profile/?u=SLAKDAW\">Seema Lakdawala</a>, a virologist and flu expert at Emory University, it needs to overcome three hurdles: It must access and replicate efficiently within the respiratory tract to cause disease; it must spread easily from person to person; and it must be novel to our immune systems. If the virus infecting the latest case turns out to be H5N1, the fact the patient was hospitalized suggests this germ is evolving to replicate more efficiently in our airways (and coming closer to overcoming the first hurdle).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We don’t know how the Missouri patient got infected</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> Another thing all previous US human H5N1 cases shared was that they could be <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-virus-type-h5n1-us-dairy-cattle#:~:text=Since%20April%202022%2C%20infection%20with,one%20person%2C%20cough%20without%20fever.\">traced back to close contact</a> with infected farmed poultry or dairy herds. This case doesn’t appear to have that link.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Spread through casual contact — for example, between people standing next to each other on a bus — hasn’t been reported with this virus, and would be much more worrisome</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without a known exposure to an infected animal, there’s concern that H5N1 may be spreading in other ways — for example, through drinking raw milk or, even more consequentially, from person to person, which could lead to a much larger outbreak.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some spread between household contacts or from a sick patient to health care workers has happened with H5N1 in the past, but hasn’t been sustainable, says <a href=\"https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jnuzzo\">Jennifer Nuzzo</a>, an epidemiologist who leads the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. However, spread through casual contact — for example, between people standing next to each other on a bus — hasn’t been reported with this virus, and would be much more worrisome.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Spread through casual contact would represent a step toward overcoming Lakdawala’s second hurdle for a pandemic: sustained person-to-person transmission. “The last time a flu virus did that, which was 2009, it was around the globe in a matter of days,” says Nuzzo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a promising sign that since the Missouri patient was hospitalized, there <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/usmap.htm\">has not been a big bloom</a> of flu-like illness in the state. “I don’t think there’s a whole iceberg out there that we don’t see,” says Nuzzo, but more details about the case would put her and other experts at ease.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Transmission through raw milk would also be bad news. Although most of the US milk supply is pasteurized — that is, heated to the point that bacteria and viruses are killed — about 1 in 100 Americans surveyed in the late 2010s said they <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9241341/#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20the%20risk%20of,per%20week%20or%20more%20often.\">drank raw milk every week</a>. We don’t yet know whether the person who got infected in Missouri was a raw milk consumer, but that’s greatly preferable to the alternative of person-to-person spread, says Bhadelia. It’s more straightforward to control what you eat and drink than who you have contact with.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two weeks elapsed between the patient’s hospitalization and <a href=\"https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/0ca9d648-cb9b-4eca-99a8-f9a1c96a01bd/human-h5-bird-flu-case-confirmed-in-missouri?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">public health</a> authorities’ <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0906-birdflu-case-missouri.html\">announcements</a> about the case</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That long delay, says Nuzzo, suggests the US hasn’t switched on its sensitive flu surveillance system that would more rapidly identify bird flu infections in people with fever, cough, muscle aches, and other flu-like symptoms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there were a lot of person-to-person spread happening, having that system switched on would mean detecting that spread early — perhaps at a stage when it could still be contained. If the system isn’t on, however, transmission among humans could get out of hand before there’s a chance to stop it using the vaccines and medications that we know work to prevent severe flu symptoms and flu transmission.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There’s very little transparency about how much infection is taking place on US dairy farms</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The more infection there is among dairy cows, the more infection there’s likely to be among the people who work with them, and the more opportunities that are created for H5N1 to mutate into a virus that spreads efficiently between people. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite this risk, most states rely on farmers to self-report infections among their herds. Widespread distrust of government and public health across the agriculture industry means <a href=\"https://www.notus.org/healthcare/farmer-bird-flu-cases-hide-cows-federal-government\">self-reporting is rare</a>, and farms can’t be forced to test <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/health/bird-flu-tests.html\">workers</a> or <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/bird-flu-dairy-farms-cdc-00156119\">animals</a> unless their state agencies mandate it. “If these state public health agencies are not willing to do that, and the state governors are not willing to say, ‘Hey, there&#8217;s an ongoing outbreak that&#8217;s causing public health concern, we need to know what&#8217;s going on,’ we&#8217;re not going to have information,” says Lakdawala.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although bird flu has been reported in Missouri only in poultry farms and not on dairy farms, that doesn’t mean it isn’t there, said Nuzzo. It just means farmers may not be testing their workers or cows for the virus, or they aren’t reporting it.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We’re not prepared for another pandemic</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many experts are concerned that Americans’ low trust in institutions would create enormous challenges in the event of another pandemic, especially one involving a virus transmitted through the air. That makes it particularly important to do what’s needed to get a handle on this outbreak, says Lakdawala. This would largely involve preventative measures instituted on dairy farms and having stockpiled vaccines available for those at highest risk of infection.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Seasonal flu is coming</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a few months, the seasonal flu virus is going to be spreading in the US. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When animals get co-infected with different flu viruses at the same time, they can serve as “<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008330\">mixing</a> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33657971/\">vessels</a>” for the viruses, allowing them to exchange segments of their genomes. That can lead to new viruses that are easier to transmit, better at causing disease, and above all, novel to the human immune system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That could lead to getting H5N1 closer to jumping Lakdawala’s third hurdle. “We don’t want those two viruses to swap genes,” says Nuzzo.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are steps you can take to minimize your already low risk.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get a seasonal flu shot</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every episode of bird flu infection in a human makes a good case for a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/370363/an-extremely-practical-guide-to-this-years-cold-flu-and-covid-season\">seasonal flu shot</a>, says Nuzzo, especially in people who work on poultry or dairy farms. Every person who’s immunized against seasonal flu is less likely to be a mixing vessel for some new nightmare Frankenflu.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoid raw milk</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a ton of H5N1 virus <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24158356/raw-milk-pasteurization-h5n1-bird-flu-sales-consumption-government-trust\">in raw milk</a>: In April, 14 percent of American raw milk products <a href=\"https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2024/07/03/fda-finds-infectious-h5n1-bird-flu-virus-in-14-of-raw-milk-samples/\">contained the live virus</a>, and the number may be higher now that more farms are affected. It’s never been safe to drink raw milk, but it’s particularly dangerous now; sticking with pasteurized dairy products is much safer, says Nuzzo.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prevent risky contact with farm animals</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fall often brings farm festivals, and with them, opportunities for lots of contact with animals that might be asymptomatically infected with H5N1, says Lakdawala. “Don’t get close with animals,” Lakdawala says, and wash your hands often during and after a farm visit. If you work on a dairy farm or a veterinarian&#8217;s office, wear a face shield and other personal protective equipment (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has some <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/farm-workers.html\">helpful recommendations</a>) to protect yourself from splashes.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Protect yourself from high-risk infections</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People tend to have only two settings when thinking about their risk of catching an emerging infection, says Bhadelia: “low risk and ‘oh my god.’” It’s more helpful to think of risk as a spectrum, and on that spectrum, Covid-19 and mpox currently pose a bigger threat to the general public than H5N1. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So if you’re someone who wants to avoid getting sick, Nuzzo suggests getting your <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/370363/an-extremely-practical-guide-to-this-years-cold-flu-and-covid-season\">Covid booster</a> sometime this fall, wearing a mask in busy spots, and gathering outdoors instead of crowding inside. If you’d benefit from an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/vaccines/vaccine-recommendations.html\">mpox vaccine</a>, get one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, it’s mostly public officials’ and farm owners’ job to worry about bird flu. The best path forward for the general population is to control the variables you can, Nuzzo says. “Being worried is not a protective action.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

AITA, as it’s known for short, is hosted by Reddit, the one-stop clearinghouse for internet drama, comeuppances, and popcorn gallery judgments on the behavior of strangers. The mothership has been on a hot streak, tripling its traffic over the last year, when Google <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/reddit-traffic-triples-posts-prioritized-in-google-search/472869\">tweaked its search algorithm</a> to prioritize content made by and for real people. Since then, Reddit has risen to over 340 million weekly unique users. Starting from around that same period, AITA has ascended rapidly from niche forum to mainstream forum to omnipresent cultural juggernaut.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The AmITheAsshole subreddit, as Reddit’s topic-based forums are known, boasts 20 million members ready to decide who’s right in a given situation and who’s wrong, if a hair more evocatively. It’s seen numerous spin-offs; not just advice subreddits and confessional subreddits that get at the same yen for revelation and judgment, but subreddits devoted to filtering and curating all those other advice and confessional subs, so that readers can find only the best (or worst) stories. But AmITheAsshole’s cultural dominance doesn’t end there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This Reddit sprawl has spilled over outside of the platform itself, spawning a whole internet ecosystem dedicated to reading and sharing content from advice subreddits. TikTok is full of automated accounts that <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@reddit.day11/video/7275595186854513962\">read stories from AITA</a> in monotone against weirdly hypnotic footage of games. Twitter and Instagram are replete with screenshots of Reddit stories, while <a href=\"https://player.fm/podcasts/AITA\">dozens of audio podcasters</a> and YouTubers have sprung up to retell and comment on the latest scandalous post. The ecosystem has spawned merch of all types, from <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/shop?iaCode=u-mugs&amp;query=aita\">coffee mugs</a> to <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/668352995/am-i-the-asshole-comedy-childrens-book?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery\">children’s book parodies</a> to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1708354107/\">self-help journals</a>. The memes practically <a href=\"https://x.com/skyler_higley/status/1828624225533653113?s=46&amp;t=FEmqCqEQaUqCryzD4XtZ4w\">make themselves</a> at this point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How did we get here? What is it about these endlessly tawdry tales that have us so addicted?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Advice subreddits are nothing new. AITA was first created in 2013, the same year as the site’s first breakout advice forum, r/Relationships. In the years that immediately followed, that sub and its various spin-offs dominated the site. Their purpose was simple enough: ask other Redditors for advice about your relationships and other conflicts, be they tiny or epic. And Redditors responded en masse: Since it was created r/Relationships grew to over 3.5 million subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">AITA built on that promise, by streamlining the comment section debates from those other subs into a simple, clean voting system: YTA (you’re the asshole), NTA (not the asshole), and ESH (everyone sucks here). (There’s another designation, NAH for “no assholes here,” but that one gets less use. The internet demands villains!) This structure cut down on lots of needless debate and got to the point: Were you the asshole or not?</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>This is meta-gossip: gossip about the <em>idea</em> of a person and about ideas of human nature</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a cultural phenomenon, AITA’s impact has been wide-ranging: It’s been the subject of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24145761/reddit-am-i-the-asshole-moral-philosophy\">philosophical</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/am-i-the-asshole-reddit/\">demographic</a> study; it’s been credited with <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/reading-reddit-relationships-amitheasshole-aita-helps-some-leave-bad-relationships/\">helping people leave</a> their own toxic and unhealthy relationships. The dynamics of the forum itself have spawned their own <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-aita-obsessions/\">obsessive scrutiny</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To an extent, a lot of this is familiar. The recent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/12/27/23520870/gossip-is-back-dont-worry-darling-drama-try-guys-normal-gossip-podcast\">gossip trend</a> aligns perfectly with AITA’s rise in popularity. Yet much of those elements have been about the titillation of knowing the people behind those stories were real, be they petty celebrities engaged in in-fighting or your neighbor’s neighbor’s best friend. AITA, however, along with other recently ascendant phenomena like the hit podcast <em>Normal Gossip</em> and The Cut’s <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/how-i-knew-marriage-over.html\">anonymous confessionals</a>, expand that concept even further. This is meta-gossip: gossip that’s not about a person we know, not about a famous person, and quite frequently not even about a <em>real</em> person. It is gossip in the abstract — gossip about the <em>idea</em> of a person and about ideas of human nature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hardly surprising, then, that this approach easily led to numerous spin-offs in theme and variation; every time you think you’ve reached the end of the offshoots of offshoots of advice subs and curation subs, another one pops up with the slightest variation. For instance, AITA is the central nervous system of the network, but it doesn’t allow users to post a range of content that falls outside of what it deems “interpersonal conflict”; enter <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/\">AITAH</a> — short for “Am I The Asshole <em>Here</em>” — a crucial one-letter distinction, sure, but that sub <em>does</em> allow users to post a wide range of other drama. So, for instance, while AITA might not allow you to ask for advice after you’ve <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f7466d/aita_for_breaking_a_mans_nose_because_he/\">broken a man’s nose</a>, the moderators who approve and deny posts on AITAH will embrace you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alongside the advice subs themselves, curation subreddits for all the advice subs have <em>also</em> exploded. The biggest curation machine on-site is arguably <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/\">r/BestofRedditorUpdates</a> (BORU), which pulls stories from all around the site and even some advice columns off-site. Because BORU isn’t just limited to AITA, it gets a broader range of wild and unbelievable stories, from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/x5opa1/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/\">inappropriate music</a> during sex to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/wcstm8/company_throws_a_corporate_retreat_at_a/\">making your employees do period cosplay at a plantation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These curation subs, too, have been divided into their own areas of focus. If you want your curation to deliver a little more schadenfreude, there’s <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/ohnoconsequences\">r/OhNoConsequences</a>. Want content that’s not just written by an asshole but by a proper spawn of Satan? Try <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/amithedevil\">r/AmITheDevil</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not all of this rapid growth is attributable to the Google bump. A BORU moderator who goes by boringhistoryfan speculated to Vox that the success of these stories is less about search engine magic and more about people seeking engaging material from an easily accessible platform, “wanting content they can relate to and respond to.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Redditor czechtheboxes, another BORU mod, was more direct, explaining that people embrace these twisty tales “for the same reason they like reality TV.” They explained, “They like drama, emotion, and laughs. They get all the excitement without any of the stress of actually being involved in these scenarios. This is just reality TV but in written form.” This hunger for more is an extra boost for the meta-subs, because “having an entire saga compiled in one place makes for easy access to the whole story.” Often those sagas take up multiple posts, spawning entire mini-arcs across the website as updates to what began as a single story become an ongoing narrative. Such updates can be piecemeal, incomplete, and scattered in different places throughout either the forum, a user’s profile, or in comments. It can take work to even find them, much less curate them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s no wonder, then, that increasingly, audiences of this type of melodramatic content are turning toward sources outside of Reddit itself to get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dustin Storm, a.k.a. YouTuber and podcaster <a href=\"https://www.dusty-thunder.com/\">Dusty Thunder</a>, says he was “never a Reddit head.” It was his wife and daughter who loved the site’s stories. “So when they pulled me into this, I essentially became a mouthpiece or a bridge to the other non-Reddit heads because I’m not one.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Storm’s family members had been seeing more and more creators on Instagram and TikTok turn to narrating the Reddit stories they so enjoyed. They encouraged him to start the podcast; now Storm reads posts on his show, curated by his wife and daughter. In order to react authentically to the stories as he reads them on air, Storm actively avoids the Reddit advice subs so he won’t get spoiled. The formula has paid off; since he started his show in 2022, his audience has topped 30,000 subscribers on YouTube and nearly a million TikTok followers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s a different kind of entertainment,” he said. “Instead of tuning into <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>, now they’re jumping on and listening to some of the crazy stories that have been going on Reddit, and it’s just a completely different form of content that people have latched onto. As long as there’s no shortage of drama in the world right now, at least it flows through Reddit.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Storm’s podcast, YouTube, and TikTok are among many dedicated to surfacing this content for broader audiences, including hits like the <em>Two Hot Takes</em> podcast and its various platforms. TikTok has also given rise to an endless array of strange faceless accounts devoted to narrating Reddit stories while playing uncanny footage of, for example, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@reddit.day11/video/7275595186854513962\">racing games</a> or Minecraft <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@scalingstories/video/7410642856676887854\">parkour videos</a>. Want your subreddit drama with a side of food videos? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIyJKhauiQ0\">You can have that, too</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“To me, it’s fake no matter what”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of the off-platform content creators trawl the meta forums because they have serialized stories and a sense (sometimes) of resolution. Their appeal makes sense; not only are Redditors churning out a bottomless well of free content for podcasters and other creators to curate, but the stories themselves reside in that irresistible space between the real and the fictional: just believable enough to seem plausible, but escalated enough to feel like pure escapism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their popularity has expanded beyond the content creator milieu; media outlets like People and The New York Post have generated <a href=\"https://people.com/real-people-family-dynamics\">reams of articles</a> just built on repurposed advice subreddit posts, now repackaged into generalized human interest stories of nameless, faceless gossip. Of course, there’s no way to fact-check the veracity of these Reddit stories. You might think that the growing influx of stories that seem to be total fakes — garish fantasies of revenge or validation — would make them less appealing to readers, but the opposite effect seems to have taken hold. “We aren’t too concerned with whether posts are fake or real and it can become very difficult to tell whether a post is fake or real based on anecdotal evidence,” BORU moderator amireallyreal said. Fans seem to feel the same way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To me, it’s fake no matter what,” Storm said. “It doesn&#8217;t touch me. It doesn’t affect me. It doesn’t change things. So for us, it’s entertainment, number one. And number two, it’s an exercise in being able to make better decisions and relationships. And if it serves that purpose, I give zero shits if it’s real or fake.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Storm acknowledged the difficulty of knowing the veracity of the stories but joked that the wildest ones were probably true. Indeed, my anecdotal experience of reading AITA or BORU usually involves being convinced a post is fake only to encounter multiple people in the comments relating similar experiences; the implausibility of a post often seems to stretch no further than one person’s lived experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ironically, Storm told me that the Dusty Thunder <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/\">subreddit</a>, which they began as an easy way of allowing his audience to submit their own stories to the podcast, had now become an example of the very subreddits the podcast was narrating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We originally started it as kind of a submission portal, but for our community to engage with as well,” he said. “It’s grown well beyond that. I’m sure there are a lot of people on there who have no idea who I am, but it’s taken on a life of its own now.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a strange mini-version of the asshole ecosystem itself: An endless ouroboros of content, both feeding and digesting more and more content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“So some people are using the Dusty Thunder subreddit like AITA,” Storm said, laughing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“And they’re like, yeah, it’s a really weird name. I don’t get it. But I like the stories.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

There’s not a lot the two agree on, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage\">other than a proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As president, both candidates would struggle to make their promised changes unilaterally as taxation is controlled by Congress, not the executive branch. Neither party seems on track to make the type of huge <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">House</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">Senate</a> gains a president would need to ram their agenda through Congress, and it’s possible control continues to be split between parties, a recipe for gridlock. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes these plans more about demonstrating an economic philosophy to voters than anything else. On economic concerns, Trump has led both his Democratic challengers in the polls, and that dominance has proven hard for Democrats to shake; according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/us/politics/trump-and-harris-times-siena-poll.html\">New York Times/Siena College</a> poll conducted last week, Trump leads Harris on the economy by 13 percentage points.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Harris is mostly on Biden’s charted path</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the current vice president, Harris is balancing support for the Biden administration’s policies while differentiating herself where it makes sense politically —&nbsp;essentially trying to chart a path that appeals to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/08/bernie-sanders-harris-capital-gains-tax-trump-election.html\">progressive Democrats calling for higher taxes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/business/dealbook/kamala-harris-capital-gains-tax.html\">wealthy Democratic donors worried about higher taxes</a>, and everyone in between.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far, Harris has said she wants to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set the capital gains tax rate at 28 percent</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set the corporate tax rate at 28 percent&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Give new <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/03/harris-small-business-tax-cuts-00177210\">small businesses</a> a tax break of up to $50,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increase the child tax credit for all parents, including giving new parents a $6,000 credit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eliminate certain taxes on tips</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensure no tax hikes on individuals making less than $400,000&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats have been agitating for some of the above changes for years. Biden, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/harris-economic-proposals/index.html\">proposed raising the capital gains tax</a> — basically, a tax on profit made by selling something, that increases in value over time, like stocks or gold — to 39.6 percent. The current rate is 20 percent, meaning Harris’s proposed rate would be an <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409\">eight percentage point increase</a>. Harris’s proposal comes with some limitations: It would exempt income from stock dividend payouts and would only apply to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/business/dealbook/kamala-harris-capital-gains-tax.html\">taxpayers with $1 million or more in income per year</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s proposed corporate tax rate — the amount corporate entities have to <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/state/combined-federal-state-corporate-tax-rates-2022/#:~:text=Combined%20Federal%20and%20State%20Corporate%20Income%20Tax%20Rates%20in%202022,-September%2027%2C%202022&amp;text=Corporations%20in%20the%20United%20States,at%20a%2021%20percent%20rate.\">pay on their income</a> —  would be a 7 percentage point increase from the current federal rate of 21 percent. That’s in line with Biden’s 2025 budget proposal, as is her proposal for a so-called “billionaire tax” that would impose a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/harris-economic-plan-tax-unrealized-gains.html\">25 percent yearly tax on unrealized gains</a>, or the increase in value of unsold assets like stocks, for people with $100 million or more in assets. New small businesses can currently claim a $5,000 deduction on their taxes, and Harris proposes giving them up to 10 times that. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea here, Harris has said, is to ensure “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/sp-500-could-see-5-earnings-hit-harris-proposed-tax-reforms-says-goldman-sachs-2024-09-05/\">big corporations pay their fair share</a>.” But she has also won plaudits for the plan from key Democratic donors: Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor, praised Harris for “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/4863337-mark-cuban-harris-tax-policy-capital-gains/\">going center 100 percent</a>” after she announced the capital gains tax rate. Her proposals focused on middle-class and low-income Americans reflect a similar, somewhat moderate populism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-economy-taxes-homes-food-prices-insurance-e1ad3f26f2ce8e6cb365a4ffe2ca3e6b\">subsidy for first-time homebuyers</a> is intended to put homeownership in reach of more people, and she has pledged to revive a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23056876/expanded-child-tax-credit-poverty-american-families-impact\">popular pandemic-era expansion</a> of the child tax credit. <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/research/federal-tax/2024-tax-plans/\">Harris’s plan</a> would give parents of newborn children a $6,000 tax credit, those with children between 2 and 5 up to $3,600 in tax credits, and families with kids ages six to 17 up to $3,000. Like Trump, Harris has promised to get rid of taxes on tips, though in a more limited fashion than her competitor: The vice president’s plan would strike federal income taxes on tips, but <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/harris-vs-trump-tax-cuts-take-spotlight-in-battle-to-win-swing-state-votes?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNTg5OTAyMiwiZXhwIjoxNzI2NTAzODIyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSTNZOVdEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFM0I3RTlGRUU4Nzk0QjE0OTkwODZFNDU4REQ1RDQxRCJ9.GVp_rsZVYr6k1VUUk7-1f0T5e2FPExsIK3vmyq8XSWY\">Medicare and Social Security taxes</a> would still be taken out of tipped wages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, Harris would keep individual income tax rates where they are except for Americans making more than $400,000 a year. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-tax-plan.html\">Americans currently in the top tax bracket</a> would see their income taxes returned to the 39.6 percent they were before <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/15/16781062/read-republican-final-tax-bill\">Trump’s 2017 tax cuts</a> (up from 37 percent today), and would also be required to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-tax-plan.html\">pay more Medicare taxes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ostensibly,<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/08/harris-trump-tax-cut-promises\"> higher capital gains and corporate taxes</a> would help make up for the revenue lost to Harris’s planned tax breaks. The proposed child tax credit increase would cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years, and her housing credit plan would cost an estimated $100 billion; all told, according to the <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/kamala-harris-agenda-lower-costs-american-families\">Committee for a Responsible Budget</a>, Harris’s proposal would increase the federal deficit by $1.7 trillion over the next decade.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trump’s plans are geared toward corporations and the ultra-wealthy</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s tax message has been less about finding balance and more about maximalism: lower taxes for businesses, using taxes to promote his “America First” ideology, and going further with populist promises than Democrats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far, Trump says he plans to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Slash some corporate taxes to 15 percent</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Institute a tariff of up to 20 percent on all imports (except those from China, which would have a 60 percent tariff)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Renew the individual tax cuts from 2017, keeping even the highest income tax brackets where they are</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get rid of taxes on Social Security benefits&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>End taxes on tips</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his first term, Trump oversaw a significant change to the US tax code that, among other things, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent. Now, he says that rate should be even lower — just 15 percent — <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/trump-proposal-to-cut-tax-rate-for-u-s-manufacturers-spurs-flurry-of-questions-24ac5cee\">for firms planning to manufacture in the United States</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also plans to revisit and expand another idea from his first term: tariffs. Trump’s<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-imports.html\"> 2018 tariffs on Chinese imports backfired</a>, jumpstarting a trade war with China. This time around, he says he’d like to see tariffs of up to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/business/trump-economy-tariffs/index.html\">60 percent on goods imported from China</a>, as well as a tariff of up to 20 percent on all other imported goods. (Trump has also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/trump-all-tariff-policy-to-replace-income-tax.html\">reportedly contemplated</a> getting rid of income taxes completely and raising tariffs enough to offset the losses such a policy would generate.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has made protecting US industry central to his campaign, but some economists believe his tariff policy could ultimately hurt American consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We should just call them taxes on imports because that’s what they are,” Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic Policy Research, told Vox. “We import $4 trillion of goods every year. So that’s a $400 billion tax increase. That’s really quite a hit that’s overwhelmingly going to moderate-income, middle-class people,” as the ultra-wealthy are more likely to spend their money abroad and on things other than consumer goods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the individual front, Trump promised to extend his 2017 individual tax cuts. Again, Harris wants to extend these for everyone except top earners; Trump would extend them for all Americans, regardless of income. (As those cuts will <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/which-provisions-of-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-expire-in-2025/\">all expire by the end of 2025</a>, Congress will have to figure out what to do about these tax cuts no matter who wins.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has also proposed eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits for senior citizens — which could save a person about $560 per year. But doing so could cost up to $1.8 trillion and <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/donald-trumps-suggestion-end-taxation-social-security-benefits\">further imperil the Social Security fund</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/trumps-plan-to-end-taxes-on-social-security-a-fatal-mistake-lawmaker.html\">set to run out in 2035</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike Harris, Trump hasn’t specified how his policy eliminating taxes on tips would work. Assuming that tips would be exempt from all taxes, however, <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/donald-trumps-proposal-exempt-tip-income-federal-taxes\">his plan could cost up to $250 billion through 2035.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-jd-vance-on-face-the-nation-aug-11-2024/\">JD Vance floated a child tax credit increase</a> of $5,000 per child in a CBS interview, but Trump has yet to endorse that position. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like Harris, it’s not immediately clear how Trump would pay for these changes, which could cost up to<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/06/trump-tax-cuts-deficit/\"> $7 trillion over 10 years</a>. He has floated <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-plan-musk-led-efficiency-commission-could-give-ceo-influence-over-rules-2024-09-06/\">creating a commission</a>, perhaps led by his billionaire ally Elon Musk, to cut waste, and proposed the creation of a <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2024/09/05/trump-floats-us-sovereign-wealth-fund-as-part-of-economic-pitch/\">sovereign wealth fund</a> —&nbsp;essentially, an investment fund on a national level — similar to those in Saudi Arabia and China that would, <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2024/09/05/trump-floats-us-sovereign-wealth-fund-as-part-of-economic-pitch/\">according to Trump</a>, finance “great national endeavors,” pay down the national debt, and fund infrastructure projects —&nbsp;something that would ordinarily be done with tax revenue and congressional appropriations.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Have pollsters learned their lessons from 2016 and 2020? Are there Trump voters that pollsters aren’t reaching? Are the polls biased against Harris? Or is polling and the way media covers it fundamentally broken?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I posed those questions to nine pollsters across the political spectrum and came away with a few frustrating but helpful conclusions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those critical of polling have a point. Predicting the kind of electorate that is going to turn out in any given election is hard. It has been getting harder because of Trump’s ability to turn out the kinds of voters many polls have trouble capturing. There are legitimate concerns about how polls are even conducted, as polling gets more expensive and the number of polls being run grows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, pollsters seem to have learned from the polling misses of the past. They are more conscientious about reaching the hardest-to-reach voters, have reconfigured the way they run their operations, and feel pretty good about capturing a snapshot of a political sentiment in time. They point out that the alternative to a poll-filled world is one where we’re all left trying to define “vibes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Answering the question “Should we trust the polls?” requires addressing several other questions too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is polling is good for?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is polling equipped to do?  </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are we asking polling to capture something it just can’t capture?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to David Byler, a longtime data analyst and pollster for Noble Predictive Insights, trust is the crux of the issue. “It’s really important to define what you mean by ‘trust,’” he told me. “If by ‘trust’ what you mean is ‘Are the polls going to tell me with certainty who is going to win and are they going to eliminate this discomfort I’m feeling about the future?’ the answer is: It’s not perfectly predictive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if trusting the polls means trusting that the polls are telling us something useful, then every pollster I talked to agrees: These tools are measuring something real.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are collecting real data that does capture real sentiments and asks people pertinent questions, and they&#8217;re the kind of questions that you can&#8217;t really ask with any other tool that we use for political analysis,” Byler said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The case for polling skepticism</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the eve of the 2016 election, national&nbsp;polls agreed that Hillary Clinton would comfortably win the popular vote, while battleground polls showed she had small leads against Donald Trump in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, but a big lead in Wisconsin. The national polls were right; the battleground picture was not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Something different happened in 2020: National polls agreed Joe Biden was way ahead of Trump, but he was also routinely posting large leads in the battlegrounds. Many of those swing states would end up being decided by very narrow margins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In response to those polling misses, pollsters have been doing a lot of work to avoid the same problems. As we head into November, though, those old worries persist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The phrase I heard most in my conversations was a worry about “solving for the last problem” or “fighting the last battle.” In other words, lessons have been learned, but will those lessons apply this time around?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2016, for example, pollsters addressed some of the reasons they overestimated Mitt Romney’s performance in 2012 but missed that state-level surveys were overrepresenting college graduates. That miss ended up artificially boosting Hillary Clinton’s support, especially in the Midwest battleground states that proved decisive. Voters who made their minds up in the final days of the 2016 election also ended up breaking for Trump, meaning their support wasn’t registering in polling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, amid the pandemic, new problems popped up: At both the state and national levels, polls overestimated Biden and Democrats’ level of support, but that disparity could not be explained by the same reasons as in 2012 or 2016. Late-deciding respondents were as likely to support Biden as Trump, and neither inaccurate weighting by education nor inaccurate estimates of the electorate as a whole were the culprits, per an <a href=\"https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AAPOR-Task-Force-on-2020-Pre-Election-Polling_Report-FNL.pdf\">industry postmortem on polling</a> published in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what happened?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Worry No. 1: Nonresponse bias</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The likely culprit in 2020 was what pollsters call nonresponse bias — that Trump supporters in general may be less likely to participate in polls, resulting in their systematic underrepresentation in polling samples.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to navigate peak poll season</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As we navigate through the home stretch of the general election season, we’re likely going to be inundated with a bunch of polling at the district, state, and national levels. After talking to pollsters for the last year, here’s my best distillation of tips for reading the polls.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remember that any poll is a snapshot in time; it’s capturing sentiment for the specific time it was out in the field. It is not predictive of what happens weeks from now</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don’t stress too much about any one poll; take them in aggregate, like through the polling averages at <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">RealClearPolitics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">Silver Bulletin</a>, and <a href=\"https://split-ticket.org/2024/09/05/our-2024-polling-aggregators-and-how-they-work/\">Split Ticket</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re reading a poll, check the sample sizes and methodologies. Is it large enough (usually at least 1,000 is a good national sample)? Is it of registered voters or likely voters (the latter is usually better closer to the election)? Was it conducted by telephone, online panel, text, or a combination of methods (a combination of methods can be better)?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check the firm that conducted the poll. Is it partisan? Reputable? FiveThirtyEight has <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/\">useful ratings</a> for the quality of pollsters’ work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don’t forget the margin of error: Percentage-point leads that fall within a margin of error can’t be taken as gospel. And keep margins of error in mind when comparing polls over time: Shifts aren’t always real.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same bias may likely cause problems for 2024 polling, according to some pollsters I spoke with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The idea that people who support Donald Trump may be less likely to take polls than people who support Democratic candidates does seem to have some validity,” Scott Keeter, a senior survey adviser at the Pew Research Center, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a number of reasons to think this bias still applies today, despite pollsters’ attempts to account for it. Generally speaking, Trump voters tend to be less trusting of institutional figures like pollsters and journalists, and so may be less willing to answer these surveys. More specifically, Trump himself routinely attacks polling and pollsters in public remarks, further ingraining that distrust in his supporters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some experts, like the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, warn that there are specific states where this nonresponse bias may have a bigger effect because of the nature of the electorate and the way data is captured there. Places like <a href=\"https://www.patrickruffini.com/p/how-will-we-know-if-the-polls-are\">Wisconsin and North Carolina,</a> he told me, have a concentration of the kinds of voters that polls have tended to underestimate: rural and suburban white, working-class, and non-college-educated voters. And Wisconsin specifically doesn’t track partisan data in voter files, either through party registration or a record of which primary a voter might have participated in before — meaning it’s harder for pollsters to weight their samples.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What you might be getting in a lot of cases is you’re talking to a particularly Democratic-leaning type of white, working-class voter that does exist in Wisconsin, and you’re not capturing the Trump-leaning type,” Ruffini said. “And there are fewer tools in our toolbox to be able to correct for that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Worry No. 2: Unlikely and late-deciding voters</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another issue haunting polling in 2024 is that pollsters don’t necessarily know who the unlikely voters and late-deciding voters will be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polls of likely voters factor in experts’ best estimates of what the electorate in November will look like, but the last few years have shown that turnout can vary significantly from cycle to cycle. Few observers expected a surge in rural and suburban white Trump voters in 2016, for example; and some independent voters decided to turn out relatively late in the 2022 midterms cycle, contributing to better-than-expected congressional results for Democrats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Biden’s exit from the race and Harris’s ascension, voter registrations and energy from younger people, people of color, and women voters have all surged, likely in Democrats’ favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those shifts all suggest changes in momentum and enthusiasm, but according to Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster who co-led polling for Biden’s 2020 campaign, whether these people turn out in November is an open question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Whether an abortion issue is on the state ballot really increases the turnout of young women,” Lake said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Worry No. 3: Hard-to-poll subgroups</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A fundamental part of the “trust the polls” question comes from how polls are covered in the political press. Big headlines about what’s happening to young voters, Hispanic voters, and Black voters get a lot of traction but are often based on analysis of data in the crosstabs of a poll, not necessarily of whole polls dedicated just to this subgroup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s often because polling specific segments of the electorate is expensive and impractical. You need a variety of methods to reach young people who won’t pick up phone calls from random numbers or to reach Hispanic Americans who may work odd hours and don’t necessarily speak English as their first language. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, looking at those crosstab results can yield conclusions with margins of error much larger than those of a poll’s topline results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So when you see big conclusions being drawn from a small number of respondents in a national poll, it helps to be extra cautious. I’ve written before about the difficulty of polling <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24125496/young-voters-trump-biden-polling\">young people</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23873568/biden-polling-black-latino-voters-2024-election-trump\">voters</a> of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24091684/democrats-latino-voters-trump-biden-polling\">color</a>; though coverage of polling news has improved, the focus on the horse race can run roughshod over nuance and lead to sweeping — if unearned — conclusions about what the polls are saying.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The case for trusting what the polls say</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With all these caveats, it can be tempting to just reject polling outright. But polling is still the most useful tool we have to gauge where the electorate is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling’s usefulness starts with understanding what it can tell us. In a polarized country, “you&#8217;re just not seeing as many large swings [in public opinion],” Mike Noble, an Arizona pollster and the founder of Noble Predictive Insights, told me. But polling is still well-equipped to take temperature checks. “[It is a good tool] to track trends,” he added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They may not be perfect, but there are still reasons to trust polling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reason No. 1: Polling still gives a good snapshot of reality</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though polling’s predictive capabilities aren’t as exact as consumers might want them to be, it still does a pretty good job at describing reality, pollsters told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A good example is the 2022 midterms, when polling captured a surge in Democratic enthusiasm to vote after the Supreme Court’s <em>Dobbs</em> decision. Polls and polling aggregates captured this reversal in Democratic performance as it unfolded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Keeter explains, predicting an election “where the public is divided almost 50-50” is challenging because the result will be decided by just a few points likely within the margin of error. However, issue polling, where public opinion might not be so closely divided, is easier to read.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you&#8217;re trying to say, ‘Does a majority of the public support abortion rights?’ if the poll is 5 percent off from whatever the hypothetical truth is or maybe even a little more than that, you still get a pretty good idea that a majority of people do support abortion rights,” Keeter said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even in 2016, when polling took a major reputational hit, national polls still captured a pretty accurate picture of how the national popular vote would break. Electoral College outcomes at a state level have been far tighter, though; consequently, Nick Gourevitch, who oversees polling at the top Democratic firm Global Strategy Group, told me, “You have to live with the fact that you&#8217;re not going to know the answer to who’s going to win the election, but [polling] is still a really valuable tool.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like Keeter, Gourevitch points out that polling is potentially more useful when it comes to issues rather than presidential races, and that type of polling may be more helpful to campaigns and to candidates actually working on these issues, other pollsters told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reason No. 2: Pollsters are always refining their methods&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everyone I talked to for this story started by telling me that the way the polling industry operates today looks very different from 2016, from 2020, and even from 2022. Pollsters now use more methods and tools to try to reach voters and are constantly watching changes in voter registration, taking into account how the likely electorate might be changing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Pollsters we work with and talk to are trying to take all these things into account,” Margie Omero, a partner at the Democratic polling firm GBAO, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We look at the people who don&#8217;t take surveys or who are harder to reach. We ask what might happen if you&#8217;re doing a poll conducted over a longer period of time. You&#8217;re trying to reach people multiple ways, so not just the easiest people to reach. You&#8217;re comparing how your poll demographics compare to the larger universe, not just folks who are super likely to vote.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Reason No. 3: Looking at polls in the aggregate, or as an average, is still very useful</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since every poll is a snapshot in time, when taken together they can offer a lot more clarity about the trends in a presidential cycle than when taken individually.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling aggregates and averages, like those run by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">RealClearPolitics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">Silver Bulletin</a>, and <a href=\"https://split-ticket.org/2024/09/05/our-2024-polling-aggregators-and-how-they-work/\">Split Ticket</a>, offer consumers a filter through which they can see what all the high-quality public opinion research is saying. This can help to correct some of the quirks or troubles that individual polls might have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling aggregates are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/opinion/harris-trump-polls.html\">different from election forecasts</a> — which try to go a step beyond aggregating polls and averaging them out to try to predict additional vibes-based factors — but can still provide a useful look at where an election stands.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to be a savvy poll-reader</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The good news for polling addicts is that the quality and frequency of polling will likely improve later in the election cycle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Post-Labor Day, polls tend to be a lot less noisy: The public is tuning back into the election; political news, ad spending, and campaigning are all ramping up; and after both national party conventions, the public will likely get to see at least one more presidential debate. Early voting will begin in many states by the end of the month, and these next nine weeks will see an explosion in polling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As November bears down, the pollsters I spoke with gave me the same set of tips for consuming polls. First, look at the sample size. Is it large enough (usually 1,000 people is good) to capture sentiments? Is it of likely voters (usually a better metric closer to the election) or registered voters? Are the conclusions being reported in write-ups that are overblown (making large demographic conclusions based on small samples) or presented with appropriate skepticism?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, look at the methodology. Was a poll conducted by telephone, online panel, or text? Was it a combination of methods? Multi-modal polling tends to be more accurate than any single method. If it’s an online poll, was the sample drawn from an opt-in group (where people sign up to take a poll) or a probability-based panel (a sample drawn randomly from a large national database)? Probability-based samples <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2023/09/07/comparing-two-types-of-online-survey-samples/\">tend</a> to be <a href=\"https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sampling-Methods-for-Political-Polling-508.pdf\">better</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which firm conducted the poll? Referring to pollster rankings and ratings like <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/\">those offered by FiveThirtyEight</a> can be helpful here to discount junk polls or outliers. Check for partisan affiliations. Those can influence the decision to release a poll or not (some outlets have scrutinized specific <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/trafalgar-group-founder-robert-cahaly-on-the-2022-midterms.html\">Republican</a>&#8211;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/08/rasmussen-538-polling/\">aligned</a> firms).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Third, make sure not to miss the margin of error. Part of why polls can’t be too specific is because their topline results exist in a range of possibilities. That’s why movement within a margin of error can’t count as real change; if one poll has a margin of error of +/- 3 points and reports a 49-46 result, a second poll with the same margin of error reporting a 51-48 shift can’t immediately be taken as proof of a real improvement since the shift is covered by the potential error.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last of all, remain skeptical of polls as prophecy. According to Byler, “We&#8217;re in this era of incredibly close elections where no major-party presidential candidate is gonna go below 42 or 43 percent of the vote, so you end up in a situation where, because of polarization [and Electoral College <a href=\"https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/a-brief-history-of-electoral-college-bias/\">bias for Republicans</a>], both major-party candidates are always within striking distance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re just not in a world where polls provide that kind of 100 percent, 0 percent win probability,” he said. “You can get odds, you can get probabilities, you can get sort of levels of certainty. But we’re in an incredibly polarized moment, and [polling] is just not a precision tool that can provide certainty.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

On Monday morning, Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833148904864465117\">posted</a> on X the false claim that “reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” In the same tweet, he claimed that “Haitian illegal immigrants” are “causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the record, there is no evidence that any Haitian immigrant ate a cat in Springfield, Ohio, or anywhere else in the United States, for that matter. But the lack of factual evidence hasn’t stopped the GOP from pushing the nativist narrative, which seems designed to play off bigotry and suspicion against the mostly Black population of Haitian immigrants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More than 300,000 previously unauthorized migrants from Haiti <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/g-s1-7061/migrants-haiti-tps-immigration-parole\">received temporary protected status in June</a>, which means these Haitian immigrants are now — despite Vance’s suggestion otherwise — legally present in the United States. Still, Vance and other Republicans’ attacks on these immigrants come at a moment when more <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris\">Americans have grown skeptical of immigration</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shortly after President Joe Biden took office, the United States experienced a surge of migrants at its southern border — much of it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality\">fueled by unrest</a> in several Caribbean and Latin American nations following the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans used this wave of migration to attack Biden’s border policies, and to claim there was a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality\">crisis at the border</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/9/26/23875580/new-york-city-migrant-crisis-influx-eric-adams\">busing efforts</a> by Republican leaders in border states sent large groups of migrants to cities and towns across the country, putting many Americans face to face with migrants <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24063986/cities-migrant-crisis-border-overwhelmed-shelters\">for the first time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this comes amid a competitive 2024 presidential race, where both candidates have rushed to frame themselves as tough on immigration. Former President Donald Trump has long <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris\">campaigned on restricting immigration</a>, while Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/369177/democrats-kamala-harris-truce-immigration-progressive-border-security\">touted a strict border security bill</a> that she supports — and which Trump pushed his fellow Republicans to kill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These factors — perhaps most of all the rise in anti-immigrant sentiment — probably explain why a sitting senator felt it was wise to share a meme claiming that if Americans don’t vote for former President Donald Trump, immigrants will eat your cats.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where the hell did the false claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets come from?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea that Haitians are roaming the streets kidnapping pets seems to have emerged from Vance’s state of Ohio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Springfield’s Police Division said on Monday that there have been <a href=\"https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/springfield-police-say-no-reports-of-pets-stolen-after-viral-social-media-post/3WSIZQNHQVE4NP4TS5BVHBB2PY/\">no reports</a> of any pets being stolen or eaten in that city. However, there apparently was an incident in Canton, Ohio — a nearly three-hour drive from Springfield — where a woman was charged with cruelty to animals for allegedly killing and eating a cat. But there’s no evidence that this woman is an immigrant or of Haitian descent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite that lack of evidence, the woman appears to have been identified as of Haitian descent in <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/how-did-fake-news-about-haitian-migrants-eating-cats-spread-from-a-malaysian-propagandist-to-jd-vance/\">far-right tweets</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent days, the completely unsubstantiated slur against Haitian immigrants began to spread outside of far-right spaces after several prominent right-wing figures credulously tweeted it out. On Sunday, provocateur Charlie Kirk <a href=\"https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1832883283199471676\">tweeted the claim</a>, including a screenshot from a pseudonymous Facebook post suggesting that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are butchering and eating dogs. Shortly thereafter, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1832968811890237947\">billionaire Elon Musk</a> chimed in to claim that “people’s pet cats are being eaten.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By Monday morning, the claim had spread to Vance — before being picked up by other prominent elected Republicans and official Republican Party accounts.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Republicans want nativist sentiment to be front and center in this election</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance has long sought to stoke anti-Haitian sentiment in Springfield, a small Ohio city that recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/springfield-ohio-school-bus-crash-haiti-immigrants.html\">attracted as many as 20,000 Haitians</a> seeking jobs in newly opened factories and warehouses. Tensions grew between the new immigrants and some of the city’s more longtime residents after a Haitian immigrant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a fatal bus crash in 2023. Vance has claimed that the city is “overwhelmed” by the new residents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, skepticism of immigration <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris\">spiked nationally</a> in recent years as the amount of migration at the southern border grew.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/temp.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.137387245316,100,51.725225509367\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicole Narea/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So it’s not surprising that many prominent members of the Republican Party, a party that frequently <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/rnc-trump-rachel-morin-family-speech-1926639\">flags isolated crimes committed by immigrants</a> to fuel nativist sentiment, latched onto an unfounded internet rumor about Haitians and cats as “proof” that immigrants present a problem (that Republicans can fix).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, none of this context changes the fact that Republicans at the pinnacle of the party, including sitting US senators and even one of the party’s two nationwide candidates, see no downside to spreading racist, completely unfounded rumors based on random social media posts spread by far-right trolls.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Dominique Pelicot — who has <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/france-victim-testifies-in-gruesome-rape-trial/a-70158198\">confessed to raping his wife repeatedly</a> over the course of a decade — is now on trial, along with 50 other defendants, who are also accused of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault. Some of these defendants have admitted guilt, while others have denied it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although she <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/france-man-accused-strangers-rape-wife-intl-latam/index.html\">had the option of a private trial</a>,<strong> </strong>Gisèle Pelicot decided to make the proceedings public in order to support and raise awareness for other victims of similar crimes. “I speak for all women who are drugged and don’t know about it, I do it on behalf of all women who will perhaps never know,” Gisèle Pelicot said of her case. In total, police have used roughly 20,000 images her husband took of the assaults to determine that 72 men had been involved in raping her from 2011 to 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Pelicot case is roiling France and comes as the country continues to grapple with accountability regarding sexual misconduct toward women. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/movies/judith-godreche-metoo-abuse-france.html\">As the New York Times reported</a> this spring, the #MeToo movement had previously stalled in France’s film industry, and has found new momentum this year after prominent actor and director Judith Godrèche spoke out. French writers and actors have also previously noted that the country’s attitudes toward sexual freedom have distinguished it from the US in how condemning sexual misconduct is treated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“French attitudes toward morality and sex have historically always been different to the US,” journalist Agnès Poirier <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240522-cannes-film-festival-frances-divisive-reckoning-with-metoo\">previously told the BBC</a>. “But it’s been brewing for years and it feels that 2024 is different.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What the case is</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dominique Pelicot’s assaults on his wife were first discovered by police in November 2020, after he was initially investigated for taking photos up women’s skirts at a supermarket in southeastern France, where the couple lived.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After he was caught taking the photos, police searched Pelicot’s computer and found a folder titled “Abuses” on a related USB drive. In it, they discovered thousands of photos and videos of Pelicot and other men raping his wife while she was unconscious. “My world fell apart,” Gisèle Pelicot said after police informed her of their discovery.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The officers’ findings followed years of Gisèle Pelicot experiencing memory lapses, hair loss, and weight loss, so much so she feared that she might be developing Alzheimer’s or another serious illness. During that time, her husband had been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trial-rape-drug-france-husband-wife-5ad00446b8a76f0c8d14f349df9147e3\">drugging her regularly</a> with a combination of medications, including the anti-anxiety drug Temesta, which can act like a sedative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Gisèle Pelicot was unconscious, Dominique Pelicot invited a number of men to their home so that they could rape her. Gisèle Pelicot has emphasized that she did not have any knowledge of these attacks, and did not feign unconsciousness as some of the defendants have suggested. Dominique Pelicot found the men via a messaging board called “Without their knowledge” on the now-shuttered website Coco, which was known for postings that involved illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the site, Dominique Pelicot solicited men to assault his wife, giving them specific instructions, including not wearing perfume or smoking, to avoid detection. The identities of these defendants haven’t been revealed, though authorities note that they range from the ages of 26 to 74, that many have partners, and that they come from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, including firefighters, journalists, and soldiers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In their search of his computer, police also found naked photos of Dominique and Gisèle Pelicot’s daughter, Caroline Darian.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s happened so far</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gisèle Pelicot and Darian both took the stand last week, and offered harrowing testimony about the assaults. “Frankly, these are scenes of horror for me,” Gisèle Pelicot said of the videos and photos her husband took to document the rapes. “They treat me like a rag doll.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to learning of the attacks, Gisèle Pelicot had said that she had believed that she and her husband of roughly 50 years had been a close couple. Dominique Pelicot has admitted the abuse and also told a psychologist that he did it because Gisèle Pelicot had rejected swinging, or sleeping with other people outside their marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gisèle Pelicot says the decision to release her identity and to speak publicly about the case was intended to show that survivors shouldn’t be ashamed of the abuse they’ve suffered. Handling the case anonymously is “what her attackers would have wanted,” her lawyers said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Darian also described the horror she felt upon learning what her father had done, calling him “the worst sexual predator of the last 20 years.” Both emphasized fears that they wouldn’t be able to regain any sense of stability or safety in relationships. “I no longer have an identity. … I don’t know if I’ll ever rebuild myself,” Gisèle Pelicot said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The defendants have been charged with aggravated rape or attempted rape, with many <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/france-rape-case-gisele-pelicot-husband-dominique-trial-drugging-mass-rape/\">facing 20 years in prison if convicted</a>. The trial is set to continue until December as the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-09-05/a-french-woman-whose-husband-is-accused-of-inviting-men-to-rape-her-testifies-in-court\">defendants make their testimony in groups.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How the case factors into larger movements in France</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Pelicot case is just the latest to raise awareness of sexual abuses in France this year, after multiple cases of sexual misconduct by prominent actors and directors came to light.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since February, several high-profile French actresses, including Godrèche, have spoken about being sexually assaulted in their teens by film directors. Notably, Godrèche was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/france-cinema-metoo-sexual-abuse-godreche-e215e51b38c9500c9ac032be99d4e0f0\">invited to make remarks about this problem</a> at the Cesar Awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, and was received with a standing ovation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“After years in which the American #MeToo movement gained traction while in France it languished,” Rokhaya Diallo, a French journalist, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/03/27/france-me-too-film-actresses/\">wrote of Godrèche for the Washington Post</a>, “this reception signaled that perhaps the larger culture here is finally ready to push back.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such shifts come as France has been more resistant to confronting sexual abuses in the same way the US has, with some <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/metoo-france/story?id=66843843\">French commentators</a> dubbing the #MeToo movement the latest extension of puritanical American culture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Godrèche’s speech and the Pelicot case, as well multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against famous French actor Gérard Depardieu, have put a new spotlight on the subject. <a href=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20240314-macron-vows-to-integrate-consent-into-french-legislation-on-sexual-assault\">Women’s rights advocates</a> have also urged lawmakers to add the term “consent” into the legal definition of rape, a move that French President Emmanuel Macron has said he supports. Currently, French law <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-activists-call-on-france-to-endorse-a-consent-based-rape-definition-across-the-entire-european-union/\">defines rape as</a> “an act of sexual penetration… committed on a person, with violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“While there is still perhaps more skepticism in France than in the US about the legitimacy of sexual assault and sexual harassment, these attitudes are changing fast, especially as a younger generation of women and French feminists and their male allies … are willing to confront these issues head-on,” Laura Frader, a professor of history emerita at Northeastern University who studies gender attitudes in Europe, told Vox. “The Pelicot case is certain to contribute to this trend.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The last act of Congress funding the federal government <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/09/congress-government-spending-shutdown-deadline/\">expires on September 30</a>. So, unless Congress passes new funding legislation by then, much of the government will shut down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4850815-proof-of-citizenship-voting-bill-government-shutdown/\">egged on by the House Freedom Caucus</a> and by <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/03/30/no-big-wave-immigrants-voting-illegally-trump\">former President Donald Trump</a>, reportedly wants to use this deadline to force through legislation that would make it harder to register to vote in all 50 states. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Johnson plans to pair a bill funding the government for six months with a Republican bill called the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act” or “<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8281/text\">SAVE Act</a>,” that would require new voters to submit “documentary proof of United States citizenship,” such as a passport or a birth certificate, in order to register to vote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no evidence that noncitizens vote in US federal elections in any meaningful numbers, and states typically have safeguards in place to prevent them from doing so. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, for example, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/noncitizen-voting-is-extremely-rare-yet-republicans-are-making-it-a-major-election-concern\">claims to have identified 1,634 “potential noncitizens”</a> who attempted to register during a 15-year period. But these possible noncitizens were caught by election officials and were never registered. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/georgia/\">nearly 5 million Georgians voted</a> in the presidential election. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More broadly, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, “illegal registration and voting attempts by noncitizens are routinely investigated and prosecuted by the appropriate state authorities, and there is <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/five-things-to-know-about-the-save-act/\">no evidence that attempts at voting by noncitizens</a> have been significant enough to impact any election’s outcome.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While noncitizen voting — which is, of course, illegal — has never been proven to have affected an election, there is evidence that the SAVE Act could have an impact on elections. That much is clear from Arizona, which already has a SAVE Act-like regime. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota\">Data from Arizona</a> suggests the state’s law has made it slightly harder for people of color, a group that skews Democratic, to vote. And at least one analysis of Arizona voter data suggests that the SAVE Act could <a href=\"https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/12/18/arizona-federal-only-voters-concentrated-college-campuses-proof-of-citizenship/\">suppress voter registration among another group that tends to vote for Democrats</a>: college students. So the bill could make it slightly more difficult for Democrats to win elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, the SAVE Act law does have a vague provision allowing voters who “cannot provide” the required documentation to submit other evidence that they are a citizen, and it provides that state or local officials “shall make a determination as to whether the applicant has sufficiently established United States citizenship.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s unclear what, exactly, that means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, the SAVE Act would <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/five-things-to-know-about-the-save-act/\">take effect immediately if enacted by Congress</a>, and it imposes significant new administrative burdens on state and local election offices. So, if the law did take effect in the two months before a presidential election, it could potentially throw that election into chaos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, that outcome is unlikely. Axios reports that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/25/mcconnell-republicans-save-act-immigrant-voting\">opposed</a> to making continued funding for the US government contingent on passing the SAVE Act. Most Democrats and President Joe Biden also oppose the bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the battle over the SAVE Act could put the US in danger of a government shutdown. And though it is unlikely to become law in the next two months, it is likely to be on the short list of bills that Republicans will be eager to turn into law should they prevail in this November’s election.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How would the SAVE Act actually impact US elections?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the SAVE Act became law, it would likely only have a marginal impact on election results — although even a modest shift in who is allowed to vote could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota\">potentially flip very close elections</a>, particularly in swing states. On its face, the bill addresses a non-problem — again, there are no legitimate concerns about noncitizen voting in the United States. And most voters do have some documentation they could use to register under the SAVE Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Arizona offers a useful window into what voting might be like under the SAVE Act. In 2004, the state enacted a SAVE Act-like law requiring new voters to submit documentary proof of citizenship to register. This law, however, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota\">conflicts with a federal law</a> which requires states to register voters who submit a standardized federal form. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona could not prevent voters who register using this form from voting in federal elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Arizona, however, responded to this decision by creating a second-class tier of voters. Arizona voters who submit the federal form without documentary proof of citizenship are allowed to vote in federal elections (for Congress and the president), but not in state elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Data from Arizona suggests that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota\">non-white voters</a> (who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans) are more likely to be registered as federal-only voters than white voters. But college students appear to be hardest hit by Arizona’s two-tiered regime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A report by Votebeat, a news outlet that reports on election administration, found that most Arizona voting precincts have fewer than a dozen total federal-only voters. But, “of the dozen outliers with more than 300 federal-only voters,” Votebeat reports that “<a href=\"https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/12/18/arizona-federal-only-voters-concentrated-college-campuses-proof-of-citizenship/\">all but one are located at least partly on a college campus</a>.” The one exception was a Phoenix precinct that includes a homeless shelter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This conclusion is intuitive. College students who leave home to earn their degree often do not bring their passport or birth certificate to school with them, so they are unable to submit it when they register to vote. (People without permanent housing are also likely not to have immediate access to these documents because they do not have a home to store them in.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a close election, a law disenfranchising many college students could be dispositive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the razor-thin 2000 election, for example, official tallies showed that President George W. Bush <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-bush-v-gore-anniversary\">won the crucial state of Florida by 537 votes</a>. Meanwhile, the University of Florida alone <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-florida-1535/student-life#:~:text=University%20of%20Florida%20has%20a,students%20and%2056%25%20female%20students.\">enrolls nearly 35,000 undergraduates</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, while the SAVE Act wouldn’t do much to address the fake problem of noncitizen voting, it would have at least some impact on US elections.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Her <em>Cowboy Carter</em> topped the country chart — a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/beyonce-tops-billboard-country-chart-genre-debut-texas-hold-em-rcna139791\">historic first</a> for a Black woman singing country — and spent 22 weeks on the Billboard top 200 album ranking. Yet despite the CMAs giving nominations to other pop crossover artists, including Post Malone and Shaboozey, the voting body denied <em>Cowboy Carter</em> nominations in any category.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rejection marks the second time the CMAs and its audience have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/4/13521928/beyonce-cma-awards-controversy-deleted-performance\">clashed with Beyoncé</a>. But while the 2016 backlash over her CMA performance with the Chicks arguably stemmed from tension over the artists’ political identities, it’s hard to chalk this snub up to anything but <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/05/professor-coins-new-word-misogynoir/\">misogynoir</a> at its most blatant — especially in a year that saw both Malone (in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/355306/post-malone-beyonce-taylor-swift-morgan-wallen\">chart-topping collab</a> with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political\">Morgan Wallen</a>) and Shaboozey nominated for Single of the Year.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are several complicating factors that may have contributed to the CMA’s diss of <em>Cowboy Carter</em>. But it’s also clear that sometimes the simplest explanation may be the truest.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Cowboy Carter</em> may have suffered from a lack of promotion</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lead single off <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, “Texas Hold ’Em,” had just about the biggest release boost ever — a drop during the Super Bowl on February 11, 2024. That date is important, because while the song immediately lit up the charts and saw significant radio play, it <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/country/beyonces-new-music-will-country-radio-play-1235607096/\">took two days</a>, per Billboard, before country radio stations actually received copies of the song from Beyoncé’s label, Parkwood, via Sony Nashville. As <a href=\"https://savingcountrymusic.com/dispelling-the-myth-that-country-radio-rejected-beyonce/\">detailed</a> in the industry blog Saving Country Music, the media narrative that swiftly coalesced of country radio refusing to play the song wasn’t actually accurate. Rather, due to the way the song was positioned initially — it was first cataloged as a pop song rather than a country song, and serviced first to pop stations — it took a week before most country stations added the song to their playlists. When that finally happened, <a href=\"https://assets.countryaircheck.com/public/5b95283f-18ab-4631-91a8692368c2871b/1863e111-7269-466b-98fa9338bbc386fa/Issue-897-February-20-2024.pdf\">on February 20</a>, the song received radio play on 79 country music stations across the country, and debuted atop Billboard’s Hot Country Songs charts. Beyoncé’s label even took out an industry ad to thank them:</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-at-12.37.24 PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.393647759119,100,39.212704481762\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Beyonce’s promotional thank you to country stations during the week of the country radio debut of “Texas Hold ’Em.” | Country Air Check\" data-portal-copyright=\"Country Air Check\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Billboard noted, “Country radio has traditionally been reluctant to play songs that aren’t serviced to them or then actively promoted by the label.” Billboard further pointed out that Beyoncé didn’t heavily promote her 2016 crossover single “Daddy Lessons” either, which may have contributed to its lackluster performance on the country charts at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That lack of promotional energy may have hurt <em>Cowboy Carter</em> in the long run. Although the album was a hit, it slid rapidly down the Billboard ranks and faced tough competition from artists like Wallen and Taylor Swift — particularly in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/359734/female-pop-stars-charts-billboard-rap-country-popularity\">a male-dominated year</a> that saw men sweeping charts and receiving tons of radio play despite a bumper crop of new releases from female artists.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyoncé’s label seemed disinclined to promote the album or its songs beyond the initial drops: “Texas Hold ’Em” received no follow-up music video, and Beyoncé did no regional promotion or in-person radio drop-ins to boost the song’s recognition to radio listeners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of this is understandable as falling within Beyoncé’s brand; her superstardom is powered as much by mystique and glamor as her artistry itself. That mystique lends itself to abrupt album drops with little promotion, but not to over-exposure through traditional industry channels like radio. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, there also seemed to be a deliberate choice on Beyoncé’s part to actively disengage from promoting <em>Cowboy Carter</em> as a country album — quite literally, in that she initially <a href=\"https://ca.billboard.com/music/country/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-cover-art-1235636280/\">announced</a> it by saying, “This ain’t a country album, it’s a Beyoncé album.” If she intended for her fans to make the argument that, in fact, it <em>was</em> a country album, that tactic worked; fans swiftly got Apple Music to change its initial designation of the songs from “pop” to “country,” and pushed <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4518998-petition-country-stations-beyonce-songs/\">a petition</a> to get the album more radio play to over 27,000 signatures. If industry insiders didn’t feel sufficiently catered to, though, that sense of being overlooked could easily have translated to a lackluster response when the CMA voting rolled around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s another explanation for all of this, though — and it’s the one you’re thinking of.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>(Straight) male crossover artists, including Black artists, tend to be welcomed at the CMAs</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s no secret that the country music industry has a longstanding problem with excluding artists of color. The CMAs specifically famously snubbed first Beyoncé for “Daddy Lessons” (which was itself <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11526188/beyonce-country-music-black-roots\">a musical lesson</a> in the erasure of Black artists from country history) in 2016 and then Lil Nas X in 2019. The CMAs <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/30/20838444/lil-nas-x-country-music-association-awards-nominations-billy-ray-cyrus\">rejected Lil Nas</a> from every musical category while giving him a nod for his collaboration on the song with Billy Ray Cyrus — effectively suggesting that he owed the song’s massive success to a white man and not his own merit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That this happened several months after Lil Nas came out as gay might also have factored into the equation, given that other straight Black male artists like Darius Rucker have found success and a warm country welcome in Nashville. Artists like Charley Pride and Ray Charles have also broken boundaries in the genre, though the fact they were already huge stars prior to turning their talents to country might have been a factor as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Lil Nas snub also puts this year’s CMAs — in which Beyoncé’s own Black male collaborator, Shaboozey, got multiple top award noms — into sharp perspective. Shaboozey, a Nigerian American multi-genre artist, got a huge boost into the mainstream from collaborating with Beyoncé on two songs on <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, and then saw his single “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” go viral; it was hailed as one of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/363120/charli-xcx-chappell-roan-song-summer\">the (many) songs of the 2024 summer</a> and received a <a href=\"https://www.effinghamradio.com/2024/09/08/shaboozeys-a-bar-song-tipsy-breaks-carrie-underwoods-record-by-topping-country-airplay-chart-for-7th-week/\">record-breaking amount of radio play</a> across country radio. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By first boosting and promoting, and then nominating, Shaboozey’s work on the back of his collaboration with Beyoncé, the industry seems to be sending a message, however inadvertent it might be, that the artistry of Black women lags behind that of their straight male counterparts. That’s quite a statement to make about <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, an album that features country legends like Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That goes without saying. Thank you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Beyonce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Beyonce</a> for opening a door for us, starting a conversation, and giving us one of the most innovative country albums of all time!</p>&mdash; Shaboozey (@ShaboozeysJeans) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaboozeysJeans/status/1833149046933848172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s also undeniable that the industry is more hospitable to male pop crossover artists. Post Malone has come under fire for collaborations that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/355306/post-malone-beyonce-taylor-swift-morgan-wallen\">appropriate styles</a> from Black artists, a problem that stands uncomfortably next to his collaboration with Wallen, whose incredible career boost following his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political\">n-word scandal</a> is arguably an interlinked issue. Yet country fans had little trouble embracing Malone and Wallen’s “I Had Some Help,” and the CMAs rewarded the song with <a href=\"https://holler.country/news/breaking/post-malone-earns-first-ever-cma-awards-nominations-for-i-had-some-help/\">four total nominations</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, while Beyoncé has undoubtedly opened doors for artists including Shaboozey, the progress of Black women in country remains fraught. While the industry has <a href=\"https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/calendar/an-evening-with-valerie-june-rachael-davis-thao-and-yasmin-williams\">upheld</a> Black artists like Valerie June, Mickey Guyton, and Yasmin Williams, it has yet to bestow CMA awards on any of them. Last year, legend <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/9/24065282/tracy-chapman-song-fast-car-grammys-meaning\">Tracy Chapman and her iconic song “Fast Car”</a> became the first Black woman in history to win a CMA award for Song of the Year — but she did so only because of a white man, Luke Combs, and his viral cover of the song.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, while there may be some logistical arguments behind the industry’s snub of Beyoncé that have nothing to do with identity, the CMA has a noticeable pattern of erasing and sidelining Black women, even in their own art. Beyoncé is actively aware of this gatekeeping; <em>Cowboy Carter</em> is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024/3/26/24111978/beyonce-album-cowboy-carter-black-country-history\">built on the marginalized contributions</a> of centuries of Black artists that came before her. It’s hardly any wonder she distanced herself and her album from the country establishment from the start; she likely knew well before the rest of us that the CMAs were never going to let her in the door — even with the entire world clamoring for her to be let in.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Despite having the biggest new country album of the year, Beyoncé received a complete shut-out from the 2024 Country Music Awards.

Wade</em>, the Supreme Court decision that established a federal right to abortion. In 2022, it finally succeeded, and states across the country began banning abortion immediately. Today about half the states either ban or severely restrict abortion. But now the anti-abortion movement is regrouping around a new goal: using the federal government to ban abortion in the rest of the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Republicans take control of Congress in the 2024 election, it’s possible they could pass a national abortion ban law. But experts don’t consider that the most likely way a national abortion ban could come about, for two reasons: polling shows it would be extremely unpopular, and it would require the elimination of the Senate filibuster. Instead, they point to a different branch of the federal government — the president’s office and all the federal agencies it oversees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the federal agencies, opponents of abortion could fashion a de facto abortion ban by chipping away at abortion access in numerous ways; for example, limiting access to medication abortion, which now constitutes <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020\">nearly two-thirds</a> of all abortions in the US. The biggest way that the president’s office could limit abortion is by deciding to enforce something called the Comstock Act: a 150-year-old abortion ban made obsolete by <em>Roe v. Wade</em> but possibly revived by its repeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The final way the next president could determine the future of abortion rights is through federal court appointments. The anti-abortion movement’s “next <em>Roe v. Wade</em>” is the national legal recognition of fetal personhood, an idea that would by definition outlaw all abortion. The current Supreme Court isn’t yet right-wing enough to endorse this idea. But after another Trump term, that could change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Watch the video above for the details of how this all could happen.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

She said she would resume some public events, though engagements are expected to remain limited through the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus,” the princess wrote in a post shared on  X. “Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She was diagnosed with cancer after doctors performed abdominal surgery on her and discovered evidence of the disease. </p>\n\n<p>Kensington Palace has not released details on what type of cancer the princess has, nor did it specify what stage the cancer was when it was found. But as a 42-year-old woman, Middleton is far from alone in her diagnosis: Worldwide, more and more people under 50 are developing cancers.</p>\n\n<p>Cancer typically strikes those who are in their 50s, 60s, or even older. Yet, in recent decades, early-onset cancers — which are usually defined as occurring in patients younger than 50 — are occurring at a higher rate, particularly in wealthy countries. As illustrated in the chart below, a <a href=\"https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049#DC1\">2023 <em>BMJ</em> analysis</a> found that the early onset of 29 different cancers had risen nearly 80 percent globally between 1990 and 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25350322/gwDvD_more_young_people_are_getting_cancer_today.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.278341533841,100,51.443316932319\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Dylan Scott/Vox\" />\n<p>Separately, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381\">a study published in <em>JAMA Network Open</em></a> the same year concluded that the occurrence of a wide range of cancers among people under 50 had increased between 2010 to 2019 among American adults, particularly among women.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the increase is attributable to colon and rectal cancers: In 2019, there were about 5.7 cases of colorectal cancer among 100,000 people ages 14 to 49. That’s up 63 percent since 1990, when there were approximately only 3.5 cases per 100,000 people. Breast, cervical, and skin cancers are still the most likely cancers to develop in adults under 50, but individual cases of colorectal cancers taking the lives of well-known <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/celebrities\" data-source=\"encore\">celebrities</a>, like actor <a href=\"https://health.ucdavis.edu/synthesis/issues/winter2021/patient_focus/chadwick-boseman.html\">Chadwick Boseman</a> in 2020, have made that trend more visible in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Cancers of the bladder, kidney, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, thyroid, and uterus also became significantly more common in the nearly three decades covered by the global investigation published in BMJ.</p>\n\n<p>John Marshall, director of the Ruesch Center for the Cure of Gastrointestinal Cancers at Georgetown University, told me recently that, early in his career, he rarely saw a patient under 50. Today, half of his patients are in that age range, many of them appearing to be healthy and fit. At first, these young patients usually came in with colorectal cancer, but Marshall has increasingly seen younger people with cancers attacking other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>\n\n<p>No single factor is to blame for this widespread uptick in numerous cancers among young people, particularly the rise in the gastrointestinal system, but scientists are starting to put together a picture of the reality behind one of the most important medical mysteries of our time.</p>\n\n<p>One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9218641/\">review published in <em>Frontiers in Nutrition</em></a> in 2022 found several dietary factors were associated with early-onset colorectal cancer. Eating a lot of deep-fried and processed foods, foods high in fat, and sugary drinks and desserts was a significant risk factor, as was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24049505/protein-intake-fiber-plant-based-vegetarian-vegan-meat\">having a diet low in fiber</a>. Other studies have found higher alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Toxins in our environment, such as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/8/24093650/mental-health-report-happiness-growth-well-being-smartphones\">microplastics</a>, could also be a contributing factor. These tiny particles can be found in everything from food containers to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/11/14/23955673/fast-fashion-shein-hauls-environment-human-rights-violations\">synthetic clothing</a>, before making their way into our bodies and our GI tracts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One New Zealand research team <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10340669/\">concluded</a> the upticks in cancers among young adults matched the timeline that we would expect from the multiplication of microplastics in the environment. Cellular and rodent models have suggested that microplastics could promote tumor growth. Though more research is needed, these materials contain chemicals that can disrupt hormones and pose a risk to our health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But these are still theories. Scientists still don’t fully understand what is primarily driving earlier-in-life cancer cases. What we do know is that stories like Middleton’s are becoming all too common.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, September 9, 12:55 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on March 22 and has been updated to reflect new information about Kate Middleton’s health status.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

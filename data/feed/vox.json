But residents who are cleaning out waterlogged homes and businesses have another challenge to their recovery, one that hasn’t let up — viral disinformation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the rumor that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750. False, <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response\">according to a fact-checking page</a> the agency has set up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What about the one that says FEMA is blocking private planes from landing in affected areas to deliver supplies? Also false.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These rumors have turned political, with some Republican politicians, including former President Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund\">repeating them to large audiences</a>. As FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/weather/hurricane-milton-disinformation-fema.html\">said recently</a>, the swirl of misinformation is “absolutely the worst that I have ever seen.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Misinformation is not uncommon in disasters. They come on fast. People see things that don&#8217;t end up being true,” <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/juliette-kayyem\">Juliette Kayyem</a>, a crisis management expert at Harvard who served as the assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, told <em>Today, Explained</em>’s<em> </em>Sean Rameswaram. “I think in many ways what we&#8217;re experiencing now is purposeful lying.” Kayyem is also the author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Never-Sleeps-Learning-Disasters/dp/1541700090\"><em>The Devil Never Sleeps: Learning to Live in an Age of Disasters</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get your podcasts, including <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL3RvZGF5LWV4cGxhaW5lZA==\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A\">Spotify</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/today-explained\">Stitcher</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For people who may have missed this disaster of facts, can you just tell them what&#8217;s going on?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you look on social media, at the atmosphere of response, there&#8217;s a lot of false facts about how the Biden administration is responding, about basic disaster response capabilities and rules. They are then amplified by, in particular, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and create their own reality that then has to be shot down by already-overburdened first responders, emergency managers, and FEMA, which has put up a rumor page on their website just to combat this crap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One example is Donald Trump consistently saying that the money that should go to Americans who are impacted by the disaster was all used for housing illegal immigrants. Not true. There was a separate line item to support migrants and sheltering that Congress passed. That money was sent to FEMA to administer, but it wasn&#8217;t replacing disaster management funds. It didn&#8217;t even overlap. It&#8217;s just the same entity distributing these funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This creates a false division between the immigrants, who are not getting this money, and Americans, who might be mad that the money that they want for disaster relief is not available. They demoralize emergency managers and volunteers. They put them at risk. I have talked to people at FEMA about what&#8217;s happening on the ground. They are deploying people in larger numbers because they&#8217;re worried about what the reaction will be. Most importantly, it&#8217;s confusing victims about what they should do, what they have access to, and what&#8217;s available to them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;re saying that Donald Trump is perpetrating some of this misinformation. Where is he doing it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At his rallies; on social media. Recently at a rally, he suggested that resources weren&#8217;t going to red states, that more Republicans were dying. There&#8217;s just no factual basis for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What&#8217;s interesting is you&#8217;re seeing Republican governors push back on that narrative, saying that they are <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/10/08/biden-call-may-have-calmed-desantis-harris-pre-storm-dustup/75568059007/\">getting the resources they want</a>. They know that they have to work with the federal government to protect their citizens and begin these recoveries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most obnoxious, disgusting rumors being amplified out in the communications space involves whether FEMA would take your home. FEMA has a process where they can buy your home. It&#8217;s a very small program. It&#8217;s if you, the homeowner, and FEMA agree on a fair market value and you don&#8217;t want to live there anymore because it&#8217;s been flooded four years in a row, and this is a rational transactional decision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This narrative that they&#8217;re going to take your home — what does that do? Well, it makes people very nervous about leaving their home. And so you hear people now saying,<em> </em>“I&#8217;m not going to leave, because if I leave my home, the government&#8217;s going to take it.” Those are the real-world impacts of all of these lies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And you&#8217;re saying this is being amplified not only by other Republican politicians, but by the owner of Twitter?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes. He is probably the biggest amplifier of disinformation, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1842246865234128978\">retweeting things that are clearly false</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What they&#8217;re trying to do is create divisions in communities in two ways. One is the divide between the citizen and government, which has always been a tactic by that wing of MAGA-ism. Then also [there’s the divide] between citizens and their neighbors. That creates chaos, confusion, and divisions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think why you&#8217;re seeing such a concerted pushback by GOP governors, but also by FEMA and others who are calling this out, is because they know it can harm their response capabilities. I should say this is being done at a time when we&#8217;re seeing our very communication networks under stress. Communications are down. It&#8217;s hard to communicate with people. And so they have that vacuum being filled by this noxiousness of which has life-and-death consequences. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Back during Hurricane Sandy, I distinctly remember social media being useful for people. It was useful for people going through Sandy, it was useful for government agencies to get out information. Is that era of social media being a helpful tool in a disaster over?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s over. Elon Musk broke “Disaster Twitter.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Twitter&#8217;s moment of birth, the moment that its founder realized its benefit, was during a minor earthquake in San Francisco. It had been just one of those other social media platforms. But it was that real-time, authenticated information that was flowing in people&#8217;s feeds that the leadership at Twitter began to take its responsibility in a disaster very seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You had an entire system, including the government relying on Twitter to amplify good information, and that whole system is down. This is the first domestic disaster where that is entirely clear, that Twitter is broken across the board for disaster management.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is the mis- and disinformation around Milton as bad as that we saw after Helene?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You saw it more online than, say, from political leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You saw much more aggressive government [and] FEMA pushback on that. They were sort of ready now. Helene was — I think they were sort of caught [by surprise]. So you saw just a lot of outreach, a lot of push back on the misinformation and even from [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis, who pushed back on some of that.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think this makes an agency like FEMA more prepared for the next hurricane and for the next storm, if you will, of misinformation?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, I think it will, on the misinformation and the lies front. I think it&#8217;s just going to be part of your emergency management plan. You&#8217;re going to push back on the rumors in a very formal way. It used to be done, but it was very piecemeal. I saw language coming out of FEMA spokespeople, which I&#8217;d never seen before, essentially just calling out the lies, in particular on social media. So they&#8217;re using the language, the sort of freewheeling language, of social media, which I think is important, rather than the sort of more formal language of government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think from the hype around Milton, there was this sense that, like, it could destroy Tampa. And it&#8217;s early yet, but I don&#8217;t think that happened. Do you think that sort of confirms and fuels this misinformation engine after an event like this?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, it will be viewed as overreach, as “the government&#8217;s incompetent, it doesn&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing.” I think the next evacuation will be harder if you don&#8217;t see the kind of damage and the kind of death that everyone was worried about. This is something that&#8217;s common, it has a name: the preparedness paradox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you are ready, you get houses ready, you get communities ready, you get them to evacuate, and the thing comes through and the damage is less than you were worried about — that&#8217;s why you wanted the evacuation. That&#8217;s why you wanted the houses to be ready.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People will say, “What were you so worried about in the first place?“ In other words, the government&#8217;s reaction, which may have minimized harm and damage and death, may very well, paradoxically, be viewed as the government&#8217;s original assessment was wrong. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Rameswaram</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Could FEMA be doing a better job during Helene and now Milton?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Juliette Kayyem</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s hard for me to know right now. In some ways, FEMA&#8217;s biggest challenge is going to be recovery. How quickly can they deploy resources?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Helene, the biggest lesson learned is how we communicate risk to Americans who may not view themselves at risk. Looking back, the only warnings that were given were a flood warning given to communities where there could be a flood. That is likely because people remember the soil was very saturated from rains in the days before. And I wonder if, in hindsight, flood warning — does it get people to move? Maybe we should think about how we communicate risk, especially because we&#8217;re getting these events that don&#8217;t really have historical precedent.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

You might have dependent family members who can’t leave due to disabilities or other health-related reasons; you might not have reliable transportation to get to a safer area, and what’s more, no gas to get there. Sometimes, you simply refuse to leave your home and everything you own behind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also the reality of just not being able to afford it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a 2021 <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/documents/news-items/spa-hurricane-survey-results-2021.pdf\">University of South Florida survey</a>, over half of the state’s residents said that finances would impact whether they evacuated from a hurricane or not, with almost 43 percent saying they had under $1,000 for emergencies. People escaping both Hurricane Milton and Helene — a Category 4 hurricane that heavily impacted the Southeastern US in late September — report <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cnn/video/7423539550137371934\">spending</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/DissentFu/status/1843373698243539317\">hundreds</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/bulkpricing/status/1843734482698023161\">if not</a> <a href=\"https://weartv.com/news/local/helene-evacuees-face-high-costs-as-they-seek-refuge-in-northwest-florida\">thousands of dollars</a> to get to safety. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Connie Vickers, 63, typically resides about an hour outside of Asheville, North Carolina. It cost her about $5,000 to book the first available Airbnb she could find to evacuate from Hurricane Helene. She considers herself fortunate — she could pay that out of pocket, with the hope that her insurance would cover some or all of the cost. “I’ve been thinking about the socioeconomic differences,” she tells Vox. “Some people literally have nothing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Terrifyingly, anecdotes of people seeing <a href=\"https://x.com/silverfang09/status/1843638806840520771\">outrageous</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813\">flight</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/hurricanetrack/status/1843482275490787568\">hotel</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/KellDA/status/1843458416070783099\">rental car</a> prices have spread like wildfire on social media in the lead-up to Hurricane Milton’s landfall as a Category 3 storm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6\">one woman in Southwest Florida</a> has been explaining why it’s so difficult to leave home with six children and four dogs. Many shelters <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/disability/evacuations-and-shelters/shelter-information/sheltering-with-pet/\">don’t accept pets</a>. “I would have to book an Airbnb or something,” she says in <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6/video/7422814373627940139\">one video</a>. “I can’t afford to do that.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Flights, hotels, or gas can be pricey — if they’re even available</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The longer someone waits to evacuate, the costlier evacuation is likely to be. One <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264879191_Is_It_Time_to_Go_Yet_Understanding_Household_Hurricane_Evacuation_Decisions_from_a_Dynamic_Perspective\">2011 study</a> estimated that evacuation costs for a Category 3 hurricane could increase from $454 about 3 days before expected landfall to $526 mere hours before landfall, which is about $632 to $732 in today’s dollars. While the cheapest one-way flight from Tampa to Atlanta in mid-November can be had for just $39, according to Google Flights, on October 8, the cheapest the search engine showed was $321. The cheapest one-way ticket from Tampa to NYC, usually available for $45 to $90, was $458.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plane tickets are priced dynamically, typically shooting up during busy travel periods and when you’re booking last minute. A United spokesperson told Vox that the airline had implemented fare caps this past Sunday. “Since then, the average price for a one way, economy class ticket to our hubs from affected Florida markets was below $500,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. They also noted that the <a href=\"https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813/photo/1\">viral screenshots</a> of $1,000-plus fares from Tampa to St. Louis included two stops. By early Tuesday, though, it was hard to find any nonstop flights from Tampa. <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/delta-waiving-fare-differences-capping-fares-new-bookings-ahead-milton\">Delta</a> and <a href=\"https://skift.com/2024/10/09/airlines-cap-fares-during-hurricane-milton/\">American Airlines</a> have also capped fares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether these tickets actually existed is also a different matter — going directly to airline websites often showed that there were actually no available flights, since airports were closed and many flights had been canceled. By Tuesday, when many <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/09/florida-hurricane-milton-evacuation-orders-flood-zones-mandatory-list-map-orlando-counties-shelters/75588425007/\">evacuation orders</a> were just going into effect, options were increasingly limited — and costly — for Floridians in the path of Milton. Many airports were <a href=\"https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/airports-close-and-flights-are-cancelled-due-to-hurricane-milton/3438303/\">closing down</a>. As of Wednesday, FlightAware data showed that 90 percent of flights out of Tampa International Airport were canceled. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rental car locations were either running out of cars or shutting down for safety as of Tuesday, and <a href=\"https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=tampa&amp;fuel=1&amp;method=all&amp;maxAge=0\">according to GasBuddy</a>, a site that helps people track prices and availability at nearby gas stations, fuel was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/business/hurricane-milton-florida-gasoline-shortages/index.html\">scarce</a>. Finding a place to stay is an uphill climb, too. At time of writing, many hotels in <a href=\"https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/panama-city/hurricane-milton-evacuees-fully-book-panama-city-hotels/\">Northwest</a> <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/10/07/booked-up-tallahassee-hotels-see-influx-due-to-hurricane-milton/75555745007/\">Florida</a> had filled up. While there are free shelters available across Florida counties where evacuation orders have been issued, as well as free <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/Updates\">shuttle services</a> or other <a href=\"https://www.wptv.com/weather/hurricane/need-transportation-heres-how-you-can-get-a-ride-to-a-local-shelter-or-to-safety\">free transportations options</a>, not everyone may be in an area where they can access them. There are also several reasons why people choose <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/10/09/evacuating-privilege-why-some-stay-behind-when-hurricanes-strike\">not to go to a shelter</a>: They may not be sure exactly where it’s located, whether it’s full, or may not be able to bring their pets. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Being poor and having few job protections makes it harder to escape a storm</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People with the least money are also often <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050132/\">least likely to be able to escape</a> a natural disaster. They are less able to leave work in advance to beat traffic or book lodgings and flights before they’re all sold out, and in the long-term, less able to permanently move to an area at lower risk of hurricanes — yet another example of how it can be <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-cost-of-being-poor-is-rising-and-its-worse-for-poor-families-of-color/\">more expensive to be poor</a>. The Gulf Coast faces some of the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4022458/\">highest poverty rates</a> in the US, and the combination of extreme poverty and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600389/\">higher rates of poor health</a> (often due to racial inequality and environmental factors) leaves residents in this region <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-part-of-the-u-s-will-suffer-most-from-climate-change/\">especially vulnerable</a> during disasters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carson MacPherson-Krutsky, a research associate at the Natural Hazards Center at University of Colorado Boulder, is currently studying the factors that motivate people to evacuate and shelter — or not — for hurricanes and tornadoes. “A huge one is resource constraints,” she tells Vox. “You have to have lodging wherever you&#8217;re going. You may need to have social support, potentially, if you want to stay with family and friends who are outside of the area. You have to have the ability to leave your job.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even in ordinary times, hotel and flight prices can be tough to stomach. Average hotel prices in the US have <a href=\"https://lodgingmagazine.com/j-d-power-2024-nagsi-study-shows-travelers-are-paying-more-for-hotel-rooms/\">risen this year</a>; across the country, it has become increasingly common to pay <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/average-hotel-room-prices-data-a0afa164\">upwards of $200 per night</a> for a room. The cost of buying a car, maintaining it, and having insurance for it has also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/your-money/car-ownership-costs-increase.html\">gone up precipitously</a> in the past few years. Then there are the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/23641875/food-grocery-inflation-prices-billionaires\">higher food prices</a> to consider. If you’ve evacuated to temporary lodgings and don’t have a stove, eating out can quickly become costly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over a quarter of Americans had <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/select/americans-checking-account-balance/\">less than $500</a> in their checking account last year, according to a CNBC Select survey, and over half of Americans have less than $1,000 saved for emergencies. A <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/hurricane-irmas-coming-what-an-average-family-spends-and-does-to-prepare\">Fox Business report from 2017</a> estimated that hurricane preparation and evacuation could cost an average family as much as $5,000; a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/18/multimedia/hurricane-florence-motel-evacuees.html\">New York Times report</a> from 2018, when Hurricane Florence ravaged North Carolina, cites one family having to cough up over $2,000 to evacuate. It can be prohibitively expensive to survive a storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For some, the risk of lost wages or other <a href=\"https://x.com/HorrorGorl/status/1843684304385143005\">consequences</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@officialladdyyg/video/7423010068448382254?_r=1&amp;_t=8qPCtDRp5ac\">of missing</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1fyyp5z/usa_what_to_do_because_were_being_forced_to_work/\">work</a> may have influenced their <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2022/09/hurricane-ian-workers-rights-laws.html\">decision to stay put</a>. During Hurricane Helene, a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/05/us/tennessee-impact-plastics-factory-helene/index.html\">factory called Impact Plastics</a> in Erwin, Tennessee, allegedly told employees to continue working despite flood warnings in the area. The company denies that it discouraged employees from leaving, saying in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_DzP__-9kg\">video statement</a> last week that they had been told to leave “at least 45 minutes before the gigantic force of the flood hit the industrial park.” It’s currently being investigated after 11 workers went missing, at least <a href=\"https://www.wcyb.com/news/local/bodies-of-5-of-6-impact-plastics-employees-swept-away-by-flood-recovered\">five</a> of whom have since been found dead.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How the government — and some companies — are trying to help</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To ease some of the costs of evacuation, the state of Florida has <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/07/governor-ron-desantis-suspends-tolls-to-assist-hurricane-milton-evacuations/\">suspended road tolls</a> and has encouraged hotels to <a href=\"https://frla.org/news-release/frla-works-with-state-of-florida-to-encourage-reduced-costs-at-hotels-for-milton-evacuees/\">waive pet fees</a>. Uber, which famously came under fire for <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/uber-reaches-agreement-with-n-y-on-surge-pricing-during-emergencies/\">surge pricing</a> in New York during Hurricane Sandy, is giving people fleeing Milton <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/\">free rides to shelters.</a> Major US airlines, including <a href=\"https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/travel/trip-planning/travel-alerts.html\">United</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/travel-alerts.jsp\">American</a>, and Delta are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/hurricane-helene-disrupting-travel-fliers-need-know-rcna173505\">waiving some fees</a> if you need to rebook a flight. A few hotels have also been offering “distress rates” for evacuees, with <a href=\"https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/10/08/myrtle-beach-resorts-offer-discount-those-evacuating-hurricane-milton/\">one Myrtle Beach resort</a> charging as little as $39 per night before taxes, and rooms at an <a href=\"https://www.wftv.com/news/local/rosen-hotels-resorts-reduces-pricing-hurricane-milton/WEDJTZ47IFE6JP6XNOI2VBMRKE/\">Orlando area hotel chain</a> starting at $69 before taxes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The supply-and-demand explanation for why things like flights and hotels can cost more during emergencies is that a lot of people are trying to snap them up at the last minute. That doesn’t mean it’s in a company’s best interest to hike prices, especially when people have been airing their sticker shock online. In some cases, it could even be illegal price gouging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Price gouging is different than a normal market increasing prices,” says Teresa Murray, director of the Consumer Watchdog office at the Public Interest Research Groups. It usually needs to occur during some kind of emergency, and only applies to essential goods. One clear example of price gouging, according to Murray, happened during the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/5/12/23068472/baby-formula-shortage-2022-why\">baby formula shortage</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/how-to-report-price-gouging-after-a-natural-disaster/\">37 states</a> have some sort of anti-price gouging law in the books. Florida’s anti-price gouging law doesn’t kick in unless an official state of emergency has been declared, which Gov. Ron DeSantis did <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/\">this past</a> <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/\">weekend</a>. If the price of food, water, or gas, for example, “grossly exceeds” the average prices seen in the 30 days before the state of emergency, that’s illegal — but it’s not clear what “grossly exceeds” exactly means. <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters#2C\">Some states</a> set a price increase threshold, such as anything more than 10 percent above normal prices. The Florida attorney general’s office has urged residents to <a href=\"https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-moody-extends-price-gouging-hotline-following-declared-state-emergency\">report any price gouging</a> they see; it was already <a href=\"https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/florida-attorney-generals-team-investigates-price-gouging-amid-hurricane-season/\">investigating potential price gouging</a> after receiving hundreds of complaints during Hurricane Helene. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg <a href=\"https://x.com/SecretaryPete/status/1843464151324389620\">said on X</a> that the Department of Transportation is “keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton” to ensure there’s no price gouging, and the department is now <a href=\"https://x.com/petemuntean/status/1843740317494964379\">in touch with airlines</a> about the issue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, Murray adds, we see a lot of <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/after-a-hurricane-or-tropical-storm-watch-out-for-repair-scams-price-gouging-unsafe-generator-use/\">price gouging</a> — whether it’s water, food, or supplies needed for clean up and repair, like chainsaws — happening in the aftermath of a disaster. With Milton, too, we might see more of it occurring as recovery efforts begin. “It’s just unconscionable that some companies might be taking advantage of this crisis by jacking up their prices,” Murray says. “We&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s lives here.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

For roughly 1,200 inmates in the Manatee County Jail, which is located in a major evacuation zone near Sarasota, Florida, that wasn’t an option. Local authorities decided not to evacuate the prisoners so they rode out the storm — which brought <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/picture-gallery/weather/hurricane/2024/10/09/photos-sarasota-bradenton-prepare-aftermath-hurricane-milton/75583179007/\">widespread flooding, property damage, and fierce winds</a> to the area — in the jail. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They weren’t alone. The Manatee County Jail is one of many that chose not to evacuate, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/weather/florida-milton-evacuations-jail.html\">according to the New York Times.</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifI9GLSClrQ\">Pinellas County</a> and Lee County, two others on the Gulf Coast that were in the storm’s direct trajectory, also did not evacuate their jails, per a Pinellas County news conference and a spokesperson for Lee County Sheriff’s Office. (Manatee County and Pinellas County Sheriff’s Offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The plight of Florida’s inmates is just the latest example to highlight how vulnerable incarcerated people are during natural disasters, when they have no control over their mobility or their exposure to hazardous situations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/hurricane-milton-florida-jails-prisons-evacuations/\">the Appeal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.news-press.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/09/lee-county-jail-inmates-safe-hurricane-milton/75593272007/\">the Fort Myers News-Press reported</a>, Manatee, Pinellas, and Lee County officials argued that they could move inmates to higher floors in case of flooding and storm surge. Manatee County officials also described the jail as “hurricane-rated,” while Pinellas County officials cited the logistical challenge of moving 3,100 inmates from the facility during the storm as justification for their decision. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Lee County jail was fully staffed and had water tanks on standby, according to the spokesperson, who noted that all the inmates were safe as of Thursday afternoon. The main facility lost power during the storm, the spokesperson added, but there were no other “notable incidents.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Manatee Sheriff’s Office also told <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/hurricane-milton-florida-jails-prisons-evacuations/\">the Appeal</a> that the inmates were “storm safe” as of Thursday and that the power was going in and out, but that they did not lose running water. The Pinellas Sheriff’s Office told the publication that it had power and no running water issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Florida Department of Corrections (DOC), which oversees state prisons, meanwhile, says that “all staff and inmates in the path of Hurricane Milton have been accounted for,” in an <a href=\"https://www.fdc.myflorida.com/weather-updates\">update</a> that it posted on Thursday morning. Per the DOC, it had evacuated 5,950 inmates from 37 facilities across the state as of that time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DOC has also said that its public list of evacuated facilities has a lag and may be incomplete since it only updates 24 hours after the inmates have already been transported. It told Vox that it weighs multiple risk factors when considering evacuations, including “the path of the storm … timing, traffic disruption, the risks of evacuating inmates, and the conditions of facilities being evacuated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In total, more than 28,000 people are incarcerated in facilities in counties that had either full or partial evacuation orders, and many were not evacuated, <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/hurricane-milton-florida-jails-prisons-evacuations/\">the Appeal reported</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really important rundown of how Florida prisons and jails are responding to evacuation orders by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elizabethweill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@elizabethweill</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EthanSCorey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EthanSCorey</a>. Several facilities in places with mandatory evacuation orders told The Appeal they will not evacuate.

Manatee County Jail, for example, is located in Evacuation Zone A, an area that faced high flooding risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We do not issue evacuation orders lightly,” Manatee County Public Safety Director Jodie Fiske previously said in a news release. “Milton is anticipated to cause more storm surge than Helene. So, if you stayed during Helene and got lucky, I would not press my luck with this particular system.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Incarcerated people have few protections</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Florida’s inmates are not the first forced to shelter in place during a severe hurricane. When Hurricane Helene hit last month, 550 men in North Carolina were left in flooded cells at the Mountain View Correctional Institution without lights or running water for five days, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/04/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-mountain-view-prison/\">the Intercept reports</a>. Previously, hundreds of prisoners were <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/abandoned-and-abused-orleans-parish-prisoners-wake-hurricane\">abandoned</a> during Hurricane Katrina without food or water <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/09/21/new-orleans-prisoners-abandoned-floodwaters\">after staff at the Orleans Parish Prison fled</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Incarcerated people are often neglected when it comes to ensuring their safety during natural disasters, but they’re frequently exploited for labor in the aftermath of those same situations. <a href=\"https://lailluminator.com/2024/09/17/in-louisiana-incarcerated-people-help-with-hurricane-recovery-after-francine/\">In Louisiana,</a> incarcerated people performed clean-up and recovery efforts after Hurricane Francine in September and, in California, they’ve been key to <a href=\"https://www.davispoliticalreview.com/article/the-use-of-inmate-firefighters-and-its-injustices\">fighting wildfires</a> for years. While some of these tasks offer an alternative path to rehabilitation or allow inmates to refine new skills, none come with the same labor protections around safety or wages that other workers generally receive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The incarcerated population, they&#8217;re doubly vulnerable,” Corene Kendrick, deputy director of the ACLU&#8217;s National Prison Project, told Vox. “First, they&#8217;re often overlooked or deliberately just ignored … when the disaster is looming, and then they&#8217;re expected to turn around and clean up the mess in the wake of the disaster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Federally, there are no requirements for guaranteeing the safety of incarcerated people during natural disasters, Kendrick told Vox. And while policies vary by state, <a href=\"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2022.307044\">a 2022 study published in the American Journal of Public Health</a> found that just six states mentioned safety protocols for incarcerated people in public plans detailing their emergency responses, while 24 mentioned the use of their labor for disaster mitigation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That patchwork becomes even more patchy when you go to the local level of jails because there&#8217;s significant local control over how jails operate,” Mike Wessler, communications director for the Prison Policy Initiative, told Vox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And although there’s a <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/429/97/\">Supreme Court decision</a> that establishes a safety standard for inmates, experts note that court cases about mistreatment face an uphill battle following the passage of <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2016/05/05/20years_plra/\">the Prison Litigation Reform Act in the 1990s</a>, which made it much harder for prisoners to file civil suits. Prisons and jails also have limited oversight at either the federal or state levels, so they <a href=\"https://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FAMM-Prison-Oversight-Principles.pdf\">often operate</a> with little regard to accountability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a result, incarcerated people are especially vulnerable to neglect and other abuses, in general and during natural disasters specifically, which can endanger their health and their lives. During past disasters in Florida, like 2022’s Hurricane Ian, inmates <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/14/hurricane-ian-jails-prisons-florida/8189762001/\">described a dearth of running water</a>, including a lack of drinkable water as well as non-flushing toilets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kendrick and Wessler noted that jails and prisons suffer from a failure to prepare for these increasingly common natural disasters as well as a <a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/the-flaws-of-u-s-prisons-and-jails-health-care-system/\">broader lack of concern for inmates’ well-being</a>. To pursue an evacuation, these facilities would need agreements with other facilities where they can transport inmates, transportation for large groups, fuel, and other resources — proposals they need to put in place prior to the emergency itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a baseline, states and counties should have policies that apply mandatory evacuation orders to inmates, the same way that they do to other non-incarcerated people, Kendrick said.<strong> </strong>(Although the government doesn’t force people to leave, it’s <a href=\"https://www.ktvh.com/science-and-tech/natural-disasters/why-do-some-people-choose-to-stay-put-during-dangerous-hurricanes\">technically illegal</a> to stay in a mandatory evacuation zone during a storm.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The federal government could also condition disaster aid to states based on their evacuation policies, in an attempt to guarantee that inmates are protected, attorney <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1359&amp;context=rrgc\">Maya Habash explained in the University of Maryland Law Journal</a>. Federal laws like the Stafford Act and the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which require that the government provide resources to protect vulnerable populations, could also be amended to include references to prisoners to make clear that they should be recipients of funding as well. And the federal government could establish clear mandates that outline how prisons and jails need to treat inmates during natural disasters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think the federal government should set national standards for prisons and jails and emergency responses, and those should be the floor, not the ceiling, for what places have to do,” Wessler told Vox.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Sunspots are patches of the sun’s surface with <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/fsd/sunspots\">unusually strong magnetic fields</a> and they appear as dark spots. The boundaries of these spots are ripe for storms that trigger <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/solar-flares-radio-blackouts\">solar flares</a>, large eruptions of radiation. They also foment <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections\">coronal mass ejections</a> (CME), bursts of magnetized plasma from the sun’s corona, its outermost layer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.space.com/sun-solar-flare-september-12-aurora-chances\">sunspot set off a massive flare and a CME</a> that sprayed the solar system with high-energy particles. “This is a very speedy CME,” said Shawn Dahl, a space weather forecaster at NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, during a press conference this week. The CME is traveling 2.5 million mph, the “fastest CME that we’ve really measured” pointed toward Earth in the current sunspot cycle, Dahl added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When these particles collide with the Earth’s atmosphere, they create a phenomenon similar to how neon lights work, exciting gasses in the atmosphere and making them glow, creating auroras.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>They typically cluster near the Earth’s poles (hence “northern lights”), but if enough energetic solar particles charge up the sky, auroras can reach much closer to the equator, which is why we’ve been seeing them all over the globe lately.</p>\n\n<p>This year, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science/2024/1/31/24047913/solar-maximum-cycle-explained-25-flares-coronal-mass-ejection\">sun is at the peak of its activity cycle</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly every 11 years, the sun’s magnetic poles reverse and as that flip approaches, there tends to be much more magnetic activity and thus more sunspots at the surface.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Anticipating how this activity will ripple toward our home planet is an important task, not just so we Earthlings can get our cameras ready and ooh and aah at the nighttime colors; space weather can create problems for communication, navigation, and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy\" data-source=\"encore\">power grid</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://staff.ucar.edu/users/wiltbemj\">Michael Wiltberger</a>, deputy director of the High Altitude Observatory at the National Science Foundation’s National Center for Atmospheric Research, noted that predicting space weather is a lot like forecasting terrestrial weather. The weather we typically experience on the ground is driven by heat, moisture, and wind while space weather is driven by the electromagnetism of stars and planets. But both space and terrestrial weather emerge at the confluence of short- and long-term drivers playing out over a variety of different regions. While we don’t usually experience space weather on the ground, it generates a constant burbling mix of subtle and severe influences on the tools of our modern world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“There’s stuff going on all the time that affects a wide range of things from radio communications to lifetimes of satellites to radiation risks to astronauts in space,” Wiltberger said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And like your local TV weather experts, scientists studying space weather draw on a variety of instruments and models to generate useful forecasts with bulletins and visuals. On its website, the Space Weather Prediction Center <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/\">produces predictions</a> for “essential space weather communities” like aviation, emergency management, satellites, and space weather enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The key tools for space weather forecasting are spacecraft that monitor the flow of solar wind and the direction of the magnetic field. “It’s important because if it’s aligned in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field, we’re not going to get a lot of energy dumped into the system,” Wiltberger said. “But if it’s in the opposite direction then the magnetic fields can interact and get more energy and more direct coupling during these geomagnetic storms.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These measurements are then coupled with readings from ground-based cameras and magnetometers and fed into models to figure out how a rowdy sun will light up the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, one of the main goals is to extend the lead time for forecasts of how disruptive a geomagnetic storm will be. While scientists can see coronal mass ejections days before they start to impact Earth, they can’t easily figure out the strength and direction of the magnetic field, which, again, is the key factor in how much energy the Earth suddenly absorbs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even small hits from the sun can be impactful. GPS, for example, relies on timing signals between satellites to pinpoint locations on the ground. A geomagnetic storm can create delays in these signals, throwing off critical measurements. “If you’re driving your car, probably not a big deal,” Wiltberger said. “But if you’re doing <a href=\"https://www.gps.gov/applications/agriculture/\">precision agriculture</a> and you’re trying to use it to tell you where to put the water on the seed that you just planted and you need really good accuracy, it’s a concern.”</p>\n\n<p>Satellites can be vulnerable to solar storms in other ways as well. On February 3, 2022, <a href=\"https://space.blog.gov.uk/2022/02/09/recently-launched-starlink-satellites-hit-by-geomagnetic-storm/\">SpaceX launched 49 Starlink internet satellites</a> into low Earth orbit, but a geomagnetic storm struck the next day. The storm increased the density of the atmosphere, creating unexpected drag and forcing most of the satellites to re-enter and burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>The company said the nearly 6,000-strong Starlink satellite fleet <a href=\"https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-solar-storm-healthy-satellites\">weathered the recent storms just fine</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest concerns is what a strong solar storm could do to electricity systems. Wiltberger said one could imagine a gargantuan, fast-moving coronal mass ejection that hits the Earth just 24 hours after leaving the sun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If the magnetic field in this ejection happens to line up in the opposite direction of the Earth’s, it will create a big shift in the Earth’s magnetic field. A changing magnetic field, you may recall from your electromagnetism classes, can induce a current in a conductor, like, say, power transmission lines. That can then disrupt power delivery or cause parts of the grid to trip offline.</p>\n\n<p>Still, even a severe coronal mass ejection is unlikely to trigger a civilization-stopping blackout. “We’re probably not going to lose the power grid, but the power grid may actually have to take steps to bring more power generation capability online, defer maintenance, do those types of things,” Wiltberger said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And perhaps losing a few lights on the ground for a while isn’t such a bad thing when the night sky lights up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, October 10, 1:50 pm: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on May 14, 2024, and has been updated to include details about aurora visibility following another geomagnetic storm. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But when I traveled to wine country last year, it was to observe a side of Sonoma that few outsiders know about: a dead-of-night animal rights <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2023/06/13/perdue-chicken-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-dxe/\">protest</a> at an industrial chicken slaughterhouse, located within a stone’s throw of a gastropub, an organic bakery, and a major vegan cheesemaker. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">Processing Meat newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">here</a> for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>’s biweekly newsletter from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\">Marina Bolotnikova</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\">Kenny Torrella</a>, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Have questions or comments on this newsletter?</strong> Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Run by a subsidiary of the poultry giant Perdue, which raises hundreds of thousands of chickens on factory farms across Sonoma, the slaughter plant typifies the unusual politics of agriculture in this part of the country, where a cultivated image of gentle, humane farming sometimes sits uneasily alongside an increasingly consolidated agriculture sector. The county has also seen a recent influx of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/09/animal-rights-california-sonoma-farms-00162034\">new residents</a> fleeing rising housing prices in San Francisco, a longtime center of animal rights activism and utopian thought.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The region’s rural heritage and progressive politics will collide next month when Sonoma County residents vote on a first-of-its-kind ballot measure that could banish Perdue’s chicken facilities, along with all other large factory farms. The <a href=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/measure-text\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/measure-text\">proposed law</a> — which would cap the size of animal agriculture facilities and phase out all large factory farms in the county within three years — faces long odds. If successful, it could reshape the face of farming in the county and set a precedent that has terrified agricultural interests in California and across the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Known as <a href=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/\">Measure J</a>, the proposal has produced fierce debate in the county over the environmental, public health, and animal welfare impacts of modern animal agriculture. It’s <a href=\"https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/sonoma-county-measure-j-factory-farming-campaign-contributions/\">poised</a> to generate the highest campaign spending of any ballot measure in Sonoma County history, with about $2 million in contributions made for and against — the vast majority of which has been spent by industry in <a href=\"https://www.noonmeasurej.com/\">opposition</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measure J is one of a pair of local ballot initiatives this fall seeking to abolish industrial animal agriculture. In Denver, a historic center for the Western livestock trade and still an important hub for the US sheep industry, voters will decide next month whether to <a href=\"https://proanimal.org/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-ban/\">ban slaughterhouses</a> in the city. The measure’s passage would shut down a lamb slaughter plant that butchers <a href=\"https://csuredi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REDI-Research-May-24-Denver-Slaughterhouse.pdf\">up to 500,000</a> lambs per year, accounting for between 15 and 20 percent of all US lamb meat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both measures face opposition from their respective political elites, including the local Democratic Parties in Denver and Sonoma and the entire Sonoma County Board of Supervisors. While some prior farm animal welfare ballot measures — like California’s historic 2018 animal welfare law, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721488/prop-12-scotus-pork-pigs-factory-farming-california-bacon\">Proposition 12</a> — have been more limited in scope, aiming to incrementally improve horrific factory farm conditions, the Sonoma County and Denver measures are more clearly perceived as bans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The measures are easily perceived as negative, as snatching things away from people — and they put proponents in the awkward position of trying to persuade voters to effectively abolish an industry, at least locally, on which they depend for abundant cheap meat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s already famously expensive to live in California in part because it’s <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-144156645\">difficult</a> to build housing, and some Sonoma residents may roll their eyes at Measure J as yet another bid to make it <a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/california/californias-business-cost-remains-expensive-new-study-says/\">prohibitively expensive</a> to do business in the Golden State.&nbsp;But industrial animal agriculture —&nbsp;a sector that exacts <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws\">immense costs</a> on the public in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, strain on local resources, disease risk, and animal suffering — makes a more worthy target for a ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In principle, there’s a lot of sense in capping the size of factory farms. Measure J&#8217;s proponents are betting that progressive Sonoma County, better known for its tasting rooms than its slaughterhouses, can push California — and the nation — in that direction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Animal cruelty in a farming paradise</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measure J, advanced by a <a href=\"https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/\">coalition</a> of animal rights, environmental, and public health groups known as the Coalition to End Factory Farming, would require farms <a href=\"https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sector_table.pdf\">classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency</a> as large “concentrated animal feeding operations” (known as CAFOs) to either downsize or shut down within three years. The proposal is similar to a farm reform <a href=\"https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-reintroduces-bill-to-reform-farm-system-with-expanded-support-from-farm-labor-environment-public-health-faith-based-and-animal-welfare-groups\">bill</a> introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) that would phase out large CAFOs by 2040.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sonoma doesn’t have the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">mega factory farms</a> found in the Midwest or South, or elsewhere in California, that pack together millions of chickens or several thousand cows in one place. But it does have big industrial farms that employ standard factory farm methods.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/unnamed.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.469063017877,100,63.061873964245\" alt=\"Graphic from a video showing how many animals a farm needs to house to be considered a large CAFO.

Dairy operations of 700 or more mature dairy cows are classified as large CAFOs, while chicken farms can house up to 125,000 birds before being considered large CAFOs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The trend is toward mergers and toward ever-increasing sizes in animal agriculture,” Woody Hastings, a Sonoma County resident who works in climate policy and supports Measure J, told me. Hastings has worked with environmental justice organizations in California’s Central Valley, a far more CAFO-dense, ultra-productive agricultural region where residents <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/classes/es196/projects/2022final/SallstromE_2022.pdf\">are afflicted by</a> air and water pollution and terrible odors. “What I learned in my work in the Central Valley is seeing how bad things can get if there is no cap on the size,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Reichardt-Crowding-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.8176599344147,100,92.364680131171\" alt=\"Dozens of white ducks inside a shed on a wire floor.\" title=\"Dozens of white ducks inside a shed on a wire floor.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A duck CAFO in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Hugging-Chickens.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,1.1762443385637,100,97.647511322873\" alt=\"Chickens on a dirt floor, with one chicken leaning its head on the shoulder of another one\" title=\"Chickens on a dirt floor, with one chicken leaning its head on the shoulder of another one\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Chickens at a CAFO in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Animal farming industries have <a href=\"https://sonomaunitedvote.org/\">mobilized</a> an all-out war against Measure J, pushing social media campaigns, TV ads, and a direct mail blitz, at times making exaggerated claims about the measure’s potential to wipe out all animal agriculture in the county or cause a <a href=\"https://www.noonmeasurej.com/faq\">dramatic spike</a> in food prices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One direct mailer sponsored by Western United Dairies (WUD), a dairy trade group, claimed the measure would shut down “more than 60 organic dairy farms” — but there are only 50 dairy farms of all categories in the county, according to the most recent USDA <a href=\"https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2022/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_2_County_Level/California/st06_2_011_011.pdf\">data</a>, and most of them don’t meet the threshold to be affected by Measure J. “We do not differentiate between any dairy farming operations,” WUD told me in a statement, adding that they were concerned that Measure J would affect all dairy farms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s been confusion in the county about the scope of the measure, with some arguing that it could be construed to include farms that are smaller than large CAFOs; my reading of Measure J is that it would only impact Sonoma County’s large CAFOs. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the opposition to Measure J has centered on Sonoma County’s dairy industry, which has been declining in recent decades and has almost entirely <a href=\"https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/business/north-bay-dairies-shift-to-organic-milk-production-seeking-higher-income-a/\">converted</a> to organic, pasture-based operations because they command higher retail prices, according to Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at UC Davis. Although the measure wouldn’t affect consumer prices much because grocery stores would simply stock more milk from elsewhere in the region, Sumner said, it is<em> </em>likely to reduce significantly how much milk is produced in Sonoma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s left some Sonoma voters asking: Why punish dairies that are doing things better than the vast majority of the US dairy industry? Measure J “threatens what is probably one of the best progressive dairy environments, certainly in California, probably in the country,” Roy Smith, a small farmer in Sonoma County, told me.&nbsp;“Yes, there are compromises that are made, but if we wanted to improve the well-being [of animals], I would suggest that more dairies reopen here, and close the ones that are low-welfare in Wisconsin.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No dairy farm in Sonoma is as big as America’s biggest <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">mega-dairies</a>, and it’s undoubtedly true that cows with access to a pasture have it better than those raised on conventional factory farms. But organic dairies can still qualify as <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/organic-concentrated-animal-feeding-operations-dairy-usda-factory-farms\">CAFOs</a>. Most of Sonoma’s milk cows are still concentrated on farms that are very large, and large-scale dairy production of any kind is hard to justify on environmental and animal welfare grounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether they’re raised organic or conventional, ruminant grazing requires a lot of land and water — the latter increasingly scarce in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23655640/colorado-river-water-alfalfa-dairy-beef-meat\">parched American West</a> — and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf\">produces significant greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Organic dairy CAFOs, including some in Sonoma, share some of the characteristics of conventional ones, like the use of manure lagoons — giant pools of animal waste that pollute air and water and can harm human health. And, organic or not, the dairy business model depends on repeatedly impregnating dairy cows and taking away their newborns (highly social animals that are then generally forced to live alone in small hutches) to extract the cows’ milk, keeping them alive just as long as they remain productive.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/DJI_0109.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.70421724872,100,78.59156550256\" alt=\"Aerial view of several rows of hutches used to individually house dairy calves.\" title=\"Aerial view of several rows of hutches used to individually house dairy calves.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Dairy calf housing at a farm in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/DJI_0090.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.5164754795709,100,86.967049040858\" alt=\"Aerial view of cows on a farm that looks like a feedlot (without pasture).\" title=\"Aerial view of cows on a farm that looks like a feedlot (without pasture).\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A dairy farm in Sonoma County. | Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of the Coalition to End Factory Farming\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A recent Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/alexandre-farms-treatment-of-animals/677980/\">investigation</a> into one of the nation’s most celebrated organic dairies, a few counties north of Sonoma, found pervasive animal cruelty, including some techniques that were unique to the organic model. (Because milk from cows that have ever received antibiotics can’t be marketed as organic, cows can be denied them even when they really need them for a painful disease or injury.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my experience writing about the livestock industry, it’s often the worst factory farms that set the bar for how we talk about animal agriculture, allowing other producers — including organic facilities — to appear idyllic by comparison. We rarely frame the conversation around what animals truly deserve: Does it really make sense to mass produce another mammal for its milk, separating mothers from babies, all for a product that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools\">isn’t nutritionally necessary</a> and that climate scientists <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf\">say</a> is so high in emissions that we have to scale it down?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measure J, a blunt instrument for shrinking a bloated industry, offers one possible answer: We have to make less of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Slaughterhouse zero</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Denver, meanwhile, the proposed slaughterhouse ban, led by the advocacy group <a href=\"https://proanimal.org/\">Pro-Animal Future</a>, looms like a “black cloud” over the US sheep industry, as one sheep feedlot employee <a href=\"https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/21538-lamb-processors-fate-in-question-as-denver-voters-weigh-slaughterhouse-ban\">put it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last 50 years, American lamb farming has <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?country=~USA\">declined precipitously</a>; the Denver slaughterhouse that would be shut down by the ballot measure, run by top lamb producer Superior Farms, is one of relatively few important facilities remaining.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the measure passes, it&#8217;s possible that some producers will be able to send their animals to be slaughtered elsewhere or that a new slaughterhouse will open outside Denver limits. Or, Sumner told me, the measure could hasten the death of the lamb industry altogether. Not many investors are saying, “Gee, I think I&#8217;ll go into the lamb slaughtering business,” he said. “Mostly they look for something that’s growing, and nobody thinks the lamb business is growing.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pro-Animal Future, much like the coalition campaigning for Measure J in Sonoma County, sees the ballot initiative as a means to start civic conversations about building a more humane, planet-friendly food system, without making people feel like the only option available to them for making change is to go vegan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lamb industry, particularly an industrial slaughterhouse, is a reasonable target for such a reckoning: Most people rarely eat lamb — making them perhaps more sympathetic to them as animals — while slaughterhouses are, pretty much invariably, sites of terrible violence. The per-serving climate impact of sheep’s meat is also <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-protein-poore\">significant</a>, second only to beef.&nbsp;The Superior slaughterhouse, under the name Mountain Meadows, was also recently <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-settlement-superior-farms-resolves-chemical-risk-violations-north-denver-facility\">fined</a> by the EPA for Clean Air Act violations, and has been <a href=\"https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?company=Mountain+meadows+lamb\">fined</a> multiple times for labor violations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This week, the Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/\">published</a> findings from a recent <a href=\"https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-exposed-superior-farms-investigation-reveals-shocking-violence\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-exposed-superior-farms-investigation-reveals-shocking-violence\">undercover investigation</a> into conditions at the Superior slaughterhouse, including gruesome footage of partially eviscerated, thrashing lambs hanging upside down on the slaughter line, with one lamb appearing to lift its head and open its mouth, and injured lambs who are unable to walk being thrown, dragged, and kicked toward slaughter. It also documented what appears to be the use of <a href=\"https://ambrook.com/research/livestock/judas-goats-slaughter-meatpacking-wildlife-control\">“Judas sheep”</a>: sheep who live at the slaughterhouse and have been trained to greet incoming truckloads of lambs and lead them to slaughter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Superior Farms spokesperson Bob Mariano told me in a statement that “nothing included in the footage we have seen is evidence of extreme violence, animal cruelty, or halal violations [the slaughterhouse is halal-certified]. This is yet another example of proponents of the slaughterhouse ban misunderstanding or misrepresenting standard, legally compliant parts of the slaughter process in an attempt to shock voters and influence an election. This is not the first time our workers have been attacked by activist groups falsely claiming that illegally obtained footage shows things that it simply does not.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Paddle.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.1196789549376,100,93.760642090125\" alt=\"Aerial view of sheep in a metal chute coming out of a truck and into a building.\" title=\"Aerial view of sheep in a metal chute coming out of a truck and into a building.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Lambs being unloaded from a truck at the Denver slaughterhouse. | Courtesy of Direct Action Everywhere\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of Direct Action Everywhere\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The investigation’s findings echoed a recent Denver Post <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2024/10/06/denver-slaughterhouse-ban-ordinance-309/\">op-ed</a> by Denver resident Jose Huizar, who worked at the slaughterhouse decades ago: “Someone has to wield that knife — over and over,” he wrote. “Spending your day slitting throats, stepping in guts, ripping the skin from the spasming bodies of animals who were alive moments ago — it’s hard to go home to your family after that.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The slaughterhouse, located in Denver’s low-income, majority nonwhite neighborhood of Globeville, <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/november-ballot-measure-threatens-to-shut-down-denvers-only-slaughterhouse-160-jobs-on-the-line\">employs</a> about 160 people — people who don’t want to lose their jobs. Like Measure J, the Denver ballot initiative directs local government to prioritize people whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the measure in workforce training programs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Our hope is not just to stick it to this one slaughterhouse, but to draw a connection to the fact that this is how the industry is run generally,” Olivia Hammond, an organizer for Pro-Animal Future, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Woody Hastings, the Sonoma resident, compared the fight against factory farming to oil and gas phase-outs: Just as we need to transition away from fossil fuels, we know we need to scale down industrial animal agriculture. We also know there will be economic impacts to such change that ought to be distributed fairly, and workers who lose their jobs ought to be treated with dignity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The anti-factory farming movement has a long way to go in convincing the people of Sonoma County and Denver to see industrial animal agriculture the way they do fossil fuels.&nbsp;And without meaningful change in either the underlying demand for meat and dairy, or in nationwide regulation of CAFOs, isolated local initiatives are, for now, likely to only shift production elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But should even one of the ballot measures succeed next month, political leaders might be persuaded that their constituents care enough about farm animal issues to create momentum for further reform. Win or lose, though, animal advocates will still face the wearying task of trying to bridge the public’s cognitive dissonance about where our meat comes from and channel it productively into politics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was featured in the </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\"><em>Processing</em> <em>Meat</em></a><em> newsletter.

Remarkably, winds from Milton actually caused a so-called reverse storm surge in Tampa Bay, which is when seawater recedes. But Tampa, the region’s largest city, still saw severe flooding: Milton dumped an astonishing 17 inches of rain in the region on Wednesday, causing what some have described as a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-milton-path-florida-10-10-24/index.html\">1,000-year flooding event</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sarasota, meanwhile, recorded at least <a href=\"https://x.com/wildweatherdan/status/1844155122714325006\">10 feet of storm surge</a>, which sent seawater rushing into the city. Surge is typically<strong> </strong>the <a href=\"https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/hurricanestormsurge/\">deadliest</a> part of a hurricane. It floods neighborhoods and can collapse homes and drown people. Prior to landfall, Milton also spawned an outbreak of tornadoes, prompting the National Weather Service to issue more than a hundred tornado warnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of Thursday morning, Milton was still a <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/100841.shtml?\">Category 1 storm</a> just off the east coast of Florida, though it’s expected to weaken later today as it moves farther offshore.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/1250x750-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.571555659263,100,76.856888681474\" alt=\"A satellite image shows a white, swirling storm over the southeastern US Atlantic coastline.\" title=\"A satellite image shows a white, swirling storm over the southeastern US Atlantic coastline.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Hurricane Milton travels out to sea off of Florida’s east coast on October 10. | NOAA\" data-portal-copyright=\"NOAA\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s especially gutting is that Milton — the <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/hurricane-milton-rapidly-intensifies-category-5-hurricane-becoming\">ninth Atlantic hurricane</a> during what government officials predicted would be an especially active season — struck parts of Florida that are still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene. Helene made landfall just two weeks ago, killing more than 200 people across the South and Appalachia and a dozen people in the Tampa Bay area. Milton prompted a historic evacuation of western Florida. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On one hand, Hurricane Milton is highly unusual. As I wrote <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/376323/hurricane-milton-category-5-tampa-florida\">earlier this week</a>, the hurricane intensified incredibly quickly, transforming from a tropical storm to a Category 5 in roughly 24 hours. With wind speeds pushing <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al14/al142024.public.011.shtml?\">180 miles per hour</a> earlier in the week and very low pressure, it’s one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then again, extreme storms like Milton are exactly what the world’s leading climate scientists have been predicting now for years. Burning fossil fuels is not just warming the air but also the ocean, and hot water is the key ingredient for super-powerful hurricanes. The threat becomes even greater when you consider that <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/03/florida-and-fast-growing-metros.html\">more and more people</a> are moving to coastal Florida.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The toll of Hurricane Milton will become clearer in the days ahead, and we’ll be here to keep you in the loop. In the meantime, here are a handful of stories that really helped me understand the threat posed by superstorms and how we can be better prepared for them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/377116/hurricane-helene-milton-florida-impact\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://link.vox.com/click/37024899.49941/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9jbGltYXRlLzM3NzExNi9odXJyaWNhbmUtaGVsZW5lLW1pbHRvbi1mbG9yaWRhLWltcGFjdD91ZWlkPThkMWU1MGRlZjQxNmM5OTg1MGFjM2FlNTVjNjE1YzM3/60917ba6ac7e007ef63c8defB394787ea\">As Milton descends, Florida prepares for uncharted territory</a></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The back-to-back phenomena of Hurricanes Helene and Milton spell disaster for communities in Florida that just barely started to rebuild and recover from Helene’s damage.

I’d switched to a new brand recently, and while my hair looked amazing, I’d developed an itchy ring around the perimeter of my skull, like someone had put a poison crown on me. When the itch became so distracting I couldn’t work, I reluctantly switched back to my old, frizz-promoting hair care regimen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then my older kid started scratching.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It turned out that about half his class had head lice. At our house, closer inspection revealed scuttling insects on both our scalps. We began an odyssey of combing and shampooing that lasted weeks, caused at least one meltdown per person, and left our bathroom full of sinister metal nit combs and half-empty bottles of goo.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our experience is a rite of passage for young children and their families. In addition to being disturbing on a psychological level (I, for one, do not like the phrase <a href=\"https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/louse.html\">“blood meal”</a>), lice can cause intense itching; Logan, 5, another recent sufferer, described his recent case to me as “super, amazing, big, wild itchy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lice are often a source of shame and anxiety for families. The insects have “been historically associated with things like poor personal hygiene or houselessness or a certain socioeconomic status,” said Dawn Nolt, a pediatric infectious disease doctor and the lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics’s <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/4/e2022059282/189566/Head-Lice?searchresult=1\">2022 recommendations on lice</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, however, there’s some evidence that they prefer clean hair, Kate King, a school nurse in Ohio and the president of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN), told me. And the insects infest people of all walks of life, all around the world, though kids and caregivers are the most susceptible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lice are an annoyance, not a danger, Nolt said — they do not spread disease. But some school districts, including New York City, where I live, bar kids from the classroom if they’re found to have lice. For my kid, that meant a day spent getting combed in front of the TV, instead of attending kindergarten.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts say no-lice policies — and in-school lice checks in which a nurse or other adult combs an entire class for bugs — don’t actually stop the spread of lice, and are especially problematic as school districts battle <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024/1/9/23904542/chronic-absenteeism-school-attendance\">chronic absenteeism</a> in the wake of Covid-19. “Since the pandemic, we really appreciate the benefits of in-person schooling,” Nolt told me. “Head lice is not a reason for a child to miss school.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The CDC has actually recommended against sending kids home for lice for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/28/nx-s1-5090917/head-lice-schools-cdc-guidance#:~:text=If%20you%20remember%20being%20sent,as%20the%20treatment%20has%20begun.\">more than 10 years</a>. But a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health/lice/myths-about-head-lice-a7156006867/\">website redesign</a> led to a <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/life-culture/2024/08/24/lice-schools-nuts-pinellas-hillsborough-county-cdc/\">resurgence</a> of <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/will-kids-with-head-lice-in-illinois-schools-be-sent-home-early-latest-cdc-state-guidance/ar-AA1pDN6Z?apiversion=v2&amp;noservercache=1&amp;domshim=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1\">interest</a> in the policy at the beginning of the 2024–25 school year, alongside what some say is an <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/head-lice-seem-back-in-force-in-nyc-schools-heres-how-to-prevent-and-treat-them\">uptick in lice cases</a> after a pandemic lull. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of panicking, experts say, families and schools alike should approach lice as what they are: annoying bugs that want to eat us, but that can be defeated with the right tools, and the right attitude.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Logan told me, “Don’t give up.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The truth about head lice</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Head lice are about the size of a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/lice/about/head-lice.html\">sesame seed</a> and can live on a person’s head for about a month, feeding on blood. During that time, they lay eggs called nits, which they stick to the hair shaft very close to the scalp with an adhesive material. Those eggs incubate for about 10 days, Nolt said, before hatching and maturing into new lice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The itching that is the hallmark of a lice infestation is actually caused by the insect’s saliva, which can cause a mild allergic reaction in humans. This reaction takes four to six weeks to develop, Nolt said, so once you start scratching, you’ve already had lice for a while.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lice don’t have wings, and they <a href=\"https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/headlice/headlice.html\">can’t jump</a>, but they spread by crawling from one person’s head to another, usually through head-to-head contact (something that happens a lot among little kids, who like to hug and roughhouse and generally get up in one another’s faces). They can spread through shared hats or clothing, but that’s much less common, Nolt said, because lice simply can’t survive for very long away from their source of warmth and food.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For some kids, the worst part of having lice is getting rid of them. Typically, an adult washes a child’s hair, then uses a special lice comb (included with many over-the-counter lice shampoos) to find all the nits and remove them. Depending on the length of a kid’s hair, the process can take hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The combing really hurt,” Thomas, 7, told me. His parents let him play video games as a distraction, but “it still really hurt,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some kids don’t mind the combing — Byron, Logan’s 2-and-a-half-year-old brother, called it “tingly.” Adding some mythos may help: Logan and Byron informed me that their family had used “nit destroyer warrior” combs “made by lasers.” (A fact-check reveals that some nit combs are purportedly made using <a href=\"https://www.licedoctors.com/product/lice-comb\">“laser technology.”</a>)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Complicating matters further is the fact that lice appear to have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007213/\">evolved some resistance</a> to pyrethrin and permethrin, the active ingredients in many over-the-counter lice shampoos. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475297/\">Some research</a> shows that dimethicone, a gooey polymer that basically suffocates lice, remains effective. This is what finally worked in my house, after several rounds of permethrin-based products failed. It is also extremely oily and takes forever to wash out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this is stressful enough without adding school disruption to the mix. Once children have symptoms, they’ve usually already had lice for weeks, Nolt said. Sending them home for a day or two does little to limit spread, but deprives the child of key learning time. Along with the CDC, the <a href=\"https://www.nasn.org/nasn-resources/professional-practice-documents/position-statements/ps-head-lice\">NASN</a> and the <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/4/e2022059282/189566/Head-Lice?autologincheck=redirected\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> also recommend against sending kids home for lice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In-school lice checks — a mainstay of my millennial childhood that’s still a reality in New York and elsewhere — are also ineffective, experts say. “It doesn&#8217;t produce any real results,” said King, the NASN president. “It’s also very demeaning and shaming for students.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When a child has lice at her school, King contacts the family with information about treatment, and provides free lice shampoo upon request. “Our main focus is to be a helper, not a punisher.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, experts say schools and families should think of lice not as something shameful or frightening, but as a part of childhood — annoying, sure, but normal and not always avoidable. “Head lice are like the common cold,” said King. “Sometimes, it just happens.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I’m reading</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/10/07/myopia-prevention-outdoor-time-children/\">Nearsightedness is on the rise</a> among kids around the world, according to <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/27734/chapter/1\">a new report</a> from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, possibly as a result of the rise in “near work,” such as reading and writing (the effect of smartphones and other screens is still unclear).

Is it also an obsolete one? The question today seems to be: What is the relationship between creativity and artificial<em> </em>intelligence? We tend to think of artistic creativity as a uniquely human endeavor, but what if it can be much more?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Philosophers, artists, and scientists are already debating whether the art and writing generated by Midjourney and ChatGPT are evidence of machines being creative. But should the focus be on the output — the art that’s generated? Or the input — the inspiration?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And what about the other, smaller ways in which we use our creativity, like through a prank on a friend or in a note to a loved one? Does the value of those communications change if AI creates them?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meghan O&#8217;Gieblyn is an essayist and the author of <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567075/god-human-animal-machine-by-meghan-ogieblyn/\"><em>God, Human, Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning</em></a>. She’s been thinking about our relationship with technology for a long time. Her book, originally published in 2022, made a convincing case that we’re going to have to reimagine what it means to be human in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I invited O’Gieblyn on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to explore how AI might force us to also reconsider the meaning — and importance — of creativity. As always, you can hear the full conversation on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"> Spotify</a>,<a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset\"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP6256078816\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How did you start studying and writing and thinking about the relationship between humans and computers?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I came to my interest in technology in a very idiosyncratic way. I grew up in a very religious family. There was a lot of fear about technology when I was growing up during the Y2K crisis, for example, and just all of this focus on the end times prophecies, which were often filtered through the lens of emerging technologies and fears about emerging technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I studied theology for two years at Moody Bible Institute, a very conservative, old Christian institution in Chicago, and ended up having a faith crisis while I was there. I left that belief system behind and just happened to read Ray Kurzweil and some other transhumanists in the years after that deconversion experience. I became kind of obsessed with the relationship between spiritual traditions and the larger philosophy of human nature that I had grown up with, this idea that humans are made in the image of God, that we&#8217;ve been given these divine capacities for reason and creativity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since you brought it up, I should ask for a thumbnail definition of transhumanism.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Transhumanism is a movement that emerged primarily in Silicon Valley in the ’80s and ’90s. Followers believed that humans could use technology to evolve into a higher form of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, the conversations about those possibilities were very speculative. But I think the things that were being discussed at that time are very much being implemented now into technologies that we&#8217;re using every day.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You once asked a computer scientist what he thought creativity meant and he told you, “Well that&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s just randomness.” What do you make of that view of creativity? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s no coincidence that a computer scientist came up with this definition. If you&#8217;re thinking about creativity, or what we call creativity, in large language models (LLMs), you can play around with the temperature gauges. You can basically turn up the temperature and turn up the amount of randomness in the output that you get. So if you ask ChatGPT to give you a list of animals at a low temperature, it&#8217;ll say something very basic like a dog, a cat, a horse. And if you turn up the temperature, it&#8217;ll give you more unusual responses, more statistically unlikely responses like an ant eater. Or if you turn it way up, it&#8217;ll make up an animal like a whistledy-woo or some Seussian creature that doesn&#8217;t exist. So there is some element of randomness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m inclined to think that creativity is not just randomness because we also appreciate order and meaning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The things that I appreciate in art have a lot to do with vision, with point of view, with the sense that you&#8217;re seeing something that&#8217;s been filtered through an autobiography, through a life story. And I think it&#8217;s really difficult to talk about how that&#8217;s happening in AI models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have these large language models, things like ChatGPT and Midjourney, and they produce language, but they do it without anything that I&#8217;d call consciousness. Consciousness is something that&#8217;s notoriously hard to define, but let&#8217;s just call it the sensation of being an agent in the world. LLMs don&#8217;t have that, but is there any way you could call what they&#8217;re doing creative?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The difficult thing is that creativity is a concept that is, like all human concepts, intrinsically anthropocentric. We created the term “creativity” to describe what we do as humans. We have this bad habit of changing the definition of words to suit our opinion of ourselves, especially when machines turn out to be able to do tasks that we previously thought were limited to us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Inspiration has this almost metaphysical or divine undertone to it. And now that we see a lot of that work done by automated processes, it becomes more difficult to say what creativity really is. I think there&#8217;s already an effort, and I sense it myself too, to cordon off this more special island of human exceptionalism and say, “No, what I&#8217;m doing is actually different.”</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think a machine or an AI could ever really communicate in any meaningful way?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There&#8217;s things that you can say in an essay or a book that you can&#8217;t say just in normal social conversations, just because of the form.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I love seeing the way that other people see the world. When people ask, “Do you think an AI could create the next best American novel, the great American novel?” We&#8217;re talking a lot in those hypotheticals about technical skill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And to me, I think even if it was — on the sentence level or even on the level of concepts and ideas — something that we would consider, virtuoso, just the fact that it came from a machine changes the way that we experience it. When I&#8217;m reading something online and I start to suspect that it was generated by AI, it changes the way I&#8217;m reading. I think that there&#8217;s always that larger context of how we experience things, and intent and consciousness is a big part of it.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s something about the intentionality behind artistic creations that really matters to us. It&#8217;s not like when I consume a piece of art, I&#8217;m asking myself, how long did it take to make this? But I know subconsciously there was a lot of thought and energy put into it, that there was a creator with experiences and feelings that I can relate to who&#8217;s communicating something in a way they couldn&#8217;t if they weren&#8217;t a fellow human being. That matters, right?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that the effort that we have to put into making things is part of what gives it meaning, both for the audience and the person who&#8217;s producing it. The actual sacrifices and the difficulty of making something is what makes it feel really satisfying when you finally get it right. And it&#8217;s also true for the person experiencing it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think about this a lot even with things that we might not consider works of genius. Everyday people have always been creative — like my grandfather, who would occasionally write poetry or make up funny poems for different occasions. He didn&#8217;t have a college education, but he was creative and the poems were personalized for the person or for the occasion. And that&#8217;s precisely the kind of thing that an LLM couldn’t do very well, right? It could write a simple poem and you could prompt it to do that. But what would that mean to us if it was just produced by a prompt? I think that really does change how you experience something like that.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you remember that controversy over the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck\">Google Gemini commercial</a>? It’s Google&#8217;s competitor with OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT. The commercial has a young girl who wants to write a fan letter to her hero, who&#8217;s an Olympic gold medalist or something like that. Her dad says something like “I&#8217;m okay with words, but this letter has to be perfect.” And so he&#8217;s just going to let the AI write it for them.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is horrifying to me because it shows that AI isn&#8217;t just coming for our art and entertainment, it&#8217;s not just going to be writing sitcoms or doing podcasts, it&#8217;s going to supplant sincere authentic human-to-human communication. It&#8217;s going to automate our emotional lives. And I don&#8217;t know what to call that potential world other than a machine world populated by machine-like people and maybe eventually just machine people. And that&#8217;s a world I desperately, desperately want to avoid.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a long time I wrote an advice column for Wired magazine where people could write in with questions about technology in their everyday life. And one of the questions I got very shortly after ChatGPT was released was from somebody who is going to be the best man in their friend&#8217;s wedding. And he said, “Can I use ChatGPT, ethically, to do a best man&#8217;s speech for me?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There&#8217;s cases of people doing this. People use it to write their wedding vows. And my first instinct was like, well, you&#8217;re robbing yourself of the ability to actually try to put into words what you are feeling for your friend and what that relationship means to you. And it&#8217;s not as though those feelings just exist in you already.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think anyone who&#8217;s written something very personal like this realizes that you actually start to feel the emotions as you&#8217;re putting it into language and trying to articulate it. I think about the same thing with this hypothetical fan letter that the girl is writing in the commercial, right? It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re stealing from your child the opportunity to actually try to access her emotions through language.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think that AI will make radically new kinds of art possible?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any of us who are daring to speak about this topic right now really are putting ourselves out there and risking looking stupid in two years or five years down the road. But it is true that AI is often called an alien form of intelligence and the fact is that it reasons very differently than we do. It doesn&#8217;t intuitively understand what&#8217;s relevant in a dataset the way that we do because we&#8217;ve evolved together to value the same things as humans.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is a big question, but I&#8217;m comfortable asking you because of your theological background. Do you think we have any real sense of the spiritual impact of AI?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s a paradox in some way, right? Technologies are very anti-spiritual in the sense that they usually represent a very reductive and materialist understanding of human nature. But with every new technological development, there&#8217;s also been this tendency to spiritualize it or think of it in superstitious ways. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think about the emergence of photography during the Civil War and how people believed that you could see dead people in the background. Or the idea that radio could transmit voices from the spiritual world. It’s not as though technology is going to rob us of a spiritual life. I think that technological progress competes with the type of transcendence that spiritual and religious traditions talk about, in the sense that it is a way to push beyond our current existence and get in touch with something that&#8217;s bigger than the human. I think a very deep human instinct is to try to get in touch with something that&#8217;s bigger than us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I think that there&#8217;s a trace of that in the effort to build AGI. This idea that we&#8217;re going to create something that is going to be able to see the world from a higher perspective, right? And that&#8217;s going to be able to give our lives meaning in a new way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you look at most spiritual traditions and wisdom literature from around the world, it usually involves this paradox where if you want to transcend yourself, you also have to acknowledge your limitations. You have to acknowledge that the ego is an illusion, you have to admit that you&#8217;re a sinner, you have to humble yourself in order to access that higher reality. And I think technology is a sort of transcendence without the work and the suffering that that entails for us in a more spiritual sense.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What I&#8217;m always thinking about in these sorts of conversations is this long-term question of what we are as human beings, what we&#8217;re doing to ourselves, and what we&#8217;re evolving into. Nietzsche loved this distinction between being versus becoming. Humanity is not some fixed thing. We&#8217;re not a static being. Like everything in nature, we&#8217;re in this process of becoming. So what are we becoming?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At some point, I think, a threshold is crossed, right? Where is that? If we&#8217;re becoming something, we&#8217;ve already been becoming something different with the technologies that we&#8217;re using right now. And is there some hard line where we&#8217;ll become post-human or another species? I don&#8217;t know. My instinct is to think that there&#8217;s going to be more pushback against that future as we approach it than it might seem right now in the abstract.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that it&#8217;s difficult to articulate exactly what we value about the human experience until we are confronted with technologies that are threatening it in some way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the really great writing and the conversations that are happening right now are about trying to actually put into words what we value about being human. And I think these technologies might actually help clarify that conversation in a way that we haven&#8217;t been forced to articulate it before. They can help us think about what our values are and how can we create technology that is actually going to serve those values, as opposed to making us the subjects of what these machines happen to be good at doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-ai-creative/id1081584611?i=1000672029347\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-ai-creative/id1081584611?i=1000672029347\">Listen to the rest of the conversation</a> and be sure to follow</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea\"><em> The Gray Area</em></a><em> on</em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\"><em> Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"><em> Spotify</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793\"><em> Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

One <a href=\"https://x.com/StaceDiva/status/1837572383491621001\">clip</a> where he appears to stump a woman during a discussion about abortion and IUDs garnered millions of views on X.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is just one of the contentious and extremely clicky scenarios explored by the media company Jubilee in its popular YouTube series “Surrounded.” The series’ setup looks like a satire of what debate has become in the age of Trump: extremely competitive, theatrical, and unbalanced (literally and emotionally) to boot. What should theoretically be an exchange of facts and logic has become the ultimate bloodsport for a certain type of “thought leader” often happy to traffic in opinions and distorted truths. These oral pugilists are more interested in some online-only version of “winning” than having meaningful discourse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the political spectrum, there has proven to be an appetite for watching people shout at each other. These on-air clashes have been the bread and butter of cable news networks like CNN and Fox News. Still, these filmed debates mostly promote the pessimistic notion that the US is too polarized to be saved. They’re frequently a front-row seat to all the misinformation, conspiracy theories, and regressive attitudes polluting the political landscape and affecting people’s daily lives. So why can’t we stop watching them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">In the Trump era, liberal vs. conservative face-offs are everywhere&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While this critique has certainly been amplified in the Trump era, the observation that public debate has become a circus is not exactly new. You can go back decades; in the 2000s, Jon Stewart (fairly) disparaged <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8016365/jon-stewart-crossfire\"><em>Crossfire</em></a>; in the ’90s, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> parodied the unproductive and shouty nature of political panel show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOLF_D7JVZM\"><em>The McLaughlin Group</em></a> and, later, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Hp9kYKFRh2I?feature=shared\"><em>The View</em></a>. However, in the digital age, this kind of content has been mass-produced and even more degraded. You no longer have to watch CNN or programs like <em>Real Time With Bill Maher</em> to see opposing parties talk over each other and manipulate facts. Instead, you can go to the New York Post’s website to watch two random people shout about the legitimacy of the Black Lives Matter movement in a series called <a href=\"https://nypost.com/video/why-this-black-woman-is-against-black-lives-matter/\">“Face Your Hater</a>” or watch a group of strangers argue about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nE3EQEBzc0\">traditional and modern masculinity</a> on Vice’s YouTube channel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ryan Broderick, a freelance journalist who writes the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/\">Garbage Day,</a> began noticing these viral confrontations ramping up after the Obama era, a period that saw a growing cultural backlash to progressive policies and rhetoric (i.e. the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12118872/southern-racism-tea-party-trump\">Tea Party movement</a>) and eventually culminated in Trump’s election. This was a time when liberals and moderates were encouraging each other to “reach across the aisle” and talk about politics with their Trump-supporting relatives during holidays. He describes these filmed social experiments as an “impulse from extremely naive digital media companies.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That whole style of content got really popular because there was this impulse coming out of the Obama years that we could bypass all the unpleasantness of the last 10 years if we could just talk to each other,” said Broderick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of these videos are at least designed as slightly more benevolent attempts to see if two supposedly opposing identities can find common ground or at least engage in a civil conversation. The YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhEt049ohYg&amp;list=PLxNRGjzMwCdzo0VFIT36FA5FHJrac2hhX\">Only Human</a> has a series called “Eating With the Enemy” where two people from different backgrounds — like a drag queen and a Catholic priest, for example — share a meal while discussing political issues, like gay marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others, like Vice’s popular “Debate” series on YouTube, can get a little more dramatic and heated, like watching a daytime panel show or a scene from <em>Real Housewives</em>.&nbsp;Even with a moderator guiding the discussion, they aren&#8217;t exactly designed with the goal of finding middle ground or even having one side convince the other of their argument. Rather, they feel like useless surveys meant to convey our country’s deeply divided climate. For instance, one debate between a group of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEIvWNhuL8U\">“anti and pro feminists”</a> arguing over a slew of women’s and trans issues ends with some of the participants talking to the camera about their experiences. Ultimately, they leave more affirmed in their established beliefs than moved by other arguments.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/fallbackpol2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jubilee’s “Surrounded” series feels more like a MrBeast-inspired game show in its pure stuntiness. Even the way the channel highlights the number of people debating against one another resembles his excessive model. The prompts displayed in the top corner of the videos — like “trans women are women” or “Kamala Harris is a DEI candidate”— aren’t rigorous or challenging. They feel primed to become “rage bait” clips meant to get viewers excited or angry, to the tune of millions of clicks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, this content is sort of genius in the way it attracts and satisfies a range of audiences because there’s typically someone you can agree with and believe made the better argument. For instance, someone can watch Jubilee’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WV29R1M25n8?feature=shared\">video of Charlie Kirk</a> being schooled by college students with more educated arguments and still, if they’re a fan of his, believe he won the debate. Broderick says that Jubilee, despite the pugnacious nature of their videos, inadvertently creates this sort of “feel-good centrist” content designed for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can&#8217;t fathom watching this and thinking that Charlie Kirk looks good,” says Broderick. “But from what I&#8217;ve seen of right-wingers watching this stuff, they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, he&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s making sense.’”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Online debates have become a successful way to self-brand&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Conservative pundits, in particular, have taken online debate culture to competitive and self-serving extremes. The phrase “debate me, bro” has become&nbsp; largely associated with the very online and combative community of right-wing commentators, like Dinesh D’Souza and Steven Crowder — a.k.a. the guy in the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/steven-crowders-change-my-mind-campus-sign\">“change my mind” meme</a> — who are constantly challenging liberal politicians, women, or practically anyone who disagrees with them on the internet to verbally spar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For personalities like Kirk, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson, these videos have become a promotional tool to prove their authority in the marketplace — or, more precisely, battlefield — of ideas. Given that many of them host debates or upload in-person confrontations on their media platforms, they’re able to edit or advertise themselves as outsmarting their opponents. For instance, the YouTube channel for Turning Point USA <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AeEFiJQCe_c?feature=shared\">features</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SkbzCZlFTVg?feature=shared\">videos</a> of Kirk supposedly “destroying” “arrogant” and “naive” students on liberal college campuses on his speaking tours. These videos are not actually about producing an interesting dialogue but rather humiliating their opponents and highlighting their supposed stupidity.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/fallbackpol3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Leftists, like YouTuber Destiny and livestreamer Hasan Piker, have also gained visibility and clicks via their eagerness to argue with conservatives. Journalist Max Read, who writes the newsletter <a href=\"https://maxread.substack.com/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://maxread.substack.com/\">Read Max</a>, says that, when it comes to these chronic debaters, the line between “self-promotion and movement-building” can be very thin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can understand the idea that you&#8217;re not just boosting your own profile; you&#8217;re boosting the profile of your politics and trying to bring more people into it,” says Read. “However, I’m inclined to be more generous to YouTubers who make explanatory response videos than join debates.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dean Withers, who’s participated in several Jubilee videos, hosts livestreams on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itsdeaann?lang=en\">TikTok</a> where he debates with users about political subjects. He also posts solo responses to right-wing talking points. He says he understands people’s criticism around his debate content as clicky and unproductive. However, he says he uses these exchanges as opportunities to educate his audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The main prerogative of my platform is to inform the people watching the debates that I have on what the issues are, why they matter, and why you should agree with me,” he says. “I know that getting my opponent to agree with me is more than likely to never occur.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For someone, like Withers — who was in middle school when Trump was elected and whose political consciousness was developed in the social-media age — debating with strangers online may just seem like an obvious approach to activism. Research has found, though, that this phenomenon may create a more toxic picture of how humans engage in political discourse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Political boxing matches might be entertaining, but they don’t reflect how we communicate in reality</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A March <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55131-4\">study</a> found that political debates on social media often give the impression of a climate that’s more combative and divided than it actually is. Specifically, research found that Americans are more likely to argue over political topics with people they know and trust, like family and friends, than strangers on the internet, and often leave these interactions with positive feelings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">University of California Berkeley professor Erica Bailey, who co-authored the study, says these intense, Jubilee-like debates “almost never happen in real life.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“While these debates can seem ubiquitous because we&#8217;re constantly being fed them through our screens, my research has found that the typical American debates hot-button issues infrequently,” she says. “Of the most common topics, like vaccines, reproductive rights, and policing, only about half of Americans have debated these topics in the last year.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the rare occasion that you may be forced to defend a political stance, it can still be a pretty daunting task and cause feelings of anxiety. This seems to be one of the reasons we can’t stop watching these videos. On the whole, these exchanges seem generally unpleasant, but it can provide a sense of relief to watch an expert — or someone who claims to be an expert — confidently expressing their opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When you engage in debate, you often find out all the ways in which your knowledge and understanding is incomplete,” says Bailey. “Watching debate videos is cathartic because we get to cosplay as an excellent debater who can articulate our position with ease. It also helps that these clips are certainly edited to show us the most persuasive moment of the exchange.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Humans also just tend to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345698319_Emotion_and_Virality_What_Makes_Online_Content_Go_Viral\">engage more</a> with content that elicits a strong emotional response. It’s one of the reasons even the most obvious “rage bait” is hard to avoid on social media, whether you&#8217;re the type of person who would ordinarily click on it or not. This behavior, plus algorithms that boost this sort of controversial content, has created a cycle of doom content we can’t escape.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While content like Jubilee’s abounds, the staginess and over-produced structure of these videos underlie a comforting truth: This level of antagonism surrounding political discourse may be clicky but it is thankfully not natural.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;“It might be surprising given the state of polarization,” says Bailey. “But humans are typically wired toward social cohesion. In the end, we really don’t want to fight; we want to belong. ”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

No more, “Bro, that movie’s so dumb, it’s [r-word],” no more, “Don’t be stupid, why are you acting like such a [r-word]?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the internet, commentators had their doubts that the movement would succeed, or even that it was worthwhile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Surely, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021103896_2.html?sid=ST2010021403772\">detractors</a> <a href=\"https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/r_word.html\">argued</a>, we had seen this dance before, with words like “idiot” and “moron” and “stupid.”&nbsp;All of them were originally developed as clinical terms for people with intellectual disorders, and they all eventually became insults as the wider public picked up on them, in a process variously called <a href=\"https://becauselanguage.com/39-is-this-a-reference/\">the euphemism cycle</a> or the <a href=\"https://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf\">euphemism treadmill</a>. “Idiot” and its ilk emerged in an era that lacked <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24098830/holy-shit-brief-history-profanity-melissa-mohr-what-the-f-benjamin-bergen-praise-michael-adams\">our current moment’s sensitivity over slurs</a>, so they hadn’t experienced the same boycott campaign that the r-word was facing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if the r-word was banished, wouldn’t new pejoratives simply replace it? “If interest groups want to pour resources into cleaning up unintentional insults, more power to them,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021103896_2.html?sid=ST2010021403772\">allowed a Washington Post column in 2010</a>. “But we must not let ‘retard’ go without a requiem. If the goal is to protect intellectually disabled individuals from put-downs and prejudice, it won&#8217;t succeed. New words of insult will replace old ones.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>All of them were originally developed as clinical terms for people with intellectual disorders, and they all eventually became insults</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet apparently against the odds, the campaign worked. Over the past decade, bit by bit, the r-word more or less vanished. (To a certain extent, though, the expected also occurred, as other euphemisms did in fact emerge. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/28/trump-harris-attacks-mentally-impaired-criticism/\">Donald Trump has lately taken to contending</a>, just on the edge of a slur, that he thinks Kamala Harris might be “mentally disabled.”)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until the past year or so, that is, when the r-word appeared to be trending back up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Posts <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/r-word-social-media\">using the word</a> have racked up tens of thousands of likes, bookmarks, and reposts on X in the last year. Edgelord comedians have started to use the word in their sets. “I know I said ‘retarded’ there a couple times. My bad on that,” said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce9_jwots-w\">comic Shane Gillis in a recent set</a> as he introduced a joke about his uncle’s Down Syndrome. On FX’s new sitcom <em>The English Teacher</em>, teachers muse about how “the kids are not into being woke” anymore and “they’re saying the r-word again.” It’s become a bipartisan slur, available to anyone on the right or the left or in between <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/373990/heterodoxy-anti-woke-libertarian-tech-bro\">who wants to show off their iconoclasm</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This summer I started hearing it right after the Democratic convention,” says Katy Neas, CEO at The Arc, a disability rights advocacy group. “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/tim-walz-gus-walz-neurodivergence/\">Governor Walz’s son</a> [who has neurodivergence] appeared, and I saw people being comfortable in using it on social media.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Andrea Cahn, vice president at Special Olympics Unified Champion Schools who helped <a href=\"https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/news/spread-the-word-inclusion\">lead the 2009 campaign against the r-word</a>, says she’s seen steadily increasing attention to the old parts of the Special Olympics website that used to promote their anti r-word campaigns. “Last year, people started asking for it because they were saying that they needed to reconnect with that messaging,” says Cahn. “So we promoted those pages, and traffic to the website went up by 200 or 300 percent or something like that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to say for sure that usage of the r-word is increasing. The use of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24098830/holy-shit-brief-history-profanity-melissa-mohr-what-the-f-benjamin-bergen-praise-michael-adams\">swear words across time is notoriously hard to track</a>. But it does at the very least look as though for some demographics, the r-word has become trendy in a way that it wasn’t a few short years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s how the r-word fell out of usage and why it seems to be coming back now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Running on the euphemism treadmill</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the ways you can tell when a group is particularly marginalized is that the words we use to describe them come to seem humiliating and dehumanizing, even when they’re not intended to be. We can track this process very neatly when it comes to people with intellectual disabilities by observing the name changes of a group now known as the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_1820#:~:text=The%20name%20was%20changed%20again,American%20Association%20on%20Intellectual%20and\">American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</a> (AAIDD).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the AAIDD was founded in 1876, its name was the Association of Medical Officers of American Institutions for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Persons. In 1910, it became the American Association for the Study of the Feebleminded. By 1933, it was the American Association on Mental Deficiency. In 1957, the American Association on Mental Retardation. Finally, in 2007, it became the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Idiot” and “feeble-minded” were legitimate medical diagnoses in their day. So, too, was “mentally retarded.” Over time, though, they all became words that laypeople were happy to throw around as insults, which in turn meant that as medical terminology, they came to feel humiliating to the people they were supposed to help. In order to do their work, the words had to shift. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This kind of shifting of meaning was called <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087798\">the euphemism cycle by linguist Sharon Henderson Taylor in 1974</a>, and later renamed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/opinion/the-game-of-the-name.html\">euphemism treadmill by psycholinguist Stephen Pinker in 1994</a>. “Euphemisms denoting low intelligence seem particularly susceptible to the sort of pejoration that the word ‘retarded’ is undergoing,” observed Taylor in her paper “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087798\">Terms for Low Intelligence</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The r-word started to fall out of official usage in the last decades of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st. In 2010, <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/11/2017-14343/rosas-law\">Barack Obama signed into effect Rosa’s Law</a>, which removed the words “mental retardation” from federal law and replaced them with the words “intellectual disability” or “intellectual disabilities.” <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145120/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704865104575588273153838564\">Multiple states followed suit</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>By 2018, so many students had signed a pledge not to use the r-word as part of “Spread the Word” that the campaign was basically over</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the r-word faded out of official language, activists began to turn their attention to more casual use. Cahn says the 2007 film <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, which prominently features <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WHBO_Qc-Q\">a joke about actors “going full retard,”</a> was a major impetus for Special Olympics to launch their “Spread the Word to End the Word” campaign to eradicate the r-word once and for all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;“We had some youth advocates that were really vocal about the harm and the insult that it was — people with intellectual disabilities, athletes of Special Olympics, and a lot of our young people that were involved in Unified Sports in schools,” says Cahn. “We had a fairly concerted campaign around <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, and that really galvanized our population.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2018, so many students had signed a pledge not to use the r-word as part of “Spread the Word” that the campaign was basically over. “Our school participants were asking, ‘What’s next?’” says Cahn. The Special Olympics team decided to expand to “focus on a larger, broader inclusion message” focused less on teaching kids about the r-word specifically. After all, they already knew.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or, at least, they used to. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/r-word.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.060057723875,100,79.879884552251\" alt=\"Student protesters on the City Hall steps hold hand-lettered signs that read “Respect is the new r-word.”\" title=\"Student protesters on the City Hall steps hold hand-lettered signs that read “Respect is the new r-word.”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Special education students rally on the City Hall steps in San Francisco, California, in March 2017 to discourage the use of the r-word. | San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images \" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the r-word came back</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to say why the r-word is suddenly so much more visible now than it was a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One reason might be that influencers have far more reach now, and they experience less incentive to avoid insulting parts of their audience than traditional celebrities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;“Perhaps it has to do with the fact that the more traditional celebrity is more aware of the feedback or more concerned about a feedback loop that could happen,” Cahn says. “Whereas, for the more individual influencer, they have less at stake when being outrageous.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, for some online personalities, being outrageous is the whole point. Linguist Caitlin Green points out that the r-word has become a convenient marker of edgy identity among conservatives online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What you&#8217;re doing when you use a slur is you&#8217;re telling the people in your audience, ‘This is the kind of person I am, and this is the kind of attitude I have toward the normies that don&#8217;t use that word,’” says Green. “You get the right-wingers using it because they&#8217;re anti-woke and not using the slur is <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Locals\">local</a>, right?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Linguist Christopher Hom notes that the heroes of the online right are those with the loudest voices when it comes to mocking those with disabilities, if not outright using the r-word. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/3/1/14772908/trump-disability-fda-megan-crowley\">Trump infamously mocked journalists with disabilities</a> <em>twice</em> in 2015 during his successful campaign for the presidency. “That really sends a signal about what&#8217;s acceptable and about how our social norms can change,” says Hom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who has <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-under-fire-for-using-anti-disability-slur-on-x\">publicly used the r-word</a> to taunt his critics online, has chosen to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1142399312/twitter-trust-and-safety-council-elon-musk\">remove the old Twitter safeguards against hate speech</a> since he purchased the site in 2022. Under Musk’s reign, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/25/1239549276/elon-musk-lawsuit-hate-speech-researchers\">the r-word has been free to spread and flourish</a> on what is now known as X.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It creates this cycle where you see that the word is allowed, so then others feel like they can use it,” says Hom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The r-word seems to be particularly appealing for <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/03/elon-musk-racist-tweets-science-video/\">Musk and others in the Silicon Valley right </a>who are preoccupied with racist pseudoscience around <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/race-science-far-right-charlie-kirk/679527/\">whether some races have higher IQs than others.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That ideology is pretty closely connected with the tendency to go for a mental disability over another kind of slur,” says Green. If a central part of your worldview is the reprehensible idea that some races are physically and mentally superior, ableism becomes especially important: You prove that one race is better than another by making the claim that it’s less likely to experience disabilities and that people who experience disabilities are less than human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“It creates this cycle where you see that the word is allowed, so then others feel like they can use it”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The r-word can also be attractive to people who identify as leftists and want to make a point that they’re cooler than mainstream liberals. “A lot of them are trying to claim this position that&#8217;s actually kind of a balancing act to maintain,” says Green, “which is ‘Yes, I&#8217;m on the left, but I&#8217;m not one of those crazy, screechy lefty people. I&#8217;m cool. I&#8217;m willing to use slurs.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The resurgence of the r-word could also be seen as a sign that mainstream culture has gotten less censorious in the post-pandemic 2020s than it was during the more progressive 2010s. “People are just being less sensitive,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18mz8jk/whats_with_the_resurgence_of_the_rslur/\">said one poster on Reddit</a> during a conversation earlier this year about why the r-word has returned. “For most of the 2010&#8217;s the attitude was not offending anybody and walking on eggshells. Now it seems to be shifting to ‘Just don&#8217;t be an asshole and if you are here&#8217;s the hardline’ and the word ‘Retard&#8217; isn&#8217;t on that line.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why people think ableism is just not that bad&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ableism is frequently the prejudice that doesn’t quite make it to the hardline. “Ableism is an easy one to ridicule as a concept,” says Green. “We have these discourses that come up every once in a while on social media, where someone will be like, ‘<a href=\"https://themighty.com/topic/disability/imani-barbarin-ableist-backlash-doorddash-delivery/\">Telling me not to use DoorDash is ableist</a>,’ or like, ‘Telling me I have to smile when I’m at my customer service job is ableist.’ And then everybody piles on them, and they&#8217;re like, ‘Oh my god, these online woke people, they&#8217;re out of control.’”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Ableism is the vector” that leads to stern think pieces about how wokeness has gone too far, Green adds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People may overlook the discrimination disabled people face if they compare it to other prejudices that run rampant in the US. Hom cites the <a href=\"https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime\">FBI’s hate crime report</a>, which shows 28 incidents of violence against those with mental disabilities over the past year, as opposed to over 1,000 incidents against Black people and Jewish people combined. But violent crime against people with disabilities is still disproportionately high, <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/capd0919st.pdf\">and in 2021, the Department of Justice reported that it was rising</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“But if you look at the other factors,” Hom continues, “the kind of boring factors that are really significant about quality of life, the ability to have a dignified life, to be able to have self-determination, it&#8217;s really bad actually. The numbers are quite shocking.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.prb.org/articles/u-s-adults-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-are-living-longer-but-covid-threatens-to-erase-recent-gains/\">People with intellectual disabilities live 12 years less</a> than other adults on average. For those with Down Syndrome, it’s 18 years less, and for those with cerebral palsy, it’s 23 years less. People with intellectual disabilities are more likely to develop <a href=\"https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/23-1/people-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-growing-old-an-overview\">chronic health conditions</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21200257/disabilities-coronavirus-group-homes-isolation-policy\">die of Covid-19</a>. During the height of the pandemic, some states adopted the policy that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21200257/disabilities-coronavirus-group-homes-isolation-policy\">ventilators should be preferentially saved</a> for those without disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To state plainly a thing most people sort of already know: Our society <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/352245/caregiving-intellectual-disability-developmental-adult-autism-down-syndrome\">is not set up well for people with disabilities.</a> It is very difficult and very expensive to live a good life as a disabled person in the US. Despite those facts, it seems to be very easy for many people to think of ableism as the kind of prejudice that doesn’t really count and the r-word as not a real slur.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jason Rogers, 32, has been involved in Special Olympics for years. As a teenager, he competed in swimming, which he says is his all-time favorite sport, and also practiced track and field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It seems to be very easy to think of ableism as the kind of prejudice that doesn’t really count and the r-word as not a real slur</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, Rogers is the coordinator of workplace readiness and inclusion on the leadership and organizational development team at Special Olympics International. He’s also community liaison for the Down Syndrome Community of Greater Chattanooga. Last summer, a stranger called him the r-word at a memorial service for a recently deceased family member.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Think before you say something,” says Rogers. “Don’t say something you regret. We take the r-word very seriously in the Down community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite this seriousness, the r-word’s defenders protest that replacing it will be useless and that a new slur is certain to come along before too long. It’s a popular position to take. It’s popular even though the reason we keep having to replace medical terminology for people with intellectual disabilities is because we transfigure those words into a deeply humiliating insult, and we do that because our society is designed to treat people with disabilities with contempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Ableism is what is fueling the euphemistic treadmill,” says Hom. “I take this as evidence that ableism really is pretty significant in our culture.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Around 15 years ago, a new campaign took off across the young social media ecosystem.&#160; People with learning disabilities and intellectual disorders were asking everyone else to stop using the r-word to describe them or even to make jokes. No more, “Bro, that movie’s so dumb, it’s [r-word],” no more, “Don’t be stupid, why are [&#8230;]",

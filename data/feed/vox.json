It’s good for our <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_gratitude_changes_you_and_your_brain\">mental</a> and <a href=\"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-201607000-00005\">physical</a> health. And here’s another thing:<strong> </strong>It can actually change our brains in ways that make us more altruistic — just in time for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/26/18098840/when-is-giving-tuesday\">Giving Tuesday</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The past two decades have seen a flurry of research on gratitude, beginning in the early 2000s with a series of landmark papers by Robert Emmons, Michael McCullough, and other psychologists. In recent years, we’ve learned through <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00599/full\">several</a> <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_gratitude_changes_you_and_your_brain\">scientific</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288932385_The_effects_of_gratitude_expression_on_neural_activity\">studies</a> that there’s a deep neural connection between gratitude and giving — they share a pathway in the brain —&nbsp;and that when we’re grateful, our brains become more charitable.</p>\n\n<p>Christina Karns, a neuroscientist at the University of Oregon, is one of the leading researchers in this field. In 2017, she wondered what happens in the brain when you receive a gift versus when you give one —&nbsp;and whether the neural response differs depending on your character. So she placed study participants in a brain scanner and had them watch as a computer moved real money into their own account or gave it to a food bank instead.</p>\n\n<p>Karns <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-youre-grateful-your-brain-becomes-more-charitable-105606\">described</a> what she learned:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It turns out that the neural connection between gratitude and giving is very deep, both literally and figuratively. A region deep in the frontal lobe of the brain, called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, is key to supporting both. Anatomically, this region is wired up to be a hub for processing the value of risk and reward; it’s richly connected to even deeper brain regions that provide a kick of pleasurable neurochemicals in the right circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The participants I’d identified as more grateful and more altruistic via a questionnaire [showed] a stronger response in these reward regions of the brain when they saw the charity gaining money. It felt good for them to see the food bank do well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Next, Karns wanted to know whether, by changing how much gratitude people felt, she could change the way the brain reacts to giving and getting. So she split participants into two groups. Over three weeks, one group journaled about the things they were grateful for, while the other group journaled about other (non-gratitude-specific) happenings in their lives.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Vox guide to giving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving — from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving\">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h1>\n\n<p>The people in the gratitude-journaling contingent reported experiencing more thankfulness. What’s more, the reward regions of their brain started responding more to charitable giving than to gaining money for themselves. As Karns writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Practicing gratitude shifted the value of giving in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. It changed the exchange rate in the brain. Giving to charity became more valuable than receiving money yourself. After the brain calculates the exchange rate, you get paid in the neural currency of reward, the delivery of neurotransmitters that signal pleasure and goal attainment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are striking (though likely not permanent) effects. Of course, we still need<strong> </strong>more research to fully understand the brain mechanisms underlying gratitude, giving, and how they relate. But for those of us who don’t always find resonant the old adage that “giving is better than receiving,” Karns’s results,<strong> </strong>if true, offer a useful amendment: Giving really can be better — if you make it so. You can proactively choose to retrain your brain so it gets more pleasure out of giving.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here are some effective ways to cultivate gratitude</h2>\n\n<p>If increasing people’s gratitude is an effective way to increase their charitableness, then maybe it’s worth nudging people to cultivate more gratitude.</p>\n\n<p>For now, we’ve got at least one such nudge built into our calendar: Thanksgiving. Many religious traditions also include daily practices meant to foster gratitude, and scientific studies have shown that some — like <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232522538_Can_Prayer_Increase_Gratitude\">prayer</a> —&nbsp;really do have that effect.</p>\n\n<p>If practicing gratitude isn’t yet part of your daily routine and you’d like to cultivate it throughout the year and not only on Thanksgiving, here are a few practices that researchers have found to be effective in boosting thankfulness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gratitude journaling: </strong>This simple practice — jotting down things you’re grateful for&nbsp;—&nbsp;has gained popularity over the past few years. But studies show there are <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal\">more and less effective ways to do it</a>. Researchers say it’s better to write in detail about one particular thing, really savoring it, than to dash off a superficial list of things. They recommend that you try to focus on people you’re grateful to, because that’s more impactful than focusing on things, and that you focus on events that surprised you, because they generally elicit stronger feelings of thankfulness.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers also note that writing in a gratitude journal once or twice a week is better for your well-being than doing it every day. In one study, people who wrote once a week for six weeks reported increased happiness afterward; people who wrote three times a week didn’t. That’s because our brains have an annoying habit called hedonic adaptation. “We adapt to positive events quickly, especially if we constantly focus on them,” Emmons <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal\">explains</a>. “It seems counterintuitive, but it is how the mind works.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gratitude letters and visits:</strong> Another practice is to write a letter of gratitude to someone. Research shows it significantly increases your levels of gratitude, even if you never actually send the letter. And the effects on the brain can last for months. In one <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26746580\">study</a>, subjects who participated in gratitude letter writing expressed more thankfulness and showed more activity in their pregenual anterior cingulate cortex — an area involved in predicting the outcomes of our actions — three months later.</p>\n\n<p>Some psychologists, like Martin Seligman, Sonja&nbsp;Lyubomirsky, and Jeffrey Froh,<strong> </strong>have studied a variation on the gratitude letter practice by having participants write a letter to someone they’ve never properly thanked, then visit the person and read the letter aloud to them. A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://people.hofstra.edu/jeffrey_j_froh/fall%202009%20web/froh%20article%20PDF_JOPP%20final%20proof-1.pdf\">2009 study led by Froh</a>&nbsp;found that teens experienced a big increase in positive emotions after doing a gratitude visit —&nbsp;even two months later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Experiential consumption:</strong> There’s another way to foster gratitude and thwart hedonic adaptation that seems especially relevant to the upcoming gift-buying season: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/13/20951937/money-experiences-buy-happiness-happy-how-to-spend\">Spend your money on experiences</a>, not things. The Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley <a href=\"https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/GGSC-JTF_White_Paper-Gratitude-FINAL.pdf?_ga=2.266174863.1800487513.1574786384-585000017.1571342301\">summarizes</a> a major study on experiential consumption like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Across six experiments, this study found that people felt and expressed more gratitude following a purchase of an experience (e.g., concert tickets or meals out) than a purchase of a material good (e.g., clothing or jewelry). According to the researchers, these experiments suggest that “as a naturalistic behavior that is relatively resistant to adaptation, experiential consumption may be an especially easy way to encourage the experience of gratitude.”&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, if you’re going to buy something special this holiday season, consider making it an experience. The resultant gratitude is more likely to stick around in the brain — and where gratitude abounds, altruism may follow.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect-newsletter\"><em><strong>Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;Twice a week, you’ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest challenges: improving public health, decreasing human and animal suffering, easing catastrophic risks, and — to put it simply — getting better at doing good.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

You can’t have woke military,” Trump said in a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-vows-fire-generals-push-wokeness-cant-woke-military\">Fox News interview in June</a> summing up his views.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Any general that was involved — general, admiral, whatever — that was involved in any of the DEI woke shit, it’s got to go,” Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoN5ovwB8s4\">said in a podcast interview</a> released in November that was conducted prior to his nomination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They claim the military has been so distracted by efforts to promote diversity in its ranks that it’s negatively affected the body’s readiness for conflicts as well as its ability to recruit new soldiers. <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/03/30/pentagon-critics-blame-diversity-policies-and-fitness-standards-recruiting-woes.html\">Pentagon officials have refuted these statements</a>, <a href=\"https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/May-June-2021/Garrett-Military-Diversity/\">however.</a> And a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2022/08/24.html\">2022 RAND Corporation report</a> laid out key ways that leveraging diversity could be beneficial to the military and its ability to develop new technology and <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2022/09/diversity-in-the-high-brass?lang=en\">build stronger teams.</a> <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/opinions/2024/11/21/military-diversity-not-problem.html\">According to many national security experts</a>, there’s scant evidence to support Trump and Hegseth’s claims.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, if Trump wants to fire generals once he takes office, he can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The president has unilateral authority to fire general officers,” says Katherine Kuzminski, the director of the military, veterans, and society program at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security. Under the wide-ranging powers presidents are given by the Constitution as the country’s commander-in-chief, they can remove generals at will over a loss of confidence in their leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606\">Wall Street Journal report</a>, the incoming administration is already laying the groundwork for such firings. Per a draft executive order the publication obtained, the Trump White House is considering establishing a “warrior board” of former generals and military officials who will be dedicated to reviewing current military leaders. Following their review, the panel will reportedly determine which officers they’d like to remove, with the aim of retiring them at their existing rank within 20 days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has only spoken in sweeping terms about changes to military leadership, so it’s unclear exactly how many high-ranking troops might be fired. However, were the president-elect to follow through on his promises — particularly at a larger scale —&nbsp; they could have a disruptive effect on military operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A mass firing would need to be followed with the elevation of lots of new leaders, some of whom might lack the experience of their predecessors. Several national security experts also told Vox they worry about the message a mass firing would send — including the idea that military officials have to express political views in line with Trump’s in order to hold onto their jobs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Trump has avenues to “fire” generals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two ways Trump could get rid of top generals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first is to issue an explicit call to resign. The second is the removal of a military leader’s assignment. For example, three- and four-star generals, the highest levels an officer can achieve, attain that rank because they’re given an assignment — like being named chief of staff of a military branch — and have responsibilities related to it. If that assignment was revoked, they’d revert to two-star rank. Typically, leaders who lose assignments retire, military experts note.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s because individuals maintain their title and benefits upon retirement. Those who retire at a higher rank stand to receive thousands more in retirement pay than those who revert to a lower rank. So, a three-star general about to lose their assignment would likely retire in order to hold onto better retirement benefits than a two-star one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you have the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or another senior military leader holding a particular position of command or responsibility, the president can relieve them pretty much on a very vague notion that he&#8217;s lost confidence in their ability to lead,” Victor Hansen, a New England Law school professor and former judge advocate general in the Army, tells Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s little recourse for generals to appeal a decision to remove them from their assignments, experts tell Vox. And since military officers serve at what’s often described as “<a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/october/know-what-officer-commission-means\">the pleasure of the president</a>,” there’s not much Congress can do to intervene beyond holding hearings to raise awareness about potential staffing changes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the less likely scenario that a general chooses not to retire from the military —&nbsp;and chooses to go back to a lower rank —&nbsp;the president could also try to kick them out of the armed services completely, if he wanted them fully out of the military. The process for doing so is more complicated, however.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-ushistory1/chapter/the-reconstruction-acts-and-johnsons-impeachment/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-ushistory1/chapter/the-reconstruction-acts-and-johnsons-impeachment/\">In the 186os</a>, Congress approved legislation that limits a president’s ability to entirely dismiss someone from the military. <a href=\"https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2016/09/15/can-presidents-fire-senior-military-officers-generally-yesbut-its-complicated/\">Under this policy,</a> the individual in question needs to either face a sentence from a court-martial to be removed, have a court-martial sentence commuted, or be dismissed during a time of war by the president. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the policy is relatively vague — including in what it defines as a “time of war” — the president still has significant leeway to terminate individuals, but any attempt to do so could face court challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Trump does remove senior military leaders, he also wouldn’t be able to replace them on his own. Nomination of new generals of three- and four-star status requires Senate confirmation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Any attempt to follow through on these promises would set a disturbing new precedent</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are past examples of presidents firing generals, though there isn’t a precedent of the type of wholesale purge Trump has alluded to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Previously, President Harry Truman <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/firing-macarthur\">fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur</a> due to disagreements they had over the handling of the Korean War. President Barack Obama also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/10395402\">fired Gen. Stanley McChrystal</a> after he made disparaging comments about Obama’s approach to the war in Afghanistan and criticized other members of the White House. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s plans would be unique because they aren’t founded upon a general’s specific approach to a military conflict and would be tied more to their perceived political ideology, given Republicans tend to have a far more <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/11/19/views-of-dei-have-become-slightly-more-negative-among-us-workers/\">negative view of diversity, equity, and inclusion</a> initiatives than Democrats. The scope of potential firings could also make his approach different.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some military experts warn that a mass firing could create the very problem Trump’s allies say they are trying to solve: that removing lots of leaders at once could hurt readiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It would be very disruptive,” Hansen told Vox. “There’s ongoing operational combatant commanders. They’re in the thick of it all over the world now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And other national security experts told Vox that forcing military leaders to ascribe to a certain views on diversity could be seen as a personal loyalty test for Trump, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/11/22/rip-dei-donald-trump-president/76116276007/\">given his stated positions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s the fear that these processes will be perverted by an administration that&#8217;s bent on revenge, retaliation, and on vetting officers based on loyalty tests to the president versus loyalty to the Constitution,” says Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School and a former active duty judge advocate in the Air Force. “That&#8217;s how we become an authoritarian state when you have the most powerful military in the world that&#8217;s swearing an oath… not to their Constitution and to the American people, but to a person.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

On the frontlines of this crisis are food banks. While the Global Food Banking Network provided <a href=\"https://www.foodbanking.org/blogs/food-banks-provided-vital-services-to-meet-high-demand/\">1.7 billion meals to over 40 million people</a> in 2023, more progress is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, what role should food and beverage companies play?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A lot of food banks need staples like long-life milk and fresh produce,” explains Rashna Shroff, Community Programs and Partnerships Manager at Nestlé Australia. “But often food bank organizations which rely on donations can struggle to meet demand and often look for institutional support,” she adds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To support food banks in their efforts to combat food insecurity, companies like Nestlé are taking action. In 2023, Nestlé donated over <a href=\"https://www.nestle.com/sustainability/people-communities/community-giving\">140 million food servings globally</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Along with donating stock, a company like Nestlé can do so much,” Shroff shares. “Our brands have intentionally fostered partnerships with food banks, our employees volunteer their time to pack food boxes or sort donations, and we also fund programs like nutrition education initiatives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s how that’s playing out globally. In Indonesia, children face high rates of stunting  <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110397/\">due to chronic malnutrition</a>. Nestlé Indonesia is collaborating with local partner Edufarmers on their ZeroStunting program to focus on <a href=\"https://www.edufarmers.org/zerostunting-the-familys-frontline-to-reduce-stunting-rates-a-synergy-between-edufarmers-and-nestle-indonesia-\">nutrition issues and bolster communities.</a> This includes product donations and educational programs to improve nutrition awareness. And it’s working, one program they collaborated on <a href=\"https://www.edufarmers.org/zerostunting-the-familys-frontline-to-reduce-stunting-rates-a-synergy-between-edufarmers-and-nestle-indonesia-\">lowered severe stunting rates by 28%</a> over the course of 100 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the United States, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%2013.5%20percent%20of,were%20affected%20by%20food%20insecurity\">one in eight people</a> struggle with hunger. Nestlé USA has partnered with <a href=\"https://www.nestleusa.com/communities\">Feeding America</a>, the nation’s largest hunger relief organization, and local food access groups like <a href=\"https://ridall.org/\">Rid-All</a>, an urban farm in Cleveland, Ohio, to strengthen urban farming initiatives and community food systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Down under, Nestlé Australia has partnered with<a href=\"https://www.nestle.com.au/en/sustainability/people-communities/foodbank\"> Foodbank Australia</a> to mitigate a common challenge faced by food relief organizations: inconsistent food donations. Food banks often receive a random assortment of items, making it difficult for families to prepare balanced, nutritious meals. To alleviate this, Nestlé Australia worked with several industry partners to develop the <a href=\"https://www.foodbank.org.au/collaborative-supply-program/maggi/?state=au\">Maggi Hearty One Pot Casserole</a>, a recipe base that is designed to create delicious and nutritious meals with the food found in relief packages. This is the first ever designed-for-Foodbank product, and since its creation in 2021 has helped to make more than <a href=\"https://www.foodbank.org.au/collaborative-supply-program/maggi/?state=au\">1.2 million meals a year</a>. “Our number one goal is to help feed more people,” says Rashna Shroff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By leveraging resources like staff, inventory, and supply chains, companies can empower food banks. Successful partnerships built on strong relationships, local needs assessments, and sustainable systems, can create a lasting impact on the billions of people that need food each year.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

While those fights are almost certainly going to garner a lot of coverage, it’s important to also pay attention to some of the less splashy policies also on the chopping block.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These might not be major programs. You might not have even heard of some of them. But America’s social safety net relies on a patchwork of many different, sometimes low-profile, subsidies that many of us take for granted. Some of these programs might only appear in spending bills as a small line item that few people notice, and that makes it just that much easier for lawmakers to slowly but surely dismantle our social safety net.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s one example: For millions of families, a spike in health care costs might be around the corner because crucial subsidies are set to expire at the end of next year. Some families will see their premiums rise by thousands of dollars; others might lose their insurance altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2021, President Joe Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that enhanced the premium tax credit — a piece of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that subsidized the cost of premiums for some lower- and middle-income families. The Biden-era enhancements, which <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/\">essentially expanded the number of people</a> who qualify for the tax credit, were originally set to expire at the end of 2022, but Congress <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/\">extended them through 2025</a> when it passed the Inflation Reduction Act. (For families at or slightly above the poverty line, the enhanced tax credit subsidizes the full premium. For people making more than 400 percent of the poverty line — people who were previously ineligible for this subsidy — it <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/how-much-more-would-people-pay-in-premiums-if-the-acas-enhanced-subsidies-expired/\">caps their premiums to 8.5 percent</a> of their income.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The enhanced premium tax credits contributed to a record number of insured people in the United States. In February 2021, before Congress expanded the premium tax credits, 11.2 million people were enrolled in health coverage through ACA marketplaces. By 2024, that number <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health\">shot up to 20.8 million people</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are many reasons for the dramatic increase in marketplace coverage — including the fact that <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/press-release/as-medicaid-unwinding-concludes-in-most-states-kff-finds-25-million-lost-medicaid-coverage-but-enrollment-is-10-million-higher-than-pre-pandemic-levels/\">millions of people were disenrolled</a> from Medicaid coverage after Covid emergency measures lapsed and had to turn to other forms of insurance, including the marketplace — but the enhanced premium tax credit played a critical role. Its expansion was the main reason so many more people were able to enroll in health care coverage from the ACA marketplace, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/another-year-of-record-aca-marketplace-signups-driven-in-part-by-medicaid-unwinding-and-enhanced-subsidies/\">according to the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Congress allows the enhanced premium tax credits to expire, millions of people will see a noticeable rise in out-of-pocket expenses. Many will likely lose their coverage, and that’s without considering how much more will be at stake if Medicaid gets slashed as well. For low-income families, particularly those who live just above the poverty line, that could be a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who’s at risk of seeing higher costs?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The enhanced tax credits didn’t overhaul the health care system, and you probably don’t remember hearing candidates talk about them much, if at all, during the election. But they proved to be a crucial, if small, improvement to the system already in place, and had immediate and tangible results when it came to getting more people insured. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The premium tax credit improvements really led to huge pocket savings for people — $700 [per year] on average,” said Gideon Lukens, a senior fellow and director of research and data analysis at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). “They were really the primary reason that marketplace enrollment increased … and the uninsured rate fell to an all-time low.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of now, around <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health\">93 percent of people</a> enrolled through the ACA marketplace receive a premium tax credit. But if these tax credit expansions aren’t extended or made permanent, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-06/60437-Arrington-Smith-Letter.pdf\">3.4 million people</a> could lose their insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Urban Institute similarly estimates that <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/four-million-people-will-lose-health-insurance-if-premium-tax-credit-enhancements-expire\">4 million people could lose their insurance</a> if Congress doesn’t act in time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health\">According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, Black and Latino people benefited most from the enhanced premium tax credit,&nbsp;so they will likely be disproportionately affected by cuts. Marketplace enrollment among Black people, for example, grew by 186 percent after the enhanced premium tax credit went into effect, and for Latino people, it grew by 158 percent. By contrast, marketplace enrollment for other racial groups grew by 63 percent during the same period.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More than 19 million people will likely see higher premiums without the enhanced tax credit. Many families could see costs go up significantly, especially if they have moderate incomes or have older members, who already have to pay higher premiums. A 60-year-old couple making $82,000 a year, for example, could see their monthly premiums triple, which means they would owe an additional $18,400 out of pocket, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health#_ftn14\">CBPP report</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The GOP will be responsible for deciding whether the enhanced premium tax credits should expire or be extended. Given the success of the tax credits — leading to a record-high enrollment rate — it would be a mistake to let the enhancements lapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the GOP might not necessarily be so eager to expand social programs — it tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Donald Trump’s first term — the benefits of the enhanced premium tax credit are extremely tangible, and if they’re gone, millions of Americans will quickly notice. That could give Democrats room to put pressure on Republicans to strike a deal that, ideally, would make these enhancements permanent. So while lawmakers should fight tooth and nail to minimize or avoid cuts to major programs like Medicare or Medicaid, they should also remember that these small adjustments are worth fighting for as well, including things like the enhanced premium tax credit or, say, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/18/gop-targets-medicaid-food-stamps/\">what people can buy with food stamps</a>, these provisions still lower the cost of living for millions of families.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Republicans regain control of Congress and the White House, it’s easy to lose hope that any meaningful antipoverty efforts will happen at the federal level. But while elections have consequences, they also aren’t permanent. That’s why, over the coming months, I’ll be focusing on what antipoverty policies states across the country are experimenting with — experiments that could one day be replicated at the federal level when it’s more politically feasible. Have you benefited from state or local programs that you think would be a good model for the rest of the country? If so, I’d love to hear from you.

Trillion. Dollars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s how much Elon Musk, co-chair of President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s new &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency,&#8221; or DOGE, has said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/4966789-elon-musk-skepticism-2-trillion-spending-cuts/\">he can cut</a> out of the annual federal budget. Musk and his partner <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020?mod=opinion_trendingnow_article_pos1\">Vivek Ramaswamy have suggested</a> that they can achieve this through &#8220;mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy,&#8221; by cracking down on spending &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; by Congress, and &#8220;large-scale audits&#8221; of federal contracts. Their target wouldn&#8217;t be entitlement programs &#8220;like Medicare and Medicaid,&#8221; they say, but &#8220;waste, fraud, and abuse that nearly all taxpayers wish to end.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you could actually cut this much, it would wipe out the <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60039\">US’s $1.9 trillion deficit</a> and put the country into surplus for the <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/answers/what-is-the-federal-governments-budget-deficit-or-surplus/country/united-states/\">first time since the 2001 fiscal year</a>. But let’s be clear: There is no way in hell Musk and Ramaswamy are going to be able to identify $2 trillion in annual spending to cut, and they certainly will not get anywhere near that number without congressional action.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To see why, consult this simple chart of projected federal spending in fiscal year 2025, which began on October 1:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The 2025 federal budget, by category\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AnUxn/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"581\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m using the current fiscal year, but you’ll see something similar in <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727\">any given year</a>. The biggest single program is Social Security (which I’ve grouped here with its companion program, Supplemental Security Income). Trump has promised he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_aElHAN5II\">will not cut 1 cent</a> from Social Security, so that’s roughly $1.6 trillion out of the $7 trillion budget off the table.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The next-largest is interest payments on federal debt, accumulated from prior deficits. Musk’s <a href=\"https://x.com/america/status/1857228761915412814\">America PAC has bafflingly listed this as a form of government waste</a>, but failing to pay interest on past debt would constitute a US default and likely lead to a national, and probably global, financial crisis and recession. While we can reduce future deficits and pay less interest in the future, we’re obligated to pay interest on debt we’ve already accumulated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So there’s nothing to save here either. Already we’ve ruled out over a third of total spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Next up is defense spending. Musk and Ramaswamy <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020?mod=opinion_trendingnow_article_pos1\">highlighted wasteful Pentagon spending</a> in their Wall Street Journal op-ed, so this money could face some cuts. But Trump massively <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/1474925/trump-mattis-hail-spending-bill-to-fund-strongest-military-ever/\">increased defense spending</a> in his first years in office, and his congressional allies, like incoming Senate Armed Services chair Roger Wicker (R-MS), have <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-senate-republican-defense-proposal-would-balloon-military-funding-by-roughly-6-trillion/\">proposed trillions in additional spending</a> to counter China. Trump’s attitude toward the defense budget, as with his attitude on so many things, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/quality-over-quantity-u-s-military-strategy-and-spending-in-the-trump-years/\">vacillated wildly</a> during his first term, so perhaps he will side with Musk and Ramaswamy and seek to lower defense spending. But that’s far from guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;If defense spending is off the table, we’ve ruled out more than half the budget.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what would they likely cut? They might look first to Medicare and Medicaid, which are responsible for over $1.5 trillion. Musk and Ramaswamy insisted that these are not their targets, but it’s hard to see how they’d avoid that. For one thing, there are places where Medicare in particular overspends where policymakers in both parties want to crack down; its practice of <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/five-things-to-know-about-medicare-site-neutral-payment-reforms/\">paying more for care in hospitals</a> than at smaller facilities is a prime example. For another, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/383186/trump-vance-medicaid-food-stamps-obamacare-poverty\">Trump proposed massive cuts to Medicaid last term</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/non-defense-discretionary-programs\">non-defense discretionary spending</a>, a grab-bag category that includes all spending authorized through annual appropriations bills rather than mandated by other legislation. The biggest category is transportation, which pays for things like air traffic control and national highways. Next up is veterans’ care and benefits. Support for science, public health/research, law enforcement, and education (including federal support for K–12 schools) each receive around or a little over $100 billion annually. This category has been cut to the bone since the 2010s as it is, and it’s hard to imagine Musk and Ramaswamy going up against veterans or cops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there’s other mandatory spending, not broken out in the above chart but including a wide array of safety net programs:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Mandatory spending outside Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/f7JA2/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"526\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Huge chunks of this feel politically and practically off-limits. Military retirement and veterans’ benefits (which fall under both the non-defense discretionary and mandatory parts of the budget) seem politically impossible to cut, and even civilian employee retirements would be difficult to cut back given that employees have paid into those accounts themselves for years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Children’s Health Insurance Program and foster care have long enjoyed bipartisan support. Trump and JD Vance have proposed <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/\">expanding the child tax credit</a>, making savings there unlikely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That leaves programs like food stamps, the Affordable Care Act health insurance credits, and unemployment insurance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let's suppose that Musk and Ramaswamy decide to really go for it. They're going to cut non-defense discretionary spending in half, maybe by shutting down all scientific and health research and K–12 school aid. They're slashing Medicare and Medicaid by a quarter, and they're eliminating food stamps, ACA credits, and unemployment insurance entirely. These, to be clear, are all cuts that would require congressional approval and that Musk, Ramaswamy, and Trump could not achieve through executive action alone. Furthermore, they're cuts that seem politically impossible to push through. For the sake of argument, let’s suppose this is the package.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Doing the math, even this unbelievably ambitious package would amount to a little over $1.1 trillion annually. It’s barely halfway to Musk’s stated goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The notion that the federal government is hopelessly bloated due to waste that every reasonable person wants to eliminate is an appealing myth, but it’s a myth. Government spending overwhelmingly goes to wildly popular programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans’ benefits, and the defense budget. You can’t make much of a dent in it without touching those areas, and once you touch them, you’re going to get immense backlash.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

You can mostly give thanks to convicted felon Sam Bankman-Fried for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23500014/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto\">having single-handedly made sure</a> far more people hear “effective altruism” and think “cryptocurrency scams” rather than “donating lots of money to good causes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is still a great deal of work being done in line with the effective altruism (EA) worldview and associated principles: combating <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/14/23868347/lead-poisoning-death-toll-world-bank-pure-earth\">lead poisoning</a>, work against factory farming that’s based on efficiently finding the best <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/365147/animal-welfare-factory-farming-effective-altruism-activism\">pressure points to improve animal welfare</a>, work on taking down the diseases that are still <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/369095/hepatitis-vaccine-deaths-symptoms-infections\">major killers in poor countries</a>, work on reforming US <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24131207/kidney-donation-compensation-tax-credit-end-kidney-deaths-act\">kidney policy</a>, work on making sure developing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23447596/artificial-intelligence-agi-openai-gpt3-existential-risk-human-extinction\">advanced AI</a> goes well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of people I talk to think this development — the downplaying of EA, if not EA causes — is all for the best. Did it ever really make sense to have all those things under one umbrella? Even if there is a benefit to all of these people learning from each other, collaborating closely, moving between roles, and sharing lots of ideas behind the scenes, does it make sense to advertise the umbrella rather than advertise the achievements?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(Disclosure: In August 2022, Bankman-Fried’s philanthropic family foundation, Building a Stronger Future, awarded Vox’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/7/21020439/support-future-perfect\">grant</a>&nbsp;for a 2023 reporting project. That project was canceled.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But a few things fall by the wayside if you stop talking about effective altruism in favor of just talking about the specific issues that the movement tended to zero in on. One of those things? The innovation called “earning to give.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earning to give is the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/\">controversial effective altruist idea</a> that one good way to make the world a better place is to take a job where you make a lot of money and donate much of that money to important, underfunded work. (To be clear, not any high-paying job would be okay, but industries like tech and finance are generally considered fine.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a sharp contrast with the more typical take that if you want to do good with your career, you should steer clear of the temptations of high-salary corporate jobs in favor of working directly at a nonprofit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Earning to give is an idea worth salvaging</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are obviously some problems with the naive formulation of earning to give, which would amount to “Just go work at the highest-paying job you can get and donate the money.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some jobs definitely do enough direct harm that, by working in them, you can’t possibly accomplish good just by donating your salary. From early on, effective altruists argued not about whether there’s a line — there obviously is — but where to draw it. Marketing addictive cigarettes? Probably not acceptable. Working on advanced AI systems? Well, depends on whether you think those will do social harm on net.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(And hopefully it goes without saying that founding a cryptocurrency startup for the avowed reason of&nbsp;earning a lot of money to donate to charity is at absolute best only a good idea if you are very careful not to let your attached hedge fund trade away your customers’ money. Just so we’re absolutely clear.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A problem here, of course, is that people making a lot of money generally find it easy to lie to themselves about the social harm their high-paying professions may be generating. And in many cases, the way to do good in the world is to do it directly, not pay for someone else to do it —&nbsp; especially if you’re a person with rare and in-demand skills. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the years, many of the people I know who have done earning to give ended up switching to directly working on important problems. That makes sense. If you’re a skilled tech or finance person, the kind who can earn a really high salary, there’s probably a lot of crucial work that would benefit from your skills, not just your checkbook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I have always found something valuable and important in the case for earning to give. It goes like this: There’s a lot of important work that needs funding, and an individual family’s donations —&nbsp;my wife and I give around $50,000 a year — can make a huge difference in getting some of that important work done. Billionaire foundations will never cover all of it, and it’s better for organizations to be funded by motivated individuals than by billionaire foundations anyway. It distorts their priorities less, it’s much less politically awkward, and committed individuals can take bets that foundations can’t or won’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I also like earning to give for its unabashed friendliness to capitalism, which is a rare quality on the do-gooder left. I believe that the last century has made the world <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23627382/progress-climate-change-poverty-global-health-doom-industrial-revolution-vaccines\">much, much better</a> for the vast majority of people, and while targeted scientific innovation is a huge part of the story, another huge part of the story is the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth\">astounding success of market economies</a>. Why did the world get better? Mostly through people doing valuable stuff, often for selfish and pecuniary reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Vox guide to giving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving — from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving\">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h1>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not every big-dollar job is ethical, and I’d strongly encourage thought about what specifically you do and whether it makes the world a better place. But I generally think participating in the economy is a basically good and admirable thing to do, even though many progressives think of it as a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/4/18185383/millennials-capitalism-burned-out-malcolm-harris\">morally negative one</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I want there to be a vision for fixing our world that proceeds from the premise that <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/abundance-scarcity\">abundance is good</a>, that wealth is good, that “growing the pie” is good, that <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/policymaking-all-about-trade-offs\">trade-offs are real</a>, and that we will have to create new things and generate new wealth in order to make those trade-offs more bearable. These convictions have always seemed to me like a firmer foundation for fixing the world than their ideological competitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capitalism is good, actually</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just as I like earning to give for these reasons, a lot of people have always disliked earning to give for <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/trouble-algorithmic-ethics-effective-altruism\">precisely the same reasons</a>. Earning to give says that you can do a lot of moral good through active participation in our capitalist system, through trying to make a lot of money and then purchasing the things you want (research, bednets, wealth redistribution, you name it) with the money you earned. It is a capitalist ideology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It makes a lot of sense to me that people who think of capitalism as a dirty word aren’t enthusiastic about the idea of harnessing it in the name of altruism — and that lack of enthusiasm is shared by many of my fellow travelers in the effort to make the world a better place. But if you think capitalism is a net good, like I do, I think you should be enthusiastic about the possibility of earning to give. You can see it as one among many ways to do good, but also a particular strategy that the world could use a lot more of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if, like my family, you’re wealthy and have high-income jobs, I’d strongly encourage you to consider making <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23976937/charity-giving-tuesday-givewell-ten-percent\">large annual donations</a>. I won’t claim it’s easy. It makes budgeting more difficult, and delays home renovations that we’d like to get done. But the money that a high-income American family can spare without giving up any essentials is <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">enough money to accomplish an enormous amount in the world</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We are the beneficiaries of the wealthiest society in human history. We live in material abundance our ancestors couldn’t have imagined. We can afford to set some of that aside and use it to get things done for the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Sign up here!</a></em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

You can mostly give thanks to convicted felon Sam Bankman-Fried for having single-handedly made sure far more people hear “effective altruism” and think “cryptocurrency scams” rather than “donating lots of money to good causes.”  But there is still a great deal of work [&#8230;]",

Despite sporadic attendance and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/celebrity-lookalike-contests-timothee-chalamet-paul-mescal.html\">skeptical media coverage</a>, the events keep happening, sometimes with repeat contests for various celebrities in different cities. Disappointed by the lack of Jack Schlossberg look-alikes in <a href=\"https://x.com/_AshleyHoffman/status/1858236265566482640\">New York</a>? Not to worry, the ultimate Schlossberg doppelgänger might get their chance to shine <a href=\"https://x.com/imyoursummergrl/status/1858977369064984694\">in Washington, DC, this weekend</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Why now, you might ask? What weird burble in the zeitgeist has somehow manifested in lines of identical Chalamets? Is it that we can’t get enough of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/355242/hollywood-it-boy-diversity-problem-barry-keoghan-jacob-elordi-jeremy-allen-white\">Hollywood “it” boys</a>? Is it that, as a society, we’re tiring of lives lived primarily online? Is it that we’re all thirsty for more fun, low-stake events that are free and open to the public?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I turned to a Zayn Malik look-alike contest attendee for answers. “I was probably just going to stay home, but I was like, no, some divine spirit is calling me to this look-alike contest,” Natalie Miller, a social producer from Bushwick, told me. Miller and a friend attended the contest last Sunday in Maria Hernandez Park.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The winner, 29-year-old Shiv Patel, seemed prepared for glory; he <a href=\"https://www.bkmag.com/2024/11/18/zayn-malik-look-alike-contest-brooklyn/\">told</a> Brooklyn Mag the win “adds to my lore.” Naturally, Miller got a photo. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/IMG_0589.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.366492146597,100,39.267015706806\" alt=\"Two smiling women pose with a cool guy who looks like Zayn Malik.\" title=\"Two smiling women pose with a cool guy who looks like Zayn Malik.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"It’s almost a real celebrity moment.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However tongue-in-cheek the events and the participants might be, the glee they’re producing is real. “Everyone was just having such a good time, and it was 30 minutes, but it was just the best part of everyone&#8217;s day,” Miller said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s been a minute since the public took to the streets for fun reasons. While flash mobs of the early 2010s quickly got deemed cringe, viral dance memes of the mid-‘10s often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/30/kiki-keke-challenge-drake-police-warn-dangerous-viral-dance\">resulted in injuries</a>, and the past few years of Pokémon Go may have <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/\">inadvertently aided our dystopian nightmare</a>, these look-alike contests seem, so far, to be wholly banal. (Well, notwithstanding that one guy who <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/arrested-timothee-chalamet-lookalike-matt-mannix-interview\">got arrested</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“[T]he timothee chalamet lookalike competition just shows that the people yearn for weird town events like we live in gilmore girls,” as <a href=\"https://x.com/sixofsongbirds/status/1850640510194794709\">one viral post</a> put it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, there’s plenty of precedent for precisely this type of quirky celebration. This moment harks back to an era well before the internet, when people were arguably considerably more bored and desperate for entertainment — or, as Jeremy O. Harris <a href=\"https://x.com/jeremyoharris/status/1858404086779093335\">put it</a>, “Great Depression era coded.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is all I see every time. <a href=\"https://t.co/CxxZScyjkT\">pic.twitter.com/CxxZScyjkT</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy O. Harris (@jeremyoharris) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1858406769933885623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, we might be seeking refuge from our current reality in wholesome, mindless community spectator events. Historian and folklorist <a href=\"https://www.malgeo.net/\">Matthew Algeo</a> noted to Vox that such crazes historically spring up amid times of intense technological and social change — changes that necessarily create public anxiety and a longing for community and simple entertainment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We think of the Great Depression as an economic event, but it was also a psychological event,” Algeo said. “We’re going through a psychological event right now. There’s a hunger for diversion.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Algeo is the author of <em>Pedestrianism</em>, about the massively popular walking contests of the 1870s and ’80s, in which crowds would fill huge stadiums, including Madison Square Garden, to watch other people walk around in circles for hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People are looking for new and interesting forms of entertainment,” Algeo said, “something that everybody can relate to.” As for what the spectators get out of it, Algeo admitted that, as interesting entertainment goes, walking competitions and look-alike contests are “a little like watching paint dry.” He suggested one reason people turn out for the events is that they “get a perverse joy in watching other people putting themselves out there in public.” While ironic glee could certainly be one factor, Miller suggests a purer motivation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It honestly felt like a One Direction meet and greet,” Miller, a longtime Directioner, told me. “I was so nervous going up to [Patel]. It&#8217;s just so fun to experience that joy again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One might assume that the primary appeal of these look-alike contests would be to the fandoms of those specific celebrities, but that isn’t the case; Miller said she was pleasantly surprised at the way most people in attendance at the Zayn contest seemed to be locals rather than fans. “It felt like a local community gathering and it was just so joyous,” Miller said of the crowd. Algeo told me the local community appeal is understandable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It reminds me of how famous walker Edward Payson Weston would go to these small towns and do these challenges where he would walk 100 miles in 24 hours in somebody’s barn,” Algeo said. “Everybody had to come out and see it because it was live entertainment, and that really brought communities together. This is kind of the same thing. It gives people a reason to get out of their houses and share an experience with other people, in real time and in real life.” He also compared the current craze to flagpole-sitting of the ’20s and ’30s, when the public would go gawk at other humans sitting, where else, <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/542170/top-world-remembering-lost-trend-flagpole-sitting\">atop flagpoles</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It sounds silly, but I think the fact that it’s silly might make it all the more appealing to people,” Algeo said. “Especially in this day and age, with everything so intense and polarized and fractured. It’s hard to summon a lot of negative emotions about a celebrity look-alike contest.” Thinking back to the Depression, it probably doesn’t hurt that in the current age of inflation, these events are free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also perhaps a little bit of stunt myth-making afoot. The flagpole-sitting craze began because a theater hired a Hollywood stuntman named Shipwreck Kelly to sit atop a flagpole to promote a new film. From there, the trend went viral. Likewise, the look-alike contests might have been born out of self-promotion as much as wholesome community fun. The organizer of the first look-alike contest, the Timothée Chalamet competition <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/timothee-chalamet-lookalike-contest\">famously attended by Timothée Chalamet himself</a>, is Anthony Po, a New York-based YouTuber with nearly 2 million followers tuning in to his stunt videos, which range from sneaking into cults to manufacturing paranormal sightings. He swiftly moved on from the look-alike contest uproar to planning his next big event: a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4pyg8-it0\">boxing match</a> between his alter-ego, Cheeseball Man, and a mysterious newcomer named Cornhead Killer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, it would seem that, so far, Cornhead Killer has nothing on Sunday in the park with Zayns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s objectively so funny to see a bunch of people standing in a straight line that all look really similar,” Miller assured me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Miller’s giddy joy in congregating with her fellow Directioners and fellow Bushwick community members would seem to support Algeo’s hypothesis that, in the end,&nbsp;“people just like to watch other people do things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“No matter what they’re doing, there’s probably any human activity you could get a crowd for.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Major changes are likely to come to the US-Canada border, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tom Homan, who Trump recently named his “border czar,” <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7381797\">has sought to sound the alarm</a> about immigrants entering the US without authorization via the Canadian border, and has outlined plans to make entering the US through its northern border more difficult. Canada is also bracing for a potential influx of immigrants if Trump moves forward with his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">plans for mass deportations</a> and to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-temporary-protected-status-trump-ce97e066f2515d722e2c4bd750589c62\">end temporary protections</a> for more than 1 million immigrants in the United States.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Canadian border isn’t often a focus of the US political debate over immigration, but policy discussions on both sides of the border suggest that may change in the next Trump administration. That could both strain normally friendly US-Canada relations and reshape domestic Canadian politics on immigration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Changes are already underway in Canada. After Trump’s election, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reestablished a special Cabinet committee on relations between the two countries that will reportedly have a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-deportations-freeland-faabd10473a10c7ab3a369234334741a\">major immigration focus</a>. Trudeau will now not only have to contend with Trump’s policies but also a Canadian public that has become increasingly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9z5rpgkyeo\">resistant to accepting asylum seekers and refugees</a> in the last four years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though it receives less attention than the US-Mexico border, the US-Canada border has become a flashpoint in the past. During his first administration, Trump sought to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a set of legal protections for citizens of certain countries experiencing upheaval. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578582891/haitians-flow-into-canada-from-the-u-s-amid-renewed-deportation-fears\">thousands of immigrants flocked</a> to the northern border in 2018 to seek refuge in Canada. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, a dirt road in upstate New York also became an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/canada-asylum-seekers-biden-talks-immigration\">informal gateway for some 40,000 immigrants</a> crossing over to Canada to seek asylum, most from Latin America but some coming from as far as Asia. The Canadian government eventually closed the crossing in 2023. Now, the border may again become a priority in US-Canada diplomacy. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Trump’s plans for the northern border</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump himself has not outlined his plans for the Canadian border, but Homan has been clear on his recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homan said in an interview with a local TV station in New York earlier this month that the northern border constitutes an “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx86mdTKiZg\">extreme national security vulnerability</a>,” citing increasing numbers of migrant encounters in recent years, including of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/illegal-crossings-northern-us-border-terror-suspects-arrested/\">hundreds of people on the US terror watchlist</a>. Border agents recorded almost <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters\">199,000 encounters</a> along the northern border in fiscal year 2024, which ended in October, compared to about 110,000 just two years before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Canada “can’t be a gateway to terrorists coming to the United States,” Homan said in the interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He added that he intends to tackle the pace of migration once at the White House by deploying more immigration enforcement agents to the northern border and encouraging Trump to negotiate with Trudeau to increase enforcement on the Canadian side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homan also suggested that a version of Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy could be implemented in Canada. It’s not clear exactly what that might look like or whether Trudeau’s government would acquiesce to such a policy, but the original version forced tens of thousands of migrants to await decisions on their US immigration cases in Mexico for months. President Joe Biden ended the policy on the Mexican border, but Trump has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/donald-trump-border-politics/index.html\">signaled he intends to revive it</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Canada is bracing for an influx of immigrants from the US</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Canadian authorities are reportedly preparing for a wave of immigrants arriving from the US under a second Trump presidency, just as they saw beginning in his first. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-deportations-freeland-faabd10473a10c7ab3a369234334741a\">recorded an increase</a> in irregular border crossings between 2016 and 2023 — from only a few hundred arrivals in a three-month period to over <a href=\"https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/statistics/Pages/Irregular-border-crosser-statistics.aspx\">14,000 at their peak</a> — resulting in part from Trump’s immigration policies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most direct example of that was Haitians who claimed asylum in Canada when Trump ended their TPS status, which had been in place since a devastating 2010 earthquake from which their home country never fully recovered. They arrived on foot and crossed the border between checkpoints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are reportedly concerns among some Canadian officials that Trump’s mass deportations policy and targeting of TPS and other programs shielding immigrants from deportation will drive people to the Canadian border. The New York Times reported earlier this month that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/canada/canada-immigration-trump-mass-deportation.html\">Canadian authorities are “drawing up plans</a> to add patrols, buy new vehicles and set up emergency reception facilities at the border between New York State and the province of Quebec.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These resources might help prevent tragedies like a 2022 case in which a family, aided by smugglers, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14lryd33y1o\">froze to death</a> on the Canadian side of the border while trying to enter the United States</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Canadian government also reportedly intends to enforce its so-called “Safe Third Country” agreement with the US, which states Canada has the right to deport asylum seekers who travel through the US before trying to claim asylum in Canada. Those migrants would then have to apply for asylum in the US.

These often tedious stretches of talk-show appearances, red carpets, and press junkets that have been part of the Hollywood grind for decades are suddenly getting as much attention on social media as the films themselves, with the stars&#8217; interactions being picked apart by fans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/9/6/23339631/dont-worry-darling-wilde-pugh-feud-explained\">social media frenzy surrounding the 2022 film <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em></a>, press tours have become sites of intense speculation often translating to full-blown scandals, from affair speculation from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23700956/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-dating-anyone-but-you-drama\"><em>Anyone but You</em></a> fans to the persistent rumors of everyone versus Justin Baldoni on the set of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud\"><em>It Ends With Us</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not surprising that this trend has struck the most anticipated (or unavoidable) movie of the year, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/386247/wicked-2024-movie-novel-ending-explained-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo\"><em>Wicked</em></a>. However, it’s manifested in a more uncomfortable way than rumors about Harry Styles’s spit. Its two stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, have become subjects of rampant online theories and scrutiny regarding their red carpet appearances, adding an icky element to an otherwise wholesome movie rollout.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this press tour nonsense speaks to the free-for-all nature of the internet, particularly in the TikTok age. In its worst cases, this insatiable desire for controversy can override ethical or productive conversations. Inevitably, these narratives become seen as absolute truths.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Wicked</em></strong><strong>’s press tour got the internet’s attention, for better or worse</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The promotion for <em>Wicked</em> dates all the way back to March when Erivo and Grande <a href=\"https://people.com/oscars-2024-wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-present-together-8604687\">presented at the Academy Awards</a> together wearing green and pink gowns representing their respective roles as Elphaba and Glinda. Since then, themed dressing, <a href=\"https://time.com/6293686/margot-robbie-barbie-inspired-press-tour-looks/\">a la Margot Robbie for <em>Barbie</em>,</a> has been a significant feature of the press tour. The two have also been keen on highlighting their close friendship, one of the overarching themes of the musical. They often hold hands on red carpets and in interviews, in addition to complimenting one another’s talents in interviews. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP_Veq-nXeo\">now-viral interview</a> with reporter Jake Hamilton, they were asked how they’ve been changed by one another, causing Grande to well up. Both actresses’ tendency to cry and be overly sentimental while discussing the film, about witches and talking goats, has become <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqnB6LzUV2s\">a bit of a joke</a> on social media before the conversation around them became a lot more serious. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@xrikgrande/video/7435046609907453217\" data-video-id=\"7435046609907453217\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@xrikgrande\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@xrikgrande?refer=embed\">@xrikgrande</a> <p>Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande x Jake&#8217;s Takes (Jake Hamilton) wicked wickedmovie wickedmovienews wickedmerch wickedmerchandise wickedmoviemerch glinda glindathegoodwitch elphaba emeraldcity popular cynthiaerivo arianagrande ariananews arianagrandenews rembeauty wickedpremiere</p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - XrikGrande - XrikGrande\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-XrikGrande-7435046659320515360?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; XrikGrande &#8211; XrikGrande</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even separate from the press tour, Grande’s appearance was already being put under a microscope on social media. In April 2023, the singer posted a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@arianagrande/video/7220884832472026414?refer=embed\">video on TikTok</a> urging fans to stop speculating about her body weight after Redditors and other social media users <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ariana-grande-reminds-us-to-stop-being-weird-about-celebrities-bodies/?utm_source=pocket_shared\">expressed concern about her thinness</a>. Grande told social media users to be “gentler and less comfortable” discussing people’s bodies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her response did little to quell those public chatter. In fact, the speculation around a potential eating disorder has torpedoed into a weeks-long discussion among both fans and detractors on social media in the months since <em>Wicked</em>’s press tour began. Social media users have claimed <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/11/21/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-wicked-bodies/76463422007/\">Erivo also looks markedly</a> thinner. Some have even accused the pair of costars of having <a href=\"https://x.com/teenykittyluvr/status/1857133914789457936\">competitive</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/waitstopwhat/status/1857209224511590531\">eating</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/tayrussellsbtch/status/1857824622021947667\">disorders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, others have expressed concern about the effects over Erivo and Grande being so hypervisible at their current state. Some even suggested the two are promoting <a href=\"https://x.com/HopeRehak/status/1858228447622930736\">eating disorders</a>, if not inadvertently triggering people who have them. Others have put the responsibility on their teams for not intervening. In an op-ed for the Standard, India Block writes that the <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-eviro-thin-b1193895.html\">conversation around their appearance</a> is more so “an indictment of Grande and Erivo’s management, the <em>Wicked</em> team, and the entertainment industry as a whole.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24001338/ozempic-bodies-barbie-botox-corporate-feminism\">Ozempic fad that’s taken over Hollywood</a> and the concerns it’s raised, it’s not exactly a shock that we got here. Still, it’s unclear how this very public conjecture will benefit anyone. Maybe Grande and Erivo’s well-being was never really the point of the conversation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How press tours became bigger than the movies</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Considering the point of press tours is to generate press attention, <em>Wicked</em>’s was a massive success, despite the controversies that dogged the film along the way. Compared to the laundry list of other movies from the past few years whose press tours eclipsed the impact of the film itself, <em>Wicked</em>’s mess was positively tame.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the discourse around the <em>Barbie</em> press tour, perhaps the most famous in recent history, seemed solely focused on star Margot Robbie’s hyper-coordinated fashion moments and director Greta Gerwig’s techniques to bring Barbieland to life, there was juicier drama behind the scenes of other films. When Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney were busy promoting <em>Anyone but You, </em>their palpable <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23700956/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-dating-anyone-but-you-drama\">chemistry didn’t go unnoticed</a>. Both had partners going into filming, but Powell left single, after his girlfriend unfollowed Sweeney on Instagram and posted a cryptic breakup message (a source claimed they never hooked up).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, of course, is what press tours are designed to do: Make audiences believe that the heat between its leads isn’t just an act, that it’s real — and if there are real-world repercussions, welp, that’s showbiz, baby. (Who could forget Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/11/lady-gaga-oprah-interview-a-star-is-born.html\">year-long lovefest</a> to promote <em>A Star Is Born</em>?). There are some cases where the on-set chemistry is, in fact, real — whenever Zendaya and Tom Holland get to promote a <em>Spider-Man</em> movie together, the internet collectively squeals — and some cases where it’s so real that people’s lives get blown apart (like when Kristen Stewart, then dating Robert Pattinson, had an affair with Rupert Sanders, the married director of <em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the most compelling version of press tour drama is when the cast seems to absolutely hate each other. That’s what thirsty fans were treated to in advance of this fall’s <em>It Ends With Us, </em>in which star Blake Lively clashed with director and co-star Justin Baldoni. Though details were murky and mostly seemed to center on a difference in creative vision between the two (not exactly the stuff of soap operas), it snowballed into fodder for all kinds of other discussions on the controversial themes of the film, which dealt with domestic violence, Baldoni’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud\">previous life as a self-identified “male feminist”</a> voice online, and Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds, who people tend to have strong opinions about.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1485000691.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.725396464072,100,78.549207071857\" alt=\"Actors Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney during opening night of the Sony Pictures Entertainment Presentation at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace during CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 24, 2023.\" title=\"Actors Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney during opening night of the Sony Pictures Entertainment Presentation at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace during CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 24, 2023.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney at  CinemaCon in Las Vegas n April 24, 2023. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images for CinemaCon\" data-portal-copyright=\"Kevin Winter/Getty Images for CinemaCon\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/9/6/23339631/dont-worry-darling-wilde-pugh-feud-explained\">2022’s <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> had both love and hate</a> — buzz about an affair between director and star Olivia Wilde and her lead actor, pop megastar Harry Styles, and rumors of tension between everyone from Wilde and actress Florence Pugh, Pugh and one-time co-star Shia LaBeouf, and, potentially, Styles and co-star Chris Pine, with whom he was alleged to have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UryoAepZqOM\">spit on at the premiere</a>. (The spitting was roundly denied.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of these films have been major box office successes, begging the question of how much the off-screen drama convinced people to buy tickets. This isn’t always the case; when Joaquin Phoenix caused controversy for his behavior on the 2008 press tour for <em>Two Lovers,</em> which he later described as &#8220;performance art,” it didn’t translate to tons of sales.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps that’s because audiences’ relationship to press tours is extremely different than it was 16 years ago. Thanks to social media, people now have unprecedented access into the lives of celebrities and industry insiders to the point where they’re absorbing the jargon of the business and speculating on the career trajectories of their favorites. Normal fans now regularly <a href=\"https://x.com/guyfierisuprfan/status/1848372521604673770\">discuss whether a certain star</a> is sufficiently “media trained,” congratulating those who are able to sidestep uncomfortable questions and seem unflappable. You’d think it’s counterintuitive — don’t people <em>want</em> their celebrities to be unfiltered and entertaining rather than “brand-safe”? Instead, they cheer on the <a href=\"https://x.com/guyfierisuprfan/status/1848372521604673770\">performance of celebrity</a> rather than the celebrity herself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, press tours aren’t for the press anymore. They’re for the general public, which has, in turn, become the press — or at least the press that matters. What would once involve a trip to a couple late night talk shows and a glossy magazine cover now mandates appearances on a laundry list of shows, many of them online-only, whether that means shoving down chicken wings on <em>Hot Ones</em>, flirting with Amelia Dimoldenberg on <em>Chicken Shop Date</em>, taking a Vanity Fair lie detector test, or gabbing about your must-have products with GQ. Footage from these shows and red carpet interviews are then clipped and optimized to go viral on social media and become inescapable whether you’re interested in seeing the film or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because so much of press tours now take place online, it’s even easier to feel like what you’re seeing is an authentic portrayal of actors’ lives. It seems less manufactured (though of course the celebrities are there to work). It’s easy to believe that Grande and Erivo really do share Glinda and Elphaba’s complex best friendship — or even, perhaps, that you’re their friend, too. A dramatic or intense off-camera dynamic among a cast now might be exactly what convinces audiences to shell out for movie tickets, because it feels like the stakes are immediate. Wait too long to see it, and you might have missed out on your chance to join in the discourse while it’s still fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the case of <em>Wicked,</em> it’ll be interesting to see how Part One compares to next year’s promotional tour. How many more times can we see Erivo and Grande in theatrical green and pink gowns crying over how much they love each other? How much more — and please excuse the <em>Wicked</em> pun — popular could it even get?&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And the Biden administration’s attempts to rein in junk fees are a way for it to make the case that Democrats are addressing Americans’ concerns about high prices before the election. Limiting fees is popular on a bipartisan basis: a December <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2023/12/12/voters-support-initiatives-to-lower-drug-costs-ban-junk-fees-and-strengthen-supply-chains\">Data for Progress poll</a> found that 77 percent of voters&nbsp;— including 81 percent of Democrats, 78 percent of independents, and 72 percent of Republicans —&nbsp;said they supported legislation banning junk fees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Essentially in all of these practices, the companies are delaying services to you or, really, trying to make it so difficult for you to cancel the service that they get to hold on to your money longer and longer,” Tanden said. “And what that means is, ultimately, consumers, the American public, is losing out.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How the policy would work</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration’s proposals would prohibit companies from billing customers without their consent, failing to disclose cancellation policies, and making cancellation difficult by, for example, requiring customers to cancel in person or endure long holds on the phone with customer service. Companies that fail to comply with the rule could <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2023-0033-0001\">face civil penalties</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/01/if-your-company-received-ftc-notice-penalty-offenses-take-notice-action\">like those</a> the FTC has sought in recent cases <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/proposed-ftc-order-will-prohibit-telehealth-firm-cerebral-using-or-disclosing-sensitive-data\">related to advertising</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The FTC is currently reviewing public comments on its <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring\">proposed rule</a>, which would require companies to allow customers who sign up online for a service to also cancel that service online in no more steps than it took them to sign up. Companies would be allowed to make additional offers when a customer tries to cancel, but only if they first ask if a customer is open to hearing them. Companies would also have to provide reminders before subscriptions are automatically renewed if they are not for any physical good.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That rule could go into effect in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the FCC opened an inquiry Monday into pursuing a similar rule that would apply to the communications industry. If the FCC decides to do so, that rule might not go into effect before Biden’s term ends, though if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election, she would likely advance it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Biden’s subscription cancellation policy is part of a broader pro-consumer agenda</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to his latest move on subscriptions, Biden has pursued a still-pending <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees\">broad regulation</a> to combat junk fees overall, as well as regulations aimed at industry-specific junk fees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably,&nbsp;the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a rule to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2024/1/17/24042169/biden-overdraft-fee-banks-nsf-amount\">curb overdraft fees</a> incurred when consumers withdraw more than the available funds in their bank account — a move that might save customers about $3.5 billion a year overall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration’s efforts have hit some barriers, however. Airlines recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/major-airlines-sue-biden-administration-over-fee-disclosure-rule-2024-05-13/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20May%2013%20(Reuters),carriers%20and%20the%20Biden%20administration\">sued</a> the Biden administration over a new final rule that requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose upfront any fees associated with booking a plane ticket. And a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/credit-card-fee-limit-blocked.html\">temporarily blocked</a> a Biden administration rule that would limit fees on late credit card payments to $8 per month, which the CFPB said would cut costs for Americans by $10 billion a year. Bank and credit card company lobbyists, supported by <a href=\"https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/credit-debit-card-transaction-fees-congress-cfpb-payments-biden-chopra/709691/\">some Republican members of Congress,</a> had argued that the rule was unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though those lawsuits are meant to limit the administration, Biden has also used the courts in an aggressive antitrust pro-consumer strategy. His administration has filed a flurry of sweeping lawsuits against major companies, including four Big Tech companies, on the grounds that they are harming competition in their industries and, therefore, American consumers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration recently won a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/big-tech/365575/google-monopoly-search-case-biden-big-tech\">major ruling against Google</a> in which the judge found that the company’s search business constituted an illegal monopoly. Other antitrust lawsuits are pending against Google over its ads business, Meta over its acquisitions of Instagram and Whatsapp, Apple over its alleged anticompetitive practices in the smartphone market, and Amazon over its restrictions on third-party sellers that have served to keep prices higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration has also filed a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/4/16/24132509/ticketmaster-live-nation-lawsuit-swift-bad-bunny-beyonce-rodrigo\">seeking to break up Live Nation</a>, Ticketmaster’s parent company, accusing it of operating an illegal monopoly through anticompetitive behavior that has harmed everyone from consumers to concert venues to artists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The durability of Biden’s consumer protection initiative may depend in part on the November election. A Harris administration would likely uphold these policies and could continue to pursue these antitrust lawsuits and then some.

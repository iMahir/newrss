Vance’s undeniable weirdness</a>. But another meeting of politics and the internet has flown a little more under the radar, in the form of a Senate race that includes, for the first time, a professional influencer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The seat opened up after Mitt Romney <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/us/politics/mitt-romney-retirement.html#:~:text=Senator%20Mitt%20Romney%2C%20Republican%20of,be%20in%20my%20mid%2D80s.\">announced</a> last year that he wouldn’t be seeking reelection in 2024. Though <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/06/john-curtis-pro-climate-republican-00165810\">Republican John Curtis</a>, currently a US Representative for Utah’s third district, is virtually guaranteed to win in November (<a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/forecast/2024/senate/utah/\">The Hill predicts</a> a more than 99 percent chance of a Curtis victory, and Utah hasn’t had a Democratic Senator since 1977), his Democratic opponent Caroline Gleich has made headlines for her career outside of politics: namely, that of a professional ski mountaineer and content creator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gleich, 38, is known to her more than 220,000 Instagram followers for both her climate activism and her mountain-climbing adventures, which have taken her through ski slopes in Argentina to the summit of Mount Everest. Her campaign for Senate began after taking a training course by <a href=\"https://utahwomenrun.org/\">a state-level organization</a> devoted to helping more Utah women run for office. From there, she met someone at a campaign management firm who reached out earlier this year to ask if she’d be willing to run for Romney’s seat. “Initially, when I got the email, I was a bit hesitant,” she told me in an interview. “But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the time is now, that we can&#8217;t wait for other people to step up and be the leaders that we want to see.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Sometimes even if they’re going to lose, having a candidate to demonstrate to the opposition party that they also have to listen to their preferences [is important],” explains Juliet Carlisle, a political science scholar at the University of Utah. “The influence of a young Democratic candidate can make [Curtis] aware of what the vibe in Utah politics is among the younger generation.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Did you know that, currently, the average Utahn loses two years of life expectancy from air pollution?<br><br>Marginalized groups that live closer to pollution (who are disproportionately Black, brown and Indigenous) can expect to die over five years earlier due to our poor air… <a href=\"https://t.co/ojCzAQbwb7\">pic.twitter.com/ojCzAQbwb7</a></p>&mdash; Caroline Gleich (@carolinegleich) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinegleich/status/1808167899515048105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Influencers have long played a role in politics, though typically they’re asked by established politicians to stump for them or push certain policies online to their followers. <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2024/07/29/jake-paul-squares-up-donald-trump-support-former-president/\">Trump, for instance, has lately</a> been making videos with YouTuber Jake Paul, while <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/30/democratic-senators-influencers-laws-initiatives/\">senators are tapping</a> influencers to help push legislation in addition to relying on traditional media. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The White House enlisted <a href=\"https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/health/2021/08/02/white-house-enlists-army-of-social-media-influencers-to-promote-covid-19-vaccines\">influencers to promote Covid-19 vaccine information</a>, but President Biden struggled to court content creators to support his now-aborted reelection campaign: Some who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/06/13/influencers-biden-tiktok-ban/\">supported him in 2020</a> refused to do so for the 2024 cycle, while other creators have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/biden-campaign-tiktok-creators-online-backlash/\">faced backlash</a> for stumping for an administration their fans have criticized. This, in contrast with Kamala Harris, who has garnered enormous organic support online from influencers and celebrities, speaking to a divide in what kinds of candidates are able to authentically tap into the chaotic energy of the internet. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It can often feel as though politicians are straining to be influencers themselves, referencing memes and online language in a way that can feel embarrassingly forced</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also not unusual for politicians to build large followings after ascending into office. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/opinion/aoc-instagram-live-capitol-attack-1234898292/\">continues to use Instagram Live</a> and other social channels to speak directly to her constituents and followers, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22867140/marjorie-taylor-greene-facebook-twitter-suspension-big-tech-content-moderation\">has leveraged her large online base</a> to promote QAnon conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation. It can often feel as though politicians are straining to be influencers themselves, referencing memes and online language in a way that can feel embarrassingly forced (see Vance’s <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/jd-vance-twitter-conservatives/\">try-hard tweets</a> or Hillary Clinton’s ill-fated attempt to get in on the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/hillary-clinton-has-entered-the-barbie-snub-discourse\"><em>Barbie</em> Oscars snub discourse</a>).  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet only recently have professional content creators, or those who make their money on social media via sponsorships with brands or contributions from followers, run for office. Gleich appears to be the first full-time influencer to do so, though there have been others with popular social accounts: Conservative influencer Rep. Anna Paulina Luna was elected to Florida’s 13th district in 2022, while last year, 25-year-old lawyer and TikToker <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2023/04/04/local-tiktok-influencer-wants-to-take-her-message-off-social-media-and-to-congress/\">Cheyenne Hunt ran</a> for California’s 45th district, though she ultimately lost. Both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca-odw3nriQ\">Paul</a> and fellow <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24105035/mr-beast-youtube-amazon-show\">YouTuber Mr. Beast</a> have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-run-for-president-soon-as-old-enough-2024-7#:~:text=YouTube%20star%20MrBeast%20jokes%20about,with%20the%20current%20political%20leaders.\">expressed their desires</a> (whether earnestly or not) to run for president. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m able to connect with people to help solve problems: That’s a big part of what I do as a content creator every day to bring value to people’s lives, and that’s similar to what I hope to achieve in the US Senate,” says Gleich. “When I approach brands and do sales pitches, I want to center their needs first. And this is really about centering the voices of Utahns.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carlisle references the 1990 political science text <em>Actors, Athletes, and Astronauts: Political Amateurs in the United States Congress </em>as a way of explaining how name recognition can assist the already famous in pivoting to political office. Arnold Schwarzenegger was able to translate his Hollywood stardom into the governorship of California, after all, although in the crowded field of Instagram influencers, that leap is much more difficult. “Name recognition doesn’t necessarily translate into local name recognition,” she explains, warning that just because an influencer has a global following doesn’t guarantee them votes in the areas where they’re running.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Reddit, where talk of influencers often tends toward the snarky, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1cf8xff/thoughts_on_caroline_gleich/\">some have accused</a> Gleich of using the election to boost her career on social media. “The cynical part of me thinks this is just one big branding move — one that will just earn her more money and sponsorships once she inevitably loses in the election,” wrote one person. Others have defended her candidacy: “We need more young liberals with different backgrounds running for office in Utah, and she seems to be the only one willing to take on the huge financial and public image burden of doing so,” wrote another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Campaign finance is a uniquely thorny issue for influencers. The Federal Election Commission currently deems any sponsored brand post that includes a candidate and runs within 90 days of an election to be subject to its rules on “coordinated communication.” It would therefore be considered an “in-kind contribution” and required to be listed in a candidate’s campaign finance reports. “These companies that are sponsoring [an influencer] then step into a thicket of campaign finance laws,” says Carlisle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“I absolutely do think that America would be better served if we had more content creators in office”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gleich is pushing back on these rules, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/10/caroline-gleich-utah-influencer-fec/\">recently filing a request</a> to sidestep the requirements. She says that profits from her content creation career are down 90 percent this year due to the campaign, which has been “devastating” financially. “When I send [brands] the rules, it’s a dealbreaker. It’s very complicated on the back end for advertisers,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though she’s been able to stay afloat after “two really good years of work,” she stresses that it’s extraordinarily <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C8K-m6VugzD/?hl=en\">difficult to run for office</a> “if you’re not retired or independently wealthy.” “Some of the outdated campaign laws have made it really challenging to navigate. And I think this is a big part of the reason why we don&#8217;t see more 38-year-olds running for office.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gleich hopes that the changes she’s pushing for will encourage more content creators and young people to get involved in politics. “I absolutely do think that America would be better served if we had more content creators in office,” she says. “I think that we will see in the next decade a lot more people from different backgrounds doing this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One way influencers can encourage political activism at a smaller scale is to make it seem cool to young people. When she first started posting about politics, she says, “We really wanted to make voter registration and the public hearings we were doing look really fun and cool so that people would want to get involved.” While existing politicians are leveraging the energy online to do the campaigning for them, it’ll be interesting to see whether that translates when digital natives are seeking out elected roles in politics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, as a professional content creator, Gleich is already used to the kinds of harassment levied against politicians: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C8pguHEPF0l/?hl=en\">sexist attacks</a>, trolls, comments on their <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CT2bFblr-d6/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">self-presentation</a>. In a country that demands a carefully curated authenticity from its influencers and politicians, perhaps there’s value in being both. Only time will tell whether more follow suit.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

On Monday, Israel’s military police raided the base and detained <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-court-extends-arrest-of-8-soldiers-accused-of-abusing-palestinian-detainee/\">10 soldiers</a> believed to be responsible for the torture of one detainee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shortly after the raid, far-right demonstrators — including some reserve soldiers and sitting parliamentarians from Israel’s current government — began rioting against the arrest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rioters tore down Sde Teiman’s exterior fence and entered its premises, hoping to free the detained soldiers by force. Footage showed <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/religious-zionism-mk-tzvi-sukkot-defends-breaking-into-idf-base-i-was-doing-my-job/\">Zvi Sukkot</a>, a far-right member of the Knesset (Israel’s Parliament), amid the mob assailing the base. When they failed to find the soldiers, a mob attacked another military base — one that houses <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/30/israel-far-right-protesters-storm-military-bases\">the headquarters of Israel’s military court system</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eventually, Israeli authorities restored order without surrendering any soldiers to the mob (two were later released without charges). Yet multiple right-wing parties in the current ruling coalition issued statements condemning the soldiers’ arrest and <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/religious-zionism-mk-tzvi-sukkot-defends-breaking-into-idf-base-i-was-doing-my-job/\">even defending participation in the mob</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even now, as a wider <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/364148/haniyeh-iran-israel-hamas-hezbollah\">war with Hezbollah and Iran looms</a>, Israel remains deeply divided over an incident that feels a lot like the US torture abuse scandal in <a href=\"https://x.com/joshuakeating/status/1818004736483754242\">Abu Ghraib and the January 6 riot rolled into one</a>. Ahmad Tibi, a member of the Knesset (MK) from an Arab political party, asked during a parliamentary debate over the abuses at Sde Teiman if “inserting an explosive into the rectum of a person [is] legitimate.” In response, Hanoch Milvetsky — a member from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party — said that when it came to Hamas commandos, “<a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-812376\">everything is legitimate</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a situation that reflects Israel’s basic bifurcation: a country that is simultaneously a democracy within its recognized borders and a lawless authoritarian state in the Palestinian territory it controls. It is an unbearable tension, one that has increasingly led the domestic democracy Israel is so proud of to begin resembling its authoritarian shadow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The riot at Sde Teiman shows exactly how this process works — and why it has led even some sober Israeli analysts to begin <a href=\"https://x.com/AnshelPfeffer/status/1817970668673089693\">fretting about civil war</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the chaos at Sde Teiman happened</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What happened at Sde Teiman this week is the consequence of two opposing legal systems crashing into each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Israel <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/history/\">seized</a> the West Bank and Gaza Strip at the end of the Six-Day War in 1967, it faced a classic conqueror’s dilemma: How do you administer land where the majority of people who live there oppose your presence?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel’s solution was to forgo formally annexing the territories and instead set up a military regime that would “temporarily” govern until a more permanent solution could be found. A special department of the Israeli military called the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, was charged with managing the governing tasks necessary for Palestinian civilian life to function. The Israeli general in charge of COGAT was in essence the governor of the West Bank: the head of a military regime whose <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/2023/12/13/24000233/why-israel-has-so-many-palestinian-prisoners\">legal system differed</a> fundamentally from the one at work inside Israel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Inside Israel proper, political leaders are determined by elections and citizens of all religions have basic rights, like freedom of speech and rights to due process. In Israeli-occupied Palestine, the leader is an unelected general who affords few basic rights to Palestinian civilians. Things that would be scandals if done to citizens in Israel, like torture of suspects in custody, <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/torture\">are fairly common in the West Bank</a> and have been so before the current war.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t apply to the settlers, Israeli Jews who live in the West Bank. They are legally entitled to all the privileges attendant with Israeli citizenship, yet their interactions with Palestinians typically take place in land controlled by the military. While soldiers are empowered to arrest settlers who commit violence, the IDF <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/cant-or-wont-idf-fails-to-prevent-settler-attacks-and-thats-unlikely-to-change/\">prefers to delegate</a> such tasks to the police.<strong> </strong>The result is that soldiers frequently turn a blind eye when extremist settlers <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/9/23945651/west-bank-israeli-settler-palestine-gaza-war-violence\">bully, assault, and even kill Palestinians</a>. Sometimes, they <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/9/23945651/west-bank-israeli-settler-palestine-gaza-war-violence\">even join in</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sde Teiman is not in the Palestinian territories; it’s in Israel proper, meaning domestic Israeli rules should apply. But it is a military base used to house Palestinians detained in Gaza, who seemed as though they’re being treated by West Bank standards — or potentially even worse. A UN <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/reports/detention-context-escalation-hostilities-gaza\">investigation</a> found that thousands of Palestinians have been detained since October 7 and kept in awful conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Detainees said they were held in cage-like facilities, stripped naked for prolonged periods, wearing only diapers. Their testimonies told of prolonged blindfolding, deprivation of food, sleep and water, and being subjected to electric shocks and being burnt with cigarettes,” the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/07/un-report-palestinian-detainees-held-arbitrarily-and-secretly-subjected\">UN investigators write</a>. “Some detainees said dogs were released on them, and others said they were subjected to waterboarding, or that their hands were tied and they were suspended from the ceiling. Some women and men also spoke of sexual and gender-based violence.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In effect, the lawlessness of the West Bank and the Gaza war had moved into Israel. When reports of the abuse came to light, both in the American and Israeli press, the Israeli government decided that it needed to start applying Israeli domestic law on Israeli territory. Hence the raid that detained Israeli soldiers suspected of inflicting severe torture, including rape, of a Palestinian detainee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This dynamic also explains the subsequent riot. The Israelis who attacked the base are hardline supporters of the Israeli settlement movement; Zvi Sukkot, the MK who broke into the base, is himself a settler who has been <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-02-07/ty-article-magazine/.premium/israels-newest-legislator-west-bank-outpost-founder-and-former-shin-bet-target/00000186-2ba4-df2e-a59f-ebffeb4f0000\">repeatedly arrested in connection with violence against West Bank Palestinians</a>. They believe that Gazan detainees should be treated according to Occupation standards, not Israeli ones. If the law was going to accord them rights, then the law, not the abuse, was the problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This also may explain why the violence managed to spread to another base and continue for roughly 12 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Israeli police are controlled by the Ministry of National Security, which is currently led by Itamar Ben-Gvir — a far-right settler who has been <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/itamar-ben-gvir-minister-visited-contested-jerusalem-holy-112057253\">convicted of crimes eight separate times</a>. There are widespread suspicions that Ben-Gvir, who has been <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/probe-of-soldiers-over-alleged-sexual-abuse-fuels-tension-between-israeli-military-and-hard-liners\">out front supporting</a> the soldiers who allegedly tortured the Gazan detainee, intentionally obstructed the police response to the riots (not unlike Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/17/trump-jan-6-capitol-riot-national-guard-00152757\">reluctance</a> to call in the National Guard on January 6). It’s serious enough that Yoav Gallant, the current minister of defense, has called for <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-30/ty-article/.premium/gallant-to-netanyahu-probe-ben-gvirs-role-in-delayed-response-to-riots-at-idf-bases/00000191-0386-df85-a399-eb96270e0000\">an inquiry into Ben-Gvir’s conduct</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What happened at Sde Teiman, in short, is what happens when Israel’s two legal systems are forced into conflict. When people like Sukkot and Ben-Gvir ascend to positions of power in the Israeli government, they expect the Israeli legal political system to change accordingly — to begin adopting the norms and procedures of the West Bank occupation. When it doesn’t, they try to make the system accommodate their lawlessness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, they do so through legal channels. But at Sde Teiman, they crossed the line into violence, helping lead a kind of minor insurrection against the Israeli state.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A <a href=\"https://bam.sites.uiowa.edu/RTL/bayit\">bayit</a> divided cannot stand</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94\">my new book <em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>, I argue that Israel today resembles Abraham Lincoln’s description of the United States before the Civil War: “A house divided cannot stand.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By this, Lincoln didn’t just mean that the United States was divided over slavery. He meant that slavery created two sets of laws, one for slave states and one for free ones, that would inevitably contradict each other. This tension, embodied by things like the Fugitive Slave Act, created a situation where one side would ultimately need to triumph over the other — bringing the citizens of the North and South into direct conflict over what the laws for the country should be. Which is precisely what happened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sde Teiman shows how Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians creates similar tensions. They were <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23864407/israel-judicial-overhaul-supreme-court-hearing-netanyahu\">at the root of the fight over the judiciary</a> that mobilized the largest protests in the country’s history prior to October 7, and they’ve only become more acute since the Gaza war began.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rather than unifying Israel, the conflict has only shown where its fault lines lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After the riot, Yair Lapid — a centrist politician and current leader of the opposition —&nbsp;argued that it revealed an “existential” threat to Israel from within.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The incursion into Sde Teiman is a despicable and dangerous crime by lawmakers who weaken and dismantle the IDF, weaken and dismantle the State of Israel, gnawing away at the foundations of our power,” <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkfcjmsfc\">he said</a>. “The politicians who abandoned the hostages, abandoned security and destroyed Israeli society are now destroying the chain of command. The country is in existential danger if these people do not leave power and get out of our lives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while politicians like Lapid are willing to condemn the excesses of people like Ben-Gvir, they are less willing to forthrightly pinpoint the root of the problem: Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestinian land.

A fundraiser for <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-win-with-black-men-fundraising-rcna163280\">Win With Black Men</a> was equally intuitive. But fundraisers just for white people?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I believe the scientific term is actually a goop of women,” <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YNu_Q11QFWY?t=214\">cracked Jon Stewart on <em>The Daily Show</em></a> after learning that 100,000 people had attended a fundraiser titled White Women: Answer the Call. “‘White Dudes for Kamala’ Was Even Cornier Than It Sounds” <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/white-dudes-for-kamala-harris-who-was-there.html?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=s1&amp;utm_campaign=thecut\">concluded the Cut</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fundraisers were massively successful. <a href=\"https://x.com/shannonrwatts/status/1817212510132683078\">White Women: Answer the Call</a>, which featured <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2024/07/white-women-harris-broke-zoom/\">celebrities like Connie Britton, P!nk, and Megan Rapinoe</a> among its more than 160,000 attendees, raised $11 million for the Harris campaign last week and sent 30,000 volunteers to Women for Harris. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/white-dudes-rally-elect-first-female-president-rcna164208\">White Dudes for Kamala</a>, which saw appearances from Jeff Bridges, Mark Hamill, and Pete Buttigieg, raised $4 million after the call on Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The idea was: How do we use our platform and our privilege to do the same thing Black women and men had done on their calls?” <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/white-women-kamala-harris-zoom-call.html\">Shannon Watts, the organizer of the call</a> and a prominent gun violence prevention activist, explained in an interview with The Cut. She added, “It was more like a reckoning than a rally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, some onlookers felt conflicted, even contemptuous. Many progressives agree that it’s valuable to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9023721/white-whiteness-race-identity\">treat whiteness as a distinct identity group</a> rather than the default. At the same time, something about a call just for white people could feel disorienting. Why not set up a fundraiser for Harris supporters of all identities?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to thinking about how white feminism intersects with the work of electing a woman of color to office, no one is better positioned to tease out the nuances than legal scholar and activist Kimberlé Crenshaw. Crenshaw is one of the founding scholars of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy\">critical race theory</a>, the legal concept that sent conservative minds aflame a few years ago, and she developed the idea of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination\">intersectionality</a>, or looking at how multiple modes of oppression can work together. So I called her up to find out what she thought of the Harris fundraisers for white people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Crenshaw spoke to me from Nashville, Tennessee, where the African American Policy Forum, of which she is co-founder and executive director, is holding its fifth annual critical race series summer school. Together, we talked through how today’s organizers are taking their cues from the triumphs and failures of the civil rights movement, and why those who want to protect democracy should start thinking intersectionally. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Zoom call &quot;White Women Answer the Call&quot; for Kamala Harris is saying it&#039;s the largest call in the history of Zoom.

I mean, Shirley Chisholm couldn’t get any constituency to support her, including the Congressional Black Caucus. So we’re in a different world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You not only have just Black women — who have the capacity at this point to raise millions — but white women, Black men, white men, and then South Asian people taking this up: It suggests to me that there is a greater awareness than ever before that in order to secure some protection against the further disintegration of our democracy, people have to be willing to organize in their own communities. They have to be willing to address the dynamics that they worry might prevent their community from supporting Kamala Harris’s presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the Black male group, they’re talking about sexism. I mean, that’s a huge moment. In the white women’s group, they’re talking about racism. So yeah, this may be what [legal scholar and civil rights activist] Derek Bell called interest convergence. There is a converging interest between those of us who think, talk, and write about intersectionality and those who want to save this democracy. They now have to think in intersectional terms. And that means white women thinking about racism, Black men thinking about sexism, white men thinking about both of these things. It is a remarkable moment to see these formations come together and the conversations that they think are important to have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I think a lot of people, when they first saw these events emerge, had the thought of like, “Oh, this is like having a White History Month. White people are so often the default. Why even call out a specific event just for them? Why not have an event open to everyone?” So I’d love to know your thoughts on whether this was an effective choice, and if so, what made it effective.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s a misreading of the moment, and I think it’s an under-reading of what is different about these efforts to form around categories that many times are not even marked or noticed. Look, plenty of people had a lot of things to say about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14061660/women-march-washington-vote-trump\">white women voting for Trump</a>. So what is the solution to that? The solution to that is for white women who are not for Trump to mobilize other white women to talk about it: What is it that people should be thinking and saying that they haven’t been? What is it that they need to do to mobilize that particular political cohort?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Look, plenty of people had a lot of things to say about white women voting for Trump. So what is the solution to that?”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is, I think, a not particularly sophisticated response to simply say this is like White History Month. In fact, I think that’s kind of silly. This is acknowledging that race and gender and other factors do form a consistent political axis in our community, and it is important to find ways to speak to those constituencies, and to speak to them in a way that doesn’t affirm the worst aspects of these historical categories. It makes possible for the best mobilizations, the best ways to talk internally, so that we can secure our democracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We saw the possibilities of raising consciousness, generating excitement, and raising resources so that this excitement has a chance of actually turning into a politically powerful coalition that can put a non-authoritarian in the White House.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>So would you say that this kind of identity-based fundraising is a good strategy to continue throughout the election cycle or even going forward?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, one cannot tell what’s going to happen throughout the election, right? So we’re in a period of time where clearly a moribund campaign has excited people. Clearly, depression has turned into excitement. It’s a fluid situation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But let’s be clear about another thing: race, gender, class issues. They’ve been around for the entirety of this country. To think that suddenly they’re going to dissipate at some point, regardless of what happens or even if Kamala Harris gets elected, is a mistake. It was a mistake that too many people made when Obama got elected. And I hope it’s not a mistake that people make again. These are deep grooves in our society, and because most of the time they’ve been used in a negative way, people think that they’re inherently only capable of producing exclusion and power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there have been plenty of white people who have organized as white people in defense of democracy and defense of racial justice. I mean, the entire civil rights movement, one of its most important conventions is that white people put their bodies on the line as well, knowing that as white people, their ability to mobilize for a true multiracial democracy would gain disproportionate attention from the media. This is using whiteness to dismantle exclusion. And we need to tell more of those stories.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The very fact that we’re talking about this is because those stories are not part of the history that we’re taught in schools. Parents attack teaching about our racial past because they say it’s divisive or they say it makes their kids feel bad. It’s evidence that we’re not taught&nbsp;about these people who have organized around their whiteness in order to advance and promote racial inclusion, democracy, and a true multiracial democracy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in dissent, it could even have allowed Trump to escape prosecution if he had <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf\">ordered “the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) plans to introduce legislation that seeks to neutralize it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bill, known as the “<a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/755260835/No-Kings-Act\">No Kings Act</a>,” has 29 co-sponsors, all of whom are members of the Democratic caucus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schumer’s bill relies on a rarely used congressional power to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23186373/supreme-court-packing-roe-wade-voting-rights-jurisdiction-stripping\">shrink the Court’s authority to hear certain appeals</a>. The idea is to prevent the Supreme Court from enforcing its Trump immunity decision by removing the Court’s jurisdiction over presidential prosecutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bill also declares that presidents, vice presidents, and former presidents and vice presidents “<a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/755260835/No-Kings-Act\">shall not be entitled to any form of immunity</a> … from criminal prosecution for alleged violations of the criminal laws of the United States unless specified by Congress.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf\"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> (2024), the Court’s six Republicans held that presidents and former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for illegal actions they engaged in using their authority as president. Among other things, the Republican justices concluded that the executive branch led by the president “has ‘exclusive authority and absolute discretion’ to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So under the Republican justices’ understanding of the Constitution, Trump could not face criminal consequences even if he’d ordered the Justice Department to bring false charges against every elected Democrat in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schumer’s No Kings Act is the second major proposal by a high-ranking Democrat that targets the Court’s <em>Trump</em> immunity decision. Earlier this week, President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/363557/supreme-court-biden-kamala-harris-reform-term-limits-ethics\">proposed a constitutional amendment to overturn <em>Trump</em></a>, and this amendment was also endorsed by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The No Kings Act is distinct from Biden’s proposal because it is ordinary legislation and therefore doesn’t need to be ratified by three-quarters of the states like a constitutional amendment. In theory, the No Kings Act could be enacted by a simple majority of both houses of Congress and signed into law by the president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practice, however, the bill is likely to trigger massive resistance from the same Republican justices responsible for the <em>Trump </em>decision if it actually becomes law (something that can’t happen unless Democrats win both houses of Congress and the White House this November). Although the Constitution <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii\">permits Congress to make “exceptions” to the Court’s jurisdiction</a>, the Supreme Court could still declare a law stripping away some of the justices’ authority unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, Schumer’s bill is significant because it shows that Democrats are increasingly willing to play <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/555/\">constitutional hardball</a> against a Supreme Court dominated by Republicans. At least two of the Court&#8217;s six Republicans are only there because Senate Republicans <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21448904/senate-republicans-supreme-court-vacancy-election-ruth-bader-ginsburg\">engaged in similar hardball tactics</a> to ensure that the Supreme Court would have a Republican majority.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Jurisdiction stripping, explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly all cases that reach the Supreme Court fall within its “appellate jurisdiction,” meaning that the case must begin in a lower court and can only be decided by the justices after some other court has weighed in on it. The Constitution provides that this appellate jurisdiction is subject to “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii\">such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, the text of the Constitution suggests that Congress has virtually unlimited power to decide which appeals the Supreme Court is allowed to hear — although, as I’ll explain in more detail below, the Supreme Court’s precedents complicate matters a great deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While there is some doubt about the scope of Congress’s ability to shrink the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction, it is widely understood that Congress gets to decide which cases can be heard by lower federal courts. While the Supreme Court is created by the Constitution, the Constitution also provides that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii\">“inferior” federal courts must be created by an act of Congress</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The power to create a new court includes the power to determine which cases may be heard by that court, and Congress routinely passes legislation defining the jurisdiction of lower federal courts. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, for example, typically only has jurisdiction over cases arising out of southern Texas, and not cases arising out of, say, Vermont.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The No Kings Act <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/755260835/No-Kings-Act\">relies on both forms of jurisdiction stripping</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It provides that any civil lawsuit claiming that the No Kings Act is unconstitutional must be filed in DC. These decisions will then appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, a court that currently has a 7-4 Democratic majority among its active judges. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Actual criminal prosecutions of a president could potentially be filed anywhere, but, because the president is a federal official who resides in Washington, DC, most potential crimes committed by a president would likely be prosecuted in a DC federal court anyway, as the Constitution provides that criminal defendants shall be tried in “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment#:~:text=The%20Sixth%20Amendment%20guarantees%20the,charges%20and%20evidence%20against%20you.\">the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, the bill provides that the Supreme Court “shall have no appellate jurisdiction” over any claim that “an alleged criminal act was within the conclusive or preclusive constitutional authority of a President or Vice President or on the basis that an alleged criminal act was related to the official duties of a President or Vice President.” A separate provision provides that the Supreme Court “shall have no appellate jurisdiction to declare any provision of this Act (including this section) unconstitutional.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, the bill seeks to lock the Supreme Court out of presidential immunity cases and to make the DC Circuit, which previously ruled that <a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/1AC5A0E7090A350785258ABB0052D942/$file/23-3228-2039001.pdf\">Trump was not allowed to commit crimes</a> while he was in office, the final word in these cases.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Would this trick actually work?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are legitimate constitutional arguments that can be raised against the No Kings Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the debate over Congress’s power to reduce the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction turns on very old precedents. In <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/74/506\"><em>Ex parte McCardle</em></a> (1869), a newspaper publisher was arrested by a military commander in the post-Civil War South. The publisher claimed that his arrest was illegal, but before the Supreme Court could rule on his case, Congress passed a law stripping the Court of jurisdiction over it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court’s ultimate decision in <em>McCardle</em> offers ammunition to both proponents of the No Kings Act and to the law’s detractors. On the one hand, <em>McCardle</em> was deferential to Congress’s power to make exceptions to the Court’s jurisdiction. “[T]he power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words,” Chief Justice Salmon Chase wrote for a unanimous Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, however, Chase’s opinion ended with a line stating that the jurisdiction stripping law “does not affect the jurisdiction which was previously exercised,” meaning that court decisions handed down before the jurisdiction stripping law was enacted remain good law. So <em>Trump </em>technically remains good law even if the Supreme Court is forbidden from enforcing it, and lower courts may feel compelled to honor that decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two years later, in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/80/128/\"><em>United States v. Klein</em></a><em> </em>(1871), the Court ruled that Congress may not use a jurisdiction-stripping law to lay out a “<a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/80/128/\">rule of decision</a>” for the Supreme Court. That is, while Congress could conceivably strip away the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to hear all abortion-related cases, it could not try to force the Court to decide these cases in a certain way by stripping it of jurisdiction only over cases where the Court is inclined to rule against abortion rights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11980829158634315619&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Felker v. Turpin</em></a> (1996), three justices joined a concurring opinion suggesting that Congress may not entirely forbid the Court from hearing a particular issue altogether. Justice David Souter’s concurring opinion in <em>Felker</em> suggests that, while Congress may cut off one process that a litigant may use to bring a case to the justices, Congress must also leave open some other avenue that would allow the issue presented in that case to be heard by the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What these cases show is that Congress’s power to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction is rarely used, and the Court has not clearly defined the scope of that power. That’s bad news for Schumer and other proponents of the No Kings Act. Given how uncertain the Court’s jurisdiction-stripping precedents are, it probably would not be hard for the Supreme Court’s Republican majority to come up with a reason to declare the No Kings Act unconstitutional if they wanted to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the No Kings Act is significant, less because it is likely to be upheld by a Republican Supreme Court than because it shows that Democrats are starting to think creatively about how to rein in a rogue Supreme Court. If the Court’s Republican majority insists upon enforcing its <em>Trump </em>immunity decision even after that decision is repudiated by Congress, then Congress has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23186373/supreme-court-packing-roe-wade-voting-rights-jurisdiction-stripping\">plenty of other tools</a> it can use to protect the nation from lawless justices and lawless presidents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among other things, Congress could zero out the Court’s budget for law clerks and other support staff. It could evict the justices from their chambers. And it could even add more seats to the Supreme Court, which could immediately be filled with Democratic justices if a Democrat is in the White House.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The No Kings Act, in other words, represents a significant escalation in the fight between elected Democrats and unelected Republicans on the Supreme Court. And, if those unelected Republicans do not yield, Congress has plenty of tools it can use to escalate further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Correction, 8 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This piece previously misstated where a trial of a former president would take place under the No Kings Act.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

This time around, Trump has enlisted the aid of two of the Republican Party’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-campain-election-2024-susie-wiles-chris-lacivita/678806/\">premier operatives</a>: Susie Wiles, who masterminded the GOP’s conquest of Florida, and Chris LaCivita, who introduced “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftboating#:~:text=The%20term%20swiftboating%20(also%20swift,unfair%20or%20untrue%20political%20attack.\">swiftboating</a>” into the American vernacular. And the professionalism and ruthless pragmatism of Trump’s new state managers has made itself felt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the Trump campaign’s direction, the GOP removed calls for banning abortion federally or opposing same-sex marriage from its <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pushes-new-gop-platform-softening-partys-positions-abortion-sex-rcna160730\">platform</a>, while adding a pledge to sustain Medicare and Social Security’s existing benefit levels and retirement ages. All these changes brought Republicans into <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/07/social-security-medicare-budget-cuts-poll/11621677002/\">closer</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-trump-biden-election-2024-dobbs-498d14f6e2bbfe1f313f006ad089de4e\">alignment</a> with <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/506636/sex-marriage-support-holds-high.aspx\">public opinion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the Republican National Convention, meanwhile, Trump’s team made <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361751/rnc-trump-speech-vance-2024\">overtures</a> to various traditionally Democratic constituencies, giving a labor leader and biracial influencer primetime speaking slots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Democrats put a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">spotlight</a> on the Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025” — a compendium of all the conservative movement policy goals for a second Trump White House, including federal abortion restrictions and the criminalization of pornography — the Trump campaign not only disavowed the document, but <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/184392/project-2025-head-paul-dans-resigns-heritage-foundation-backlash-trump\">got its lead author ousted</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And recently, Trump has touted heterodox economic policy ideas with some appeal to swing constituencies, such as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4803191-no-tax-on-tips-tradeoffs/\">exempting tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-01/trump-vows-to-cut-taxes-on-social-security-in-bid-to-woo-seniors\">Social Security benefits</a> from taxation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But sound marketing only gets you so far. And in recent days, Trump and his running mate have made it clear that their campaign is trying to sell a similarly defective product. Their handlers can try to present them as center-right populists who will get tough on immigration, while protecting entitlements and leaving abortion to the states. But let them speak unscripted for long enough, and the weird and hateful nature of their worldviews will shine through.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Wednesday, the GOP nominee participated in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american\">a question-and-answer session</a> before the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). Trump could have used this appearance to advance a few of his campaign’s many sound lines of attack against Kamala Harris: that she <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/kamala-harriss-medicare-for-all-plan-makes-political-sense.html\">once endorsed</a> many <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html\">exceptionally</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/harris-fracking-shift-raises-questions-in-pennsylvania-can-shapiro-help-00170885\">left-wing policies</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/31/harris-border-immigration-gop-00172202\">decriminalization of border enforcement</a>; that she presided over the highest inflation in four decades; or that she might have <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-allies-escalate-attacks-harris-accusing-covering-bidens/story?id=112163387\">publicly downplayed</a> the extent of President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, he chose to suggest that Harris is not really Black, since in some contexts she has identified with the heritage of her Indian mother. (Her father is Jamaican.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The vice president “happen[ed] to turn Black,” Trump explained. “She was Indian all the way and all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black woman.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since his exile from Twitter, Trump has had fewer opportunities to advertise his racial insensitivity and personal cruelty on a high-visibility platform. But no campaign consultant could vet Trump’s extemporaneous musings on Harris’s ethnicity before they escaped his mouth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nor, evidently, could they prevent him from doubling down on this bizarre line of attack in the face of controversy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Wednesday night, Trump <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/08/01/trump-doubles-down-on-harris-race-comments/\">projected</a> on a large overhead screen an image of a news story that described Harris as “Indian-American.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Thursday, Trump reiterated this attack by <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1819010458277580946\">posting on Truth Social</a> an old photograph of Harris with several Indian family members, beneath the sardonic message, “Thank you Kamala for the nice picture you sent from many years ago! Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian Heritage are very much appreciated!”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Trump’s attacks on Harris’s ethnicity are dishonest (and probably counterproductive)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is perhaps misguided to seek some strategic logic in these rancid effusions. To the extent that questioning Harris’s Blackness was a coldly calculated move rather than a thoughtless outburst, its aim is to promote the idea that she is a phony: For most of her life, Trump implicitly argues, Harris’s true, primary ethnic identity was Indian, but she chose to downplay that part of her heritage — and emphasize her Jamaican roots — once she entered Democratic politics, in an inauthentic bid for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If this argument has a rational purpose, it is to trigger white Americans’ resentment of affirmative action (by insinuating that Harris owes her position to the cynical exploitation of her heritage) while dampening Black voters’ enthusiasm for her candidacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I cannot say with total certainty that Trump’s attack on Harris’s identity will fail to achieve either of those ends. Trump launched all manner of disgraceful attacks in 2016 and then won the presidency anyway. And current polls suggest he is the slight favorite in this year’s election. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I do not believe that any competent political consultant would encourage Trump to pursue this line of attack. Voters are worried about immigration and inflation. Harris’s record leaves her vulnerable on both fronts. Any day that the media is talking about her ethnic heritage is a day they aren’t talking about the most unpopular positions she took during her 2020 primary campaign. Meanwhile, one of Trump’s biggest liabilities include the perception that he <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_060320/\">stokes racial division</a>, and therefore is not actually the candidate of order and social calm. Attacking Harris on the basis of her race increases the salience of that liability — especially since the attack in question is transparently mendacious and insincere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college. Her identification as Black therefore long predates her political career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is Trump who abruptly chose to adopt a manifestly inauthentic social identity once he started running for office: After spending decades as one of America’s most prominent libertines, Trump refashioned himself in 2015 as a devout Christian whose “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/27/politics/donald-trump-favorite-bible-verses/index.html\">favorite book</a>” is the Bible. Nevertheless, he proved unable to name a single treasured biblical verse when asked in an interview and flubbed the name of one of the New Testament’s books in a campaign speech.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">today seems like a good day to bring back the clip of Trump being unable to name a single verse from the Bible — his &#039;favorite book&#039; — when asked what his favorite verse was: <a href=\"https://t.co/NGccrMtHHu\">pic.twitter.com/NGccrMtHHu</a></p>&mdash; JRR Jokien (@joshcarlosjosh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshcarlosjosh/status/1772709698979930377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">J.D. Vance is the most disliked vice presidential candidate on record</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any case, Trump’s remarks about Harris were not the only missteps in his appearance before the NABJ. Asked whether his choice for vice president, J.D. Vance, is qualified to assume the duties of the presidency on day one, the 78-year-old Republican nominee declined to say yes, replying instead, “The vice president in terms of the election doesn’t have any impact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s eagerness to distance himself from his running mate is understandable. Vance is a similarly difficult commodity to sell.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Ohio senator’s career as a politician has been brief and undistinguished. In 2022, he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results/ohio/\">won election</a> to the Senate by just a six-point margin, even as the GOP’s gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine won his race by 25 points.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sources of Vance’s underperformance aren’t hard to identify. He has the <a href=\"https://x.com/mannyfidel/status/1815466593146581153\">charisma</a> of a memoirist, not a politician. And he has staked out a wide variety of deeply unpopular and off-putting policy positions, arguing that rape victims should <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vance-abortion-rape/2021/09/24/c3007318-1d32-11ec-8380-5fbadbc43ef8_story.html\">be legally forbidden</a> from receiving abortions since “two wrongs don’t make a right,” and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">lamenting</a> the imprisonment of January 6 rioters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/363473/jd-vance-weird-voting-parents-demeny-postliberalism\">Vance’s peculiar contempt for childless women</a> has come to national attention. Democrats <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gPGxB2FqEc\">have promoted</a> a clip from a July 2021 interview that Vance gave to Tucker Carlson, in which he told the then-Fox News host that the Democratic Party is run by “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance backed up this claim by citing Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as childless Democrats who, as a result of their childlessness, had no “direct stake” in their country’s future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One problem with Vance’s argument is that Harris has step-children and Buttigieg was in the process of adopting twins in summer 2021. Another problem is that you do not need to have children of your own to have young loved ones (including, say, your nieces or nephews), or to care about improving your country, as an end in itself. And a third problem is that many people who would like to have kids are unable to do so as a result of infertility, and mocking their supposed misery is a weird and offputting thing to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Actor Jennifer Aniston, who has <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/jennifer-aniston-ivf-fertility-struggles\">openly struggled</a> with fertility, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/jd-vance-jennifer-aniston-childless-cat-lady.html\">highlighted this third point</a> in an Instagram post criticizing Vance’s remarks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Republican vice presidential candidate then had an opportunity to walk back his years-old comments, express remorse for any hurt his ill-considered remarks may have caused, and explain that what he really meant to say was that we need to make it easier for Americans to start families through better public policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, he decided to suggest that Aniston had sexualized his toddler because she wrote in her message, “Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Hollywood celebrities say, ‘Oh, well, J.D. Vance, what if your daughter suffered fertility problems?’” Vance said on <em>The Megyn Kelly Show</em>. “Well, first of all, that’s disgusting because my daughter is 2 years old. And second of all, if she had fertility problems, as I said in that speech, I would try everything I could to try to help her because I believe families and babies are a good thing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this has ingratiated Vance to the American people. As CNN’s Harry Enten <a href=\"https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1819010887287488558\">notes</a>, Vance is the first-ever vice presidential nominee to have a net-negative favorability rating right after being introduced at their party’s convention. And in ABC News’s polling, Vance’s net approval has dropped from -6 points shortly after his nomination to -15 points today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this said, it remains entirely possible that Trump and Vance will move into the White House next year. Indeed, Trump is still<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\"> leading</a> Harris in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/wisconsin/trump-vs-harris\">many polls</a> of key battleground states. But if the Republican Party succeeds in winning the presidency this November, it will be in spite of the two men on its ticket, not because of them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In exchange, eight Russian prisoners in the US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia will also be released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The swap marks the largest prisoner exchange with Russia since the Cold War, and was the byproduct of <a href=\"https://theins.ru/en/news/273542\">years of negotiations</a>. That this — one of the most complicated prisoner swaps in history — happened at all is significant, though it’s unlikely to signal a serious improvement in the relationship between the US and Russia, as the latter’s invasion of Ukraine continues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Relations are still at a nadir and will remain so absent any fundamental change in Russia&#8217;s war on Ukraine,” Adam Lenton, a Wake Forest University professor who studies Russian politics, told Vox. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Who are Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan? And who are the other noteworthy people being freed?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gershkovich, who was imprisoned in Russia in 2023 while on a reporting trip, was the first American journalist arrested in the country since the Cold War. At the time, he was detained due to claims that he was aiding the CIA in gathering intelligence about a Russian military equipment manufacturer, allegations he and the US government have strongly denied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His detention, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/3/30/23663270/wall-street-journal-american-reporter-evan-gershkovich-arrested-russia-first-since-cold-war\">as Jonathan Guyer explained for Vox at the time</a>, was a significant blow to what little press freedom remained in Russia:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><sub><em>It’s true that </em>Russian authorities have often harassed and surveilled international journalists in the country. But they were generally a somewhat protected class, as compared to Russian journalists, who have faced <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/killed/europe/russia/?status=Killed&amp;motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&amp;motiveUnconfirmed%5B%5D=Unconfirmed&amp;type%5B%5D=Journalist&amp;type%5B%5D=Media%20Worker&amp;cc_fips%5B%5D=RS&amp;start_year=1992&amp;end_year=2023&amp;group_by=location\">deadly peril</a>. The assumption was that having some foreign journalists in Russia was necessary should Russia want its correspondents credentialed in the US and Europe. Now, amid Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine, the rules are changing …</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Whelan, who is a citizen of the US, England, Ireland, and Canada, was accused of espionage in 2018, after going to Moscow for a wedding. He has similarly denied these allegations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both men were convicted in closed-door trials and sentenced in 2024 and 2020, respectively, to 16 years in a penal colony. The United States designated both men as “wrongfully detained” — a term the government uses to describe Americans it believes are detained overseas on unfounded charges, and whose release it is actively working to secure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others who are being released include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent Russian dissident and a dual British and Russian citizen who’s known for his vocal critiques of the government. Kara-Muza is a Pulitzer Prize winner for the commentary he’s published on the subject and had previously faced a 25-year sentence for charges of treason. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alsu Kurmasheva, a US-Russian journalist accused of spreading false information, had edited a book about Russia’s war on Ukraine and had previously been sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prisoners returned to Russia in exchange include convicted hackers and a convicted hit man, operatives who are known for their ties to the Kremlin. The most prominent among them is Vadim Krasikov — a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/putin-wants-his-hit-man-back-5bd759f8?mod=article_inline\">professional assassin</a> who in 2019 killed a former Chechen insurgent in broad daylight in Berlin while parents and their children watched. As the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/evan-gershkovich-prisoner-exchange-ccb39ad3?st=e7lgj32xb8k481j&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\">reported in their coverage of their own reporter’s return</a>, Krasikov “was the man the Russian president wanted to bring home.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts note that it’s important to differentiate between the individuals released by Russia and those released by other countries. “Putin wanted to bring home a Russian assassin, one he allegedly knew personally, and other spies, to show people who work in the Russian intelligence services that their government will try to bring them home if they get caught. The US government and its allies wanted to free innocent people being held hostage in Russian prisons,” Brian Taylor, a Syracuse political scientist who specializes in the study of Russian politics, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why this is important</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The scale of the prisoner swap is notable and ensures that a number of journalists and political activists are able to secure their freedom following years of imprisonment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Today is a joyous day for the safe return of our colleague <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/evan-gershkovich\">Evan Gershkovich</a>, who left a Russian aircraft moments ago in Turkey’s capital, Ankara, as part of a prisoner swap with Russia,” <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/emma-tucker-letter-evan-gershkovich-7a8c514f\">Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a statement</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The bogus case against him represented many significant things. A blow against press freedom. A warning to foreign journalists covering the Kremlin. A new tension in America’s relationship with Russia,” she added. “But at the center of it all was Evan, our 32-year-old Moscow correspondent from New Jersey, who likes to cook and supports Arsenal Football Club, and who loved living in and reporting on Russia.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Russia’s willingness to take individuals including Gershkovich, Kara-Murza, and Kurmasheva prisoner underscores the oppressive approach the country has increasingly taken to the press and political dissent under President Vladimir Putin. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24115022/evan-gershkovich-russia-espionage-jail-wall-street-journal-reporter\">As Vox’s Ellen Ioanes reported</a>, the Kremlin has backed “<a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/war-ukraine-putin-delivers-final-blow-russia-s-independent-media\">draconian laws</a> against what it refers to as fake news and against disparaging the war effort,” all of which are intended to silence critics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And while US lawmakers lauded the exchange, they also noted that taking hostages (<a href=\"https://theins.ru/en/news/273542\">including potentially Gershkovich</a>) was a troubling tactic Russia utilized to gain political leverage and facilitate the release of Russians detained overseas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These arrests have been examples of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s cynical ‘hostage diplomacy,’ where he detains foreign nationals to use as leverage against their home governments in an assault on the rules-based international order,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/evan-gershkovich-prisoner-exchange-ccb39ad3\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/evan-gershkovich-prisoner-exchange-ccb39ad3\">As the Wall Street Journal explained</a>, the US has increasingly had to grapple with that reality and the ethical dilemma posed by freeing convicted Russians in exchange for Americans it considers wrongfully detained:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To respond to Putin and other hostage-taking autocrats, the State Department staffed an entire office of roughly two dozen personnel, led by a former Green Beret who jetted around Europe and the Middle East to explore prisoner trades that might free Gershkovich and others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prisoner swap also signals that the two countries still have some diplomatic channels, though it does little to improve the hostility between the nations as Russia continues its war with Ukraine, which the US has staunchly opposed.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s the most significant development in the 9/11 case in years —&nbsp;one that may finally bring a sense of closure to some survivors and families of 9/11 victims, but that also highlights the broken legal system at Guantanamo Bay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the Department of Defense has not yet released the details of the agreement —&nbsp;and the defendants have not formally entered into it —&nbsp;Mohammed, Walid bin Attash, and Mustafa al-Hawsawi will reportedly plead guilty to war crimes in exchange for life in prison. Previously, they faced the possibility of a death sentence if found guilty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The plea agreement means that there will be no trial for the three at the prison’s notoriously slow military commissions,&nbsp;a justice system set up solely to try defendants at Guantanamo that’s been fraught with delays and complications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also means that, almost 23 years after the attacks, these cases will be resolved, though what will happen to the prison where 30 men are still held, even though most are cleared to be released, remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who are Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Walid bin Attash, and Mustafa al-Hawsawi?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The three men are some of Guantanamo’s most notorious detainees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mohammed, also called KSM or Mukhtar, has been called the architect of 9/11 and claimed responsibility for its planning “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/guantanamo-bay-detainees.html#detainee-10024\">from A to Z</a>.” He is a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Khalid-Sheikh-Mohammed\">59- or 60-year-old </a>member of the Baloch ethnic group and a Pakistani citizen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He allegedly traveled to Afghanistan and joined al-Qaeda, the terror group responsible for the attacks, sometime after he graduated from a North Carolina college in 1986. Mohammed is alleged to have proposed the plan to fly planes into the World Trade Center to former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 1996 and formally joined the group in 1998 or 1999. He’s also alleged to have trained some of the 19 hijackers. He was captured in Pakistan in 2003 before being held in CIA black sites in multiple countries for three years. There, he was subject to torture including waterboarding, forced nudity, and sleep deprivation, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/september-11-trial-guantanamo-bay.html\">the New York Times’s Carol Rosenberg</a> wrote earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The extensive torture Mohammed endured —&nbsp;he was waterboarded 183 times — made a fair trial impossible. In the US legal system, evidence produced under torture is inadmissible in court; <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/76985/how-the-biden-administration-should-take-torture-derived-evidence-off-the-table/\">that is not the case in the military commissions</a>, though some judges there <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/guantanamo-judge-throws-out-more-evidence-obtained-through-torture-jawad-case\">have adhered to US norms</a> in rejecting evidence or cases obtained via torture. (That was one of the issues seen as complicating commission trials.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bin Attash, also known as Khallad, is a Yemeni citizen. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/september-11-trial-guantanamo-bay.html\">According to Rosenberg</a>, he left for Afghanistan at age 14 to partake in a civil war against the US-backed Northern Alliance. He is accused of training two of the hijackers, as well as doing research to coordinate flight times, and testing flight security by smuggling a knife on flights. The <a href=\"https://www.therenditionproject.org.uk/pdf/PDF%20445%20%5bJTF-GTMO%20Detainee%20Assessment%2c%20Walid%20bin%20Attash%20(8%20Dec%202006)%5d.pdf\">DoD also claimed he was bin Laden’s close associate and bodyguard</a> (though he is missing part of a leg due to an injury in Afghanistan), and that he participated in the planning and execution of other attacks including one on the USS <em>Cole</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <a href=\"https://www.therenditionproject.org.uk/prisoners/walid-binattash.html\">bin Attash’s own testimony</a>, he was also extensively tortured over nearly three and a half years at CIA black sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mustafa al Hawsawi, also called&nbsp; Hashim &#8216;Abd al-Rahman, Zahir, Ayyub, and Muhammad Adnan, is the third man in the plea agreement. He is a Saudi citizen accused of conspiracy for financing some of the hijackers and helping with logistics. He was captured in Pakistan in 2003, and held at the black site the CIA operated at Guantanamo until 2004, when the site was forced to close. He was held in other black sites, <a href=\"https://www.therenditionproject.org.uk/prisoners/hawsawi.html\">where he was also tortured</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two other men, Ammar al-Baluchi (Mohammed’s nephew) and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, were also part of the capital case, but are not part of the plea agreement.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The agreement closes a chapter in Guantanamo’s history</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both former President Barack Obama and current President Joe Biden pledged to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, which is notorious because the George W. Bush administration skirted international law both in opening it and in the treatment of prisoners there. Its continued operation, 23 years after the war on terror began, is in contradiction of international laws and norms that the US claims to uphold, like those against torture and wrongful detention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That contradiction has been repeatedly on view during legal proceedings held there: “Every time the military commissions have to address a factual or legal issue, the United States government prioritizes covering up the torture and abuse of the detainees over getting to the truth, or ensuring justice and accountability for what happened on 9/11,” J. Wells Dixon, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Vox in an interview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sentencing agreement will likely give the detainees the opportunity to speak, Dixon said —&nbsp;including about their roles in the attacks and the torture they endured—&nbsp;and will give victims’ families the opportunity to ask questions of the defendants. A date for the sentencing hearing has not yet been made public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But agreement for the alleged plotters is just one part of the story. The other part is the effect it has had on survivors and the families of victims —&nbsp;some of whom are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/31/nx-s1-5059244/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-9-11-matermind-plea-deal\">frustrated</a> with the outcome and others who are relieved the process is nearly over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I feel like I am more aware of the fact that there will never be closure,” Leila Murphy, whose father was killed in the attacks when she was a young child and who is part of the advocacy group 9/11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, said in an interview. “But in a certain way, it’s like a closure on a chapter. This [trial] has just been dragging on for so long.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Biles, along with teammates Suni Lee, Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, and Hezly Rivera,<strong> </strong>compiled a score of 171.296 and defeated Italy (165.494) and Brazil (164.497) who won silver and bronze. Two days later, on August 1, Biles took home the individual women’s all-around gold, with a total score of 59.131. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These are Biles’s fifth and sixth Olympic gold medals, bringing her to nine Olympic medals in total over three Olympics. Biles’s medal haul, along with her 30 world championship medals — 23 of which were golds — solidifies her as the greatest gymnast that we’ve ever seen and arguably the most dominant athlete in all of sports. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her legacy is punctuated by her power, consistency, and winning record, but it’s her return to the Olympics and gymnastics in general that’s truly remarkable. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/358882/simone-biles-olympic-trials-paris-floor-vault\">For the last few years</a>, Biles has openly talked about her mental health struggles and the abuse she endured as a Team USA gymnast. She has been sharing these painful moments in the hope that what happened to her doesn’t happen again. She wants to make the sport safer and better for the next crop of girls following in her footsteps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While that kind of change is not as easy to quantify as a triple-twisting double back, Biles’s resiliency and bravery are just as legendary as her skill.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Simone Biles is the GOAT&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To put <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/10/20908435/simone-biles-gymnastics-best-ever\">Simone Biles’s talent in perspective</a>, you have to understand that gymnastics is scored down to decimal points. Biles regularly beats her competitors by roughly two full points. Those margins are like winning tennis matches 6-0, 6-0, outscoring an American football team by multiple touchdowns, or besting another basketball team by 40 points, and so on and so forth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles achieves these giant scores because she’s performing the most difficult moves at the most consistent clip. Biles’s two highest-scoring events are floor exercise and vault, both of which allow Biles’s power to take center stage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As experts explained to me back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12411966/simone-biles-olympics-gymnastics\">headed into the Rio Olympics</a>, and again in 2021 preceding the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/24/21185843/summer-olympics-postponed-coronavirus-tokyo-2020\">delayed</a> Tokyo Olympics, Biles’s power on the floor allows her to perform the hardest tricks. Floor routines are usually stacked so that the first tumbling passes are the most difficult, so they can be done when a gymnast has the most energy. However, Biles’s third tumbling passes (which are usually her easier passes) are sometimes the same difficulty as most women’s first passes. Biles has two floor moves named after her: the Biles I (a double back layout with a half twist) and the Biles II (a triple-double: two flips and three twists). As of 2024, no other woman but Biles has landed the Biles II in any competition.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2164431987.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.711279031594,100,74.577441936812\" alt=\"A gymnast in mid-air with her eyes on the bar she is going to grasp.\" title=\"A gymnast in mid-air with her eyes on the bar she is going to grasp.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Simone Biles competes on the uneven bars at the 2024 Paris Olympics. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jamie Squire/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the floor exercise moves, Biles has three <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/simone-biles-live-updates-gymnastics-paris-olympics-2024-latest-results/ZDUs2Jfuveao/iuPgP054UnL1/\">high-scoring</a> elements named after her:&nbsp;on vault, she has the Biles (two twists and front layout) and the Biles II (a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurchenko_vault_family\">Yurchenko</a> double pike); and on beam, she has the Biles dismount (a double-twisting double backflip).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"EVERY Simone Biles signature move I NBC Sports\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j61F2HucjEw?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ahead of the Tokyo Games, Biles was involved in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22575301/simone-biles-olympics-scoring-explained-gymnastics-yurchenko-double-pike\">scoring controversy</a>. The problem? Her tricks were too good. Judges could not figure out how to adequately score Biles because her moves were pushing the limits of difficulty. Critics said the Tokyo judges were scoring elements like Biles’s eponymous beam dismount too conservatively and not giving her full credit. Giving her the full total of her difficult elements would have made the already huge gap between Biles and her competitors even larger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re … too low and they even know it,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/sports/olympics/simone-biles-yurchenko-double-pike.html\">Biles told the New York Times</a> in May 2021. “But they don’t want the field to be too far apart. And that’s just something that’s on them. That’s not on me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles has been so good and so consistent that she’s pushed the sport to a new limit, which has yet to be matched. There are gymnasts and there is Simone Biles. Simone Biles is one of one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Paris, Biles is nursing a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/simone-biles-return-paris-olympics-2024-spt-intl/index.html\">slight calf injury</a> but still earned a 14.90 on vault and 14.66 on floor to help lead the US team to gold. She is still poised to compete in the women’s finals for vault, balance beam, and floor exercise.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simone Biles’s resilience&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Biles is a once-in-a-lifetime athlete, her return to the Olympics is nothing short of extraordinary. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22596910/simone-biles-withdrawal-olympic-gymnastics-team-finals-results\">Three years ago in Tokyo</a>, Biles suffered a mental block known in the gymnast world as the “twisties.” As Biles has explained in articles and extensively in her new Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81700902\"><em>Simone Biles: Rising</em></a>, the twisties happen when there’s a disconnect between your brain and body. That lack of body awareness, especially when gymnasts are performing difficult tricks, could end in serious injury. As a result, Biles pulled out of the team and all-around competition despite being the heavy favorite. She came back for one event, the balance beam event finals, and won a bronze medal on the apparatus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet pundits, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/29/simone-biles-and-the-magaverses-fetish-of-toughness-501515\">primarily right-wing personalities</a>, attacked Biles for withdrawing from competition and failing her team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What the public didn’t fully understand, and what Biles speaks about honestly in <em>Rising</em>, is that she believes the twisties she suffered in Tokyo were a result of unresolved stress and trauma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because of Covid-19 and the health precautions surrounding the pandemic, families were not allowed to travel with athletes to the 2021 Olympics. Biles’s support system — her family and mom especially —&nbsp;was not present.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles also explains that she still hadn’t fully processed or gotten sufficient treatment after being abused by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22585637/gymnastics-tokyo-olympics-2021-abuse-larry-nassar\">Larry Nassar</a>. Nassar was the former doctor of Team USA’s gymnastics team and was charged with sexually assaulting girls and young women. After <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/us/larry-nassar-sentencing/index.html\">pleading guilty</a> to federal pornography charges (Nassar was in possession of child sex abuse material) and multiple child sex abuse charges,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/2023/07/11/larry-nassar-ex-gymnastics-doctor-convicted-sexual-abuse-stabbed-in-prison-what-we-know/70400955007/\">he was sentenced</a> to 60 years in federal prison and over 100 years in state prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-announces-138m-settlement-larry-nassars-victims-claims/story?id=109533950\">one of the hundreds of women</a> and girls who came forward against Nassar. She also spoke out about the FBI’s failure to properly investigate the allegations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In September 2021, weeks after the Olympics, Biles testified at a US Senate Hearing against Nassar. “I worked incredibly hard to make sure that my presence could help maintain a connection between the failures [around the Nassar case] and the competition at Tokyo 2020,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nhXchOtMLg\">Biles told the sitting senators</a>. “That has proven to be an exceptionally difficult burden for me to carry, particularly when required to travel to Tokyo without the support of any of my family. I am a strong individual and I will persevere, but I never should have been left alone to suffer the abuse of Larry Nassar.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Biles had walked away from the sport after Tokyo, no one would have blamed her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s won almost every medal possible — including the team and all-around gold in Rio. She revolutionized gymnastics, creating moves that judges couldn’t accurately score. The sport itself is emotionally and physically taxing. And speaking about being sexually abused and your own mental health publicly, in the media spotlight, must be incredibly difficult.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in coming back to Paris, Biles has changed gymnastics for the better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s helped open the door to an honest, de-stigmatizing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22596341/simone-biles-withdrawal-osaka-olympics-mental-health\">conversation about mental health.</a> She’s made us question the pressure we put on athletes, especially young girls (<a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/kerri-strug-simone-biles-vault-atlanta-legacy-injuries.html\">remember Kerri Strugg?</a>) and how stories about their “toughness” and “perseverance” as gymnasts are framed. She and her family have also <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/simone-biles-impact-her-parents-owning-gym-has-athletes-color-t221423\">opened their own gym</a> and are helping change the sport for the next generation of young girls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because Biles has been so dominant and so talented, we took her greatness for granted. Without her honesty and vulnerability, we may have never understood how resilient she is. And thankfully, we’ve been  lucky enough to witness it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, August 1, 3:25 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published on July 20 and has been updated with news of Biles winning the women’s all-around individual final. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The conversation around <a href=\"https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=3b588a4f-0564-4eb7-8afc-291e51eae543\">sports</a> is particularly fraught, from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/28/1138396067/transgender-youth-bills-trans-sports\">children’s athletics</a> right up through the <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2023/06/transgender-athletes-sports-debate-lance-armstrong.html\">pros</a>. Despite the International Olympic Committee vowing to be <a href=\"https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-publishes-updated-portrayal-guidelines-to-help-ensure-gender-equal-fair-and-inclusive-media-coverage-of-paris-2024\">more inclusive</a>, the future for trans athletes is unclear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It all raises the question: How did we get to this point, and did it always have to be this way?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answers found in historian and journalist Michael Waters’s <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374609818/theotherolympians\"><em>The Other Olympians: Fascism, Queerness, and the Making of Modern Sport</em>s</a><em> </em>might be surprising<em>. </em>Waters’s book traces the emergence of Zdeněk Koubek, a track and field star representing the country formerly known as Czechoslovakia who, at 21, won two medals — a gold in the 800m and a bronze in the long jump — at the 1934 Women’s World Games. (The Women’s World Games was the precursor to women competing at the Olympics). In 1935, Koubek announced that he would be living life as a man and swiftly became an international celebrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps the most intriguing facet to Koubek’s story was in the public response. Koubek was more welcomed and celebrated than we might imagine. There was an open-mindedness and empathy to the reception of Koubek and his gender identity and expression in the 1930s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Waters also pinpoints where and when that changed, specifically at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany. Armed with a propensity for eugenics, gender anxiety, and a startling lack of scientific evidence, a small set of Nazi officials influenced the International Olympic Committee into gender surveillance and trans panic — stuff that eerily mirrors the transphobic attacks that athletes, <a href=\"https://x.com/buttonslives/status/1817737387369267707\">cis</a> and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/transgender-swimmer-lia-thomas-speaks-backlash-future-plans/story?id=85068951\">trans</a> alike, face today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In reading Waters’s account of Koubek and other trans and intersex athletes’ lives, it all feels like those Olympics were a breaking point. The Nazi era has substantially shaped the conversation surrounding trans athletes today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This conversation was edited and condensed for length and clarity. As Waters notes in </em>The Other Olympians<em>, we use different and more specific language to signify transgender and intersex identity today, making it difficult to fully translate stories from the past into contemporary language. We refer to Koubek with male pronouns because that’s how he expressed his gender identity publicly after his transition.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I want to ask you, how did you find out about Koubek? I’ve never heard of him. I was so surprised —&nbsp; in a good way! All the details about his life — how he loved running, how he got famous — how did you find his story?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s sort of the reaction I had when I first came across him. History, especially before World War II, is full of the stories of queer people in the community kind of existing and becoming prominent way before you might expect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What I found is that the way we would describe queer people, whether in terms of sexuality or gender transition — those phrases have changed so much over time, but when you know what [terms or phrases] might have been used in a specific era, you can actually find some really interesting stories.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the 1930s, a lot of transitions would be described as “sexual metamorphoses,” which is this weird technical word. Because this is a time before we have a concept of gender, it sort of comes from this idea that something had spontaneously changed in these people’s bodies, and then they’re a man or woman.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Obviously, language has changed now and I think there’s a general effort to be more conscious of the terms we’re using. Back then, people didn’t have the words or language when it comes to gender identity and expression.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I had a preconceived notion of queer history as generally bleak to awful. Like something out of </strong><strong><em>Mad Max.</em></strong><strong> And from reading your book, I was surprised to find that it wasn’t exactly that.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, I mean, I think it’s really easy to think of like, before World War II and especially even before Stonewall generally as this dark period where there can’t be public embraces of queerness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s so much more complicated than that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You point out in Koubek’s case that he becomes a celebrity and is even welcomed. This is all relative, but there seems to be a lot of open-mindedness and positivity in a lot of the coverage following Koubek.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a bit of sensationalism to the coverage. There is a little bit of fascination because he is one of the few prominent people who is sort of transitioning. Reporters get his pronouns wrong all the time. In some articles, you see every conceivable pronoun used to describe him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I think through it all, you see this real empathy and curiosity about transition and what’s possible medically in terms of logistics. People are interested in this idea of these categories of&nbsp;male and female, and what you’re assigned at birth is not as set in stone as they would have expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Right. I don’t want to give them too much credit, but the media’s coverage of Koubek wasn’t as painful or as terrible as I expected, especially when you consider how trans people are covered and written about today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>In that vein of looking at today, I think the stark thing in your book&nbsp;is that you see when and where the narrative surrounding Koubek and other athletes shifts. That’s the Olympics in Nazi Germany.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What was so interesting to me is that these [current] Olympic sex testing or eligibility policies have their historical roots in 1936. And those historical roots really, I think, are in this anxiety over women athletes. In the 1930s, there’s just a general fear of masculine women in sports and this idea of sports, especially a sport like track and field, as being both somehow dangerous to health, but also imperiling this really strict notion of femininity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that Koubek, in some way, proves the fears of mostly male sports officials who were worried that the act of playing sports is changing something in women athletes and sort of masculinizing them in this way that they found intolerable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Yes, absolutely. They used fear and suspicion as a cudgel and anyone — you note that Jewish athletes also face similar kinds of discrimination — who didn’t conform to their ideas of “norm” got punished.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just the fact that in the 1930s, the conception was this idea of a medical exam, which was this kind of strip test. The strip test would be given out if a competitor had a question about another one of their competitors. You can just sort of force your competitor to be physically examined by a doctor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I think you can see some of that nastiness permeate into sports today. It’s not unlike some of the conversations surrounding </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8189679/serena-williams-indian-wells-racism\"><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/Simone_Biles/status/813947733816016896\"><strong>Simone Biles</strong></a><strong> throughout their careers. They’re often accused of being too masculine or muscular, and there have been insinuations that they dope or derisions that their bodies aren’t feminine enough. It’s a nefarious accusation.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, this all starts with the origin of the Olympics. Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Olympics, didn’t want women to play in sports, full stop. There are many quotes about how he didn’t like the sight of women athletes. Women athletes were looked at with suspicion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>The current </strong><a href=\"https://olympics.com/ioc/pierre-de-coubertin/the-rationale-behind-coubertins-opposition-to-women-competing-in-the-olympic-games\"><strong>Paris Olympics website</strong></a><strong> has an entire — not entirely convincing — page on de Coubertin’s views and how his sexist ideologies may have been a product of their time.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This really helped cement this idea that there was something or there could be something unfeminine about successful athletes. That’s also tied to race and class. The first Olympic sports for women are sports like tennis and golf which, at the time, were really associated with the white upper class.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I think tennis, especially, is still considered a more feminine sport today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah. So there’s that important starting point, you have this fear-mongering about female athletes. Maybe a few women are okay if they play a certain kind of sport and they fit this notion of femininity, but there is real anxiety about what sports would do to the idea of gender in some way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I think what you’re getting at is that women athletes, to make people more comfortable, had to perform and present themselves in a non-threatening, traditionally feminine way. I think that still happens in sports today when you look at who gets rewarded with sponsorships and deals and who gets to be the face of women’s sports.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>In reading your book, I found myself wondering a little bit about what would’ve happened to the conversation and policies surrounding trans athletes if things took a different turn in the 1930s.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s easy to just assume that this is how sports had to be. It’s just really this specific coalition of officials who didn’t have the best morality in other aspects of their lives and political beliefs —&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>A coalition of officials who were really into … Nazi Olympics!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is a little bit counterfactual, but I do think, at the very least, it’s also important to see that these sorts of restrictive policies weren’t inevitable and to see how they were constructed and who constructed them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To the IOC’s credit, they released this policy statement in 2021 where they at least gestured at the idea of greater inclusion for trans and intersex athletes as well as women athletes with high hormone levels — groups that are often banned from competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do believe that we are capable of having that conversation. And I do think the IOC statement suggests that there is some interest in talking about making sports more inclusive. But obviously, I think the policies on the ground at the Paris Olympics this year don’t really reflect that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, August 1, 2:20 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This story, originally published August 1, has been updated with information about boxer Imane Khelif. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

During her time there, she noticed something interesting about who tended to be most excited about the Trump movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Those most enthralled with Donald Trump were not at the very bottom — the illiterate, the hungry,” she writes. Rather, Trump’s biggest fans could be found among “the elite of the left-behind,” meaning people “who were doing well within a region that was not.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an observation that cuts against <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/8/4/23818817/trump-support-david-brooks-economic-anxiety\">the prevailing theory of Trumpism</a>: that he is the tribune of the left-behind and impoverished white people suffering due to globalization. It is also one that is backed by hard data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/nationally-poor-locally-rich-income-and-local-context-in-the-2016\">In 2020</a>, three political scientists studied <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ogorzalek-Piston-and-Puig-2020-Nationally-rich-locally-poor.pdf\">how location and income affected white voters’ voting decisions</a>. They found that, on a national level, poorer white people were indeed more likely to vote for Trump than richer ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But when you factored in local conditions —&nbsp;the fact that your dollar can buy more in <a href=\"https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/Mississippi-Biloxi\">Biloxi</a> than <a href=\"https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/Massachusetts-Boston\">Boston</a> — the relationship reverses. “Locally rich” white people, those who had higher incomes than others in their zip codes, were much more likely to support Trump than those who were locally poor. These people might make less money than a wealthy person in a big city, but were doing relatively well when compared to their neighbors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Put those two results together, and you get a picture that aligns precisely with Hochschild’s observations. Trump’s strongest support comes from people who live in poorer parts of the country, like KY-5, but are still able to live a relatively comfortable life there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what does this mean for how we understand the Trump-era right? It cuts through the seemingly interminable debate about Trump’s appeal to “left behind” voters and helps us understand the actual complexity of the right’s appeals to region and class in the United States. America’s divisions are rooted in less income inequality per se than is widely appreciated, and often tied to divisions inside of communities and social groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Stolen Pride</em>, Hochschild locates the heart of Trump’s appeal to rural voters in emotions of pride and shame — including pride in their region’s traditions and shame in what it’s become in an era of declining coal jobs and rising drug addiction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Roger Ford, a KY-5 entrepreneur and Republican activist who serves as Hochschild’s exemplar of Trump’s “locally rich” base, Trump helps resolve those emotions by offering someone to blame. Ford may not be suffering personally, but his region is&nbsp;— and Trump’s rage at liberal coastal elites helps him locate a villain outside of his own community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“He based his deepest sense of pride, it seemed, on his role of defender of his imperiled rural homeland from which so much had been lost — or, as it could feel, ‘stolen,’” she writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ford’s comments to Hochschild shift seamlessly between economic and cultural grievances. In discussing his opposition to transgender rights, he situates it as the latest in a long line of dislocations that people in his region faced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“With all we’re coping with here, we’re having a hard <em>enough</em> time,” he tells Hochschild. “Then you make it fashionable to choose your gender? Where are we going?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This comment might make it seem as if economic concerns are somehow prior to cultural ones, and people like Ford are angry at transgender people because of economic deprivation in coal country. But high-quality research tells a different, more complicated story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, scholars Kristin Lunz Trujillo and Zack Crowley examined the political consequences of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0962629822000725\">what they call “rural consciousness” for politics</a>. They divide this consciousness into three component parts: “a feeling that ruralites are underrepresented in decision-making (‘Representation’) and that their way of life is disrespected (‘Way of Life’) — both symbolic concerns — and a more materialistic concern that rural areas receive less resources (‘Resources’).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When they tried to use these different “subdimensions” of rural consciousness to predict Trump support among rural voters, they found something interesting. People who saw the plight of ruralities in cultural and political terms were most likely to support Trump, while those primarily concerned about rural poverty were, if anything, less likely to support him than their neighbors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taken together, these findings suggest that the story isn’t simply that economic deprivation breeds cultural resentment. Trump’s strongest supporters in rural areas tend to be angry that their regions don’t set the social terms of American life: that they don’t control the halls of power and that, as a consequence, both political and cultural life is moving away from what they’re comfortable with. Economic decline surely exacerbates this sense of alienation, but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94\">it isn’t at the heart of it</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This more sophisticated understanding of rural white politics contributes to a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/trump-american-gentry-wyman-elites/620151/\">broader</a> literature <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/family-capitalism-and-the-small-business-insurrection/\">complicating</a> how we think of Trumpism’s class base, be it <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/trump-american-gentry-wyman-elites/620151/\">Floridian boat paraders</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/family-capitalism-and-the-small-business-insurrection/\">GOP mega-donors</a>. This body of work suggests that the conventional class shorthands political commentators use — rural versus urban, elite versus the working class, the one percent versus the rest — are of limited utility in discussing the political economy of Trumpism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To really understand what’s happening on the right today, we need to pay attention to the divisions within these broad groupings.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Then, influencers got more ambitious with “<a href=\"https://www.eater.com/24105047/you-dont-need-to-decant-your-groceries-kitchen-storage\">decanting</a>” videos documenting a method of pantry organization involving transferring foodstuffs from the grocery store packaging to clear containers in neat rows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now it’s “fridgescaping.” This is roughly what it sounds like: The interiors of refrigerators are organized and decorated, with the most popular posts of the genre featuring fridges that look less like cold storage and more like a bohemian fairy garden. Milk goes in farmhouse pitchers, eggs line up ceramic trays, and butter hides under dishes shaped like animals. Berries, ever ubiquitous, are placed attractively in vintage bowls, raw vegetables stand at attention, and items that have no place in a fridge — bouquets of flowers, photos in frames, string lights — are given prominent placement. That the refrigerators are meticulously clean is a given, and they’re often new and large.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7400918601911389470\" data-video-id=\"7400918601911389470\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@lynziliving\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving?refer=embed\">@lynziliving</a> <p>A Hobbit refrigerator has been my most requested fridgescape theme ever, so I went on a quest to tackle it. I’ve honesty been very nervous because I really wanted to do it justice for everyone. I was heavily influenced by Bilbo Baggins’ kitchen in The Hobbit right down to the doilies! This was also very similar in a lot of ways to Outlander with the very primitive style dishware and fresh herbs and plethora of textures. It was very fun to create as I’m currently vibing the natural texture in the refrigerator.  I wish I had been recording, but when Dave opened the refrigerator he was so excited. It’s his favorite one yet. I love getting his refrigerator stamp of approval. 😭😭  Side note: the bread was eaten for dinner.

Another tells the Times that spending three hours on a forest-themed fridge is worth it because she is “more excited” to eat her produce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It’s hard to fathom that influencers are meticulously creating a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7400918601911389470\"><em>Hobbit</em>-inspired fridgescape</a> and buying so much produce that their fridge <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jenefertaylor/video/7150726446682623275?lang=en\">looks like</a> a Dutch Golden Age still life</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As someone with a cooking background — my father has been a chef for 35 years, my mother’s side of the family runs a spice business, and I grew up running around commercial kitchens and worked for a year as a line cook, in addition to writing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spice-Advice-Wisdom-History-Saltiness/dp/1510735259\">a book on spices</a> — I find myself deeply disturbed by fridgescaping. It is, I believe, the culmination of a series of trends that serve to alienate people from food. It removes all the labor, the mess, the physicality, and the pleasure inherent in eating, and replaces it with public performance. There are better ways to organize a kitchen, techniques that can improve functionality and prioritize goals like reducing food waste — and, yes, that could even lead to eating more fruits and vegetables.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The rise of fridgescaping</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cooking at home for the majority of us not wealthy enough to outsource it requires an immense amount of time and labor: coming up with a meal plan, making a list, going to the store, shopping, unloading, chopping, sautéing, simmering, and doing the dishes after. This is out of reach for <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/key-statistics-graphics/\">millions of Americans</a> experiencing food insecurity, the many millions more living with low food security, or those who simply don’t have enough hours in the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shabazsays/video/7384908970835594528\" data-video-id=\"7384908970835594528\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@shabazsays\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shabazsays?refer=embed\">@shabazsays</a> <p>If you’re not fridgescaping.. what are you doing?  🤯🤯<a title=\"duet\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet?refer=embed\">#duet</a> <a title=\"stitch\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stitch?refer=embed\">#stitch</a> with  @lynziliving <a title=\"fridgescaping\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fridgescaping?refer=embed\">#fridgescaping</a> <a title=\"restock\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/restock?refer=embed\">#restock</a> <a title=\"restocking\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/restocking?refer=embed\">#restocking</a> <a title=\"bridgeton\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bridgeton?refer=embed\">#bridgeton</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Shabaz Says\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7384909007951317793?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; Shabaz Says</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that reality, it’s hard to fathom that influencers are meticulously creating a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7400918601911389470\"><em>Hobbit</em>-inspired fridgescape</a> and buying so much produce that their fridge <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jenefertaylor/video/7150726446682623275?lang=en\">looks like</a> a Dutch Golden Age still life. It goes without saying that fridgescaping — and its pantry cousin, decanting — prioritizes displaying and arranging food, instead of preparing and eating it. That’s not to mention all the unnecessary aesthetic upkeep, like changing out the water of that bouquet. Imagine doing all that and also recording yourself doing it, then sitting down to edit the footage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is to say: Fridgescaping is a scam of the classic keeping-up-with-the-Joneses variety for the TikTok age. In these clips, hours of labor are squeezed into 30 seconds of beautification, following the before-and-after formula so successful on social media. These videos suggest you too can have the beauty and bounty of a fridge decked out <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7381862181010181407\"><em>Bridgerton</em> style</a> if you <a href=\"https://www.shopltk.com/explore/Lynziliving/productsets/11ef1bc31026792d929a0242ac11002d\">purchase</a> the additional storage and knickknacks. Conveniently, you can click a link and buy everything you see from the influencer’s online store, where they receive a cut. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7407151543646014751\">Plenty</a> of rationalizations exist (the produce!) but they’re undercut when those same creators urge their followers to “shop my fridge!”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s very easy to connect any capitalist endeavor to food,” said <a href=\"https://utulsa.edu/people/emily-contois/\">Emily Contois</a>, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Tulsa and co-editor of <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=58mye9fd9780252044465\"><em>Food Instagram</em></a>, “because it’s something we have to do to survive — but it’s also something we genuinely want to do because it’s pleasurable, and doing it with other people, eating it with other people, preparing it with other people can also bring such profound pleasure.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Add in the gendered expectations around food preparation and cleaning, and fridgescaping can be seen as yet another domestic task expected of women: to not only shop, cook, and clean the kitchen, but to make it all look beautiful, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Your kitchen should be a space of purpose, not just aesthetics</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I no longer cook professionally, but as a regular working person who cooks daily in a well-functioning home kitchen with an average amount of storage space,<strong> </strong>I have good news: You don’t need to live a life of ample wealth and leisure to smartly organize your kitchen. There are free or very cheap ways to do it with function in mind, without totally sacrificing aesthetics (although you won’t be needing fairy lights anytime soon).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I consulted with the chefs in my life — my dad Brian Moog, and my brother-in-law Justin Behlke — for their practical advice on making the best use of your own time, space, and labor — and, as an avid home cook, added some tried-and-true tips of my own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Make your produce last much longer</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You should store most fresh produce in the refrigerator to maximize lifespan and give space and air to anything that’s packed tightly together to help it stay good for longer — I guess you’d call that a kind of decanting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can look at how they’re storing produce in the store,” my dad said. “If they’re storing something in water, like asparagus, you can do that at home too.” In addition to freeing the asparagus from their rubber band, he cuts the bottom of the stems, like flowers, and puts them in half an inch of water in a deli container in the fridge, where they last up to 10 days. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He also removes lettuces and pre-cut greens from bags and clamshells and places them in&nbsp;airtight containers with paper towels at the bottom and top. Raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries are likewise placed in a single layer on a piece of paper towel in airtight containers. Heads of lettuce, kale, herbs, and scallions can be simply wrapped in dry paper towels to achieve similar results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For my dad and brother-in-law, paper towels are the secret weapon to keeping produce fresh. As fruits and lettuces spend time in the fridge, moisture leaks out, which condenses and leads to the foods going bad faster. You want paper towels to absorb that excess. “The amount of paper towels I use …” Justin said. “There are all sorts of specialty containers, but usually those specific things are marketing gimmicks.” (For those who want a reusable option, try plain cotton or linen napkins to achieve a similar keep-fresh effect.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Paper towels are the secret weapon to keeping produce fresh</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So don’t be ashamed of paper towel use. “There’s a lot of value in paper towels,” Justin said. “There’s balance to keep in mind, but there’s a lot of practicality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Flour is the only dry good he puts in a plastic container, with a lid that’s easy to get off and an opening wide enough to dip a measuring cup into — mostly because flour bags create a mess every time they’re opened. “Keeping yourself and the cooking area clean saves time,” he said. “It seems nominal but it adds up.” That’s the kind of practical consideration you should keep in mind as you’re making your own kitchen decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I also recommend putting brown sugar in an air-tight container. After years of gouging it, rock-hard, from the bag, I can pop off the lid and scoop soft, moist sugar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Keep perishables front and center</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fridgescaping influencers talk a lot about how their methods help them keep track of their produce, but a few simpler methods achieve the same results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s true that “out of sight, out of mind” is a cursed reality when it comes to perishables in the fridge, so keep short shelf life items at the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t use the crisper drawers for fruits and veggies. I put condiments in one and, being a Wisconsinite, cheese in the other. I know certain produce lasts longer in the crisper drawers, but all that meant for me was produce languishing there for a few extra days because I’d forget about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, if your household consumes meat, try putting it in a see-through plastic container at the front. This keeps it front of mind and cordons it off from other food.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The real key to my family’s approach to reducing food waste is the use of a whiteboard on the fridge, where we note the meals we’ve bought ingredients for. Seeing those meals listed reminds us about the foods likely to go bad fastest, so we cook those first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We also keep a running shopping list on a second whiteboard. Whenever we’re low or out of something, we add it to the list, so by the time we’re going shopping we’re not trying to remember everything we need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>You don’t need to buy expensive plastic “storage systems”</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You don’t need professional-grade equipment or specialty gadgets, but professional-grade storage is key. For a lot of chefs, this means deli containers and cambros.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/779/deli-take-out-containers.html?srsltid=AfmBOoob6HEfRB8Do4xUff1usM9FoID_WrNkpHi9Z3ULOMS6sO_6_Msl\">Delis</a> are round plastic storage containers most commonly used in <a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/choicehd-32-oz-microwavable-translucent-plastic-deli-container-and-lid-combo-pack-case/128HD32COMBO.html\">32-ounce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/choicehd-16-oz-microwavable-translucent-plastic-deli-container-and-lid-combo-pack-case/128HD16COMBO.html\">16-ounce</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/choicehd-8-oz-microwavable-translucent-plastic-deli-container-and-lid-combo-pack-case/128HD8COMBO.html\">8-ounce</a> sizes. They stack in the cupboard, saving room, but also when used in the fridge, freezer, or pantry, regardless of which size you’re using. They’re a staple in restaurant kitchens, and they’re cheap and sturdy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/3087/food-storage-containers.html?vendor=Cambro\">Cambros</a> are larger containers made of thick, sturdy plastic with tough lids. A couple of these live on top of our fridge, and we pull them down to use as a mixing bowl, to make dough, and to cook big batches of food. The square cambros are ideal for storing large-batch leftovers, prepped ingredients (like chopped onions and carrots), and soups,&nbsp;they take up just as much room as a mixing bowl but because of their square shape they fit more efficiently and stack more readily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Use tape to label the food in the delis and cambros (no, you don’t need to cut it with scissors like they do on <em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/358672/the-bear-season-3-review-food-main-character-fine-dining\">The Bear</a></em>). Noting the date something was made can come in handy in both the short and long term. A “made on” date attached to leftovers containing meat, for example, is helpful when deciding whether to dig back in after a few days. And for items that won’t spoil, like syrups or caramel, it’s helpful when clearing out the fridge to realize which products have been occupying valuable real estate for six months without being used. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/IMG_5775_f51367.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A shelf in the author’s pantry. | Caitlin PenzeyMoog\" data-portal-copyright=\"Caitlin PenzeyMoog\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For pantry organization, try recycling old containers or using what you have instead of buying new ones. For instance, I use my loaf tins for granola bars and baby crackers on a pantry shelf to make the packages more accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t buy the idea that putting everything in clear plastic containers is helpful. I know how much cereal is left in the box every time I pour it into a bowl; I know how much mustard is left each time I squirt it out. When I notice them running low, I add them to the running grocery list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Kitchen organization is a process, not a one-off event</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My dad and Justin both say that organizing a kitchen is less an exercise in perfection and more about refining as you go along. “My biggest piece of advice is to remain conscious,” my dad told me. “I’ve set up a lot of kitchens, and I see the angst of it. People want to be able to move into a new space and put every item in the best place, but that’s just not realistic.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Don’t worry about finding the right spot for each and every item. Know that you’ll figure it out with an open mind combined with time spent in the kitchen. “It takes time. It takes trial and error,” my dad told me. “You just need to exist in your kitchen space for a while before you set it up perfectly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My dad is still fine-tuning his own organizational scheme. He recently realized pasta rollers were taking up a prime spot in a drawer when he hadn’t made pasta from scratch in two years. “It’s time to go to the basement,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One day you’ll realize, ‘this just doesn’t work here,’ and you’ll move it to the right spot,” said Justin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A kitchen is a living and ripening room. Not only will items gravitate to the correct spots, but those spots will likely evolve. Farmers market hauls in the summer require a different setup than cookie-baking season in the winter, and that’s to say nothing of new functions needed in a kitchen when a baby is born or a new roommate moves in. Even when you’ve achieved a well-functioning kitchen, it’s helpful to internalize Heraclitus’s adage that the only constant in life is change. “It’s a mindset,” my dad said. Somebody just needs to tell the fridgescapers.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

This was enough to erase the Republican nominee’s previous cash advantage; at the start of August, Harris <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/21/trump-harris-campaign-spending-fec-00175377\">had</a> $220 million in cash on hand, while Trump held just $151 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Official data on August fundraising has yet to be released. But there’s reason to believe that Harris’s money advantage grew last month, due in part to the Democratic National Convention. According to the Democrat’s campaign, it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-raises-540-million-since-launching-her-presidential-campaign-2024-08-25/\">raised $540 million</a> in the first six weeks since President Joe Biden handed off the nomination. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet this torrential downpour of campaign cash hasn’t trickled down the Democratic ballot: Even as Harris has begun outraising Trump, the Republican committee responsible for funding GOP state legislative candidates has amassed far more money than its Democratic counterpart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From January 2023 through the second quarter of this year, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) — the body tasked with electing Democratic state legislators — had raised $35 million, according to the committee. Over the same period, its GOP rival, the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), had <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/two-gop-spending-groups-raise-15-million-in-second-quarter-to-boost-down-ballot-republicans/\">raised $62 million</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those figures do not include the fundraising of party-aligned outside groups that focus on state legislative races. In recent years, progressive organizations such as <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/01/michigan-democrats-2022-midterm-results-the-states-project.html\">The States Project</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/9/17092822/foward-majority-liberal-super-pac-state-legislatures-2018-midterms\">Forward Majority</a> have spent large sums on state-level races. It’s possible that when super PACs are taken into account, the GOP loses its apparent cash advantage. Then again, there are also conservative outside groups, such as <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/01/koch-network-super-pac-ramping-up-political-activity-2024-election/\">Americans For Prosperity Action,</a> that invest in down-ballot elections. What we know for sure is that, when it comes to the parties themselves, Republicans are outraising Democrats in the fight for statehouses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That fight is often neglected by the national spotlight — but it can have profound implications for Americans’ daily lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Harris campaign appears to be conscious of its party’s down-ballot challenges. This week, it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/09/03/harris-25-million-transfer/\">transferred $2.5 million</a> of its own funds to the DLCC. Yet that largesse scarcely narrows the RSLC’s cash advantage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, only Democratic donors can ensure that the GOP enjoys no down-ballot edge. Given blue America’s current enthusiasm and engagement, this should be possible — at least, if liberals come to appreciate the high stakes, and low cost, of winning state legislative races.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Small elections can have big consequences</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In our nation’s federal system, a great deal of policy is set at the state level. It is a state’s governor and legislature — not Congress — that primarily determines its public education spending and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/24136266/housing-states-affordable-rent-homes\">housing policies</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the parties have polarized ideologically, so have policy outcomes between states with Democratic and Republican governments. Whether Democrats or Republicans wield power in a given state can determine whether its working-class families have access to <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/state-medicaid-expansion-gains-momentum-despite-gop-opposition\">affordable health insurance</a>, or its parents <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-state-of-paid-family-and-medical-leave-in-the-u-s-in-2024/\">receive paid leave</a>, or its labor unions can <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/digest/202208/impacts-right-work-laws-unionization-and-wages\">fend off rapid decline.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturning of <em>Roe v.Wade</em>, the stakes of state legislative elections became even higher. Throughout much of the country, the right to an abortion has become contingent on the outcomes of down-ballot races.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html\">22 states</a> that currently ban abortion — or restrict access to the procedure more tightly than <em>Roe</em> did — have GOP-controlled state legislatures. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/02/state-houses-next-battle-abortion-rights/\">all 16 states</a> that have enacted new abortion protections since the end of <em>Roe </em>are governed by Democrats. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Arizona narrowly averted a near-total ban on abortion this year, thanks largely to the Democratic Party’s large minorities in both the state Senate and House. When the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe</em>, the state’s 1864 abortion law went into effect. Only five of Arizona’s Republican state legislators <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-1864-ban-repeal-24578e546b69ca087e01034bcaf4aa01\">supported</a> repealing that archaic statute. But this was enough to enact a law overturning it, as Democrats <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_House_of_Representatives\">lay claim</a> to 29 of the state’s 60 House seats and 14 of its 30 state senators. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, a ban on abortions after 15 weeks remains in effect in the state. A November <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_139,_Right_to_Abortion_Initiative_(2024)\">ballot measure</a> could nullify that law by enshrining abortion rights into the state’s constitution. If it fails, however, Democrats could also expand abortion rights legislatively by flipping a tiny number of state legislative seats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">State legislative races are a bargain</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the stakes of state legislative races are high, the cost of meaningfully influencing their outcomes can be remarkably low.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, Democrats won control of the Minnesota state Senate by a single seat — which Democratic state Sen. Judy Seeberger won <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2023/05/04/minnesota-democrats-progressive-bills-moderate-divide\">by just 321 votes</a>. Seeberger’s <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=55630218&amp;default=candidate\">campaign cost</a> $123,992, while her Republican opponent <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=19069432\">raised</a> $137,143. In a race that tight and inexpensive, it’s conceivable that a dozen small-dollar donations could have tipped the balance in Seeberger’s favor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever the exact cost of Seeberger’s narrow victory, her donors got an extraordinary bang for their buck. With their single-vote Senate majority, Minnesota Democrats established paid <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2023/04/legislators-work-out-details-of-bill-that-would-create-a-paid-family-and-medical-leave-program-in-minnesota/\">family and medical leave</a>, barred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/07/minnesota-pro-worker-paid-leave-union\">non-compete clauses</a> in labor contracts, banned employers from holding compulsory anti-union meetings, bolstered workplace protections for meatpacking and Amazon workers, formed a statewide board to set minimum labor standards for nursing-home workers, directed <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/greater-minnesota/2023/05/why-lawmakers-finally-reached-a-deal-on-bonding-and-what-it-means-for-infrastructure-in-greater-minnesota/\">$2.58 billion</a> into improved infrastructure, made <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-signs-free-school-meals-bill-into-law/600259831/\">school breakfast and lunch free</a> for all Minnesota K-12 students, restored the <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2023/02/minnesota-supreme-court-state-can-bar-felons-from-voting-until-probation-ends/\">voting rights</a> of ex-felons, invested $1 billion into <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2023/05/minnesota-legislative-big-big-deal-spends-1b-on-affordable-housing-adds-metro-sales-tax/\">affordable housing</a>, imposed background checks on private gun transfers, initiated a <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2023/05/four-takeaways-from-the-dfls-vote-to-approve-gun-regulations/\">red-flag warning system</a> to remove firearms from people courts deem to be a threat to themselves or others, <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2023/05/minnesotas-soon-to-be-law-allowing-recreational-marijuana-explained/\">legalized recreational marijuana</a>, and mandated that utilities go <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/environment/2023/02/how-small-city-utilities-are-grappling-with-minnesotas-new-100-carbon-free-standard/\">carbon-free</a> by 2040, among other measures. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Were it not for 321 votes — and quite plausibly, a few thousand dollars of campaign contributions to Seeberger — few, if any, of these reforms would have passed. What’s more, it’s possible that Seeberger’s victory was also responsible for Gov. Tim Walz’s ascent to the Democratic ticket: Thanks to Minnesota’s flurry of legislating, Walz became a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/06/04/democratic-party-minnesota-legislature-progressives/\">nationally renowned</a> progressive darling, which might well have put him on Harris’s radar. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This November, Democrats have a chance to replicate their 2022 triumph in Minnesota. The party has an <a href=\"https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/can-democrats-flip-the-pennsylvania-senate-for-a-trifecta/\">outside shot</a> at winning a narrow majority in Pennsylvania’s state Senate, thereby giving the party a trifecta in the Keystone State and unlocking all manner of liberal reforms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The party also has a chance of accomplishing a similar feat in Wisconsin, where GOP gerrymanders had previously all but guaranteed Republican state legislative control. Last year, the state’s Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-strikes-gop-drawn-legislative-maps-rcna130983\">declared</a> such gerrymanders unconstitutional, and forced <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/20/24078666/new-wisconsin-legislative-maps-legislature\">the composition of new electoral maps</a> that feature a roughly even split of Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning districts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Michigan and Minnesota, meanwhile, the party is fighting to defend existing trifectas, and enable further policy gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democratic donors’ fixation on presidential politics is understandable. The stakes of keeping Donald Trump out of power are certainly high. But tossing another $20 (or even $2,000) onto Harris’s $540 million pile is much less likely to meaningfully change Americans’ lives than making a similar contribution to a pivotal state legislative campaign. At the national level, the cost of progress is exorbitant. In the right down-ballot races, however, it retails at a steep discount.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But after 10 months of Israel’s war in the strip — which has devastated the health care system and created dangerous and unsanitary conditions for Palestinians — a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevjz7zreyxo\">baby</a> became partially paralyzed last month after contracting the disease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the virus spread in the besieged enclave, UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153276\">called for</a> an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow for a mass vaccination campaign in Gaza. Since then, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02z5kjn40o\">Israel has agreed</a> to a series of three-day humanitarian pauses in the northern, central, and southern parts of the strip. As of Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that vaccination efforts have hit their targets so far, reaching more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8xwxjy4y7o\">161,000 children under 10</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is still a long way to go before health officials can declare that polio is no longer a public health threat in Gaza. To get there, WHO <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/world/middleeast/polio-vaccinations-gaza-who.html\">must reach 90 percent</a> of children under 10, or an estimated 640,000. Each child needs to receive two rounds of vaccines, and the second round of vaccinations is <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/polio-vaccination-campaign-gaza-israel-world-health-organzation/\">set to start four weeks</a> after the first doses are administered. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes the vaccination drive hard to implement, especially if the war continues between humanitarian pauses because more people will be displaced and more infrastructure will be destroyed. If Israel continues issuing evacuation orders or its attacks on infrastructure in Gaza, for example, it will be “very difficult for humanitarian actors to move around and be able to provide vaccines for not only polio but for other diseases,” said Julia Bleckner, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The nearly eradicated disease poses a serious risk for Palestinians in Gaza. And while health officials say it’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/polio-gaza-vaccines.html\">impossible to tell</a> if polio cases will remain contained, experts warn that a broader outbreak is possible and could have consequences for the region and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/31/nx-s1-5095736/children-in-gaza-get-polio-vaccines-but-the-virus-may-already-be-spreading\">potentially spread beyond</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How did polio make a comeback in Gaza?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polio, which <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis#:~:text=Polio%20mainly%20affects%20children%20under,protect%20a%20child%20for%20life.\">mostly affects children</a> under 5, is a highly infectious disease that attacks the nervous system and can quickly cause total and permanent paralysis. While there’s no cure, it can be prevented through vaccines, which is why most countries have been able to successfully eradicate the disease. In fact, since the <a href=\"https://polioeradication.org/who-we-are/\">Global Polio Eradication Initiative</a> launched in 1988, confirmed polio cases have decreased by <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/global-polio-vaccination/about/index.html#:~:text=Since%20the%20launch%20of%20GPEI,two%20countries%3A%20Afghanistan%20and%20Pakistan.\">99 percent around the world</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For decades, Gaza was an area where polio was considered to be eradicated. But in July, health officials <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/what-is-known-about-polios-return-gaza-strip-2024-08-30/\">detected the polio virus</a> in wastewater samples in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, in southern and central Gaza. ​​“Left unchecked, [the poliovirus] would have a disastrous effect not only for Palestinian children in Gaza, but also in neighboring countries and the region,” Guterres <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153276\">said last month</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The spread of polio in Gaza is likely the result of what are known as vaccine-derived strains of the virus. One version of the polio vaccine works by exposing people to a live but weakened form of the poliovirus. As a result, people who receive that vaccine can shed some of that weakened virus, usually in wastewater. If that virus is allowed to keep circulating through a community for long enough, it can eventually turn back into the kind of strain that can get people sick.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overcrowded areas with poor sanitation <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON500#:~:text=On%20rare%20occasions%2C%20when%20replicating,%2C%20poor%20sanitation%2C%20or%20overcrowding.\">are especially vulnerable</a> to spreading the virus through contaminated food or water —&nbsp;and those are exactly the conditions Palestinians in Gaza have been living in since the war started last October, particularly since Israel <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/israel-using-water-weapon-war-gaza-supply-plummets-94-creating-deadly-health#:~:text=Israel%20has%20destroyed%2070%25%20of,of%20Oxfam%20water%20testing%20equipment.\">has attacked</a> water and sanitation infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Add to that the fact that this war has significantly reduced the number of vaccinated people in Gaza. Before October 2023, 99 percent of people in the strip had been routinely immunized, but that number dropped to lower than 90 percent in the first three months of this year, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1153851\">according to the WHO</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That this is the first polio case in 25 years is “not a coincidence,” Bleckner said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will enough Palestinians be vaccinated in time?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most pressing concern for health officials is to ensure that 90 percent of Palestinian children under 10 are vaccinated as quickly as possible. So far, the results of the campaign have been promising: According to the WHO, the 160,000 children <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-attacks-gaza-kill-33-palestinians-pauses-allow-third-day-polio-2024-09-03/\">vaccinated</a> in the first two days of its drive have surpassed the agency’s projection of reaching 150,000 children at this point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s unclear how sustainable that success will be given that the war is still ongoing. As humanitarian pauses lift, obstacles could emerge that could prevent health officials from meeting their targets. Last week, for example, the United Nations said that Israel’s near-constant evacuation orders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/27/gaza-polio-vaccine-rollout-hindered-by-israeli-evacuation-orders-says-un\">hindered their aid workers’ efforts</a> to reach Palestinians in need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Within Gaza, it’s also possible that health officials will run into some vaccine hesitancy —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/2/polio-returns-to-gaza-where-else-has-the-virus-re-emerged\">one of the reasons</a> polio has been spreading in some parts of the world. And for some Palestinians, the fact that the vaccination campaign is coming from international organizations rather than Israel isn’t enough to alleviate their skepticism. As one Palestinian mother <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/9/3/tragic-childhood-gaza-children-vaccinated-against-polio-war-continues\">told Al Jazeera</a>, “People here have lost faith in anything global or Western.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also the question of safety. “For parents trying to bring their kids to get vaccinated, how are they going to move safely to health care centers when the majority of health care centers are inaccessible at this point and barely functioning?” Bleckner said. And after Israel attacked <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/5/israel-bombs-al-maghazi-refugee-camp-killing-dozens-gaza-officials-say\">refugee camps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e5y8ny1l4o\">schools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/21/gaza-hospitals-attacks-bombed-israel-war/\">hospitals</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1234906745/gaza-food-aid-convoy-israel-hamas\">food distribution sites</a>, it’s understandable that some parents might have some concerns that no facility is safe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Around the world, the spread of polio has been very limited, but it’s still considered to be endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, every part of the world will remain at risk until the virus is eradicated from those countries. That’s especially true for low-income countries with inadequate public health infrastructure. In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/2/polio-returns-to-gaza-where-else-has-the-virus-re-emerged\">Mozambique and Malawi</a> reported wild poliovirus cases — that is, poliovirus that is circulating naturally as opposed to the vaccine-derived strains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the health of Palestinians in Gaza and others in the broader region, it’s critical for the current vaccination drive to succeed. But because it’s taken so long to implement — experts <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-23/ty-article/who-warns-of-high-polio-risk-in-gaza-and-beyond-its-borders-amid-dire-water-sanitation/00000190-dfde-dab4-afb9-fffeebf10000\">have been warning</a> Israel and the world about a potential polio outbreak for months, and Israel has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02z5kjn40o\">vaccinating its soldiers</a> since July — it’s going to require an extraordinary effort. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s no reason why any kid in 2024 should have polio. It’s an entirely preventable disease, so even one confirmed case — and the WHO has also identified that there are multiple kids now showing symptoms of paralysis — that’s already too late,” Bleckner said. “The conditions that people are living in in Gaza are so honestly horrific and enabling the spread of disease, it’s really a fight against time in order to stop the catastrophic spread of this disease and others.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

For flight attendants, though, a delay isn’t just a hassle – it’s a lot of unpaid work. You’re at the airport, in your uniform, yet the pay clock doesn’t start until the plane is pulling out of the gate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t know another job in the world where you can show up, clock in, essentially, and just not get paid,” says Rory Kimbrough, who represents JetBlue flight attendants as the executive board member at large for the Transport Workers Union Local 579. Kimbrough has been a flight attendant for 20 years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Treatment like not being paid throughout the labor-intensive boarding process or during delays&nbsp;isn’t just shoddy, it’s indicative of a delicate and strained system for airline workers that, in the end, makes flying worse for everyone. When other common problems crop up, such as understaffed support teams and difficulty getting a hotel room for proper rest, those issues can just make delays even worse for passengers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Not getting paid is a huge issue,” says Brittany Norris, a member of the <a href=\"https://deltaafa.org/\">Delta AFA Organizing Committee</a> who has been a flight attendant for eight years. “When something is delayed and passengers are upset, we&#8217;re also upset.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More people have been jetting around this summer than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/23862850/flights-travel-delays-fees-nightmares-compensation-airlines\">last</a>, with a record <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Travel/tsa-sets-new-single-day-record-3-million/story?id=111750113\">3 million travelers</a> passing a TSA screening point on the Sunday of Fourth of July weekend. Between late May and August this year, about 25 percent of flights were delayed — roughly the same as last summer — according to data from flight tracking site Flight Aware. Compare that to summer 2019, when 18.6 percent of flights were delayed. When the CrowdStrike IT outage hit in late July, over <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2024/07/23/crowdstrike-outage-flight-delays-passenger-rights/\">46,000 flights were delayed</a> in one day. The outage lasted for days. Throughout July, almost 24,000 flights in North America were canceled, according to the aviation analytics firm <a href=\"https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/cirium-monthly-on-time-performance-reports2024/\">Cirium</a>. Delta was the hardest hit, with delays and cancellations rippling on for almost a week after the issue first surfaced.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Passengers and flight attendants alike were stranded at airports for days. While CrowdStrike started out as an IT issue that brought down computer systems crucial to airline operations, the Delta organizing committee, which has been fighting for a union since 2019, blames a <a href=\"https://deltaafa.org/news/where-plan-ed\">lack of communication</a> and understaffed teams as reasons why the flight disruptions lasted so long.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How flight attendant pay works</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an email, Delta explained they are “the industry leader in operational performance,” canceling fewer flights, leading to less time delayed in airports and more in the air. “Delta is the only major airline that provides boarding pay for our flight attendants, and we’ve been doing it for more than two years,” they wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, the way pay works for flight attendants can be a bit head-spinning. In general, there’s a base rate that applies to flight time and distance flown that roughly mimics an hourly wage while in the air, often called “block” time. The entire duty period, however, can include multiple flights and includes the 45 minutes to nearly two hours flight attendants would have to arrive at the airport to “sign in” for work, as well as about 15 minutes after the plane lands. Most unionized airlines have some minimum pay protections around duty time, however, like being guaranteed flight time rate pay for at least half of the duty hours.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Some unionized flight attendants have gone years without meaningful raises</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The flight time rate is supposed to be high enough to make up for those on-the-ground hours, but pay increases haven’t caught up with inflation or how much more work flight attendants do now compared to many decades ago. Particularly after Covid-19, delays in new contract negotiations have meant some unionized flight attendants have gone years without meaningful raises in a period of high inflation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They are working harder than ever before, with full aircraft, minimum staffing, long days, short nights, and no return for their hard work,” says Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. The industry underwent seismic changes after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and ensuing <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/488219-lessons-from-9-11-for-the-post-covid-19-airline-industry/\">airline bankruptcies</a>. “The number of hours that the airline could schedule us increased, the number of hours that we could schedule ourselves increased,” she says. “Everyone was willing to do that because there were such <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/TRAVEL/09/06/flight.attendant.attacks.anniversary/index.html\">steep cuts in pay</a>, and they had to make up for those losses in some way.” After 9/11, flight attendants essentially became the “last line of defense in aviation security,” Nelson notes. After the pandemic, they had to become public health enforcers too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond the duty time pay protection, there’s also usually a small per diem (ranging from around $2 to $3 per hour) while on duty, meant to cover paying for food and other expenses that pop up while working. Some airlines also offer overtime pay if a flight attendant exceeds a certain number of hours per month or higher pay for working certain hours and routes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this means that if a flight is delayed before the plane door is shut, many flight attendants are waiting even longer to start making money.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@moreperfectunion/video/7272809614796672299\" data-video-id=\"7272809614796672299\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@moreperfectunion\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@moreperfectunion?refer=embed\">@moreperfectunion</a> <p>Flight attendants at American Airlines are nearing the end of a strike authorization vote.

At Delta, the scale now tops out at close to <a href=\"https://deltaafa.org/news/june1-increase\">$80 per hour</a> of flight time (an hourly rate of $77.43, the new <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2024/04/24/southwest-airlines-flight-attendants-land-new-contract-first-for-industry/\">top rate at Southwest</a>, works out to about $74,332 per year.) But that’s only if you can survive the first several years. In recent years, some flight attendants have reported experiencing homelessness due to their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/08/26/flight-attendant-pay-flying-hours-homelessness/\">low wages</a>. Others work multiple jobs to afford basics. A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1cnyt19/the_actual_letter_aa_gives_new_fas_when_they_move/\">proof of income letter</a> for an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/american-airlines-flight-attendants-wages/index.html\">American Airlines flight attendant</a> went viral earlier this year when it showed that, at a rate of $30.35 per flight hour, a first-year employee would make about $27,315 per year. According to the <a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/pages/methodology\">MIT Living Wage calculator</a>, a single adult in <a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/54\">West Virginia</a> — which has one of the lowest costs of living in the US — would need roughly $39,386 a year to cover the cost of their basic needs. Kimbrough says that some of his fellow union members are on government assistance programs such as SNAP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“It’s the first time in the industry that we’ve actually had people quitting because they can’t afford to be a flight attendant”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These new people coming in, I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re surviving being flight attendants,” says Maria Teresa Hank, a member of TWU 556, the union of Southwest flight attendants. “It’s the first time in the industry that we’ve actually had people quitting because they can’t afford to be a flight attendant.” A spokesperson for the company told Vox in an email that “Southwest and its Flight Attendants union negotiated an industry-leading contract, which <a href=\"https://swamedia.com/releases/release-f9b0d09b13627fa65cf1f5e65d072ad8-southwest-airlines-flight-attendants-ratify-new-contract\">our Flight Attendants ratified back in April</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many are fed up. Flight attendants from American Airlines and United have been fighting for more pay, and also to be paid for the entire time they’re working. There have been some recent wins and movement on the issue; the <a href=\"https://skift.com/2024/04/24/southwest-flight-attendants-score-new-contract/\">new contract</a> ratified between Southwest and its flight attendants does provide some extra pay if there are long delays. A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/american-airlines-flight-attendants-union-new-contract/index.html\">tentative agreement</a> that was reached between American and its flight attendants offers half-pay during boarding the same way Delta does. On August 28, flight attendants at United voted to authorize a strike if negotiations break down, with an overwhelming 99.99 percent of yes votes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How delays can throw a wrench in the workday – and your travel plans</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not uncommon for a flight attendant to be scheduled for multiple flights a day. Delays can mess up their route, which — you guessed it — can trigger a domino effect of more delays. When airlines are ill-equipped to quickly react to disruptions, that slows everything down even more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The flight attendants we spoke to all emphasized that their employers could stand to be more proactive when disruptions, called “irregular operations” in the industry, occur. One example: ensuring flight attendants can get hotel rooms when delays stretch on for more than a few hours. Flight attendants are legally not allowed to work more than a certain number of hours, often between 14 to 16 hours for domestic routes. Long airport waits eat into the time that a flight attendant can legally be on duty before they need to get nine consecutive hours of legal rest. “Then when we are ready to go, the customers are like, ‘Why is the crew timing out, we didn&#8217;t even go anywhere’?” says Norris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hank says that airlines tend to wait right up until the minute they’re contractually obligated to provide a hotel room. Finally, when flight attendants are allowed to request one, there’s the time it takes to reserve and travel, so “by the time you get to the hotel, you literally get an hour, maybe 30 minutes, of just sitting down and being restful before you have to go back to the airport.” They then return to work not feeling rested and closer to timing out of being able to fly, which is an especially big problem if there are multiple legs on their schedule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People think of us as just serving drinks and snacks, but we&#8217;re really there for the important stuff, like if there&#8217;s an evacuation of an aircraft or if you have a medical [emergency] on an airplane,” says Hank. “You need your flight attendants alert and ready to go.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>They just end up sleeping on the plane, in airport chairs, in the crew lounge</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that a lot of people — including passengers — are looking for lodgings during major disruptions, it’s not entirely uncommon for flight attendants to struggle to obtain a hotel room for themselves. Even if rooms are available, it can take hours to get in touch with someone from the airline hotel team. That means they just end up sleeping on the plane, in airport chairs, in the crew lounge (if there is one at the airport), or on the floor, as stranded passengers do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I&#8217;ve had to actually pay for other [flight attendant’s] rooms before,” says Kimbrough. Newer flight attendants in particular may not have a few hundred dollars in the bank to drop on a hotel room, and a full reimbursement isn’t necessarily guaranteed. Norris says that until recently, Delta capped reimbursements at $200 per night. Now, it reimburses up to a “reasonable amount.” (The company told Vox that receipts should be submitted for reimbursement for any out-of-pocket hotel costs but did not clarify whether it only reimbursed up to a “reasonable amount.”) Sometimes, Hank says, pilots at Southwest end up paying for a room on behalf of flight attendants, as she says they seem to have an easier time getting reimbursed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When a flight attendant times out, they are supposed to rest in a hotel room, not kick back in the crew lounge at the airport or get shut-eye on the floor. The Delta AFA organizing committee is hoping that, once they’re negotiating their first union contract, they’ll get a minimum of 10 hours of legal rest with “nine hours behind the actual hotel room door,” says Norris.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why the CrowdStrike delay was worse for Delta passengers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s still not clear why Delta was hit hardest by the CrowdStrike outage in late July, taking almost a week to recover when other carriers bounced back within <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/air-travel-delays-continue-though-most-airlines-have-recovered-from-global-tech-outage/\">two to three days</a>. One factor that might have impacted Delta is that its computers had to be <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/delta-days-restore-normal-service-after-crowdstrike-outage/story?id=112299966\">manually fixed and restarted</a> instead of being done remotely. That took a lot of time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the Delta AFA organizing committee suspects there’s another reason that contributed: a lack of staff on the airline’s crew scheduling team. “Right now, we have the fewest amount of schedulers of any of the major carriers,” says Norris. Crew schedulers are the people who assign flight attendants to specific flights, communicate with them about delays, and make reassignments when there are irregular operations. It’s impossible to solve delays without a robust crew-scheduling system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The committee estimates that there are as few as <a href=\"https://deltaafa.org/news/where-plan-ed\">53 crew schedulers</a> at the airline, while at United there are about 120, and at American there are about 200. Delta has about <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2024/02/16/labor-hero-shawn-fain-backs-flight-attendant-union-at-delta-detroit-hub/\">28,000</a> flight attendants, a little more than <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2023/11/30/after-lost-year-for-contracts-american-and-united-flight-attendants-look-to-2024/\">American and United</a>. Taylor Garland, communications director at the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, notes that United and American have more crew schedulers because their flight attendant unions pushed for more staff. “That is a really, really critical backbone infrastructure team,” says Garland.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without an adequate scheduling team, an airline can lose track of where their crew is and where they could best be rerouted, which is exactly what happened to Norris.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>In all, Norris was “lost” to the crew tracking system for about 40 hours</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On July 19, the first day of the CrowdStrike outage, Norris recalls how hard it was to get in touch with crew tracking at Delta. She showed up to the airport and was told that her scheduled flight couldn’t leave because the airline didn’t have any pilots who were “legal” to work at the time — as in, they hadn’t gotten the required amount of rest between flights. In all, Norris was “lost” to the crew tracking system for about 40 hours and ended up being unable to work one of her trips.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When asked about Delta’s crew scheduling staff numbers, a spokesperson said that its “scheduler process is not comparable to others as their crew assignments are not built out the same way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When there are waves of delays messing up flight assignments and leaving some flight attendants stranded far from where they’re needed, airlines call on a team of reserves — often early-career flight attendants — to jump in. When disruptions last for days, though, those reserves can dry up. Carriers offer higher pay to incentivize off-duty flight attendants to pick up extra flights during such times, but even so, some turn down the offers because of the possibility of ending up stranded without a hotel room during the disruption, says Kimbrough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If airlines want fewer, shorter flight delays, they need to beef up their support staff. This staff “is not seen but is crucial to getting flight attendants and pilots in the correct places,” Garland says. They should also be quicker to offer incentives for flight attendants picking up extra shifts when irregular operations occur.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of us have groused about how much more frustrating and conflict-ridden air travel feels today compared to before the pandemic. The percentage of flights that are delayed these days isn’t all that much higher compared to pre-2019, but there are more fellow travelers to bump shoulders with, and there’s been a huge spike in the number of “<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/unruly\">unruly passenger</a>” reports since 2019, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The aviation industry is more fragile now, in part because of how many experienced workers left during Covid-19. <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2020/04/30/39000-american-airlines-workers-take-early-retirement-leave-or-reduced-hours-in-face-of-covid-19-pandemic/\">Tens of thousands</a> of pilots and flight attendants were laid off or retired early in 2020, when there was virtually no demand for air travel. By mid-2020, over <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/business/delta-posts-billion-loss-cites-staggering-pandemic-impact/8XIEEs2ntPd9uWDvuGS8ZK/\">17,000 Delta employees</a> had left the company. In the past few years, airlines have rushed to hire <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2023/05/08/airline-hiring-booming-summer-travel/\">thousands of new pilots and flight attendants</a>. A lot of institutional knowledge has been lost; it also means that a greater number of flight attendants we see today are making the lower end of the pay scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The flight attendants Vox spoke to implored passengers not to take their frustrations about delays out on them. “We are sometimes in the exact same situation as you, with a canceled flight, no way to get back,” says Kimbrough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, September 4, 9:45 am ET:</strong> Taylor Garland&#8217;s name was misstated in a previous version of this post.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Local governments have been putting fluoride in city water supplies for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/01/dayintech-0125/\">nearly 80 years</a>. In many ways, its addition has been a remarkable public health success: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drinking fluoridated water <a href=\"https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/oral-health/fast-facts-oral-health/fluoride-prevent-decay.html#:~:text=According%20to%20CDC%2C%20drinking%20water,reduces%20tooth%20decay%20by%2025%25.\">reduces tooth decay by 25 percent</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in late August, the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) published a long-awaited <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fluoride-water-brain-neurology-iq-0a671d2de3b386947e2bd5a661f437a5\">report</a> declaring, with “moderate confidence,” that drinking water with elevated fluoride levels is linked to lower IQ in children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fluoride in our drinking water has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY\">inspired conspiracy theories</a> for generations. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is also a prominent anti-vaxxer and Covid-19 skeptic, is one of the most <a href=\"https://fluoridealert.org/content/rfk-jr-michael-connett-fluoride-lawsuit/\">vocal proponents</a> of banning fluoridation to protect children from neurodevelopmental problems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, though, isn’t a conspiracy theory. Scientists have spent decades <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11571/fluoride-in-drinking-water-a-scientific-review-of-epas-standards\">trying to figure out</a> what level of fluoride strikes the best balance between oral health and healthy brain development. The NTP’s new <a href=\"https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride\">324-page report</a> reviews results from over 500 experiments, lending more weight to the idea that fluoride can be connected to brain problems than, say, a single fraudulent, <a href=\"https://time.com/5175704/andrew-wakefield-vaccine-autism/\">now-retracted study</a> linking vaccines to autism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Science is a frustratingly non-linear process. Facts that seemed unquestionable a decade ago can be overturned by new data at any moment. If you’ve never thought about fluoride outside of the dentist’s office, hearing that it might have neurotoxic effects could be confusing, scary, or infuriating. Why is fluoride still in our water and toothpaste, then?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not because dentists and scientists are lying to us (although <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/368350/scientific-research-fraud-crime-jail-time\">sometimes they do</a>). It’s because finding the whole, unshakable truth is a never-ending process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, don’t throw out your toothpaste and stockpile bottled water just yet. Here’s what the science says (and doesn’t say) about fluoride and the brain.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why does the government want us to drink fluoride?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fluoride is a mineral found naturally in soil, water, and things we consume, like <a href=\"https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/fluoride/\">brewed tea and shellfish</a>. It’s also in the toothpaste most of us use. Fluoride <a href=\"https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/oral-health/brush-oral-health/understanding-how-fluoride-helps-prevent-repair-tooth-decay\">strengthens our enamel</a> and prevents cavities. It’s about more than maintaining pearly white teeth; left untreated, <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10946-cavities\">tooth decay</a> leads to severe infection, which can spread throughout the entire body.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the turn of the 20th century, dental researchers noticed that many people living near high-fluoride water sources had splotches on their teeth, a condition called fluorosis. Once scientists began <a href=\"https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/fluoride/the-story-of-fluoridation\">studying the effects of fluoride on dental health</a>, they realized that, while fluoride can damage teeth and bones at high concentrations, drinking water with low levels of fluoride actually prevents tooth decay. Today, many cities add a small amount of fluoride to their tap water — about 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But around 1.9 million people in the US live in areas where <a href=\"https://undark.org/2024/05/06/tap-water-high-dose-of-fluoride/\">tap water naturally contains more fluoride</a> than the government recommends, according to the report. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.twdb.texas.gov/groundwater/aquifer/majors/ogallala.asp\">Ogallala Aquifer</a>, which provides water for West Texas, is infused with fluoride-rich volcanic ash, bringing its <a href=\"https://nccd.cdc.gov/DOH_MWF/Default/Default.aspx\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://nccd.cdc.gov/DOH_MWF/Default/Default.aspx\">fluoride concentrations</a> up to a whopping 5 mg/L.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The report linked fluoride levels of 1.5 mg/L — about twice the level <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547570/\">recommended by federal health officials</a> — with lower IQ in children. According to the NTP, more research is needed to figure out whether there are also risks associated with higher levels of fluoride for adults, or with the lower concentrations the government recommends.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While these findings have been reproduced enough times to be worth taking seriously, the science of intelligence — including the concept of IQ itself — is questionable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Measuring brain development is complicated&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measuring brain function isn’t straightforward. After all, the brain has many functions: keeping the body alive, helping us walk and talk, guiding our learning and decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More than 70 of the 100 human studies reviewed by the NTP specifically looked at children’s IQ as a proxy for brain development — IQ tests are easier and cheaper to run than, say, brain scans or full neurological exams. Of those 72 IQ-related studies, only 19 were flagged by the NTP as having a low risk of bias, controlling for factors like socioeconomic status, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641149/\">which could also contribute</a> to differences in IQ scores. Only a handful of those 19 studies were conducted in North America, and none in the US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, critically, none of these human studies tell us anything about how fluoride changes the brain at a biological level. Even studies in lab animals and cells did not identify how fluoride might affect learning, memory, or intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;IQ scores also only capture an incomplete picture of early childhood brain development and are tangled up in a number of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3270016/\">socioeconomic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/jason-richwine-race-iq-genetics-095765\">racial,</a> and <a href=\"https://nrcgt.uconn.edu/newsletters/winter052/\">cultural</a> factors beyond how much fluoride someone is exposed to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/pov/films/refrigeratormothers/\">mothers were blamed</a> for their children’s cognitive disabilities. Redirecting that blame to environmental factors like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684109/autism-vaccines-treatment-cure-bleach\">MMR vaccines</a> — or, say, fluoridated water — can give parents a sense of control over scary-sounding diagnoses. A 2017 <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/does-fluoride-drinking-water-lower-iq-question-looms-large-court-battle#:~:text=The%20fluoride%20lawsuit%20is%20the,a%20%E2%80%9Cscientifically%20defensible%20basis.%E2%80%9D\">federal lawsuit</a> calling on the EPA to ban water fluoridation already has the <a href=\"https://fluoridealert.org/content/rfk-jr-michael-connett-fluoride-lawsuit/\">enthusiastic support of high-profile anti-vaxxers</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The trial hinges on the results of NTP’s final report, a draft of which was originally presented over a year ago. The drawn-out legal battle has been <a href=\"https://undark.org/2024/03/06/fluoride-drinking-water/\">messy</a>, with dental health advocates obstructing fluoride research and <a href=\"https://fluoridealert.org/content/national-toxicology-program-finds-no-safe-level-of-fluoride-in-drinking-water-water-fluoridation-policy-threatened/\">denying the NTP’s findings</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the court decides fluoride poses health risks that outweigh its benefits, it could end water fluoridation in the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid scientific uncertainty and political shadiness, it’s hard to know what to believe.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who should I believe? What should I do?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, the NTP has simply determined “with moderate confidence” that there is a correlation between higher fluoride exposure and lower IQ in children — specifically, IQs 2 to 5 points lower.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s hard to know how we would measure the differences in lived experiences based on a few IQ points.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re concerned about your family’s fluoride exposure, you can check your tap water’s fluoride levels on the CDC’s <a href=\"https://nccd.cdc.gov/DOH_MWF/Default/SearchByWaterSystem.aspx\">My Water’s Fluoride page</a>. If you happen to live somewhere with levels above around 1.5 mg/L, your tap water crosses the threshold of neurodevelopmental concern. No need to switch to bottled water, though; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-under-sink-water-filter/\">home water purifiers</a> can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793412/\">filter fluoride out completely</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To make sure you don’t throw out the oral health benefits of fluoride with the bathwater, keep using fluoride toothpaste for those <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6804a3.htm#:~:text=However%2C%20ingestion%20of%20too%20much,toothpaste%20at%20age%202%20years.\">over the age of 2</a> (just don’t swallow it).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if you’re still fluoride-skeptical, you can order some <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/07/toothpaste-fluoride-hydroxyapatite/679200/\">hydroxyapatite toothpaste</a> — which has similar cavity-preventive benefits — from Europe or Canada, where it’s been approved and endorsed by dental associations.<br><br><em>This story originally appeared in </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter\"><strong><em>Today, Explained</em></strong></a><em>, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter. </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup\"><strong><em>Sign up here for future editions</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Tim Walz celebrate during the Democratic National Convention on August 22, 2024, in Chicago. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/\">pulled slightly ahead</a> in national polls against former President Donald Trump. Still, the race is pretty tight, and it looks like it will remain that way until Election Day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite polling errors that <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/mistakes-to-avoid-polls.html\">overestimated</a> Democrats’ performance in the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, head-to-head polls are still the best signal of what the election outcome will be — though it’s important to keep in mind that no single poll will be exactly right, and that some polls have better methodologies than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But head-to-head polling isn’t the only way to gauge the state of play. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/index-of-presidential-election-indicators/\">Other</a> election <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/24490/key-election-indicators.aspx\">indicators</a> — ranging from approval ratings and sentiments among key groups of voters to economic measures and campaign spending — all provide crucial context about where the electorate and this campaign are headed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here are some factors beyond topline numbers that we think are especially crucial to help you gain a fuller understanding of the race.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Biden’s approval rating</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President Joe Biden may have stepped aside from the Democratic nomination, but that doesn’t mean he’s irrelevant: Biden’s approval rating is a proxy for how voters feel about his administration — one whose record Harris has for the most part defended.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It would be a worrying sign for Harris if that number — which already made Biden <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/12/biden-polling-drop-out/\">historically unpopular</a> before he dropped out — stagnates or goes down before the election.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That “would be a negative verdict on the incumbent administration, which she is part of,” said <a href=\"https://centerforpolitics.org/kyle-d-kondik/\">Kyle Kondik</a>, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter, at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “I wouldn’t take that as predictive on its own, but I do think the president’s approval rating still merits watching, even though he’s not a candidate anymore.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has so far managed to both take credit for Biden’s popular policies and decouple herself from his <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/14/kamala-harris-economy-inflation\">most unpopular</a> policies. Her approval rating is about 42 percent, up from about 38 percent when Biden dropped out on July 21, according to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a>. Biden, on the other hand, so far hasn’t gotten the kind of boost that many people thought he might after dropping out: His approval rating is only up <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">about 2 percentage points</a> to 41 percent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That number could be a liability for Harris because “Republicans are gonna do their damage to connect all of the unpopular things with Biden to Harris,” Kondik said. “It’s just the question of whether it works or not. I don’t think it’s worked yet.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/zB6P3-biden-s-approval-rating-could-reflect-on-harris.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,19.202340622113,100,61.595318755775\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Trump’s favorability rating</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For nine years now, more Americans have viewed Trump more unfavorably than favorably. But Trump&#8217;s favorability is also rising notably, suggesting that he has expanded his appeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That may be because the memory of his first term, when he was <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/01/18/trump-approval-rating-average-popularity/\">incredibly unpopular</a>, has faded somewhat in the public’s consciousness. What voters may remember fondly is that the economy was doing well under his presidency until the pandemic hit. Other voters may just like that he’s not Harris or Biden.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think to some degree, independents have less of a negative association with him now that he’s out of office and has been for a while, and they weren’t really happy with the Biden administration,” said <a href=\"https://split-ticket.org/author/lakshyajain97/\">Lakshya Jain</a>, a partner at the political forecasting firm Split Ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has maintained a strong base of support among Republicans, leveraging the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations\">numerous indictments</a> against him to make the case that he has been targeted as an anti-establishment candidate. He’s also made overtures to moderates, including by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/29/trump-measure-overturn-florida-six-week-abortion-ban-00176809\">somewhat dialing back</a> the restrictive Republican stance on abortion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, however, it would be wrong to say that Trump is popular.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I wouldn’t say he’s cracked through a massive ceiling on favorability, because his negatives are still [high],” Jain said. Indeed, they’re currently more than <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/\">10 percentage points higher</a> on average than his favorability ratings.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/dnhnN-trump-s-favorability-ratings-have-improved-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.050459661129,100,63.899080677743\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether these unfavorable numbers move as the campaign kicks into high gear in the fall and people get reacquainted with the former president remains to be seen. If they rise, that could signal trouble for Trump on Election Day.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The share of undecided voters in major battleground states</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polls in battleground states suggest that Harris and Trump are practically in a dead heat. That means even the few percent of voters who remain undecided could tip the scales one way or the other. Keeping an eye on these voters will be key to understanding what to expect in each of the swing states.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gwicK-undecided-voters-could-make-the-difference.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, it’s hard to assess what way they’re leaning: Because there are so few undecided voters, pollsters often can’t get an accurate read on how they’re feeling. Demographically, they tend to be a bit younger and more diverse than the rest of the electorate, and they also tend to skew a bit more female. All of that would “suggest that Kamala Harris would have more upside with them,” said <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/about/staff/david-wasserman\">David Wasserman</a>, senior editor and elections analyst at the Cook Political Report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that doesn’t mean Democrats should assume they now have an edge in swing states. These undecided voters also exhibit traits that might make them lean toward Trump. Wasserman said they are more distrustful of institutions and government, tend to work blue-collar jobs, have less than a four-year college degree, have broad dissatisfaction with the two-party system, and believe that the Biden administration has mishandled the economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These are cross-pressured voters who may not turn out to vote at all at the end of the day, but that is a group that we’re watching closely,” Wasserman said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Harris’s growth among key groups of voters&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has shown the potential to improve with groups of voters who Biden had struggled with and are projected to play a key role in the election — like independents, Hispanic voters, and infrequent voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That last group was of particular concern for Biden. When he was the nominee, some strategists suggested that higher turnout would hurt Democrats because infrequent voters were <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/meet-sporadic-voters-decide-2024-election-rcna158374\">less likely to support him</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There was an overwhelming sentiment among infrequent voters that Biden would not be able to fulfill his responsibilities for a second term, and for the first half of the year, Democrats were publicly in denial about that,” Wasserman said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But among registered voters who did not vote in 2020, Harris improved by 9 percentage points in New York Times/Siena College polls conducted <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html\">before</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/10/us/elections/times-siena-poll-pennsylvania-toplines.html\">after Biden dropped out</a>, suggesting that she has narrowed Trump’s advantage with that group. That growth suggests she has appeal with voters who aren’t hardcore partisans — and that she might have further opportunities for growth.   </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/E3UTl-harris-appears-to-be-gaining-among-key-voters.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.9156486329261,100,90.168702734148\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any significant movement among Black and Latino voters toward Trump is also notable and could prove decisive in certain swing states. In 2020, Trump made gains with Latinos not just in Florida and Texas, but <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/republican-latino-voters-donald-trump-pennsylvania-20240826.html\">also in Pennsylvania</a>. Black voters will play a key role in Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and some of them <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-polls-black-voters-donald-trump-national-polling-average-1942378\">appear to be moving toward Trump</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s lower-propensity Black voters who are open to voting for Trump, and they are not guaranteed to show up. But even so, if Trump wins 15 percent of the Black vote, that would likely be enough to tip Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania to the Republican column,” Wasserman said. “That means that Kamala Harris has to make it up somewhere else, and that’s hard.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/electoral-college-map?game-id=2024-PG-CNN-ratings&amp;game-view=map\">still win after losing those three states</a>, Harris would likely need to sweep the rest of the swing states and pick up a large state that Democrats have struggled in, like North Carolina.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, Kondik said that he is skeptical any shift among Black voters would be large, and that polling errors might be overstating the extent to which Black voters are supporting Trump. “I think that’s a mirage,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Second-quarter economic growth</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s a single issue most likely to determine the election, it’s probably the economy, which is at or near the top of issues that voters prioritize <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx\">across</a> multiple <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/economy-key-insights-data-and-solutions-inflation-recession-consumer-confidence-and-more\">polls</a>.<strong> </strong>The economy is also worth watching because it has previously had electoral significance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A key variable in Sabato’s Crystal Ball’s <a href=\"https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/time-for-change-model-predicts-close-election-with-slight-edge-for-kamala-harris/\">election forecasting model</a> is economic growth leading up to an election: specifically, second-quarter percent change in gross domestic product (GDP),<strong> </strong>the total value of goods and services produced in the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That change has “proven to be historically electorally important,” Kondik said. Sabato’s didn’t use it in their 2020 model because the pandemic contributed to a big downturn in economic growth that would have suggested Trump would lose in a landslide, which seemed unlikely — and indeed, he ended up losing what was a tight race.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s no reason to believe that this year is similarly exceptional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If there’s a big crash, the incumbent party almost always suffers some sort of penalty. This is kind of what doomed John McCain in 2008,” Jain said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/CI8kn-economic-growth-has-been-electorally-important-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.907343884777,100,62.185312230447\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Interest rates</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in mid-2022, increasing borrowing costs and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-conference-board-economy-spending-3dfae1c18dba90aaeba2b5a4e3ce9567\">dampening consumer confidence in the economy</a> through much of this year. The Fed’s goal was to get high inflation under control; now that inflation has cooled, the Fed is expected to finally <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-conference-board-economy-spending-3dfae1c18dba90aaeba2b5a4e3ce9567\">cut rates again in September</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/RsW6m-interest-rates-coming-down-could-help-harris-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.809066478228,100,66.381867043544\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A rate cut might not be a complete game-changer for Harris, especially since “a lot of the effect of the economy on the election is already ‘baked in’ at this late date” in that most people have already made up their minds about the Biden administration’s performance on the issue, said <a href=\"https://as.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/john-sides/\">John Sides</a>, political science professor at Vanderbilt University.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, it might give her more ammunition to fight off Republican attacks on Biden’s economic record. Not only would it provide some immediate relief to homeowners and homebuyers by bringing down mortgage interest rates, it would also signal that the Fed is willing to step in to help workers in a <a href=\"https://time.com/6287012/why-finding-job-is-difficult/\">tougher job market</a>. A rate cut would ease financial pressure on businesses that kept them from hiring as much as they were during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for high inflation and household debt and promised to reinstate “<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?537985-1/president-trump-delivers-remarks-potterville-michigan-economy\">the best economy in the history of our country</a>,” which he falsely<strong> </strong>claimed was during his first term. (His term saw an annual average of between <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=US\">2 and 3 percent GDP growth</a>, not counting the pandemic economy of 2020, while yearly GDP growth averaged nearly <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=US\">5 percent in the 1960s</a>.) That has proved persuasive among the majority of voters who <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-edge-over-harris-economy-crime-slips-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2024-08-27/\">prefer him to Harris</a> on the issue, but Harris has also closed that gap somewhat. Harris has argued that she and Biden inherited an economic mess from Trump and have largely managed to clean it up: inflation is down, growth has remained <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/u-s-economic-growth-revised-up-to-solid-3-percent-annual-rate-for-second-quarter-of-2024#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20U.S.,upgrade%20of%20its%20initial%20assessment.\">relatively strong</a>, and the labor market is still on <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555\">solid footing</a> despite a recent downturn in job growth, all without triggering a recession. However, it’s not clear how effective that argument is among consumers who are still struggling with higher prices and more debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In general, I think a rate cut would be a bit of welcome ‘good news’ for the Harris campaign that might help weaken the Trump campaign’s economic argument,” Sides said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The difference in Democratic and Republican spending in key states</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The amount of dollars spent in presidential elections by each party <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/364964/harris-trump-fundraising-donations-campaign-2024\">isn’t necessarily predictive</a> of election outcomes. Piles of cash can’t compensate for poor spending decisions or bad candidates. And there are diminishing returns on ad spending.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the difference in party spending in major battleground states can reveal something about which party has momentum where, and how competitive they perceive that state to be, Jain said. If one party is being outspent by the other in a particular state, that can indicate one of two things: either they think they already have it in the bag and don’t need to spend more, or they’ve backed off because it doesn’t seem winnable and are focusing their resources elsewhere. As of now, Republicans are being outspent in a few battlegrounds where Trump is <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/\">not</a> <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/wisconsin/\">polling</a> as <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/nevada/\">well</a> as Harris (though it’s very close).</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/M3D74-democrats-have-outspent-republicans-in-major-battleground-states-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.57955773139,100,46.84088453722\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond the major battlegrounds, it’s also important to pay attention to spending aimed at expanding the map for either Republicans or Democrats. Any money spent outside Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nebraska (which <a href=\"https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/nebraska-and-maine-split-their-electoral-vote-is-it-a-better-system-than-winner-take-all/\">allocates three of its five electoral votes</a> to whichever candidate wins the vote in its three electoral districts) might signal as much. Notably, it seems that both parties are planning to <a href=\"https://time.com/7009161/battleground-swing-states-2024-election/\">spend fairly heavily</a> in states including Texas and Florida this fall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That would suggest that Democrats see some path to victory in those traditionally Republican states that isn’t immediately obvious to observers lacking their internal polling, that they feel secure enough in other key states to spend money on long shots, or that they feel they have enough money to force the GOP to “waste” money on states that should be safe for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m really curious to see if there’s any heavy television spending in states other than the big seven, plus Nebraska,” Kondik said. “If money is spent in any other place, I’ll be interested in that. So, Republicans go on TV in Minneapolis, St. Paul, or Democrats go on TV this fall in Miami.” Such moves might indicate a party is feeling bullish about expanding the map.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Countries across North America, Europe, and Asia are <a href=\"https://evmagazine.com/articles/germany-builds-nationwide-fast-charging-network-for-evs\">expanding charger networks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-cut-electric-vehicle-costs-for-americans-and-continue-building-out-a-convenient-reliable-made-in-america-ev-charging-network/\">offering EV subsidies</a>; global EV sales are <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/electric-vehicle-sales-headed-for-record-year-but-growth-slowdown-puts-climate-targets-at-risk-according-to-bloombergnef-report/\">projected</a> to nearly triple by 2030, reaching 40 million vehicles annually.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The incipient wave of EV purchases raises a question: What will happen to the millions of gas-powered cars whose owners no longer want them?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The likely answer: Rather than scrapping used gas vehicles or selling them domestically, rich nations will dispatch them to developing countries where limited incomes and low levels of car ownership have created eager buyers for even older, substandard models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An influx of used gas cars would be a welcome development for those in the Global South who aspire to automobile ownership, a luxury that many in affluent countries take for granted. But it would undermine efforts to mitigate climate change, since shifting gas guzzlers from one country to another doesn’t lower global emissions. For developing countries themselves, a sharp increase in car ownership could amplify calls to build auto-reliant infrastructure, making it harder to construct the dense neighborhoods and transit networks that can foster more sustainable growth. And since these imported used cars would be fueled by gasoline, air quality would further decline in cities that are already choked with smog.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The world is in an era of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23920997/polycrisis-climate-pandemic-population-connectivity\">polycrisis</a>, facing concurrent challenges including climate change, toxic air, and extreme inequality. Difficult trade-offs are often inevitable. Such is the case with the thorny issue of what to do with the millions of gas cars that the rich world will discard as its fleets are electrified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Electrification is a necessary goal. And it’s natural for people in the developing world to desire the same luxuries that characterize middle-class comfort in wealthier countries. The question is how to manage a transition with enormous stakes that has largely been ignored. The experts who do pay attention are growing alarmed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m really worried that everything is going to be gas vehicles for many years, maybe decades,” said <a href=\"https://webapps.knust.edu.gh/staff/dirsearch/profile/summary/9a6c1c63db46.html\">Godwin Ayetor</a>, a senior lecturer in engineering at Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. “I’m worried about the health implications, and also the congestion. It’s already difficult to walk through Accra because of all the traffic, and the cars keep coming.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today’s steady flow of used cars into the Global South could become a torrent as the rich world electrifies. A deluge of gas vehicles would be a double-edged sword for low-income nations — and a risk to the planet.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How used cars move from rich nations to poor ones</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although it generates few headlines, a massive industry transports used cars across borders every day, with exporters collecting lower-quality models from dealers and wholesale auctions. Ayetor noted that colonial legacies are reflected in the trade flows: the UK, with its car cabins designed for drivers who keep to the left, tends to ship to former colonies like Kenya and Tanzania that still follow the same rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/used-vehicles-and-environment-global-overview-used-light-duty-vehicles-flow-scale\">a report issued in June</a> by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), some 3.1 million used cars were exported in 2022, up from 2.4 million in 2015. Most come from Japan, Europe, and the United States. (In the US, <a href=\"https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles\">around 7 percent</a> of all cars no longer in use are sent abroad. The rest end up in junkyards where their parts and materiel are sold off.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">About one in three exported used vehicles is destined for Africa, followed by Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Imported models often dominate local auto sales, since international carmakers send few new vehicles to the Global South and rarely establish production facilities there. (In sub-Saharan Africa, only South Africa has local factories.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The developing world’s demand for cars is robust, in large part because comparatively few people own one. According to <a href=\"https://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/Total-World-vehicles-in-use-2020.pdf\">one 2020 estimate</a>, the US had 860 cars for every 1,000 residents, while South Africa had 176, Morocco 112, and Nigeria just 56. Meanwhile, growing populations provide a steady supply of new potential customers. Africa is home to all of the world’s 20 <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/population-growth-rate/country-comparison/\">fastest-growing countries</a>, with Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, and Uganda expanding their populations by at least 3 percent per year. (For comparison, the US population is growing at a 0.67 percent rate).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As long as their price is right, aged or damaged used cars will be snapped up in the Global South. Many vehicles shipped from abroad have been in crashes, stripped of parts, or manufactured decades ago, when emissions and safety rules were more lax. A <a href=\"https://www.ilent.nl/binaries/ilt/documenten/leefomgeving-en-wonen/stoffen-en-producten/chemische-stoffen-en-mengsels/rapporten/used-vehicles-exported-to-africa/Used+vehicles+exported+to+Africa.pdf\">2020 study</a> by the government of the Netherlands found that most Dutch used cars sent to Africa lacked a roadworthiness certificate; many were manufactured over 20 years ago. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Old cars mean old technologies,” said Ayetor, “and old technologies means they don’t have modern systems to reduce the impact of the emissions before they leach out into the atmosphere.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wealthy countries have generally turned a blind eye to the shoddy quality of used cars sent overseas; they are profitable transactions for domestic businesses and the risks are largely borne elsewhere. “Most countries do not impose significant restrictions on trading unroadworthy or highly polluting vehicles,” concluded a <a href=\"https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles\">recent study</a> by the International Transport Forum, the transportation arm of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The receiving countries can also take a laissez faire approach. About half the 146 nations examined by UNEP do not regulate used car age or quality. Others have adopted policies such as barring used car imports outright (<a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2024-05-22-illegally-imported-used-cars-cost-sa-and-the-consumer-dearly/#:~:text=SA%20outlaws%20the%20importation%20of,Kia%20SA%20CEO%20Gary%20Scott.\">as in South Africa</a>), banning older cars (<a href=\"https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/WP.29-187-17e.pdf\">as in Kenya</a>, where imported vehicles must be less than eight years old), and scaling import tax rates with the age of the vehicle (<a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/ghana-customs-valuation-used-vehicles\">as in Ghana</a>). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adjacent nations may have different import rules, however, which creates loopholes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What happens is that vehicles are exported to one country, and then they go to neighboring countries as well,” said Joseph Mashele, who was an automotive regulator in South Africa before recently joining Jaguar Land Rover.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Case in point: Despite South Africa’s official ban on used cars, tens of thousands still <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2024-05-22-illegally-imported-used-cars-cost-sa-and-the-consumer-dearly/#:~:text=SA%20outlaws%20the%20importation%20of,Kia%20SA%20CEO%20Gary%20Scott.\">arrive annually</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Really shady cars make it into emerging economies, because there is still a market for them,” said Andreas Kopf, an author of the ITF’s recent report. His team found that roughly a quarter of used cars sent to the developing world adhere to emissions standards that are at least 21 years old.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of these cars lack modern safety features and pollution controls that are commonplace in newer vehicles made in wealthier countries. That is a particular concern in Africa, which despite its low level of car ownership still has the world’s highest rates of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries\">road deaths</a> and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/02-05-2018-9-out-of-10-people-worldwide-breathe-polluted-air-but-more-countries-are-taking-action#:~:text=The%20highest%20ambient%20air%20pollution,Africa%20and%20the%20Western%20Pacific.\">some of its dirtiest air</a>, according to the World Health Organization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, the developing world’s voracious appetite for used cars has caught the attention of senior leaders in China, an <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/china-has-become-an-electric-vehicle-export-behemoth-how-should-the-us-and-eu-respond/\">emerging colossus</a> of automotive manufacturing. Until 2019, China banned the export of used vehicles, focusing instead on supplying its burgeoning domestic market. Now those restrictions have been removed, and the Chinese government is <a href=\"https://m.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bnjg/202110/20211003211557.shtml\">actively promoting</a> the used car trade because it can attract foreign currency and stoke domestic demand for automaking heavyweights like BYD and Geely. By sending older gas-powered cars out of the country, China can also nudge residents to buy new EVs, which the government favors with <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/blogs/trustee-china-hand/chinese-ev-dilemma-subsidized-yet-striking\">subsidies</a> and a recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-19/china-cash-for-clunkers-to-fuel-26-billion-more-electric-vehicle-sales?utm_source=fot.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trucks-fot-buffalo-cruise-uber-auriga&amp;_bhlid=ca393710e3b76fcad69280e33e2e5885a425e60a\">cash-for-clunkers program</a> that provides money to those trading in an older-model car.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can just pull existing internal combustion engine cars out of your fleet, and then you stimulate new sales,” Kopf said. “This is what they are doing in China.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although China exported <a href=\"https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles\">only 40,000 used cars in 2022</a>, that figure is expected to skyrocket. According to the ITF’s analysis, Chinese used car exports may total <a href=\"https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles\">8 million vehicles annually</a> within the next decade, more than double current trade flows from Europe, East Asia, and North America combined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, China’s future trade in used cars could be dwarfed by a tsunami of gas vehicles set to depart the wealthy world. Its cause: Electrification.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Electrification will push even more vehicles to the developing world</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With privately owned automobiles responsible for <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/transport/cars-and-vans\">about 10 percent</a> of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/carbon-pollution-transportation\">more than twice that share</a> in the US), wealthy nations are rightly moving to electrify their vehicles as quickly as possible. The European Union, for instance, has <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/digest/eu-gas-car-phaseout-2035#:~:text=Around%20a%20quarter%20of%20EU,%2C%20Romania%2C%20and%20Italy%20abstained.\">committed</a> to ending the sales of gas-powered cars by 2035, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-to-phase-out-gasoline-powered-cars-bucking-toyota-chief-11608887640\">around the same time</a> as Japan. In the US, the Biden administration has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html\">vowed</a> that a majority of new cars will be all-electric or hybrid by 2032.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In May, electric and hybrid vehicles represented a little less than <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-electric-car-sales-drop-may-german-demand-slumps-industry-says-2024-06-20/#:~:text=Electrified%20vehicles%20%2D%20fully%20electric%20models,to%2029.9%25%20from%2025%25.\">half</a> of new car sales in the European Union and under <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/percentage-of-electric-cars-in-us.html#:~:text=If%20we're%20talking%20about,1.6%20percentage%20points%20from%202022.\">7 percent</a> in the US. But as electrification ramps up, the Global North’s demand for gas cars — including used ones — will wane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The total number of cars in rich countries is relatively constant,” said Kopf. “That means that if an EV is entering the fleet, a combustion engine is leaving.” With fewer people shopping for a used gas car within rich countries, more will likely be sent abroad — potentially a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Norway, the world’s most aggressive adopter of EVs, provides a preview of what’s to come. With the government providing an array of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23939076/norway-electric-vehicle-cars-evs-tesla-oslo\">generous incentives</a>, Norwegians have gone all-in on electric models, which comprise <a href=\"https://alternative-fuels-observatory.ec.europa.eu/general-information/news/norwegian-ev-market-surges-915-market-share-setting-sustainable-example#:~:text=7%20April%202024-,Norwegian%20EV%20Market%20Surges%20to%2091.5%25%20Market%20Share%2C%20Setting%20a,from%2091.1%25%20the%20previous%20year.\">over 90 percent</a> of new car purchases. <a href=\"https://elbil.no/om-elbil/elbilstatistikk/elbilbestand/\">Around one in four cars</a> on the road in Norway is now electric, compared to <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/how-many-electric-cars-in-us.html\">under 2 percent</a> in the US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Norway’s EV embrace has triggered a veritable explosion in exports of used gas vehicles: They more than <a href=\"https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles\">quadrupled</a><em> </em>in the decade from 2012 to 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As other rich nations electrify their own fleets, ITF’s Kopf said he anticipates “similar behavior” to what Norway has experienced. If <a href=\"https://sustmob.org/PCFV/LightDutyVehicles_Report_June2024.pdf\">used car exports</a> in Europe, East Asia, and North America match Norway’s trajectory, those regions would collectively ship 12 million gas vehicles per year, on top of the potentially 8 million coming from China. A total of 20 million used gas cars exported annually to developing nations would be seven times greater than current levels. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That would be welcome news for those in lower-income nations who yearn to own their own car, since the laws of supply and demand predict that a growing supply of used vehicles would lower their market price. Ayetor said that “a lot of Africans are hoping” that such a scenario unfolds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/people/jane-akumu\">Jane Akumu</a>, a Nairobi-based transport expert at UNEP, said that used car buyers in the Global South should be careful what they wish for, because aged models may not be the bargain that they appear. “If you are importing 20-year-old cars, you have to bring in an equal shipment of parts, because they will break down so quickly,” she told me, noting that immobile cars can clog motorways, thickening traffic as well as smog.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Theoretically, an influx of used cars could reduce emissions and breakdowns if newer, cleaner vehicles were displacing the older and dirtier models currently in use. But no one I spoke with expects that to happen. Instead, imported gas guzzlers would be added to the existing fleet — increasing total pollution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A new used car is not going to replace an older one; it&#8217;s just going to be absorbed,” Kopf said. “So you&#8217;ll have the 30-year-old car running around, plus the new 10-year-old car.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.2.4.58\">2010 study</a> of used cars shipped from the US to Mexico supports his point: The authors found that although imported cars were cleaner than the average Mexican car, their arrival still increased total emissions because they added to, rather than supplanted, the preexisting vehicle fleet.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The world needs a plan to adapt</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The risks of aged, polluting cars sent abroad will not be borne by the Global South alone. Climate change is a planetary phenomenon; driving a gas guzzler produces the same amount of emissions in Lusaka as it would in London or Los Angeles. Reducing greenhouse gasses requires reducing total vehicle emissions, not just shifting their location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an ideal world, electrification would enable the rich world to scrap its most decrepit gas cars. Instead, wealthy nations are likely to ship them to poorer countries, which will be left to figure out what to do when even the most <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2KTPmrT8xY\">MacGyver-like</a> mechanics cannot keep them running.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“All of your worst vehicles end up here,” Ayetor said. “When we want to get rid of the vehicle, what do we do?” No wealthy nations currently screen exported vehicles to weed out those that flunk basic quality tests, Kopf said. But that may soon change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The European Union is now <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_3819\">considering new regulations</a> that would prohibit exporting “<a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/end-life-vehicles_en\">end of life</a>” vehicles, requiring that cars shipped abroad obtain a certificate confirming their roadworthiness. Its adoption would be a “game-changer,” according to UNEP’s Akumu. (She and Kopf said they know of no comparable proposals under consideration in North America.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Mashele noted that export controls provide only a partial solution. “Sometimes things happen in transit,” he said, “and certain equipment has been tampered with or removed,” making the vehicle more polluting or dangerous upon arrival than when leaving its port of origin. He wants to see stricter emissions and safety checks in the Global South, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those countries have a lot of policy work to do. <a href=\"http://sustmob.org/PCFV/LightDutyVehicles_Report_June2024.pdf\">In 2023</a> the UNEP gave 57 developing nations a rating of “weak” or “very weak” for their vehicle import rules, with the bulk of them in Africa. But the UNEP did note some progress, such as the five East African countries that in 2022 <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/events/workshop/east-africa-sub-region-becomes-second-sub-region-africa-adopt-euro-4iv-equivalent\">required</a> imported vehicles to adhere to the EU’s Euro 4 emissions standards, which were introduced in 2006. That move followed a <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/west-african-ministers-adopt-cleaner-fuels-and-vehicles-standards\">similar one in 2021</a> by a bloc of 15 West African countries, which stipulated that imported used cars follow Euro 4 and be less than 10 years old. Syncing such rules can prevent importers from circumventing countries with strong regulations by shipping to their less stringent neighbors instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even if strict vehicle standards are applied universally, the number of used gas cars flowing into the developing world is still poised to rise as the rich world electrifies. As the ranks of car owners in the Global South expand, many are likely to demand new roads to drive on and more places to park. Bowing to such requests will be risky.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A century ago, American leaders built highways and reconfigured cities to accommodate the automobile, in the process locking the country into car-oriented development that has lengthened commutes, increased emissions, and undermined city life. The automobile’s dominance has also raised the cost of living: The average American spends <a href=\"https://itdp.org/2024/01/24/high-cost-transportation-united-states/#:~:text=According%20to%202023%20European,than%20the%20average%20American%20household.\">16 percent</a> of their income on transportation in 2020, 5 percentage points higher than those in the denser and more transit-rich nations of the European Union.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">UNEP’s Akumu is already concerned by what she is seeing in Kenya. A few years ago, she said, nearly half of Nairobi’s children walked to school. But “that number keeps going down, because when you graduate in income, you want to own a car.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As incomes in the Global South grow, density and robust transit service could make driving an option rather than a necessity. For example, South Korea and Taiwan became wealthy nations in the latter half of the 20th century, and both built excellent mass transportation systems. <a href=\"https://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/Total-World-vehicles-in-use-2020.pdf\">In 2020</a>, their rates of car ownership (458 per 1,000 people in South Korea and 344 per 1,000 in Taiwan) were far below the US (860 per 1,000).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Investing in multimodal infrastructure now could help lower-income countries avoid the planning mistakes that the US made a century ago. Many residents of the Global South are understandably eager to purchase their first motor vehicle, but “we need to make sure that an influx of cars does not displace a potential buildup of public transportation,” Kopf said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A number of such projects are currently in the works, including new subways in <a href=\"https://societegenerale.africa/en/societe-generale-africa/news/news-details/news/abidjans-metro-line-1-the-biggest-public-transport-infrastructure-project-in-sub-saharan-africa/#:~:text=The%20Abidjan%20Metro%20Line%201,improve%20environmental%20and%20social%20conditions.\">Abidjan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stm.group/en/stm-celebrates-algiers-metro-milestone/\">Algiers</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.railwaygazette.com/passenger/kinshasa-urban-train-aims-to-improve-transport-in-fast-growing-city/63666.article\">urban rail network</a> in Kinshasa. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.tanzaniainvest.com/sgr#:~:text=According%20to%20comments%20made%20by,currently%20in%20the%20testing%20phase.\">Tanzania</a> is revamping its rail system, while Botswana and Namibia are building a <a href=\"https://tkrpmo.com/\">Trans-Kalahari Railway</a>. As World Bank transport researchers argued in <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/transport/investing-in-rail-can-help-put-african-cities-on-a-more-sustaina\">a recent blog post</a>, “investing in rail can help put African cities on a more sustainable track,” noting that many existing tracks could be adjusted to ferry people as well as goods.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, that would be the wisest strategy to manage an impending glut of used gas cars: ensure that people can flourish without one, regardless of where they live.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Harris currently leads national polls by about 3 <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\">percentage</a> <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">points</a> on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html\">average</a>, but the Electoral College is what actually determines the outcome. That means to win the presidency, Harris and Trump need to pick up as many swing states as possible. And as of midday Tuesday, state polling averages from publications like <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">Silver Bulletin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/\">Real Clear Politics</a>, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html\">New York Times</a> point to hair-raisingly tight contests in the most important swing states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wisconsin and Michigan are currently looking best for Harris: All four polling averages mentioned above agree she is narrowly ahead there, by about 1 to 3 percentage points. But those states would not be enough to give Harris an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/363256/kamala-harris-electoral-college-swing-state-polls\">Electoral College majority</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The state of play is murkier in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona, where the averages vary. Though some averages of these states show Harris very slightly ahead (by about 1 percentage point or less) in each of those, others show tied races (in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html\">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/nevada/trump-vs-harris\">Nevada</a>) or very narrow Trump leads (in <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">Arizona</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html\">Georgia</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the remaining swing state, North Carolina, Trump <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/north-carolina/\">leads polling averages</a> by a very tiny margin of less than 1 percentage point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only reasonable takeaway from polling like that is: the contest looks very close and neither candidate has gained a clear advantage.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Electoral College nitty-gritty</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The margins in all these swing states are extremely tight. Still, as one scenario for how election night could play out, let’s assume that, as the averages currently suggest, Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan and the other lean-blue states; Trump wins North Carolina and the lean-red states; and Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada are too close to call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This would place Harris at 251 electoral votes — 19 away from the 270 she needs to win. And she’d have two paths to get over the threshold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Path one would be to win Pennsylvania. Its 19 electoral college votes would be just exactly enough. (That’s why it’s the most important swing state.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Path two would be to win Georgia plus either Arizona or Nevada. Winning only the combo of Arizona and Nevada would not be enough, as that would provide Harris with 17 electoral votes. She’d need Georgia too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why it matters that all of these states — Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada — look so close. Tiny shifts in them could well determine the outcome. And neither candidate looks to lead comfortably in enough of them so far.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Harris’s lack of a big convention bounce understandable or ominous?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling averages tell you what the polling currently shows, but election forecasts, in theory, are supposed to do something extra: to anticipate via modeling how the race may change between now and Election Day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That has proven contentious in an election year that has, in the past few months, veered off into uncharted territory with Democrats’ late Biden-for-Harris swap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">FiveThirtyEight — under new management since founder Nate Silver departed last year&nbsp;— came under <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/why-i-dont-buy-538s-new-election\">much</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1813290593491018186\">criticism</a> earlier this summer, first due to its forecast model’s optimistic projections about Biden’s chances despite his bad polling, and second because the model <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/08/25/2024/538s-model-mystery\">remained offline</a> for a month after Biden quit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">G. Elliott Morris, who now runs FiveThirtyEight for ABC News, republished the model last week, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/538/538-adjusting-election-model-harris-versus-trump/story?id=112563822\">acknowledging</a> he had to make some significant changes to it. The old version of the model gave Biden a significant advantage for being the incumbent president and seemed to give that greater weight than new polling showing Biden struggling. Critics questioned whether it truly made sense to assume the unpopular, elderly president would get an “incumbent advantage” toward the end of the race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Silver is now publishing his own independent forecast at <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/why-i-dont-buy-538s-new-election\">Silver Bulletin</a>, and for most of August, the model aligned with polls, showing Harris as a slight favorite.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But beginning last Thursday, Silver Bulletin showed Trump taking a slight edge. As of midday Tuesday, it <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">gave Trump</a> a 56.7 percent chance to win the election. That’s despite Silver Bulletin’s polling averages showing Harris with narrow edges in most swing states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again,&nbsp;a forecasting model is not just a crude polling average, it’s also trying to anticipate how the race might change between now and the election. As Silver explained in <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-no-normal-in-this-election\">a recent post</a>, the model is dinging Harris in part because presidential nominees typically get a polling bounce after their convention and lose some of that advantage later on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris hasn’t gotten much of a bounce since the Democratic convention and she’s barely leading now, so if we assume she’s likely to lose a bit of ground later, that means Trump would have the edge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But again, is that a safe assumption? Harris optimists could make the case that she already got her “convention bounce” with the enormous press and public attention on her since Biden dropped out and she emerged as Biden’s replacement, so we shouldn’t necessarily have expected her polling to improve further after the convention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris pessimists could turn that logic around, saying that yes, her campaign has been in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/365148/kamala-harris-trump-polls-election-2024\">“honeymoon” phase</a> since she entered the race, but that the honeymoon is bound to end and she’s sure to experience more contentious periods of the race going forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, the next big moment that can reshape the election — and the polls — is coming soon: the Trump-Harris debate is on September 10, just one week away. And no one has a crystal ball for how that will go.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

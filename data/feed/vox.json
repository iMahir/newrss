Police have revealed little about the shooting so far, except to say that the suspected shooter is now in custody.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Please, let us get the facts that we need to make sure we get this right,” a local sheriff <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/04/us/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school\">said</a> at a news conference Wednesday, describing an investigation that was still in its early stages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the details will differ, many of the overarching themes of the Barrow County shooting are likely to sound familiar. The persistence of gun violence is one of the most tragic aspects of life in the United States. While mass shootings make up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000524/mass-shootings-rare\">just a small percentage of the large number of gun deaths</a> that happen in the United States every year, they are the most attention-grabbing and obvious manifestation of the country’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/353878/new-guns-us-violence\">unique problem of too many guns</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem of mass shootings will likely be with us as long as we have more guns than people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s no easy solution,” says <a href=\"https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/nagin-daniel\">Daniel Nagin</a>, a professor of public policy and statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. Nagin, who helped develop <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12484\">a series of evidence-based recommendations</a> for reducing mass shootings, says that “the sheer volume of firearms” circulating in the US, which are “far more lethal than they were in the past,” make the notion of eliminating mass shootings altogether — commonly defined as a shooting where four or more people are shot — seem distant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t yet know who the Georgia shooter was, and what may or may not have motivated them. And while each mass shooting has unique circumstances, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to prevent mass shootings. “One of the big stereotypes, or myths we have about mass shootings in general, is that perpetrators who do this go crazy and just snap,” says Mark Follman, author of the book <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/trigger-points-mark-follman?variant=39402950131746\"><em>Trigger Points: Inside the Mission to Stop Mass Shootings in America</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/author/mark-follman/\">an editor</a> at Mother Jones. “That’s not the reality at all of how this works.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two broad approaches that can help mitigate the threat of mass shootings: proactive efforts to identify threats in advance, performed by behavioral threat assessment teams; and targeted gun regulations like red flag laws and bump stock bans.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Identifying the threat</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mass shootings are almost never random, according to Follman. The vast majority of mass shooters don’t spontaneously decide to pull out a gun in public and start shooting. Learning to identify who’s most at risk for committing mass violence, identifying warning signs and finding ways to intervene, can save lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s what <a href=\"https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources-and-podcasts/school-safety-and-crisis/systems-level-prevention/threat-assessment-at-school/behavior-threat-assessment-and-management-(btam)-best-practice-considerations-for-k%E2%80%9312-schools\">behavioral threat assessment teams</a> do. The process and composition of a team can differ in various contexts, <a href=\"https://ready.uic.edu/btat/\">including educational</a>, <a href=\"https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/threat-assessment-teams-workplace-and-school-violence-prevention\">corporate, and law enforcement</a> settings, but the general idea is the same: the teams receive information from community members about behavior that is concerning. The teams <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/making-prevention-a-reality.pdf/view\">investigate that behavior</a> to determine whether someone is at risk of committing mass violence. Then, depending on their conclusion, the team finds a way to reach out to the person and try to get them support before they commit an act of violence. That contact can happen at the person’s home, but it might also happen at work, school, or another community setting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s difficult to prove the efficacy of these interventions, because there’s no way to quantify the number of mass shootings that <em>didn’t </em>happen because someone got help. But experts and mental health advocates say the work has prevented people from carrying out violence, and Follman <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/10/mass-shootings-threat-assessment-shooter-fbi-columbine/\">has reported on cases</a> where law enforcement believes people were <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/aaron_stark_i_was_almost_a_school_shooter/transcript?subtitle=en\">successfully diverted</a> from committing acts of mass violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s very possible. There are many examples of successful threat cases where the case subjects have been diverted away from, in many cases, often very serious and developed plans for committing violence,” Follman says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Researchers have identified <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/stopping-mass-shooters-q-a-00035762\">several circumstances</a> shared by people who commit mass violence. They are almost (but not always) men, many of whom have suffered from some form of early childhood trauma or abuse. Most are suicidal. “The number of perpetrators who attempted suicide beforehand was astounding,” <a href=\"https://www.hamline.edu/faculty-staff/jillian-peterson\">Jillian Peterson</a>, a professor at Hamline University and co-founder of The Violence Project, a database of every mass shooting in the US since 1966, <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/mass-shootings\">has said</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Peterson, who with her colleagues interviewed the small number of mass shooters who survived after committing violence, came to an important realization: that “nobody goes in planning to come out.” That insight is significant, she says, because it means that some of the same tools mental health professionals have to prevent suicides can help prevent mass shootings as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while those are common factors among mass shooters, they aren’t the most helpful at determining risk — the vast majority of men, and people who are suicidal, don’t become mass shooters. Other behavioral indicators help investigators better identify who is most likely to commit mass violence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among the most important is a history of domestic violence. In 2021, <a href=\"https://injepijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40621-021-00330-0\">researchers found</a> that a majority of mass shootings were domestic violence-related. “A substantial fraction of mass shootings are not these killings of strangers in public places, but they occur in ongoing domestic disputes,” says Nagin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://health.ucdavis.edu/vprp/ourteam/index.html\">Garen Wintemute</a>, the founding director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at University of California Davis, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/369441/political-violence-2024-election\">an expert in mass shootings and political violence</a>, says that “intervening on people involved in intimate partner violence at whatever level of severity likely has a role in preventing mass shootings and many other bad things down the road.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Researchers have identified other behaviors common in mass shooters: a sudden increase in, interest in, or purchases of guns and ammunition, and increased interest in previous mass shooters. A would-be mass shooter also often makes bizarre <a href=\"https://drreidmeloy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-Studying-mass-shooters-words-Warning-behavior-prior-to-attacks.pdf\">or threatening comments</a> in the lead-up to a shooting, indicating to those close to him, or to a community online, that he intends to do something violent — a phenomenon researchers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/02/1210266306/a-former-fbi-profiler-explains-how-leakage-can-warn-of-a-mass-shooting\">call leakage</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When a behavioral threat assessment team has identified someone at risk, the next step is to come up with a plan to help. It often involves the person’s family or friends, and can entail direct contact with the person of concern. “The ideal of this work is with both empathy and concern,” Follman says. “And then coming up with a plan to intervene and try to help, which is also based on specific information gathered about that person from the person themselves and the people around them. What does this person need? What can we do to help move them away from where they are now to a better place?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The goal is to make the person less isolated and angry, and to attempt to ease the grievances that might be making them feel violent. Every treatment plan looks different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s not like there’s a simple menu and you pick one thing and then the switch flips and everything’s fine. That’s not how threat management works,” Follman says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, in-school threat assessment teams are required in <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/law/school-threat-assessment-teams/\">nine states</a>, not including Georgia — but experts say that more states should require them, and make sure they have the <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/law/school-threat-assessment-teams/\">resources they need to develop risk assessment strategies and track their results</a>. People who live in states without risk assessment teams can push their states to require them in schools and other government settings.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Finding gun regulations that help prevent mass shootings</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One appealing thing about behavioral threat assessment work is that it’s an intervention that can be done without butting head-first into the brick wall that is America’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/360742/someone-tried-to-assassinate-the-former-president-and-the-gop-still-wont-talk-about-guns\">intractable debate over gun control</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But make no mistake: a country <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\">with over 400 million guns in it</a>, and with gun regulation so lax that almost anyone can carry a gun in public whenever they want, makes the work of preventing mass shootings much more difficult.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, there are specific gun policies that can help prevent mass shootings and might be more politically feasible. Lawmakers and voters who care about reducing mass shootings have already helped push for their passage in states like New York, Florida, and California. For advocates who care about reducing mass shooting, they are a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most important legal tools available to prevent mass shootings is extreme risk laws, commonly referred to as red flag laws. The laws, <a href=\"https://www.everytown.org/solutions/extreme-risk-laws/\">currently in place in 21 states</a>, including several <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/more-states-adopting-gun-seizure-laws-after-parkland-tragedy\">after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in 2018</a>, allow both family members and law enforcement to petition courts to temporarily confiscate someone’s firearms if they believe the owner is at a risk of committing harm either to themselves or others. Red flag laws, Follman says, are “a relatively new gun policy that is very important and very useful to the field of threat assessment.”  Though critics have challenged the constitutionality of the laws, they have so far withstood <a href=\"https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/2024/04/litigation-highlight-new-york-state-appellate-court-upholds-red-flag-law\">legal challenges</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another common factor among mass shooters is their use of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/ar-15-force-mass-shootings/\">assault-style rifles</a>, known for their capacity to rapidly fire bullets and to kill or injure large numbers of people in a short amount of time. Though research has shown that assault weapons bans can <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13504851.2014.939367?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true\">meaningfully reduce</a> mass shooting deaths when they’re in effect, Republicans <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4345455-senate-republicans-block-assault-weapons-ban/\">blocked an assault weapons ban</a> when it came before Congress in December 2023, and polls show that while Americans <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/513623/majority-continues-favor-stricter-gun-laws.aspx\">generally favor more strict gun regulation</a>, they are <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042423/\">more divided</a> on the question of whether to ban assault weapons outright. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In part because of Republican opposition to regulating assault rifles, <a href=\"https://www.bradyunited.org/about-us/press/more-than-one-year-after-las-vegas-massacre-trump-administration-bans-bump-stocks\">gun safety advocates</a> have turned their focus to banning bump stocks as a more targeted and effective means of reducing mass shootings, and in 2018 the Trump administration took the rare step, for a GOP administration, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/18/politics/bump-stocks-ban/index.html\">of banning bump stocks</a> following a Las Vegas mass shooting. But the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/355399/supreme-court-bump-stocks-machine-guns-garland-cargill\">struck down the regulation</a> in June 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What happens next is an open question, and Republicans have been relatively quiet about the Supreme Court’s decision. But congressional action could be an important next step. As Justice Samuel Alito noted in his concurring opinion, Congress <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/bump-stock-vegas-shooting-supreme-court.html\">could pass a law banning bump stocks</a>, which would help limit the lethality of weapons used by mass shooters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that a Republican president was the first to ban bump stocks, and the regulation was relatively uncontroversial at the time, it’s not impossible to believe that Congress could make it happen. Similarly, Vice President Kamala Harris has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-parkland-guns.html\">urged states to adopt red flag laws</a>, and former President Donald Trump also <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/09/trump-promises-nra-that-if-elected-no-one-will-lay-a-finger-on-your-firearms-00140818\">previously expressed support for these laws</a>, despite the concern from gun rights advocates. Support from leaders of both major parties belies the notion that gun regulations that could counter mass shootings are completely off the table.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And though experts say passing those laws would have an impact, they are not the only thing that can be done. Family members and law enforcement in states that already have red flag laws <a href=\"https://foundation.gunresponsibility.org/faq-extreme-risk-protection-orders/\">can try to get the courts to intervene</a> if they’re worried about someone with guns. Individual community members, especially in the workplace and at school, can pay attention when someone seems to be leaking intentions of a mass shooting <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/18/us/mass-shooting-tips-what-to-do/index.html\">and report that behavior to the authorities</a>. The media can do their best <a href=\"https://niemanreports.org/articles/journalists-can-do-better-covering-mass-shootings/\">not to elevate the profiles of mass shooters,</a> which has been shown to inspire a copycat effect. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of all, Follman says, it’s important not to treat the problem as hopeless. Sometimes, he says, that can even encourage would-be shooters. “We have this national narrative about how this is never going to end and nothing ever really changes, and there’s nothing we can really do about it.” But understanding that mass shootings aren’t random, that they can be predicted and prevented, can help people understand what warning signs to look out for. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Despair and outrage,” he says, “is not a good way to think about the problem.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That sell-off is bad news for Nvidia, and it renews existing concerns about the strength of the AI sector and the US economy more broadly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That one company was able to have such an impact on global stock prices is a testament to Nvidia’s size and reach. Nvidia is the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/research/largest-companies-by-market-cap/\">third most valuable company in the world</a>. Because of its dominance, its success — or failure — can shift the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index, where it is listed. And because it’s so entangled with other tech companies, when it falls, so does the stock of its partners, like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which pulled down markets overseas. In the US, Nvidia pushed sell-offs throughout the entire tech industry. Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel shares were down as of Wednesday afternoon, though Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices saw gains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One of the big risks is that you have this market concentration, and all it takes is those names to be volatile, for it to feed through to the entire market,” Justin Onuekwusi, chief investment officer at investment firm St. James&#8217;s Place, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2024-09-04/\">told Reuters Wednesday</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Nvidia triggered this week’s stock market slump, there are a few other factors that have investors rattled. Recent concerns about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/business/chinas-gdp-q2.html\">China’s sluggish economy</a> are putting a damper on a wide array of businesses, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2024-09-04/\">an oil industry</a> already <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/opec-discussing-delay-planned-oil-output-hike-october-sources-say-2024-09-04/\">struggling with falling prices</a>. Weak manufacturing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-manufacturing-edges-up-august-8-month-low-trend-remains-weak-2024-09-03/\">in the US</a>, along with some higher prices in that sector, are part of the equation as well.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia’s troubles come amid rising uncertainty about the AI </strong>sector</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Investors have significant concerns about whether the US tech sector is headed in the right direction. Questions about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/357250/nvidia-stock-shareholder-ai-investor-market-capitalization-bubble\">whether Nvidia is overvalued</a>, and about the wisdom of investing so heavily in AI technology, have dogged the tech sector for months. Analysts from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-s-240-billion-swoon-leads-rout-in-semiconductor-stocks?sref=qYiz2hd0&amp;embedded-checkout=true\">JPMorgan Asset Management and Blackrock</a> cautioned earlier this week that massive spending on AI hasn’t been justified because the technology has limited applications outside the tech sector. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Companies like Microsoft and Meta have ignored that advice, spending <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation?sref=qYiz2hd0\">as much as 40 percent of their hardware budgets</a> —&nbsp;tens of billions of dollars — on Nvidia products to accelerate their own AI products. But that has investors worried that tech companies are betting too much on a future that may never come. And that if these giant companies have made a wrong bet, they may drag the stock market down with them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“[Tech companies are] all kind of saying, ‘Look, we’re not going to be on the wrong side of this. We’re going to invest,’” Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a global technology research and advisory firm, told Vox. “But I’m not hearing for what, or where this provides the return. And I think there’s a little bit of hesitation on [Wall Street] — people want to know where that return comes from.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this — from concerns about China’s economy to the strategy of tech companies — is swirling at a time when <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-dealing-rare-bifurcation-economy-030343116.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIulVkfy5LEz0MzxfuCu1WPFkVSeiEFPncoWzQcVsEXyU0zfWbMo6SH7WxvcUiMqE8vWxx-XfWHd2jTGnD1G_Xzu2KxazSAsigDVzGMgQzgfAmSLU5Qb4Cxg2NFmNKpWqChAgZJKW76OCt-aD4LiAp0E6rxBmiM7rEmQohSka8lQ\">some financial and economic experts</a> are warning the <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/other/rate-cuts-are-likely-to-be-too-little-too-late-bca/ar-AA1pYxqg\">US could be in danger of a recession</a>. And this week’s turmoil has only <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-080424/card/stocks-set-for-another-bad-day-as-economic-and-ai-worries-persist-x6ZyVzc1Wiy9BkG4h3hj\">intensified concerns </a>that these experts might be right.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does Nvidia’s slide mean for the economy?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no question that Wednesday’s sell-off is concerning, but it’s impossible to say now whether it can tell us anything about the danger of a recession.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stock market performance isn’t the only —&nbsp;or even the best — indicator of economic health. Stocks rebounded after last month’s early, volatile sell-off thanks to the news that the Federal Reserve would be lowering interest rates, making credit cheaper and hopefully making it easier for people to make big purchases and for businesses to hire and to make other investments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Fed is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter of a point at its meeting this month, which may help ease some recession fears. But that alone isn’t likely to make those concerns go away completely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the US isn’t currently in a recession —&nbsp;traditionally defined as negative gross domestic product growth over two successive quarters —&nbsp;there’s concern that one could still develop because of high inflation and high interest rates, which could curtail production and lead to higher joblessness rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nvidia’s fall from grace this week probably isn’t the ultimate indicator of whether the economy will go into a recession, and it may not even last that long. But it does say something about the markets’ dependency on the tech sector —&nbsp;and it’s only the latest reminder of how much uncertainty remains about the US economy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Two of the victims were students and two were teachers, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/us/winder-ga-shooting-apalachee-high-school/index.html\">GBI director Chris Hosey said in a news conference</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The shooting was the deadliest at a school in Georgia history, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/04/us/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting\">385 mass shootings in the United States in 2024</a>, including at Apalachee High School, following a <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting?year=2023\">near-record number</a> of mass shootings in 2023. No other high-income country has suffered such a high death toll from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22382180/supreme-court-uvalde-guns-violence-second-amendment-heller-scalia\">gun violence</a>. Every day, more than <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/\">120</a> Americans die at the end of a gun, including suicides and homicides, an average of 44,341 per year. According to the latest available analysis of data from 2015 to 2019,<strong> </strong>the US gun homicide rate was <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/\">26 times</a> that of other high-income countries; its gun suicide rate was nearly <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/\">12 times higher</a>. Mass shootings, defined as attacks in which at least four people are injured or killed excluding the shooter, have been on the rise since 2015, peaking at <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/mass-shootings-in-america/\">686 incidents in 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite that sheer carnage, however, the political debate over how to ensure that guns don’t fall into the hands of people who may hurt themselves and others has long proved intractable. In 2022,<strong> </strong>Congress reached a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/23/23180893/senate-gun-control-bipartisan-bill-2022-pass\">deal on limited gun reforms</a> for the first time in nearly 30 years<strong> </strong>in the wake of a shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas — the deadliest school shooting since 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But those narrow reforms clearly haven’t stopped America’s gun violence epidemic. The US’s expansive view of civilian gun ownership has been so ingrained in politics, in culture, and in the law since the nation’s founding that there’s no telling how many more people will die before federal lawmakers take further action. In that absence, many red states have loosened their gun laws over the last few years, rather than making it harder to obtain a gun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“America is unique in that guns have always been present, there is wide civilian ownership, and the government hasn’t claimed more of a monopoly on them,” said David Yamane, a professor at Wake Forest University who studies American gun culture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The US has a lot of guns, and more guns means more gun deaths </h2>\n\n<p>It’s hard to estimate the number of privately owned guns in America since there is no countrywide database where people register whether they own guns, there is a<a href=\"https://www.everytown.org/issues/gun-trafficking/\"> thriving black market</a> for them in the absence of strong federal gun trafficking laws, and people can manufacture their own guns with DIY kits or 3D printers. The gun lobby has also <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/atf-gun-laws-nra/\">vehemently opposed</a> federal legislation to track gun sales and establish a national handgun registry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One estimate from the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research project, found that there were approximately <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081\">390 million guns</a> in circulation in the US in 2018, or about 120.5 firearms per 100 residents. That number has likely climbed in the years since, given that<a href=\"https://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/one-in-five-american-households-purchased-a-gun-during-the-pandemic.aspx\"> one in five households</a> purchased a gun during the pandemic, though the 2018 estimate remains the most recent available. There has also been a significant increase in the number of <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\">guns manufactured and imported</a> in the years since. But even without accounting for that increase, US gun ownership is still well above any other country: Yemen, which has the world’s second-highest level of gun ownership, has only 52.8 guns per 100 residents; in Iceland, it’s 31.7.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24876824/1443590414.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.724909644683,100,78.550180710634\" alt=\"At Least 5 Dead And 18 Injured In Colorado Springs Gay Nightclub Shooting\" title=\"At Least 5 Dead And 18 Injured In Colorado Springs Gay Nightclub Shooting\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A makeshift memorial set up for the victims of the Club Q nightclub shooting in Colorado Springs that happened on November 19, 2022. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Scott Olson/Getty Images\" />\n<p>American guns are concentrated in a tiny minority of households: just 3 percent own about half the nation’s guns, according to a 2016 Harvard and Northeastern University<a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2016/09/study-70m-more-firearms-added-to-us-gun-stock-over-past-20-years/\"> study</a>. They’re called “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey\">super owners</a>” who have an average of 17 guns each. Gallup, using a different methodology, found that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx\">45 percent of Americans</a> lived in a household with guns in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers have found a clear link between gun ownership in the US and gun violence, and some argue that it’s causal. One 2013 Boston University-led study, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828709/\">for instance</a>, found that for each percentage point increase in gun ownership at the household level, the state firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9 percent. And states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun-related homicides and suicides, according to a <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/\">study</a> by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The link between gun deaths and gun ownership is much stronger than the link that<strong> </strong>gun rights advocates often seek to draw<strong> </strong>between violence and mental health issues. If it were possible to cure all schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders, violent crime in the US would <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/myth-vs-fact-violence-and-mental-health\">fall by only 4 percent</a>, according to a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=v4oSb2Na4nQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=swanson&amp;f=false\">study</a> from Duke University professor Jeffrey Swanson, who examines policies to reduce gun violence.</p>\n\n<p>There’s still a pervasive idea, pushed by gun manufacturers and gun rights organizations like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/5/25/23140519/uvalde-school-shooting-nra-texas-good-guy-gun\">National Rifle Association</a>, that further arming America is the answer to preventing gun violence — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/5/25/23140519/uvalde-school-shooting-nra-texas-good-guy-gun\">the “good guy with a gun” theory</a>. But there have been relatively few instances in which police or armed bystanders have been able to successfully stop an active attack.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to a database maintained by Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, there were 520 active attacks — <a href=\"https://www.activeattackdata.org/index.html\">defined</a> as when one or more people are “actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space,” including but not limited to shootings — between 2000 and 2022. In many of those cases, police were <a href=\"https://www.activeattackdata.org/allattacks.html\">unable to stop</a> the attacker, either because the attack had already ended by the time they arrived or because the attacker surrendered or committed suicide. Only in 160 cases were police able to successfully intervene by shooting or otherwise subduing the attacker.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24882439/Ndqdu_police_stopped_fewer_than_a_third_of_active_attacks_between_2000_and_2022__1_.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,20.109822298073,100,59.780355403855\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Another 2021 <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2776515\">study</a> from Hamline University and Metropolitan State University found that the rate of deaths in 133 mass school shootings between 1980 and 2019 was 2.83 times greater in cases where there was an armed guard present. The researchers argue the results suggest the presence of an armed guard increased shooters’ aggression and that because many school shooters have been found to be suicidal, “an armed officer may be an incentive rather than a deterrent.”</p>\n\n<p>“The idea that the solution to mass shootings is that we need more guns in the hands of more people in more places so that we’ll be able to protect ourselves — there’s no evidence that that’s true,” Swanson said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The prevalence of the self-defense narrative is part of what sets apart the gun rights movement in the US from similar movements in places like Canada and Australia, according to Robert Spitzer, a professor at SUNY Cortland who studies the politics of gun control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Self-defense has become by far the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">most prominent reason</a> for gun ownership in the US today, eclipsing hunting, recreation, or owning guns because they’re antiques, heirlooms, or work-related. That’s also reflected in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/us/politics/gun-manufacturing-atf.html\">ballooning handgun sales</a>, since the primary purpose of those guns isn’t recreational, but self-defense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>American gun culture “brings together the hunting-sporting tradition with the militia-frontier tradition, but in modern times the hunting element has been eclipsed by a heavily politicized notion that gun carrying is an expression of freedom, individuality, hostility to government, and personal self-protection,” Spitzer said.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23589886/GettyImages_1240907270.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,7.1237996034465,100,85.752400793107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"People gather at Sacred Heart Catholic Church to pray for the victims of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on May 25, 2022. | Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p>That <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11975850/ar-15-owner-orlando\">culture of gun ownership in the US</a> has made it all the more difficult to explore serious policy solutions to gun violence after mass shootings. In high-income countries lacking that culture, mass shootings have historically galvanized public support behind gun control measures that would seem extreme by US standards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Canada <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/03/23/mass-shootings-response-other-countries-gun-laws/\">banned military-style assault weapons</a> two weeks after a 2020 mass shooting in Nova Scotia. In 2019, less than a month after the Christchurch massacre, New Zealand lawmakers passed a gun buyback scheme, as well as restrictions on AR-15s and other semiautomatic weapons, and they later established a firearms registry. The 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Australia spurred the government to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9212725/australia-buyback\">buy back 650,000 firearms</a> within a year, and murders and suicides plummeted as a result.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, nearly a decade went by after the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, before Congress passed a new gun control law. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/23/23180893/senate-gun-control-bipartisan-bill-2022-pass\">Bipartisan Safer Communities Act</a>, the law passed in June 2022, was relatively limited:<strong> </strong>It incentivized states to pass red flag laws, enhanced background checks for gun buyers under 21, and closed the “boyfriend loophole,” which allowed some people with domestic violence convictions to purchase guns. But it did not ban any types of weapons, and certain studies suggest that even truly universal background checks may have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/27/18224727/house-universal-background-checks-gun-violence-congress\">limited effects on gun violence</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the same time, many states have sought to expand gun ownership in recent years. At least 27 states have now passed laws allowing residents to carry a <a href=\"https://www.handgunlaw.us/documents/Permitless_Carry_States.pdf\">handgun without a permit</a> and allow school staff and teachers to <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/laws-allowing-armed-staff-in-K12-schools.html\">carry guns on campus</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24882641/nwQcq_27_states_have_passed_laws_allowing_people_to_carry_a_handgun_without_a_permit.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,21.773275665832,100,56.453448668336\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>“Other countries look at this problem and say, ‘People walking around in the community with handguns is just way too dangerous, so we’re going to broadly limit legal access to that and make exceptions on the margins for people who might have a good reason to have a gun,’” Swanson said. “Here we do just the opposite: We say that, because of the way that the Supreme Court interpreted the Second Amendment, everybody has the right to a gun for personal protection, and then we tried to make exceptions for really dangerous people, but we can’t figure out who they are.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/harvard-political-review/vast-majority-americans-support-universal-background-checks\">While the majority of Americans</a> support more gun control restrictions, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">including universal background checks</a>, a vocal Republican minority unequivocally opposes such laws — and is willing to put pressure on GOP lawmakers to do the same. Alongside the NRA, and a well-funded gun lobby, this contingent of voters sees gun control as a deciding issue, and one that could warrant a primary challenge for a lawmaker who votes for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The gun lobby has the advantage of enthusiasm. “​​Despite being outnumbered, Americans who oppose gun control are more likely to contact public officials about it and to base their votes on it,” Barnard College’s Matthew Lacombe <a href=\"https://barnard.edu/news/break-down-gun-politics-america\">explained in 2020</a>. “As a result, many politicians believe that supporting gun regulation is more likely to lose them votes than to gain them votes.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24876847/1246706108.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.100531452033,100,73.798937095933\" alt=\"Two older Asian women stand comforting each other.\" title=\"Two older Asian women stand comforting each other.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Mourners honor the victims of the January 27, 2023, Monterey Park, California, mass shooting. | Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Supreme Court has made it impossible to cure America’s gun violence epidemic</h2>\n\n<p>In 2008, the Supreme Court effectively wrote NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre’s “good guy with a gun” theory into the Constitution. The Court’s 5-4 decision in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html\"><em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em></a> (2008) was the first Supreme Court decision in American history to hold that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm. But it also went much further than that.</p>\n\n<p><em>Heller</em> held that one of the primary purposes of the Second Amendment is to protect the right of individuals — good guys with a gun, in LaPierre’s framework — to use firearms to stop bad guys with guns. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in <em>Heller</em>, an “inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right.”</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of textual interpretation, this holding makes no sense. The Second Amendment provides that “<a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-ii\">a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State</a>, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We don’t need to guess why the Second Amendment protects a right to firearms because it is right there in the Constitution. The Second Amendment’s purpose is to preserve “a well-regulated Militia,” not to allow individuals to use their weapons for personal self-defense.</p>\n\n<p>For many years, the Supreme Court took the first 13 words of the Second Amendment seriously. As the Court said in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/307/174\"><em>United States v. Miller</em></a><em> </em>(1939), the “obvious purpose” of the Second Amendment was to “render possible the effectiveness” of militias. And thus the amendment must be “interpreted and applied with that end in view.” <em>Heller</em> abandoned that approach.</p>\n\n<p><em>Heller</em> also reached another important policy conclusion. Handguns, according to Scalia, are “overwhelmingly chosen” by gun owners who wish to carry a firearm for self-defense. For this reason, he wrote, handguns enjoy a kind of super-legal status. Lawmakers are not allowed to ban what Scalia described as “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use for protection of one’s home and family.”</p>\n\n<p>This declaration regarding handguns matters because this easily concealed weapon is responsible for far more deaths than any other weapon in the United States — and it isn’t close. In 2021, for example, a <a href=\"https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/shr\">total of 14,616 people were murdered in the US</a>, according to the FBI. Of these murder victims, at least 5,992 — just over 40 percent — were killed by handguns.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23589874/GettyImages_1240908247.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A woman holds a photo of Nevaeh Bravo, who was killed in the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School, during a vigil for the victims in Uvalde, Texas, on May 25, 2022. | Allison Dinner/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Allison Dinner/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p>In 2021, the Supreme Court made it even harder for federal and state lawmakers to combat gun violence. In its decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf\"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a><em>, </em>it massively expands the scope of the Second Amendment, abandons more than a decade of case law governing which gun laws are permitted by the Constitution, and replaces this case law with a new legal framework that, as Justice Stephen Breyer writes in dissent, “imposes a task on the lower courts that judges cannot easily accomplish.”</p>\n\n<p><em>Bruen </em>has since allowed handguns — which are responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22382180/supreme-court-uvalde-guns-violence-second-amendment-heller-scalia\">overwhelming majority of gun murders</a> in the United States — to proliferate on many American streets. That’s because <em>Bruen</em> strikes the types of laws that limit who can legally carry handguns in public, holding that “the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual’s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.” Amid a flurry of activity in the courts in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/07/28/bruen-supreme-court-rahimi-00108285\">more than a dozen state and federal gun control laws</a> have been invalidated in whole or in part as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Under this new legal regime, the future of firearm regulation looks grim for anyone who believes that the government should help protect us from gun violence.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, September 4, 2024, 5 pm ET:&nbsp;</strong>This story was originally published on May 26, 2022, and has been updated multiple times, most recently with the latest details from the September 4 shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That’s due to her perceived support for former President Donald Trump and his promised political policies. This all started when Mahomes liked and then unliked an Instagram post from the former president that <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/28/brittany-mahomes-trump-support/\">outlined his 2024 platform</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under any normal circumstances, only <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittanylynne/?hl=en\">Brittany Mahomes’s biggest fans</a> would be deeply invested in whether she desires mass deportation and an Iron Dome missile defense system built over America.

That very valuable association is why the social media likes and dislikes of an American football WAG (that’s “wives and girlfriends”) has become a pop culture saga.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re here to answer your most pressing questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Wait, what happened?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Brittany Mahomes has become a moment in this news cycle because she has been liking and unliking social media posts supporting former President Donald Trump and his various policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C-m53xGu3MY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a69d4fdc-9933-4d07-904b-7e88d71753a8\">August 13</a>, Trump’s Instagram account posted a platform promising to “Seal the border, and stop the migrant invasion,” “Keep men OUT of women’s sports,” and “Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.” He also plans to cut “federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, Radical Gender Ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/tiredasslesbian/status/1826972546052325629\">Eagle-eyed internet sleuths</a> spotted that Mahomes “liked” and “unliked” the xenophobic and transphobic dog whistle salad last week. And though Mahomes doesn’t follow Trump on her account, it seems as though the narrative was already set: Mahomes supports some of Trump’s most pernicious and divisive politics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The news that people saw Mahomes’s social media activity eventually circled its way back to Mahomes, who was not pleased that people noticed her public actions. To that, she posted a message via <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/brittany-mahomes-message-haters-liking-pro-trump-instagram-post\">Instagram Story</a> (Instagram Stories are temporary), denouncing her haters and telling them they were emotionally damaged adults:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/brittany-mahomes-slams-haters-instagram-015629071.html?.tsrc=daily_mail&amp;segment_id=DY_GOLDLIST_TEST&amp;ncid=crm_19908-1202929-20240825-0&amp;bt_user_id=6JRyBTwoYQzmdnLH3pN2QzNZuI5lUW99eij89uny52Y9VmIpDsEpGGO5JWIe&amp;bt_ts=1724580120381&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKBxQxF-fo9Px30l0B6tcZu6KwckIA3BbKQcCQTyBfmdE-eLjhpbxsDzUFDj5U0riA9M2Jsg-zMbF58SDN42jXuDiD764vw6o2Wv0F_tzmN_zscfp-UWDMzLVQM4dRmTihmI2MylQw9k_ZcZWJAySNmtqdVp7JDgb2AdfXCpwmLA\">Mahomes seemed</a> to see the negativity surrounding her social media proclivities as a sign that people were mad that she was succeeding, rather than that people were disappointed in her presumed politics, that is to say, what appeared to be her beliefs about how the country should be run and how others should be treated. Mahomes also <a href=\"https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1828870083847884899\">liked a pro-Trump comment</a> under a recent post, eliminating any ambiguity that her previous liking and unliking spree might be an accident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On August 26, Mahomes doubled down and <a href=\"https://people.com/brittany-mahomes-doubles-down-calling-out-critics-after-backlash-8701908\">shared a post</a> that read, “Contrary to the tone of the world today … You can disagree with someone, and still love them. You can have differing views, and still be kind.” She did not comment on or explain the relative kindness of the views she appeared to support. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, on September 4, Trump apparently heard the news and was flattered, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113080034075111751\" rel=\"nofollow\">posting a message</a> on his own social media platform, Truth Social. In the post, Trump called Mahomes “beautiful” and thanked her for “strongly defending” him, going on to decry “Crime and Illegal Immigration,” “INFLATION,” a “World that is laughing” at US leaders. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-truth-social wp-block-embed-truth-social\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"iframely-embed\"><div class=\"iframely-responsive\"><a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113080034075111751\" data-iframely-url=\"//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?maxheight=750&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthsocial.com%2F%40realDonaldTrump%2Fposts%2F113080034075111751&#038;key=a95589c51263af39f0de8ef8737db4f3\"></a></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mahomes has yet to comment on Trump’s thanks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And sorry, who is Brittany Mahomes again? Do people regularly care about Brittany Mahomes in general?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Brittany Mahomes is primarily famous because she’s married to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was her high school sweetheart. She’s also the <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a45601704/who-is-patrick-mahomes-wife-brittany-mahomes/\">co-owner</a> of the Kansas City Current, a team in the National Women’s Soccer League, which was the sport she excelled in through college, and she was a Sports Illustrated <a href=\"https://www.si.com/sports-illustrated/brittany-mahomes-makes-her-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-debut-01hxt4v7tp05\">swimsuit model</a> in May of this year. She and Patrick have two children and are currently expecting a third.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3\">biggest “Brittany Mahomes” search spike</a> of the past year was during the Super Bowl when people were ostensibly trying to figure out whether Patrick Mahomes had a wife and if she was hanging out with Taylor Swift (more on this in a bit).&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2160725206.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.696771244586,100,78.606457510828\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes at Wimbledon this year. | Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, the name Brittany Mahomes is not one the average American gives a lot of thought to, and her political views would probably warrant even less consideration. She’s not a political scholar nor is she some kind of kingmaker. Prior to her online statements about “haters,” the <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3\">American public wasn’t furiously Googling</a> “Brittany Mahomes loves Trump?” or “Brittany Mahomes Republican.” There’s a bit of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect\">Streisand effect</a> happening, where the more Mahomes doubles down, the more attention she draws to the kerfuffle. There’s possibly a timeline in which Mahomes lets the entire saga run its course and fade away as football season begins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing to note is that her pro-Trump political stance appears to many to be at odds with her husband’s identity. Patrick is biracial, with a Black father and a white mother. And it would seem that Brittany’s liking that pro-Trump post, especially his bits about attacking critical race theory (an attack that would minimize the historical <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy\">Black American experience</a>) would be insensitive if not incongruent with her husband’s identity. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american\">Trump has recently attacked</a> Vice President Kamala Harris’s biracial ethnicity, claiming that she “turned” Black for political gain. Harris’s father is Jamaican.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patrick hasn’t been open about who he’s voting for, but he has spoken up about police brutality and <a href=\"https://andscape.com/features/patrick-mahomes-saw-george-floyds-death-and-chiefs-quarterback-knew-he-couldnt-stay-on-the-sideline/\">supported Black Lives Matter</a>. In 2020, he <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/watch-patrick-mahomes-and-other-nfl-stars-demand-the-nfl-condemn-racism-and-admit-wrong-in-silencing-players-from-peacefully-protesting-2020-06-05\">urged the NFL</a> to denounce and separate itself from racism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But more important than her husband and the reason everyone’s talking about Brittany at all is that she’s allegedly friends with Taylor Swift — the most famous person on the planet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>So this is all because she’s friends with Taylor Swift?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pretty much!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How long have they been friends?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift and Mahomes seem to have formed their close bond after Swift started dating <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/25/23889682/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-date-nfl-chiefs-game\">Travis Kelce</a>, a Chiefs tight end who plays with Patrick Mahomes. The two women likely cultivated their relationship during Chiefs games last year, when they <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-rcna121662\">were photographed</a> together multiple times at the VIP suites, even potentially wearing matching necklaces. It wasn’t long until they took their friendship on the road, with Taylor including Brittany on a <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/photos/36639/taylor-swifts-nyc-night-out-with-selena-gomez-brittany-mahomes-more\">girls’ night in NYC</a> with the rest of her squad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Wait, what does Taylor have to say about Trump?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift has spoken up against Trump in the past, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump\">acknowledging in her 2020 documentary</a><em> Miss Americana</em> that she regretted not speaking up about him and his policies during the 2016 election. Ahead of the 2020 election, <a href=\"https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1266392274549776387\">Swift tweeted</a> that Trump was cavorting with white supremacists and promised “we will vote you out in November.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But ahead of the upcoming 2024 election, Swift has been less vocal about Trump and publicly more nonpartisan.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/taylor-swift-urges-282-million-instagram-followers-vote-super-tuesday-rcna141848\">In March</a>, she urged her fans to vote for “the people who most represent YOU into power.” Kelce, her boyfriend, has appeared in Covid-19 vaccine and <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/bud-light-boycott-movement-goes-after-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce\">Budweiser</a> commercials, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans\">two targets</a> of right-wing protests. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At last year’s Super Bowl, Swift and Kelce found themselves in the middle of a kooky <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/12/us/politics/biden-tiktok-super-bowl.html\">right-wing conspiracy theory</a> that President Joe Biden rigged the game in Kelce and Kansas City’s favor, all to get some of that sweet Swift attention. The gist: that Kelce and Swift were liberal, so Biden tilted the game in their favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/donald-trump-taylor-swift-ai/index.html\">Trump also recently posted an AI image</a> falsely suggesting he has the support of her fans. Swift has not <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/us/ai-content-laws-taylor-swift-trump/index.html\">officially responded</a> to that “acceptance.”<strong> </strong>Still, Swift has yet to endorse a presidential candidate. In what’s likely to be a close election, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/swifties-kamala-harris-zoom/679637/\">some of Swift’s biggest fans</a> are urging her to throw her support behind Harris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Okay, so … Brittany Mahomes isn’t actually Taylor Swift, she’s just a friend. Why do her perceived politics matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mahomes’s social media meltdown came at a peculiar time for megastar Swift. Mahomes and her husband spent the weekend with Taylor Swift at the singer’s Rhode Island estate on August 24. Swift was reportedly hosting a birthday party for pal Blake Lively that weekend. Lively has been having a difficult time in the press recently because of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/367451/blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-press-tour-controversy\">feud with co-star Justin Baldoni</a> during the filming of their movie <em>It Ends With Us</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift’s getaway weekends are famous for being luxurious and over the top, but also as invitations only her very best friends receive. Swift is known for picking and choosing her friends from the world of beautiful and notable people and then visibly hanging out with them. Ever since Swift’s <em>1989</em> tour, where her pals — ranging from Fifth Harmony to Gigi Hadid — joined her onstage, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24134809/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-matty-healy-joe-alwyn\">Swift’s friendships</a> with the hippest, smartest, kindest, and most beautiful women in pop culture have become a crucial part of her image. All these people who call Swift friends are culturally cool, which makes Swift culturally cool.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-1717057814.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.7460602225,100,78.507879555\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Taylor Swift, Brittany Mahomes, and Blake Lively hanging out! One of these women may or may not be deeply into mass deportation! | Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, Swift’s friendships are the most human thing about her. They’re her way of signaling to the public that as different as she is from the rest of the population — a billionaire making hit music and selling all kinds of albums — she’s relatable as a good friend. Arguably, Swift’s friends have defined the singer almost as much as she’s defined herself. The Mahomes’ presence in Rhode Island would indicate that Brittany is indeed a bestie. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, not unlike how fans are trying to puzzle out the dynamic of Brittany’s relationship with her husband, Swifties are trying to figure out how Brittany’s politics figure into her friendship with Swift. Since the singer has been relatively quiet, they’re trying to get a read on Swift’s current feelings about Trump. Or, possibly, get a read on how much longer Brittany and Swift will remain friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift’s friendships have always been a crucial and visible part of her image.<strong> </strong>And Brittany Mahomes may have just made a mark on that image that Taylor Swift didn’t agree to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update: September 4, 3:25 pm:</strong> This story, originally published August 29, has been updated with Trump’s Truth Social post about Brittany Mahomes. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But the same ethos can be applied to <em>The Bachelor</em> franchise. That has always been true to some extent; as the audience, you are signing up to watch a bunch of hot, over-served 20-somethings fight for the right to get engaged to the lead character over the course of just two months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nothing about it is natural. You might even say none of it is <em>real</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But last night’s conclusion to Jenn Tran’s season, in which the show so callously tore its lead character down, should be all the evidence you need that drama this brutal requires real pain at its center. The show’s promise of true love demands the threat of genuine heartbreak for it to feel earned. This means that, periodically, when the fairy tale ending fails to materialize and deliver the show its big cathartic finish, cast members will instead be traumatized for our entertainment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It may have been just a television program for the producers, for many of the contestants, and for the audience. But the tears streaming down Tran’s face were an uncomfortable, piercing reminder that at the heart of all this pageantry is a real person who may genuinely believe they have the chance to find the love of their life through this silly show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You may think that’s ridiculous, but that doesn’t make it any less true — nor does it justify the utter disregard with which Tran’s ex-fiancé and the show that cast her as its first Asian-American lead treated her at her lowest moment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What happened on <em>The Bachelorette</em> finale</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s a recap for the uninitiated: Tran’s decision came down to two men, Marcus and Devin. Both shared their traumatic childhood experiences with her. Marcus was more reserved, which made any steps toward love feel authentic, but Devin was a fan favorite, a buoyant personality who seemed genuinely enamored with our lead. It was almost shocking how unguarded he was with his feelings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only question seemed to be whether Tran would choose the exuberant Devin — admittedly less conventionally attractive than some of the other men — or the more unavailable Marcus. That was supposed to be the source of suspense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Midway through the finale, Jenn had a difficult conversation with Marcus in which it became clear he would never “get there” emotionally, so she chose to end that relationship. That meant Devin — who appeared to be the “right” pick, the guy who was actually there for the right reasons, the one who was genuinely into her — was the only guy left. The show had primed us for months for an unprecedented finale, and many viewers had deduced that would mean Jenn proposing to her man. In Hawaii, after breaking up with Marcus, Jenn told Jesse she planned to do just that with Devin. It seemed she was on the verge of her happy ending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But then, rather than roll the proposal footage, producers cut in with host Jesse Palmer in the ABC studios and it was quickly clear that between that moment of triumph and last night’s live taping of the post-finale special, something had gone horribly wrong. This was a break from the norm when, even if a couple has broken up since the season wrapped, the show allows the proposal to unfold before breaking the bad news to the audience. Over the next hour, we would see how far the show is willing to go to exploit genuine emotion for cheap entertainment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First Jenn on her own and then Jenn and Devin together recapped what happened after the proposal that still had not been shown. The story, as it was presented to us, was that almost as soon as the cameras turned off, Devin switched up and went cold. When they returned from filming to real life, he was noncommittal and absent. Jenn said that he dumped her in a 15-minute phone call in which he said he never loved her and then refused to have a more detailed conversation about it until they were in front of the TV cameras again. For his part, Devin insisted that the feelings he expressed to Jenn during filming were genuine, but he otherwise did little to rebut her accusations about his behavior after production had ended, only saying repeatedly that he had “failed” her. He also copped to following on Instagram a previous season&#8217;s contestant, Maria, who was widely rumored to be the next Bachelorette before Jenn was announced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps we the viewers should have seen this coming. Earlier in the episode, Palmer asked Jenn’s brother how he was feeling. “Angry,” was his answer. It was an odd response, but it made absolute sense once the finale’s true twist was revealed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then came the final twist of the knife. After rehashing their painful break-up, with Jenn struggling to keep her composure, Palmer proffered that they should watch the proposal anyway. He attempted to frame it as an empowering moment, saying that though the engagement fizzled, Jenn still “chose herself” in that moment and that is what mattered. Would she be okay with airing it?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Do I have a choice?” she exclaimed, with a pained laugh. The answer was implicit: No.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the producers cut away to the Hawaiian beach where Jenn and Devin were to get engaged, with contemporary inserts of Jenn describing how happy she is. Meanwhile, in the corner of the screen, they showed a feed of Jenn live in the studio, sitting next to her ex, watching her proposal and knowing it was already invalidated. Jenn sobbed without constraint. Whatever you might think, whether she was truly heartbroken or more embarrassed at being humiliated, the anguish was real. (It was at this point that a friend texted me, “This is torture. This is actually a violation of the Geneva convention to be airing this.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the course of her season, I came to believe that, whatever her questionable taste in men, Jenn was a real one. She came on this absurd show for those elusive right reasons. To see it all ripped away from her in such a public way was nauseating — and admittedly riveting.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>The Bachelorette</em> needed a ratings win, and it crushed Jenn to get it</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the production team, making good TV was surely all that mattered. <em>The Bachelor</em> franchise has been struggling with <a href=\"https://www.the-express.com/entertainment/tv/147014/Bachelorette-producers-Jenn-Trans-Season-21-ratings\">middling ratings</a> for a while now. Jenn’s season was dogged by <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bachelorette-jenn-tran-abc-dating-reality-tv-1925259\">bad buzz</a> (unfairly, in my opinion, but that was the prevailing sentiment). They needed a grand finale, and Jenn’s emotional devastation provided it. There’s no denying ABC concocted a memorable climax — we can only hope they did not permanently damage a real person’s psyche in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because that is the real risk. There has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/11/23864621/bethenny-frankel-real-housewife-reality-tv-union-bravo\">much discussion</a> about whether reality TV participants deserve union representation and stronger legal protections. I think the argument against those measures is usually that these people know what they’re signing up for. But that does not mean they are not vulnerable to emotional trauma as part of the experience. Jenn’s final appearance, quickly shunted to the side so that Palmer could introduce the new lead for the franchise’s next season, is a painful reminder of that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the same show that once <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/reality-tv-most-influential-seasons/6198528/arie-becca-the-bachelor-breakup-legacy/\">ambushed a contestant</a> who thought she was going to see her fiancé only to learn she too was about to lose the man who loved her (or so she believed). The show that <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/rachel-lindsay-thinks-lee-garrett-was-cast-on-her-bachelorette-season-to-add-controversy/\">may have intentionally cast a racist</a> for the first season with a Black bachelorette. The show that <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bachelor-fans-are-already-over-virgin-jokes-about-colton-underwood-after-1283537\">made a mockery of its lead character’s virginity</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This morning, reflecting on last night, I thought again of <a href=\"https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2022/07/22/the-great-escape-the-moment-that-came-to-shape-the-bachelor-forever/\">a 2022 essay by Catherine Horowitz in Bright Wall/Dark Room</a> in which she analyzed a moment in which a “character” from <em>The Bachelor</em> appeared to suffer genuine emotional distress and stretched the show’s fabric to the point of ripping. It led her to this critical insight, one that is easy to forget in our era of ubiquitous reality television: These narratives may be disposable entertainment for us, but they are part of another person’s lived experience, something they will carry with them long after the lights go out and the studio audience heads home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“For those who participate in it, reality television isn’t manufactured at all; it’s a real part of their lives, something that impacts them in a permanent way,” Horowitz wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And almost paradoxically, these format-breaking moments give us a story that “maybe, just maybe, people could believe in.” The cost, however, may be the well-being of the show’s cast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Bachelor</em> is under no directive to be humane, only to entertain. Cruelty has always been a feature of this show. That’s the point.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Watching Tuesday night’s finale of The Bachelorette, one phrase kept ringing in my mind: The cruelty is the point.

The response was an outpouring of protests: Israelis flooding the streets to call for a ceasefire that would bring all hostages back and end the war, a demand that <a href=\"https://en.idi.org.il/articles/55520\">a majority of Israelis support</a>. The Histadrut, Israel’s national labor union, called a (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/g-s1-20547/general-strike-in-israel-over-hostages-leads-to-uneven-closures\">swiftly ended</a>) general strike.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The response from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to double down on war. In a Monday night press conference, he insisted that any ceasefire would depend on <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/philadelphi-corridor-explainer-israel-hamas-talks-cease-fire-gaza-rcna169274\">Israeli control</a> over a stretch of territory in southwestern Gaza called the Philadelphi Corridor — something Hamas is not prepared to give. Netanyahu’s presser was so belligerent, in fact, that it may have <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/official-says-netanyahus-press-briefing-torpedoed-hostage-deal-efforts-report/\">single-handedly torpedoed ongoing ceasefire talks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s clear that the Israeli public has no faith in Netanyahu’s handling of the war: <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-810113\">Roughly 70 percent</a> believe he should resign his position. Yet despite <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netanyahu-protests-philadelphi-corridor-hostage-deal-demand-rcna169484\">ongoing protests</a>, it’s equally clear that the prime minister will not be changing course voluntarily. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it looks like he’ll likely get away with it, at least for now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His government has weathered dismal polling on its war effort, as well as sporadic protests, since the war began last October. And yet, as with past demonstration flare-ups, there has been no evidence that this weekend’s events have brought his government to the brink of collapse. How can this be?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answer is brute power politics. The 2022 election gave right-wing parties a clear majority in the Knesset (Israel’s parliament), allowing Netanyahu to build the most far-right government in Israeli history. Though this coalition has since become extremely unpopular, there’s no way for voters to kick it out on their own. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The government could only collapse if it faces defections from <em>inside</em> the governing coalition. But at present, the greatest threat to Netanyahu’s coalition comes from his extreme right flank, which wants him to continue the war at all costs. And for that reason, he seems intent on doing so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not impossible that other cracks in the government begin to show. There are certainly signs of stress, and escalating mass publication could exacerbate them. But as of right now, the situation looks bleak. The Israeli public wants to end the killing in Gaza, but their government won’t let them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Netanyahu’s coalition has been so durable</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Israel’s parliamentary system, governments are formed by legislative majorities; Netanyahu’s government currently commands 64 out of the 120 seats in the Knesset.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of those 64 seats, half come from Netanyahu’s own right-wing Likud party. Twenty-five seats come from ultra-Orthodox parties, and the remaining seven belong to the even further right Religious Zionism faction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These parties don’t agree on everything, but it’s hard to see any of them rebelling against the government to push for a ceasefire deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Likud, once Israel’s relatively normal center-right party, is now a hollowed-out vehicle for Netanyahu’s ambitions. Its parliamentary ranks are mostly made up of the prime minister’s toadies. Yoav Gallant, the current defense minister, is an exception; he has bitterly and publicly feuded with Netanyahu over the prime minister’s incompetent handling of the war. Indeed, Gallant’s support is a major reason why the 2023 mass protests <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/1/3/24022467/israel-supreme-court-judicial-overhaul-reasonableness-basic-law-overturn\">successfully blocked</a> Netanyahu’s master plan to seize control of Israel’s court system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But those protests were bigger and more disruptive than the current anti-war demonstrations. And so far, there is little evidence that Gallant has enough supporters inside the government to fuel a wave of defections that might topple the government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The religious parties in Netanyahu’s coalition care less about the war itself than they do preserving the rights and privileges of the ultra-Orthodox community. Foremost among these priorities is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p24expzd5o\">fighting a recent Supreme Court ruling</a> that ends the community’s exemption from Israel’s national conscription law, a court order that Netanyahu is slow-walking and that a center-left coalition would almost certainly implement in full.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One ultra-Orthodox party, Shas, has <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/shas-urges-netanyahu-to-move-forward-with-hostage-deal-ignore-far-right-threats/\">expressed support for a hostage deal</a>. But so far, there is no indication that Shas cares <em>enough</em> about the plight of the hostages to threaten to topple the government over it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Religious Zionism, by contrast, cares deeply about the war — and they want it to continue. Their party’s raison d’être is expanding Israeli Jewish control over all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, and the war has proven an extraordinary boon to this cause. The party’s radical leaders, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, have <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/smotrich-threatens-to-quit-govt-over-hostage-deal-eisenkot-slams-far-fight-blackmail/\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-01/ty-article/.premium/ben-gvir-smotrich-reject-u-s-hostage-proposal-threaten-to-quit-netanyahu-coalition/0000018f-d552-d5bc-a1bf-df7225960000\">threatened</a> to quit the coalition if Netanyahu strikes any kind of long-term ceasefire deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Netanyahu cares very deeply about maintaining his grip on power: it’s the closest thing to a literal get-out-of-jail-free card that a prime minister <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahus-lawyer-tells-court-pm-can-only-testify-in-corruption-trial-in-march-2025/\">staring down criminal conviction</a> could have. This means that he cares a great deal about the far-right threats to quit his government, and will want to maintain the war as long as he can, absent a major political threat on his other flank.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far, one hasn’t emerged.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can the opposition turn mass discontent into political power?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The protest movement, while large, primarily draws from the ranks of the Israeli center and left. As such, it’s thus unlikely to sway parliamentarians from the right-wing coalition parties as long as they keep their core voters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Both these things are true: the government does not enjoy a majority in the polls, but it still holds a sizable base of support,” says Noam Gidron, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moreover, Gidron says, the fractured Israeli opposition has not yet figured out how to translate its majority public support into a concerted strategy to break Netanyahu’s coalition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The opposition is divided between the centrists, the more leftist wing, and the Arab parties — and they have not figured out how — and perhaps even whether — they should operate together against the government,” he says. Benny Gantz, the leader of the most popular opposition party, seems “reluctant to use all the political power and go in full force against Netanyahu.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s one way things could change: the opposition getting its act together, linking up with the street demonstrations, and trying to force Netanyahu’s hand. You could also imagine Gallant finding a few more Likud defectors, Shas having an attack of conscience, or tensions over <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24114496/benjamin-netanyahu-ultra-orthodox-conscription-coalition-gaza\">the conscription of ultra-Orthodox men boiling over</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as of right now, none of this appears to be on the horizon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“For [the government to fall], Israeli political leaders would need common sense, political courage, and a moral backbone. Too clearly, the overwhelming majority have none,” <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-04/ty-article/.premium/furious-israelis-are-protesting-to-save-the-hostages-can-they-change-netanyahus-mind/00000191-bc49-d9c6-a997-be6996320000\">Dahlia Scheindlin</a>, a leading Israel pollster, writes in the Haaretz newspaper.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The game first attracted interest in 2020, when its makers debuted a 13-minute-long <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2nNljv0MOw\">trailer</a> that drew over 10 million views and won <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-preview/\">wild praise</a> from gamers around the globe. The ensuing four years of anticipation paid off: Within a day of its August 20 release, it had <a href=\"https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/08/21/black-myth-wukong-sales-4-5-million-copies-report\">reportedly</a> sold 4.5 million copies and soared to over 2.2 million concurrent players on Steam; it’s currently <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak\">ranked</a> as the platform’s second most-played game of all time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This might have been a simple and exciting win for the Chinese gaming industry; <em>Wukong</em> is the country’s first major top-tier game release — not to mention a major exportation of Chinese culture at a mass global scale. But therein lies the problem: Some of the game’s US audiences seem to <a href=\"https://seandknight.com/index.php/2024/06/17/why-western-gamers-should-boycott-black-myth-wukong-dei-free-but-not-ccp-free/\" rel=\"nofollow\">believe</a> the game itself is Chinese propaganda. It doesn’t help that prior to the game’s release, the game’s co-publisher, Hero Games, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvyre936zvo\">attempted to issue a moratorium</a> among reviewers and streamers on certain unsavory topics — including elements that have nothing to do with the game itself, like “feminist propaganda” and Covid-19. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Was this dictum merely a face-saving gesture for the Chinese Communist Party? Was it a sign that the game is actually serving a conservative agenda? Or was it something else altogether? No one is sure; but in the wake of the game’s success, a mix of wariness about China and right-wing embrace has led to a backlash against the game by some on the left. Now, being angry about the game is being seen as tantamount to being angry about the American right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this over a game whose only real aim is arguably to have players have fun battles and collect cool pretty things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>No one can agree on whether </strong><strong><em>Wukong</em></strong><strong> is good. Either way, it’s undeniably popular.</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Journey to the West</em>, Monkey, a.k.a. Sun Wukong, is a trickster archetype who becomes immortal but rebels against Buddha. He then gets kicked out of heaven before repenting and slowly redeems himself, eventually leveling up through constant battles to achieve enlightenment and become a Buddha himself. It’s a perfect story for a video game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, a single-person action fighter RPG, imagines that Monkey died at some point after his journey to enlightenment. In this loose sequel, you play as a reincarnation of Monkey, working to collect six relics that can help revive you to your former state as Buddha. You do this by fighting bad guys. Lots and lots and lots of bad guys. There are anywhere from 90 to 113 “bosses” in the game’s six chapters, depending on how you’re counting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether or not Wukong is good based on the merits of its gameplay alone is, like many things, in the eye of the beholder. Some say the game is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science\">boringly easy</a>; others, <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/\">prohibitively</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1826626808151998788\">difficult</a>.&nbsp; The game’s linear structure, in which you face off against the game’s bosses one after the other, is either <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/gaming/black-myth-wukong-chinese-nationalism-anti-woke\">too uninventive</a> or just <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KMZohKOEaoM?t=350\">basic fun</a>. It’s either <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/2358720/discussions/0/4426562258568484005/\">wildly overhyped</a> or actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoZs5sEl3w\">even better</a> than players expected. (That last review poses an important question: “What other game lets you transform into a giant rock so you can battle another giant rock?”)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly everyone <a href=\"https://www.chinausfocus.com/society-culture/chinas-black-myth-wukong-looks-like-a-hit\">agrees</a>, however, that <em>Wukong</em>’s art design is flawless. The graphics and visuals are gorgeous, the animation is superb, and the details are careful, with especially careful attention given to recreating actual Chinese relics and artifacts. (A closed museum that preserves such artifacts in China’s northern Shanxi province, where much of <em>Wukong</em> takes place, recently <a href=\"https://www.shine.cn/feature/travel/2408276474/\">announced</a> its re-opening in the wake of the game’s popularity.)&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/sc8i9c.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Sun Wukong, the Monkey King and protagonist of the game. | Game Science\" data-portal-copyright=\"Game Science\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The game builds and expands upon the mythos of <em>Journey</em>, with <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-six-senses-buddhism-relics-abilities/\">elements of Buddhist and Chinese folklore</a> ever present throughout. The main goal — to retrieve the six relics from different regions — is based on the six senses of Buddhism (that is, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind). Players have praised the game’s worldbuilding as well, from the many pseudo-historical characters inspired by <em>Journey</em> to the litany of customizable RPG mechanics, many of which draw further on Chinese culture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while all the praise cited above comes from English-speaking gamers, the most prominent line of attack against the game from people who seek to disparage its popularity is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ex2cnn/90_of_wukong_players_are_from_china/\">the claim</a> that most of <em>Wukong</em>’s massive sales have come from China. While this doesn’t seem like much of a problem, unless you assume all Chinese gamers have poor taste or are brainwashed nationalists, there is plenty of evidence that the game is experiencing popularity worldwide. It currently stands at a score of 82 on the English-language <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/black-myth-wukong/\">Metacritic</a>, and on Steam, <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/\">95 percent</a> of the 700,000-plus user reviews are positive, and they seem to be written in a <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/2358720/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;filterLanguage=all\">balanced mix</a> of languages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The game, however, has set off a strange discourse about — guess what — diversity and inclusion that the game itself barely invites. Now, far overshadowing all conversation about its themes and use of Chinese mythology, players and critics alike have been thrust into a discomfiting argument about whether <em>Wukong</em> is “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy\">woke</a>” or not.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Wukong</em></strong><strong> is neither woke nor anti-woke, but that hasn’t stopped players from using it to fuel their own agenda</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wukong has been mired in controversy since well before its release. Just prior to August 20, the game’s co-publisher <a href=\"https://www.si.com/videogames/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda\">sent out</a> the aforementioned <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/exserv.bsky.social/post/3kzvr3jr54225\">list of taboo topics</a> to gamers, reviewers, and streamers who had requested preview access to the game and who might be preparing to livestream their gameplay on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. The list of “Don’ts” the gamers were instructed to avoid reportedly ran thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Do NOT insult other influencers or players.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do NOT use any offensive language/humor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do NOT include politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishization, and other content that instigates negative discourse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do NOT use trigger words such as ‘quarantine’ or “isolation” or “COVID-19.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do NOT discuss content related to China’s game industry policies, opinions, news, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Needless to say, gamers of all varieties <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/\">bristled</a> <a href=\"https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/264562-playstation-5/80831395/981785468\">at</a> these restraints on their freedom of speech. Yet there are several reasons the company might have sent out this list for in-game discussion rules that have nothing to do with trying to quash discussion for the sake of quashing discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s important to understand the role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in this moment. The CCP has a way of essentially freezing industries that grow too popular too quickly; see, for instance, that time it banned palace dramas for a couple of years because of the runaway popularity of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22968747/story-of-yanxi-palace-review-palace-drama-recommendations\">one palace drama</a> in particular. Gaming has already come under <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/its-time-to-pay-attention-to-china-inside-the-worlds-largest-pc-games-industry/\">increasing fire</a> from the government, which has attempted to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/business/media/china-online-games.html\">dramatically limit</a> the number of hours children spend playing video games. So sending out a list like this could be a tactical way for its developer, Game Science, and publishers to potentially stave off backlash from the CCP while mediating the government’s view of the game and its sudden popularity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, some critics on the left who may have already been suspicious of a game originating from China took off their gloves. One outlet blasted the game for its “<a href=\"https://dotesports.com/black-myth-wukong/news/black-myth-wukongs-shameless-lack-of-diversity-is-attracting-the-wrong-type-of-fans\">shameless lack of diversity</a>;” another <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/\">argued</a> that “The lack of diversity and inclusivity resonates with the misogynistic comments reported to have been made by developers &#8230; the underlying feeling that women aren’t welcome in this world felt present throughout my gameplay experience.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/china-opinion/article/3276212/why-black-myth-wukongs-success-should-spark-reflection-sexism-gaming\">took issue</a> with the workplace sexism that may have undermined the game. As multiple media outlets <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvyre936zvo\">pointed out</a>, there’s some evidence to suggest that Game Science isn’t exactly progressive. In November 2023, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west\">IGN reported</a> on a history of lewd and misogynistic remarks made against women by multiple staffers at the company on social media, including two co-founders. One co-founder fantasized about expanding staff and getting fellatio from all the new employees; another staffer claimed women’s games were different from men’s because of differences in their biology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other gamers unearthed <a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe92c4f9-73b5-4ad2-9535-d029b5383f5e_1195x1632.jpeg\">ribald promotional images</a> the studio has used in the past. The juvenile imagery, and the glib tone of many of the staff remarks, fit into the typical “boys will be boys” gamer milieu that dominated gamer culture in the US prior to the last decade. But years of concerted efforts to make games more accessible to women and other marginalized players have diminished that rampant sexism, and in 2024, it’s difficult to read some of these statements as anything but hopelessly dated at the least and actively hostile to women in games at worst.&nbsp;It doesn’t help that the company has so far <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/black-myth-wukong-sexism-controversy-interview-no-comment/\">responded</a> to media requests regarding this history with “no comment.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To gamers on the right, this outcry from the left was validation — a sign that the woke media had gone off the rails in its haste to bash anything that appeared to be anti-diverse. “Let me tell you, I am delighted just as the next guy that journalists and DEI advocates just can” cope with Wukong’s success,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/1f0tgu1/is_black_myth_wukong_a_good_game_though/\">wrote</a> one redditor on Reddit’s longstanding pro-<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/20/20808875/gamergate-lessons-cultural-impact-changes-harassment-laws\">gamergate</a> subreddit KotakuInAction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet despite all of this background, there’s nothing really objectionable in the game itself. Claims that <em>Wukong</em> has no women are false; there are plenty of female characters, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDe27jK6Do4\">female</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YYLB_cNFEU\">bosses</a>, and (as far as we could see from a jaunt across the internet) there’s nothing overly sexualized or fetishistic about their designs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for claims that the game lacks diversity, while this is true in a technical sense, in that it lacks racial diversity, it’s also a fantasy about an anthropomorphized rhesus macaque fighting a huge array of other fantastical creatures of all shapes, sizes, and species. And it’s set in a world based on a culture to which US gamers generally have limited exposure. The game itself offers a valuable experience merely by introducing its players to the culture and folklore of China.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is that a low bar? Possibly, but it’s still one not everyone meets. “I was in a second-hand bookshop the other day and suddenly held<em> The Monkey King</em> in my hands,” one gamer <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/1f0tgu1/is_black_myth_wukong_a_good_game_though/ljue8ix/\">wrote</a> on the aforementioned KotakuInAction post. “I might buy it next time and read it and then buy the game (on sale!). I think it will enhance the experience significantly.” This might be a rare perspective (that user, alas, was ruthlessly downvoted). Fans of <em>Wukong</em> using the game to rail against wokeness aren’t necessarily <em>for</em> embracing Chinese culture, but a nimble riff on that culture is still on offer through the game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most annoying thing about the debates surrounding <em>Wukong</em>, in fact, is just how little they have to do with the actual game. They’re being waged almost entirely in meta-arguments rather than actual consideration for either the narrative itself or the aims of the developers who made it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What this fight <em>does</em> tell us, however, is that unlike neighboring Korea, China’s <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3275726/will-black-myth-wukong-gaming-mania-mark-turning-point-chinas-soft-power-fortunes?module=perpetual_scroll_1_RM&amp;pgtype=article\">foray</a> into exporting its soft power will likely be fraught with distrust and even bad faith. Fandom, and gaming, are toxic cultures on a good day — and the tentative entry of Chinese creators into the fray will likely only exacerbate the worst tendencies of the worst players.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In the world of video games, it’s possible with a simple cheat code — type “motherlode” in <em>The Sims</em>, watch a flood of money roll in, redecorate your whole mansion. For a brief, wild moment, a viral TikTok trend suggested that such a shortcut could exist in real life, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The money “hack” worked like this: Over the weekend, news of a “glitch” spread on TikTok claiming that Chase bank was allowing people to withdraw funds from a deposited check right away. People took advantage by writing themselves massive checks, depositing them, and then withdrawing stacks of cash at ATMs. “We are aware of this incident, and it has been addressed,” a spokesperson for Chase wrote to us over email. “Regardless of what you see online, depositing a fraudulent check and withdrawing the funds from your account is fraud, plain and simple.” Chase did not clarify how much money had been withdrawn, or what repercussions there would be for people who had cashed fake checks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the weekend bonanza, videos of <a href=\"https://x.com/seamorechaos/status/1829946659687547205\">people</a> who had allegedly scammed Chase seeing negative balances in the tens of thousands have also started popping up. While there are countless videos talking about the so-called “Chase money glitch” on TikTok now, many of the top ones are wisely noting that <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@darryl2times/video/7409753108596903214\">cheating a</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jazmindaneen/video/7409428372666813727\">big bank</a> out of money is not likely to end well. The Chase fraud isn’t particularly sophisticated, and very easy to trace — especially when you brag about it online. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is pretty much traditional check fraud,” says Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. “There’s nothing really new about this.” Banks have been reporting <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-alert-nationwide-surge-mail-theft-related-check-fraud-schemes-targeting\">soaring rates of check fraud</a> in recent years, which can take different forms. This form, where you write a check you can’t back and take advantage of the money the bank supplies in the interim, is known as “check kiting,” but someone could also steal your check and carefully change the amount and recipient. <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams\">Fake check scams</a> have been on the rise, too: You get mailed a check from someone asking you to deposit it, using a variety of lies and excuses as to why they can’t do it themselves. Then they ask you to send some or all of the money back. It’s a scam because the funds from the check might show up in your account, but it “doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s already been checked,” says Palmer. By the time the bank verifies that it was a fraudulent check and takes back the money, you’ve already sent the cash back to the scammer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you cash a check that’s fake and then withdraw money, you’re still responsible for the money that you withdrew,” Palmer says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chase did not respond to a question on whether it was an error in its system that allowed people to withdraw more money than they typically could from a newly deposited check, or whether they were exploiting the ordinary way that a portion of funds is made available when someone deposits a check, known as the “float.” Usually, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.chase.com/personal/banking/education/basics/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-check-to-clear\">waiting period</a> for the full balance of a deposited check to appear in your bank account — it can take a few business days for larger amounts, or if you don’t have an open account with the bank. “Sometimes, as a courtesy, the bank does make a portion of the check available right away,” notes Palmer. US banks are also generally required to make <a href=\"https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/help-topics/bank-accounts/funds-availability/funds-availability-check.html\">at least $225 available</a> by the next business day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s worth noting that even when banks make a mistake — no fraud involved — customers usually <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/bank-error-your-favor-can-you-keep-cash-n735316\">don’t get to keep the money</a>. Financial institutions don’t operate under “no takesy-backsies” rules. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Chase Check Fraud Incident of 2024 is emblematic of a pattern of financial pro-tips and quick hacks offered on social media platforms like TikTok: They’re not smart shortcuts to save money or earn a little more. At best it’s bad advice that won’t improve your finances, and at worst they’re straight-up illegal. One example from last year: a TikToker telling viewers they can easily charge a $100,000 watch on a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/articles/dont-believe-this-terrible-tiktok-advice-about-getting-free-money-from-business-credit-cards/\">business credit card</a> and never pay it off. “With business credit, you are not personally held responsible for that line of credit,” the user @greenthumbgotbands claims in <a href=\"https://x.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1671513512236163073\">the video</a>. (In a later video, he said <a href=\"https://x.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1672351601804341248\">it was a joke</a>.) To be clear, even with a limited liability company, or LLC for short, you can absolutely be personally liable for business debt, especially when it’s fairly easy to prove that you were <a href=\"https://weisblattlaw.com/blog/protect-assets-with-llc/\">mingling personal and business purchases</a> — like a flashy watch. Your credit card company might also <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/business/using-business-credit-card-for-personal-expenses/#consequences\">shut down</a> your business’s credit line. Early this year another <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/debug/tiktok-investing-credit-card-advice/\">TikToker made waves</a> by promoting one easy trick to increasing your credit limit: by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/19827mp/tiktok_business_coach_posts_video_advertising_how/\">sending invoices</a> to your own LLCs and then paying them with a credit card. It looks like your business is getting a lot of income, and it looks like your credit cards are getting high usage, which are both factors used to determine higher credit limits. This is also likely fraud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Australia, a viral financial tip in 2021 advertised as a way to get a quick government loan led to the country’s tax office being <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/tiktok-gst-fraud-hit-on-tax-office-blows-out-to-4-6b-20230813-p5dw2y\">defrauded of $4.6 billion</a>. The advice, which spread widely on TikTok, instructed people to register a fake business and claim tax refunds on fake business expenses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The genre of uncredentialed <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229551/tiktok-personal-finance-day-trading-tesla-scam\">money gurus</a> teaching social media disciples how to get rich quick has exploded in recent years. While you can find some sensible, common sense guidance on money, bad TikTok financial advice runs the gamut from morally questionable to the downright ruinous, whether it’s advising homeowners to get a roommate and charge them the entire monthly mortgage (or more) without disclosing that they’re the landlord — that’s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@twoguystakeonrealestate/video/6942652559534460166\">called “house hacking”</a> — or maxing out credit cards to buy an Airbnb property you can’t actually afford. “I see a lot of real estate advice that really doesn’t make sense,” says Palmer. “Nothing is stopping someone from calling themselves a financial expert, or adding letters after their name on social media.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re really unlucky, the advice you uncritically follow from TikTok won’t just drain your bank account or tank your credit score — it could actually be a crime. It’s unclear what will happen to the money glitch fraudsters. “It’s really up to Chase if they want to follow up and prosecute fraud that has been done to them,” says Palmer. Check fraud laws vary across jurisdictions, but in some states writing a bad check can be a felony if the amount is large enough (in Texas, for example, it’s <a href=\"https://www.rtoddbennettpc.com/blog/2023/07/understanding-theft-by-check-in-texas/\">$2,500</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With the proliferation of digital banking and personal finance apps, it has become easier to download an app, open an account with a financial institution, and start making some pretty consequential money-related decisions. There’s a sense in which much of our financial transactions and systems don’t quite feel grounded in reality — money isn’t cold hard cash, it’s a number displayed in an app. It’s easier to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/23875697/ios-17-apple-pay-overspending-tap-to-pay-tech\">overspend</a>, and also easier to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/your-money/mobile-payment-venmo-zelle-cash-app.html\">simply get scammed</a>. The FTC reported a <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/facts-about-fraud-ftc-what-it-means-your-business\">record amount of money</a> lost to scams last year, with about $10 billion reported lost. Younger people, spending a lot of time online, are actually <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/23882304/gen-z-vs-boomers-scams-hacks\">more likely to fall prey to a scammer</a> than baby boomers are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People have to be really skeptical when they see these sorts of suggestions online, because they can easily lead you down a path where you are breaking a law without even possibly realizing it,” says Palmer. The “I didn’t know” defense typically doesn’t absolve someone in the eyes of the law, even if it leads to a lesser penalty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also true that sometimes — if you’re already wealthy or in the right, secretive financial circles — you can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/28/how-to-get-away-with-financial-fraud\">get away with fraud</a> for many years. You can wade in the muddy waters where the law is untested on whether you’re only <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/2024/3/13/24086102/billionaires-wealthy-tax-avoidance-loopholes\">minimizing the taxes you owe</a> or outright evading them. Tax laws and benefits are already structured to <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/billionaires-tax-avoidance-techniques-irs-files\">favor capital and the ultra-rich</a>, and even if you get into legal trouble, you can hire lawyers to mount a strong challenge in court. But for the vast majority of us, there simply isn’t a shortcut to making a heap of money.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

During her time there, she noticed something interesting about who tended to be most excited about the Trump movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Those most enthralled with Donald Trump were not at the very bottom — the illiterate, the hungry,” she writes. Rather, Trump’s biggest fans could be found among “the elite of the left-behind,” meaning people “who were doing well within a region that was not.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an observation that cuts against <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/8/4/23818817/trump-support-david-brooks-economic-anxiety\">the prevailing theory of Trumpism</a>: that he is the tribune of the left-behind and impoverished white people suffering due to globalization. It is also one that is backed by hard data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/nationally-poor-locally-rich-income-and-local-context-in-the-2016\">In 2020</a>, three political scientists studied <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ogorzalek-Piston-and-Puig-2020-Nationally-rich-locally-poor.pdf\">how location and income affected white voters’ voting decisions</a>. They found that, on a national level, poorer white people were indeed more likely to vote for Trump than richer ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But when you factored in local conditions —&nbsp;the fact that your dollar can buy more in <a href=\"https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/Mississippi-Biloxi\">Biloxi</a> than <a href=\"https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/Massachusetts-Boston\">Boston</a> — the relationship reverses. “Locally rich” white people, those who had higher incomes than others in their zip codes, were much more likely to support Trump than those who were locally poor. These people might make less money than a wealthy person in a big city, but were doing relatively well when compared to their neighbors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Put those two results together, and you get a picture that aligns precisely with Hochschild’s observations. Trump’s strongest support comes from people who live in poorer parts of the country, like KY-5, but are still able to live a relatively comfortable life there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what does this mean for how we understand the Trump-era right? It cuts through the seemingly interminable debate about Trump’s appeal to “left behind” voters and helps us understand the actual complexity of the right’s appeals to region and class in the United States. America’s divisions are rooted in less income inequality per se than is widely appreciated, and often tied to divisions inside of communities and social groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Stolen Pride</em>, Hochschild locates the heart of Trump’s appeal to rural voters in emotions of pride and shame — including pride in their region’s traditions and shame in what it’s become in an era of declining coal jobs and rising drug addiction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Roger Ford, a KY-5 entrepreneur and Republican activist who serves as Hochschild’s exemplar of Trump’s “locally rich” base, Trump helps resolve those emotions by offering someone to blame. Ford may not be suffering personally, but his region is&nbsp;— and Trump’s rage at liberal coastal elites helps him locate a villain outside of his own community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“He based his deepest sense of pride, it seemed, on his role of defender of his imperiled rural homeland from which so much had been lost — or, as it could feel, ‘stolen,’” she writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ford’s comments to Hochschild shift seamlessly between economic and cultural grievances. In discussing his opposition to transgender rights, he situates it as the latest in a long line of dislocations that people in his region faced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“With all we’re coping with here, we’re having a hard <em>enough</em> time,” he tells Hochschild. “Then you make it fashionable to choose your gender? Where are we going?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This comment might make it seem as if economic concerns are somehow prior to cultural ones, and people like Ford are angry at transgender people because of economic deprivation in coal country. But high-quality research tells a different, more complicated story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, scholars Kristin Lunz Trujillo and Zack Crowley examined the political consequences of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0962629822000725\">what they call “rural consciousness” for politics</a>. They divide this consciousness into three component parts: “a feeling that ruralites are underrepresented in decision-making (‘Representation’) and that their way of life is disrespected (‘Way of Life’) — both symbolic concerns — and a more materialistic concern that rural areas receive less resources (‘Resources’).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When they tried to use these different “subdimensions” of rural consciousness to predict Trump support among rural voters, they found something interesting. People who saw the plight of ruralities in cultural and political terms were most likely to support Trump, while those primarily concerned about rural poverty were, if anything, less likely to support him than their neighbors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taken together, these findings suggest that the story isn’t simply that economic deprivation breeds cultural resentment. Trump’s strongest supporters in rural areas tend to be angry that their regions don’t set the social terms of American life: that they don’t control the halls of power and that, as a consequence, both political and cultural life is moving away from what they’re comfortable with. Economic decline surely exacerbates this sense of alienation, but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94\">it isn’t at the heart of it</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This more sophisticated understanding of rural white politics contributes to a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/trump-american-gentry-wyman-elites/620151/\">broader</a> literature <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/family-capitalism-and-the-small-business-insurrection/\">complicating</a> how we think of Trumpism’s class base, be it <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/trump-american-gentry-wyman-elites/620151/\">Floridian boat paraders</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/family-capitalism-and-the-small-business-insurrection/\">GOP mega-donors</a>. This body of work suggests that the conventional class shorthands political commentators use — rural versus urban, elite versus the working class, the one percent versus the rest — are of limited utility in discussing the political economy of Trumpism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To really understand what’s happening on the right today, we need to pay attention to the divisions within these broad groupings.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Then, influencers got more ambitious with “<a href=\"https://www.eater.com/24105047/you-dont-need-to-decant-your-groceries-kitchen-storage\">decanting</a>” videos documenting a method of pantry organization involving transferring foodstuffs from the grocery store packaging to clear containers in neat rows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now it’s “fridgescaping.” This is roughly what it sounds like: The interiors of refrigerators are organized and decorated, with the most popular posts of the genre featuring fridges that look less like cold storage and more like a bohemian fairy garden. Milk goes in farmhouse pitchers, eggs line up ceramic trays, and butter hides under dishes shaped like animals. Berries, ever ubiquitous, are placed attractively in vintage bowls, raw vegetables stand at attention, and items that have no place in a fridge — bouquets of flowers, photos in frames, string lights — are given prominent placement. That the refrigerators are meticulously clean is a given, and they’re often new and large.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7400918601911389470\" data-video-id=\"7400918601911389470\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@lynziliving\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving?refer=embed\">@lynziliving</a> <p>A Hobbit refrigerator has been my most requested fridgescape theme ever, so I went on a quest to tackle it. I’ve honesty been very nervous because I really wanted to do it justice for everyone. I was heavily influenced by Bilbo Baggins’ kitchen in The Hobbit right down to the doilies! This was also very similar in a lot of ways to Outlander with the very primitive style dishware and fresh herbs and plethora of textures. It was very fun to create as I’m currently vibing the natural texture in the refrigerator.  I wish I had been recording, but when Dave opened the refrigerator he was so excited. It’s his favorite one yet. I love getting his refrigerator stamp of approval. 😭😭  Side note: the bread was eaten for dinner. It’s fine, I promise. 😂 I also forgot the potatoes. 😭 <a title=\"theshire\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/theshire?refer=embed\">#theshire</a> <a title=\"shire\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/shire?refer=embed\">#shire</a> <a title=\"thehobbit\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/thehobbit?refer=embed\">#thehobbit</a> <a title=\"hobbithouse\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hobbithouse?refer=embed\">#hobbithouse</a> <a title=\"hobbitcore\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hobbitcore?refer=embed\">#hobbitcore</a> <a title=\"hobbithome\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hobbithome?refer=embed\">#hobbithome</a> <a title=\"lordoftherings\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lordoftherings?refer=embed\">#lordoftherings</a> <a title=\"fridgescaping\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fridgescaping?refer=embed\">#fridgescaping</a> <a title=\"fridgescape\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fridgescape?refer=embed\">#fridgescape</a> <a title=\"refrigeratororganization\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/refrigeratororganization?refer=embed\">#refrigeratororganization</a> <a title=\"fridgeorganization\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fridgeorganization?refer=embed\">#fridgeorganization</a> <a title=\"kitchenorganization\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/kitchenorganization?refer=embed\">#kitchenorganization</a> <a title=\"kitchendecor\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/kitchendecor?refer=embed\">#kitchendecor</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ The Shire: Concerning Hobbits (From Lord of the Rings) - San Fernando Symphonic Assembly\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/The-Shire-Concerning-Hobbits-From-Lord-of-the-Rings-6791379316836927489?refer=embed\">♬ The Shire: Concerning Hobbits (From Lord of the Rings) &#8211; San Fernando Symphonic Assembly</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a trend piece, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/style/fridgescaping-fridge-decorating-tiktok.html\">the New York Times declared</a> “[N]ot even the inside of your fridge is safe from decorating.” It reports on fridgescaping as a “creative outlet” for some and, according to one influencer, a means to make food “more accessible” to her three young children. Another tells the Times that spending three hours on a forest-themed fridge is worth it because she is “more excited” to eat her produce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It’s hard to fathom that influencers are meticulously creating a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7400918601911389470\"><em>Hobbit</em>-inspired fridgescape</a> and buying so much produce that their fridge <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jenefertaylor/video/7150726446682623275?lang=en\">looks like</a> a Dutch Golden Age still life</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As someone with a cooking background — my father has been a chef for 35 years, my mother’s side of the family runs a spice business, and I grew up running around commercial kitchens and worked for a year as a line cook, in addition to writing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spice-Advice-Wisdom-History-Saltiness/dp/1510735259\">a book on spices</a> — I find myself deeply disturbed by fridgescaping. It is, I believe, the culmination of a series of trends that serve to alienate people from food. It removes all the labor, the mess, the physicality, and the pleasure inherent in eating, and replaces it with public performance. There are better ways to organize a kitchen, techniques that can improve functionality and prioritize goals like reducing food waste — and, yes, that could even lead to eating more fruits and vegetables.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The rise of fridgescaping</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cooking at home for the majority of us not wealthy enough to outsource it requires an immense amount of time and labor: coming up with a meal plan, making a list, going to the store, shopping, unloading, chopping, sautéing, simmering, and doing the dishes after. This is out of reach for <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/key-statistics-graphics/\">millions of Americans</a> experiencing food insecurity, the many millions more living with low food security, or those who simply don’t have enough hours in the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shabazsays/video/7384908970835594528\" data-video-id=\"7384908970835594528\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@shabazsays\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shabazsays?refer=embed\">@shabazsays</a> <p>If you’re not fridgescaping.. what are you doing?  🤯🤯<a title=\"duet\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet?refer=embed\">#duet</a> <a title=\"stitch\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stitch?refer=embed\">#stitch</a> with  @lynziliving <a title=\"fridgescaping\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fridgescaping?refer=embed\">#fridgescaping</a> <a title=\"restock\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/restock?refer=embed\">#restock</a> <a title=\"restocking\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/restocking?refer=embed\">#restocking</a> <a title=\"bridgeton\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bridgeton?refer=embed\">#bridgeton</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Shabaz Says\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7384909007951317793?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; Shabaz Says</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that reality, it’s hard to fathom that influencers are meticulously creating a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7400918601911389470\"><em>Hobbit</em>-inspired fridgescape</a> and buying so much produce that their fridge <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jenefertaylor/video/7150726446682623275?lang=en\">looks like</a> a Dutch Golden Age still life. It goes without saying that fridgescaping — and its pantry cousin, decanting — prioritizes displaying and arranging food, instead of preparing and eating it. That’s not to mention all the unnecessary aesthetic upkeep, like changing out the water of that bouquet. Imagine doing all that and also recording yourself doing it, then sitting down to edit the footage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is to say: Fridgescaping is a scam of the classic keeping-up-with-the-Joneses variety for the TikTok age. In these clips, hours of labor are squeezed into 30 seconds of beautification, following the before-and-after formula so successful on social media. These videos suggest you too can have the beauty and bounty of a fridge decked out <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7381862181010181407\"><em>Bridgerton</em> style</a> if you <a href=\"https://www.shopltk.com/explore/Lynziliving/productsets/11ef1bc31026792d929a0242ac11002d\">purchase</a> the additional storage and knickknacks. Conveniently, you can click a link and buy everything you see from the influencer’s online store, where they receive a cut. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lynziliving/video/7407151543646014751\">Plenty</a> of rationalizations exist (the produce!) but they’re undercut when those same creators urge their followers to “shop my fridge!”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s very easy to connect any capitalist endeavor to food,” said <a href=\"https://utulsa.edu/people/emily-contois/\">Emily Contois</a>, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Tulsa and co-editor of <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=58mye9fd9780252044465\"><em>Food Instagram</em></a>, “because it’s something we have to do to survive — but it’s also something we genuinely want to do because it’s pleasurable, and doing it with other people, eating it with other people, preparing it with other people can also bring such profound pleasure.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Add in the gendered expectations around food preparation and cleaning, and fridgescaping can be seen as yet another domestic task expected of women: to not only shop, cook, and clean the kitchen, but to make it all look beautiful, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Your kitchen should be a space of purpose, not just aesthetics</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I no longer cook professionally, but as a regular working person who cooks daily in a well-functioning home kitchen with an average amount of storage space,<strong> </strong>I have good news: You don’t need to live a life of ample wealth and leisure to smartly organize your kitchen. There are free or very cheap ways to do it with function in mind, without totally sacrificing aesthetics (although you won’t be needing fairy lights anytime soon).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I consulted with the chefs in my life — my dad Brian Moog, and my brother-in-law Justin Behlke — for their practical advice on making the best use of your own time, space, and labor — and, as an avid home cook, added some tried-and-true tips of my own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Make your produce last much longer</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You should store most fresh produce in the refrigerator to maximize lifespan and give space and air to anything that’s packed tightly together to help it stay good for longer — I guess you’d call that a kind of decanting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can look at how they’re storing produce in the store,” my dad said. “If they’re storing something in water, like asparagus, you can do that at home too.” In addition to freeing the asparagus from their rubber band, he cuts the bottom of the stems, like flowers, and puts them in half an inch of water in a deli container in the fridge, where they last up to 10 days. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He also removes lettuces and pre-cut greens from bags and clamshells and places them in&nbsp;airtight containers with paper towels at the bottom and top. Raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries are likewise placed in a single layer on a piece of paper towel in airtight containers. Heads of lettuce, kale, herbs, and scallions can be simply wrapped in dry paper towels to achieve similar results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For my dad and brother-in-law, paper towels are the secret weapon to keeping produce fresh. As fruits and lettuces spend time in the fridge, moisture leaks out, which condenses and leads to the foods going bad faster. You want paper towels to absorb that excess. “The amount of paper towels I use …” Justin said. “There are all sorts of specialty containers, but usually those specific things are marketing gimmicks.” (For those who want a reusable option, try plain cotton or linen napkins to achieve a similar keep-fresh effect.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Paper towels are the secret weapon to keeping produce fresh</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So don’t be ashamed of paper towel use. “There’s a lot of value in paper towels,” Justin said. “There’s balance to keep in mind, but there’s a lot of practicality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Flour is the only dry good he puts in a plastic container, with a lid that’s easy to get off and an opening wide enough to dip a measuring cup into — mostly because flour bags create a mess every time they’re opened. “Keeping yourself and the cooking area clean saves time,” he said. “It seems nominal but it adds up.” That’s the kind of practical consideration you should keep in mind as you’re making your own kitchen decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I also recommend putting brown sugar in an air-tight container. After years of gouging it, rock-hard, from the bag, I can pop off the lid and scoop soft, moist sugar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Keep perishables front and center</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fridgescaping influencers talk a lot about how their methods help them keep track of their produce, but a few simpler methods achieve the same results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s true that “out of sight, out of mind” is a cursed reality when it comes to perishables in the fridge, so keep short shelf life items at the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t use the crisper drawers for fruits and veggies. I put condiments in one and, being a Wisconsinite, cheese in the other. I know certain produce lasts longer in the crisper drawers, but all that meant for me was produce languishing there for a few extra days because I’d forget about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, if your household consumes meat, try putting it in a see-through plastic container at the front. This keeps it front of mind and cordons it off from other food.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The real key to my family’s approach to reducing food waste is the use of a whiteboard on the fridge, where we note the meals we’ve bought ingredients for. Seeing those meals listed reminds us about the foods likely to go bad fastest, so we cook those first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We also keep a running shopping list on a second whiteboard. Whenever we’re low or out of something, we add it to the list, so by the time we’re going shopping we’re not trying to remember everything we need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>You don’t need to buy expensive plastic “storage systems”</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You don’t need professional-grade equipment or specialty gadgets, but professional-grade storage is key. For a lot of chefs, this means deli containers and cambros.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/779/deli-take-out-containers.html?srsltid=AfmBOoob6HEfRB8Do4xUff1usM9FoID_WrNkpHi9Z3ULOMS6sO_6_Msl\">Delis</a> are round plastic storage containers most commonly used in <a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/choicehd-32-oz-microwavable-translucent-plastic-deli-container-and-lid-combo-pack-case/128HD32COMBO.html\">32-ounce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/choicehd-16-oz-microwavable-translucent-plastic-deli-container-and-lid-combo-pack-case/128HD16COMBO.html\">16-ounce</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/choicehd-8-oz-microwavable-translucent-plastic-deli-container-and-lid-combo-pack-case/128HD8COMBO.html\">8-ounce</a> sizes. They stack in the cupboard, saving room, but also when used in the fridge, freezer, or pantry, regardless of which size you’re using. They’re a staple in restaurant kitchens, and they’re cheap and sturdy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/3087/food-storage-containers.html?vendor=Cambro\">Cambros</a> are larger containers made of thick, sturdy plastic with tough lids. A couple of these live on top of our fridge, and we pull them down to use as a mixing bowl, to make dough, and to cook big batches of food. The square cambros are ideal for storing large-batch leftovers, prepped ingredients (like chopped onions and carrots), and soups,&nbsp;they take up just as much room as a mixing bowl but because of their square shape they fit more efficiently and stack more readily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Use tape to label the food in the delis and cambros (no, you don’t need to cut it with scissors like they do on <em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/358672/the-bear-season-3-review-food-main-character-fine-dining\">The Bear</a></em>). Noting the date something was made can come in handy in both the short and long term. A “made on” date attached to leftovers containing meat, for example, is helpful when deciding whether to dig back in after a few days. And for items that won’t spoil, like syrups or caramel, it’s helpful when clearing out the fridge to realize which products have been occupying valuable real estate for six months without being used. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/IMG_5775_f51367.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A shelf in the author’s pantry. | Caitlin PenzeyMoog\" data-portal-copyright=\"Caitlin PenzeyMoog\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For pantry organization, try recycling old containers or using what you have instead of buying new ones. For instance, I use my loaf tins for granola bars and baby crackers on a pantry shelf to make the packages more accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t buy the idea that putting everything in clear plastic containers is helpful. I know how much cereal is left in the box every time I pour it into a bowl; I know how much mustard is left each time I squirt it out. When I notice them running low, I add them to the running grocery list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Kitchen organization is a process, not a one-off event</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My dad and Justin both say that organizing a kitchen is less an exercise in perfection and more about refining as you go along. “My biggest piece of advice is to remain conscious,” my dad told me. “I’ve set up a lot of kitchens, and I see the angst of it. People want to be able to move into a new space and put every item in the best place, but that’s just not realistic.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Don’t worry about finding the right spot for each and every item. Know that you’ll figure it out with an open mind combined with time spent in the kitchen. “It takes time. It takes trial and error,” my dad told me. “You just need to exist in your kitchen space for a while before you set it up perfectly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My dad is still fine-tuning his own organizational scheme. He recently realized pasta rollers were taking up a prime spot in a drawer when he hadn’t made pasta from scratch in two years. “It’s time to go to the basement,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One day you’ll realize, ‘this just doesn’t work here,’ and you’ll move it to the right spot,” said Justin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A kitchen is a living and ripening room. Not only will items gravitate to the correct spots, but those spots will likely evolve. Farmers market hauls in the summer require a different setup than cookie-baking season in the winter, and that’s to say nothing of new functions needed in a kitchen when a baby is born or a new roommate moves in. Even when you’ve achieved a well-functioning kitchen, it’s helpful to internalize Heraclitus’s adage that the only constant in life is change. “It’s a mindset,” my dad said. Somebody just needs to tell the fridgescapers.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

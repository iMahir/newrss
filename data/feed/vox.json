However, if dispatches of <em>Wicked</em> screenings around the country are any indication, this code isn’t being followed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the few days since the highly anticipated musical movie <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/386247/wicked-2024-movie-novel-ending-explained-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo\"><em>Wicked</em></a> arrived in theaters, it’s been difficult to scroll through social media without seeing photos — if not entire scenes —&nbsp;of the film taken from patrons’ phones. In-theater recordings of <em>Wicked</em>’s signature number “Defying Gravity” are all over TikTok. <a href=\"https://x.com/nat_dwbua_/status/1860541618060943677\">One X<em> </em>user</a> went viral for asking fans to post photos they had snapped during the movie. This immediately ignited a conversation among film critics and cinephiles about a lack of theater etiquette in the general public. But is it totally their fault?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s safe to say that the film marketing tactics of the past few years have taught people how to show up to movies — ready to whip out their phones. That’s not to mention the advent of streaming, plus the years spent mostly inside during the pandemic, that have certainly played a role in a lack of movie-going etiquette.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23789864/barbenheimer-barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-release-memes-double-feature\">Barbenheimer</a>, movies aren’t just meant to be shared with a room full of people but with others on social media. The endless merch and product tie-ins that come with IP films, as well as more organic efforts to dress up for screenings, have made the extremely mundane experience of sitting in a dark room for a couple of hours &#8220;content.&#8221; But what happens to moviegoing when it becomes all about sharing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Moviegoing for the ’gram</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an effort to recoup losses from the pandemic, there have been more and more incentives for people to get off their couches and back into movie theaters. These innovations certainly enhanced the moviegoing experience beyond snacking on popcorn, ultimately making it a lot more shareable and post-worthy online. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since 2019, when AMC offered <a href=\"https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2024/11/22/how-the-specialty-popcorn-bucket-is-helping-build-out-the-theater-experience\">specially designed R2-D2 popcorn buckets</a> to coincide with the release of <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em>, novelty items have made a huge comeback. Now, they’re an expected bonus when buying tickets for the year’s biggest releases. Over the past few years, AMC has sold uniquely designed buckets and cups for buzzy movies like <em>The Mario Bros. Movie</em>, <em>Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé</em>, and <em>Dune: Part Two</em>. The last film’s elaborately designed bucket — with an opening resembling the mouth of a sandworm — was so attention-grabbing that it got its own parody song on an episode of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl_Xhvgkxrk\"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The popcorn bucket for ‘DUNE 2’.<br><br>(via: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3CFilmss?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@3CFilmss</a>) <a href=\"https://t.co/FzNZjGJiTC\">pic.twitter.com/FzNZjGJiTC</a></p>&mdash; DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1750669926816182408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/362928/how-to-see-twisters-4dx-perfect-way-imax-rpx-explained\">4Dx experience</a> is another in-theater development that patrons can’t stop posting about. The immersive format, involving motion seats and practical effects, gained a lot of word-of-mouth popularity this year for movies like <em>Madame Web</em>, <em>Twisters</em>, and <em>Deadpool and Wolverine. </em>Much of this word-of-mouth, though, has occurred online, particularly on TikTok where <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sharmedlife/video/7393729832238042398?q=4dx%20&amp;t=1732734281770\">influencers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@allyb1226/video/7400158266266815774?q=4dx%20&amp;t=1732734281770\">regular</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@yourboymoyo/video/7238331364293102874?q=4dx%20&amp;t=1732734281770\">customers</a> film themselves being thrust around and sprayed with water while the movie’s playing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Outside of theaters, studios are <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/movie-marketing-spends-summer-films-1235142253/\">investing more and more money</a> into elaborate marketing campaigns for their buzziest movies, the most notable cases being the 2023 hit <em>Barbie</em> and this year’s <em>Wicked.</em> This advertising has largely manifested in endless brand collaborations, from <a href=\"https://pressroom.lexus.com/drive-the-magic-lexus-unveils-a-wicked-pair-of-rides/\">luxury cars</a> to <a href=\"https://www.crocs.com/c/cast-of-characters/wicked?gclid=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V9r16y4M6AfvJSTaWB0mYsiMwfQ2-GipciKFAxbgly9P16pZr-9VrQaAoE-EALw_wcB&amp;adid=ppc_google_us_brand_wicked_searchgooglebrandcollections_x_x_x&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V9r16y4M6AfvJSTaWB0mYsiMwfQ2-GipciKFAxbgly9P16pZr-9VrQaAoE-EALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4035!3!717308216836!e!!g!!wicked%20crocs&amp;gad_source=1\">Crocs</a>, all designed to&nbsp;be collected and shared on social media with the movie’s hashtag. The ubiquity of the marketing suggests that if you aren’t seeing these movies in theaters, you’re missing out on a huge monocultural moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Studios have also turned to influencers to provide <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/film-critics-social-media-influencers-screenings-publicity/\">early reactions to movies</a>. Sometimes, these popular X and TikTok users are invited to advance screenings alongside journalists. In more and more cases —&nbsp;like with <em>Gladiator II</em> and <em>Wicked — </em>they’re given earlier access to these movies than some critics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid all of these orchestrated marketing movies, it seems as though customers are finding unique ways to enhance the moviegoing experience for themselves. For example, the trend of “themed dressing” feels like an earnest expression of movie fan culture with organic roots. In the past, this trend has been reserved for movies associated with “nerd culture,&#8221; like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em>. But <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/gallery/barbie-oppenheimer-street-style-photos\">“Barbenheimer”</a><em> </em>made this activity more of an instinctual habit for the average moviegoer. Without the instruction of a studio, everyone got the memo to wear pink to their screenings of <em>Barbie</em> and, on a lesser scale, black to see <em>Oppenheimer</em>. Since then, marketers have clearly taken notice. This seemed evident in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itendswithusmovie/reel/C-dIFmsPeWH/?hl=en\">promotional video</a> Blake Lively filmed earlier this year for the domestic abuse movie <em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud\">It Ends With Us</a></em>, where she urged ticket-buyers to “wear their florals” in theme with the movie’s florist protagonist. The same phenomenon is occurring at <em>Wicked</em> showings, where fans are arriving in pink or green clothes, and even full-on green face paint to imitate the main character Elphaba.&nbsp;If fans weren’t planning on dressing up themselves, the pink-and-green marketing certainly implied that it was a crucial part of the theater experience.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What happens to a communal space when it’s all about content?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since <em>Wicked</em>’s premiere, moviegoers have been posting their reactions to the film — along with their themed outfits —  on TikTok and X, often directly from the theater. One <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@fredasquith/video/7440889417750809888?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387\">trend</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bacobell_/video/7440845864546929951?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387\">that’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@yourstrulybusie/video/7440330399710072094?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387\">proved</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gia.mariano/video/7440953771108076846?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387\">popular</a> is a format where a user posts themselves before the movie starts with a hard cut to their emotional reaction during the credits or outside of the theater. In other cases, people have <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@imogenhorton/video/7441177027815738656?q=reactions%20during%20wicked&amp;t=1732730139853\">filmed themselves</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@songsbyralph/video/7441433639751077175?q=reactions%20to%20wicked&amp;t=1732730084783\">person next to them</a> reacting to the movie while they’re watching it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of these emotional responses are genuine. But the urge to self-broadcast in the middle of a film speaks to a misunderstanding or, in some cases,&nbsp;complete disregard for the sanctity of movie theaters. In its worst interpretation, it shows a lack of respect for other people’s in-theater experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@imogenhorton/video/7441177027815738656\" data-video-id=\"7441177027815738656\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@imogenhorton\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@imogenhorton?refer=embed\">@imogenhorton</a> <p>When I tell you my whole seat was shaking I was sobbing THAT much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 (I did already pre warn the couple sitting next to me at the beginning that I would cry A LOT) 😂😂😂 genuinely the best thing I’ve ever watched in my life, I don’t even know where to begin.

Elphaba is such an incredible character than I think so many of us could actually benefit from just absorbing even an inch of her strength, her moral compass, her kindness and the fact she doesn’t care about fitting in, she does what she thinks is RIGHT.

In the case of <em>Wicked</em>, many users have posted photos of the film, including spoilers or pivotal scenes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Undoubtedly, studios’ recent embrace of <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/features/how-social-media-influencers-are-transforming-film-marketing/5187462.article\">influencers as marketers</a> has something to do with this. In an article for <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/movie-marketing-spends-summer-films-1235142253/\">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, writer Pamela McClintock said that, as “advertising on TV is more complicated and expensive,” studios have had to explore different promotional routes including “TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube and other platforms.” Likewise, influencers are now&nbsp;appearing at press junkets, activations, and other events, implying that moviegoing is also about engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Entertainment reporter Raven Brunner says that screenings have contributed to the movie-posting problem, given that influencers and even critics are encouraged to take photos and post them. “When you go to an early screening, they have that customized banner before the movie starts that you&#8217;re supposed to take photos of,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard not to draw a line from the posts that circulate after an advanced screening — whether it’s from a film account or a <a href=\"https://people.com/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-transform-kim-kardashian-home-wicked-magical-screening-party-8732640\">celebrity</a> — to the average moviegoer snapping photos during <em>Wicked</em>. Comedian and writer Josh Gondelman thinks this problem exposes a tendency for moviegoers to view themselves as “creators” first. As a result, they end up prioritizing what they share with others over their own personal consumption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There are so many ways to be like, ‘hey, check me out. I&#8217;m a person in the world engaging with culture,’ which I think is pleasant,” he says. “But you can do it without making everyone else&#8217;s experience in the theater secondary to your followers&#8217; later.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, he doesn’t think all movie-posting comes from a shallow, attention-seeking place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I always try to be understanding and appreciative of people who want to do, like, a long vlog response to something and just want to share their thoughts on art,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, there are basic rules of behaving in public that people, particularly in a younger, more online generation, are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23835782/concert-attack-cardi-b-pink-ashes-movie-theater\">struggling with</a>. The past few years since the pandemic spent largely inside watching movies on streamers presumably haven’t helped.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At a bare minimum, these inescapable spoilers and leaked scenes show an enthusiasm around movies (or at least certain titles). Maybe there’s hope that, in a world where young people have been influenced to see movies again, they can also be influenced into turning off their phones.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Stores offered almost-impossible “doorbuster” deals on TVs and hand blenders, shoppers rose before dawn to wait in line to get them, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/article/black-fridays-most-gruesome-injuries-and-deaths-through-the-years/\">violence ensued</a>, and the tinsel-covered period when retailers finally operated “in the black” began in earnest. <br><br>It’s probably for the best, then, that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmarts-black-friday-crowds-chaos-over-employees-couldnt-be-happier-2023-11\">Black Friday is not what it was even 20 years ago</a>. A movement to recognize its toll on retail workers eventually <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/11/29/22808238/black-friday-2021-pandemic-shopping\">convinced several stores to close on Thanksgiving</a> so workers could be with their families, instead of stocking for the busy day ahead. Holiday shopping <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/22/online-shopping-has-grown-rapidly-in-u-s-but-most-sales-are-still-in-stores/\">has continued to move online</a>. And the thrill of a deep, one-day discount has morphed into a numbing, month-long thrum of flash sales, Cyber Monday specials, and member appreciation events.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a> deputy editor Izzie Ramirez has reported extensively on the state of American consumerism, from our habit of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370626/consumerism-circular-economy-single-use-recycling-landfill-garbage\">buying, using, and throwing away literal tons of stuff</a> each year, to how the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23529587/consumer-goods-quality-fast-fashion-technology\">quality of the things we’re purchasing — from appliances to undergarments — is progressively getting worse</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I caught up with her to talk about why Americans’ shopping habits have transformed, what the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-59239afe12033ca99c65c7a2be0e4f0d\">threat of high tariffs</a> might mean for big-ticket goods, and how sales bonanzas like Black Friday are part of a larger effort by retailers to keep us shopping, to our own detriment, and the planet’s. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Lavanya Ramanathan: So, the quality of our stuff is worse now. Tell me a bit about that, as we stare down a period when Americans will be buying a ton. </strong><br><br><strong>Izzie Ramirez: </strong>I would like to preface this by saying everyone thinks that I&#8217;m anti-shopping, and it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m anti-shopping; I actually love shopping. Materials are fun, materialism is fun, except for when it&#8217;s not. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I started <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23529587/consumer-goods-quality-fast-fashion-technology\">writing about it </a> because I came across a problem, and the problem was that my brand-new bra absolutely sucked. Shouldn&#8217;t new things be better? Isn&#8217;t this, like, the whole promise of capitalism, in a way? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I really wanted to get a mass-production understanding of what&#8217;s going on, and talk a little bit about the decline of repairability, and what we can do about it. Because I do think that people want to buy things that make them happy, that last and fit into their lives. And it sucks when you invest your money and you don&#8217;t get your money&#8217;s investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s less that companies want to be making worse-quality goods. In the case of my bra, it&#8217;s more that for the cost of producing something like my bra, you can&#8217;t do the same thing for the same amount of money. Something has to give, and it&#8217;s going to either be labor or the quality of the material, and it&#8217;s usually a little bit of both. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Knowing all of that, what is a good way to approach something like Black Friday? There are all sorts of deals, like TVs for $50. With some of these, is it just throwing good money after bad? Is there actually a way for the consumer to be a winner?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m going to be a hypocrite with this. I usually think Black Friday is bad, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/386042/trump-tariffs-economy-global-trade\">but if Trump does enact tariffs</a>, then maybe Black Friday might be good for larger purchases, such as washing machines, dishwashers, and other major appliances, because tariffs would create conditions for those globalized objects, where you need parts from a billion different places, to become way, way, way more expensive. And if they don&#8217;t become more expensive, those are going to be the very objects that become way worse, very, very rapidly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>That’s bad advice for most circumstances. There is a lot of science and psychology behind buying things. On Black Friday, you feel like you don&#8217;t have time. It is entirely a lie, because they run the same sales regularly. If you know anything about Black Friday, they do the same sales every year. It&#8217;s not like that sale is never going to happen again. Or the Sephora sale. It really grinds my gears when I see people posting Sephora hauls, like they&#8217;re never gonna do the members sale again. They do, two or three times a year. It&#8217;s the scarcity mindset.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1801104722.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.1888422166698,100,83.62231556666\" alt=\"Shoppers inside a busy mall on Black Friday\" title=\"Shoppers inside a busy mall on Black Friday\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Shoppers flooded the Polaris Fashion Place mall in Columbus, Ohio, on Black Friday in 2023.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You have also written about hauls. We </strong><strong><em>are</em></strong><strong> shopping differently now. We shop online. It&#8217;s become that much easier to get things from all over the world. If I had to guess, I’d say there are a lot more brands, too — direct-to-consumer sellers of things like jewelry. What is happening to shopping itself?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/11/14/23955673/fast-fashion-shein-hauls-environment-human-rights-violations\">Hauls</a> are when people buy 10 or 15 or 20 different items in one go, and usually parade them around on social media. They&#8217;re buying things from places like Amazon, Temu, Shein, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. The thing about haul culture is that it also creates that mindset around scarcity, like, “Oh, you need this.” It normalizes mass consumption, and buying a lot all at once and regularly, and that it is a regular practice to spend that much money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> And if you&#8217;re not spending that much money, then you&#8217;re going to be spending at places like Shein that have $1 T-shirts, and that normalizes a dangerously low price for workers and the planet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>A lot of the things that you&#8217;re describing feel like new behaviors. There&#8217;s also a thing happening in our shopping ecosystem, and in our consumer culture, around demand for the new — for newness at all times.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, and I think so much of that is driven by that normalization of excitement around buying — dopamine shopping, wanting to feel something.

It’s often more intensely felt in the times when you are expected to be surrounded by the warm embrace of family and friends. And, increasingly, that warm embrace isn’t happening. Americans spend more time at home — alone — than they did 20 years ago, according to a <a href=\"https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-20-553/\">recent analysis </a>of federal data. The numbers went up dramatically during the pandemic and never came back down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the board, Americans have fallen away from activities that involve or require community. Religious service attendance is down dramatically. Two decades ago, over 40 percent of US adults attended religious services every week or nearly every week. Now, just 30 percent of Americans say the same, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642548/church-attendance-declined-religious-groups.aspx\">according to Gallup polling</a>. Other metrics of civic engagement have dropped off too: According to <a href=\"https://americorps.gov/about/our-impact/volunteering-civic-life\">one AmeriCorps study</a>, just 20 percent of Gen Z volunteer their time to help others, compared to almost 30 percent of Gen X.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Loneliness has been on the steady march for many decades, and one man has been watching its advance: <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/robert-d-putnam\">Robert Putnam</a>, a public policy professor at Harvard University and the author of 15 books, including the 2001 bestseller <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bowling-Alone-Revised-and-Updated/Robert-D-Putnam/9780743219037\"><em>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community</em></a>. The book was based on a simple premise: Once, Americans joined bowling leagues. Now, they are going bowling by themselves. In the book, Putnam extends the metaphor to speak to all our social connections, saying that their drop-off speaks to the decline of our democracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This half-century of civic decline is charted in a documentary about Putnam’s life that came out in 2023, called <a href=\"https://www.joinordiefilm.com/\"><em>Join or Die</em></a>. We wanted to hear more about the importance of a culture that embraces community activities, so we reached out to the man who inspired a thousand clubs himself.&nbsp;Noel King spoke with Putnam — though he prefers to be called Bob — for <em>Today, Explained</em> to discuss if “bowling alone” has grown even more acute, the role technology plays, and how to reverse the trend. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A\">Spotify</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1319-today-explained-87205166/\">wherever you get podcasts</a>.</p>\n\n<iframe frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP8778198437\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Volunteering is good for the person who is doing the volunteering, right? Is that a reason to volunteer?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Robert Putnam</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There&#8217;s a lot of evidence that if you&#8217;re volunteering to help somebody else, you&#8217;re probably getting more benefits out of it than they are, because there are all sorts of physiological changes. People after volunteering are happier than if you hadn&#8217;t volunteered. It&#8217;s one reason to volunteer. You don&#8217;t have to choose between the reasons. In writing the book <em>Bowling Alone</em>, I talked about the consequences of our connections with other people, both our actual in-person connections and our connections through political organizations. And that, as a community in which people are more connected with one another, the whole community functions better, not just the two people involved in a given exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let me give an example from education. If I, as a parent, get involved in my child&#8217;s school, I join the PTA or I volunteer in the classroom, that turns out to be good for my child. But the astonishing thing is my getting involved has even more effect on the success and the happiness of other kids in the school. In the book <em>Bowling Alone</em>, which was written [about] 25 years ago, I talked about the decline in these connections, decline in what I called social capital. And I said, “Gosh, if this continues, it&#8217;s going to be bad for American democracy. You know, we&#8217;re going to have more polarized politics,” and so on. And the reason that there&#8217;s now a little bit of a new wave of interest in my work is that I turned out to be right. Even more right than I thought. If you&#8217;ve not noticed, American politics is in a pickle right now, and the fundamental reason for that is because for the last 30 or 40 years, we as a country have become less and less connected with one another — in my jargon, with less and less social capital.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does the data bear it out? Because it feels like we&#8217;re more isolated now, and it felt that way when you wrote <em>Bowling Alone</em> 25 years ago. Is it true?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Robert Putnam</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes. Once upon a time there was a debate, there was a thought that maybe we don&#8217;t actually have to be in somebody&#8217;s presence. That we could see them on Zoom or social media would be just as good as actual social connections. For quite a while, the evidence has been that Facebook is not as good as bowling leagues. That is, you don&#8217;t get the same benefit from connecting with people via social media as you do from actually connecting with them face to face. That&#8217;s what <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563203000402\">the evidence has shown</a>. I can tell you when public opinion on that changed. It was just about November 25th of 2020, at the height of the pandemic, and everybody in America realized that hugging Grandma was not the same thing as actually seeing Grandma over Zoom. And it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People who might otherwise not leave the house very much join Reddit communities; people have WhatsApp chat groups with their relatives in other countries. I text my 14-year-old niece, who I don&#8217;t get to see very often. I hear you saying the technology has not been good for us and I want to make sure that we’re sure about that.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Robert Putnam</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m not saying that electronic connections are of no use to us. I&#8217;ve got lots of grandchildren and I&#8217;m texting with them or emailing with them literally every day. I&#8217;m not saying that social media or other forms of electronic connection are literally no good, I am saying they&#8217;re not as good as face-to-face ties.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So if, currently, we’re at a low point for social connection, what brought us here?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Robert Putnam</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the beginning of the 20th century, around about 1900, America was very polarized politically. Our politics were tribal. We were very unequal. There was economically a big gap between the rich, who were living on the Upper East Side of New York, and the huddled masses, the poor immigrants on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. We were very socially disconnected. We&#8217;d had connections back on the farm, where we knew other people, whether the farm was in Iowa or in southern Italy, but we&#8217;d all moved. There had been a huge movement from the rural areas to the cities, and we did not know our new neighbors, and so we were very socially isolated. And actually, we were culturally very self-centered. We were an “I society” rather than a “we society.” We didn&#8217;t think of ourselves as having a lot in common. And then beginning about 1910 — none of these things are super exact — but about 1910, all of those things began to change and they moved in a different, better direction for a half-century or more. So from roughly 1910 to roughly 1965 or 1970, every year we became less polarized politically, less socially isolated, less unequal, or more equal, and more of a “we” society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So we went from being an “I” society around 1900 to being a “we” society around, roughly speaking, 1965. The movements of the 1960s — which you no doubt you don&#8217;t remember, [but] I do remember that period — that was the culmination of a half-century long increase in political participation, increase in connecting with other people, increase in cooperation across party lines, increase in equality. And I have to say, this is just about the time when I personally began to vote. So you may think I personally brought these problems on America in the middle ’60s. All those lines turned and for the next half-century, up to now, every year we got more socially isolated, more politically disconnected, more unequal. We lost it all.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Could it work to sell joining clubs, volunteering, in-person engagement as, “This will make you feel good, I promise”? And the side effect is that it&#8217;s good for society, it’s good for democracy — but if you&#8217;re going to do it, do it for yourself? Think of it as a kind of self-care.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Robert Putnam</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The danger to your life expectancy from social isolation is <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">as big a risk factor for premature death </a>as smoking. If you did smoke and you had a choice, should you smoke? Or should you join a club? By all means, join the club! There are huge personal benefits from connecting with other people, including joining. The most important reason is actually that you should connect with other people. You will add years to your life expectancy.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;re going to live longer. And also you&#8217;re going to save American society.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Robert Putnam</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By the way, you&#8217;re also going to save American democracy. That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thanks to a new Netflix docuseries from true crime mainstay <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/5/18210945/ted-bundy-extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-vile-review-netflix\">Joe Berlinger</a>, audiences across the nation are asking a question true crime fans never really let go of.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new series, <em>Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey</em>, doesn’t actually spend all that many of its three hour-long episodes speculating about its title question. Instead, it spends most of them arguing a hot take that’s less hot than you might think — that JonBenét’s own parents <em>didn’t </em>do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> Following JonBenét’s violent death — which occurred sometime during the early morning hours of December 25 and 26, 1996, in her family’s massive home in Boulder, Colorado — that was a very popular theory. During the ensuing media frenzy, many members of the public looked at John Ramsey and his wife Patsy (who died in 2006) and assumed the case was open and shut. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The victim was an <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/184273-how-the-jonbenet-ramsey-case-affected-me-as-a-kid\">eerily</a> <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/6086362/_Necrophilia_Pedophilia_or_Both_The_Sexualized_Rhetoric_of_the_JonBenet_Ramsey_Murder_Case_\">sexualized</a> 6-year-old pageant queen; her face graced the tabloid magazine covers at every checkout line in America. In 1997, no single news story was bigger than this one; by 1998, the Los Angeles Times labeled her “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-28-ca-27182-story.html\">the nation’s most famous murdered child since the Lindbergh baby</a>.” And although a <a href=\"https://realnewjournalism.com/2016/09/17/jonbenet-ramsey-a-judicial-analysis/\">2003 federal ruling</a> supported the Ramseys’ innocence, and they were formally <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25608543\">exonerated in 2008</a>, many people remain convinced that one or both of JonBenét’s parents were the culprits and suggest they did it to cover up a horrible accident committed by their 9-year-old son. A hugely influential <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/burke-ramsey-now-rcna181229\">2016 CBS series</a> about the case confidently made that argument. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet in recent years, many experts, including several featured in Berlinger’s documentary, have argued that an intruder committed the crime — a theory that the original police investigation never really seemed to take seriously, and which led to deep divisions among Boulder police, the district attorney, and the FBI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the confusion stems from the problem that the original investigation was botched from the beginning, with police allowing the crime scene to be completely contaminated, evidence to be moved around and tampered with, rooms to be cleaned, and a string of visitors to traipse throughout the house for hours after the Ramseys called 911. This negligence torpedoed the integrity and reliability of nearly every piece of evidence in the case. As a result, even decades later, every detail remains up for debate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for a list of potential suspects, while there are several primary contenders, including the Ramseys, it’s often difficult to have an even-handed discussion about them. That’s likely all because of a single piece of evidence, one of the most infamous in true crime history: the ransom note. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For most people who look into the JonBenét case, how they view the ransom note determines how they view the rest of the case, including who did it. That’s because the ransom note itself is so inexplicable that it immediately, and perhaps permanently, biased and derailed the entire investigation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The strangest ransom note ever</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first weird thing about the ransom note is where Patsy claims to have found it — lying unobtrusively on the floor of a back spiral stairwell in the early-morning hours of December 26. She gave conflicting stories about the sequence of events: In one version, she checked JonBenét’s room first and noticed she was missing, and then found the ransom note; in the more frequently repeated version, she found the note first, then ran upstairs to check on JonBenét, only to discover her missing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The next weird thing about the ransom note is&#8230; well&#8230; everything about it. Here is the text in full:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mr. Ramsey,</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Listen carefully! We are a group of individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We [the word “do” has been scribbled out] respect your bussiness [sic] but not the country that it serves. At this time we have your daughter in our posession [sic]. She is safe and unharmed and if you want her to see 1997, you must follow our instructions to the letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You will withdraw $118,000.00 from your account. $100,000 will be in $100 bills and the remaining $18,000 in $20 bills. Make sure that you bring an adequate size attache [sic] to the bank. When you get home you will put the money in a brown paper bag. I will call you between 8 and 10 am tomorrow to instruct you on delivery. The delivery will be exhausting so I advise you to be rested. If we monitor you getting the money early, we might call you early to arrange an earlier delivery of the money and hence a [sic] earlier [“delivery” is scribbled out] pick-up of your daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any deviation of my instructions will result in the immediate execution of your daughter. You will also be denied her remains for proper burial. The two gentlemen watching over your daughter do not [“not” has been inserted between words] particularly like you so I advise you not to provoke them. Speaking to anyone about your situation, such as Police, F.B.I., etc., will result in your daughter being beheaded. If we catch you talking to a stray dog, she dies. If you alert bank authorities, she dies. If the money is in any way marked or tampered with, she dies. You will be scanned for electronic devices and if any are found, she dies. You can try to deceive us but be warned that we are familiar with Law enforcement countermeasures and tactics. You stand a 99% chance of killing your daughter if you try to out smart [sic] us. Follow our instructions and you stand a 100% chance of getting her back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You and your family are under constant scrutiny as well as the authorities. Don&#8217;t try to grow a brain John. You are not the only fat cat around so don&#8217;t think that killing will be difficult. Don&#8217;t underestimate us John. Use that good southern common sense of yours. It is up to you now John!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Victory!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">S.B.T.C</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a lot to unpack here: The strange ransom amount — $118,000 — corresponded to John’s year-end bonus that year from the lucrative tech company he ran. The note’s over-the-top language seems to be referencing well-known quotes from movies that feature abductions and ransoms, including <em>Dirty Harry</em>, <em>Ransom</em>, <em>Ruthless People</em>, and <em>Speed</em>. The “foreign faction” is very obviously not real, and “S.B.T.C.” has never been linked to any existing group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The final oddity about the note is where it came from — a notepad belonging to Patsy. The note’s author not only used the notepad, they wrote a draft version of the note originally addressed to “Mr. &amp; Mrs.” before directing the note just to John. They even used a Sharpie from the house that they then helpfully returned to the correct pen holder. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patsy participated in a string of handwriting analysis sessions, over which multiple analysts concluded it was probable, but not definitive, that she wrote the note. However, the modern understanding of handwriting analysis generally holds that it’s a shaky forensic arena prone to <a href=\"https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2023/jan/15/debunking-forensic-science-decade-increased-scrutiny-reveals-forensic-processes-prone-bias-and-error/\">significant cognitive bias</a>, and that less experienced analysts are <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2119944119\">more likely</a> not only to be wrong, but to be more confidently wrong than their peers. Other handwriting analysts have since <a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/news/9797920/jonbenet-ramsey-update-ransom-note-handwriting-gary-oliva/\">offered</a> totally different opinions about who wrote it. Behavioral analysts, too, tried to analyze the note with dubious results. To give you an idea of the kind of hysteria that surrounded this case, one official psychological profile <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19990224122955/http://www.seraph.net/jonbenet.html\">claimed</a> that “SBTC” could have meant “Saved by the cross,” and argued that Patsy was a “delusional sociopath” who committed the murder as part of an arcane religious ritual.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ransom note is so strange that for many people it’s impossible to get around the sheer improbability of anyone writing it at all. After all, what purpose could it serve an intruder to linger in the house after the crime, taking their time to write multiple drafts of a note, for a kidnapping that had not taken place?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One argument against this is that the intruder could have written the note <em>before</em> the crime. The Ramseys were away for hours at a Christmas party that evening, which gave a potential predator hours to enter the house, familiarize themselves with the home’s layout, and play around with creative writing exercises while waiting for the family to return and settle in for the night.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the question of motive — why?  — seems to lead, for most people, away from an intruder and straight back to a Ramsey: The note is so fantastical that the most glaringly obvious conclusion is that it was written by someone who was desperate to divert attention away from the home and away from the family. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a while, if that was the motivation, it worked: Boulder police assembled at the house but then left without securing it as a crime scene, leaving only one officer there throughout the day until JonBenét’s body was ultimately found by her father in the basement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet if this was really a cover-up by the family, the question of motive still remains: Why would the family leave (or place) JonBenét’s body in the basement if they wanted the police to think she’d been abducted? Why write such an elaborate ransom note or ask for such a specifically incriminating amount? Either way you look at it, the ransom note just doesn’t make sense. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For most people, there’s only one way to read the ransom note: Patsy wrote it. What else could it be?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One alternate way for us to think about this ransom note comes to us via <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/\"><em>The Consult</em></a>, a recent podcast hosted by former members of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/14/16474370/mindhunter-review-netflix-fincher\"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> fame. We know <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/12/18044688/criminal-profilers-mindhunter-hannibal-criminal-minds\">criminal profiling is as pseudoscientific</a> as every other cool-but-actually-junk forensic tool, so we have to take this analysis with many grains of salt. But in their <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/jonbenet-ramsey-the-ransom-note-part-1/\">two-part</a> <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/jonbenet-ramsey-the-ransom-note-part-2/\">series</a> studying the ransom note earlier this year, host Julia Cowley and her guest Robert Drew made interesting observations about the mindset of the letter writer — by honing in on the fact that they were really into movies about abduction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That sounds like an obvious point, but the profilers used it to make a salient point about the kind of person who could commit this crime. Every film referenced in the note involves a villain who, at the moment he’s making ransom demands, fully has the upper hand over the hero. He’s not only calling the shots, but doing so gleefully and maliciously, exactly as the letter writer may be attempting to do with John. The former FBI profilers argue that the letter is a fantasy of having control over someone rich and powerful — that it’s not an anomaly, but rather an extension of a crime scene created by a sadistic child abuser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This isn’t the only way to read the note, of course, but it’s a reasonable way to think about how the note fits into an intruder scenario. And given the resurgence of interest in the case, maybe this truly bizarre piece of evidence will finally start making some sense.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They are also the basis for security clearances necessary for high-level national security officials tasked with handling sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The checks are meant to reveal whether there’s reason to believe these potential officials might misuse the power of their offices or if they have any vulnerabilities that might be exploited, either by US citizens or foreign adversaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s possible that the FBI will be asked to do background checks next year. According to a report in the Guardian, Trump will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/26/trump-transition-team-fbi-security-clearances-background-checks\">request the background checks</a> once his own officials are posted at the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI. The transition team is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-fbi-gaetz-congress-background-vetting-cabinet-ac9afcd41d598a62ae34442ecf96a652\">reportedly relying on internal vetting</a> as well as outside law firms and unspecified allied groups to conduct the background checks, but the FBI is better equipped and has the training and capacity necessary to conduct these investigations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An FBI background check for political appointees is only customary; there’s no legal backing for it. No other branch of government can compel the nominees to undergo them. Trump himself has been skeptical of the FBI, so it’s not that surprising that he’s eschewed the background checks. But they do serve several important purposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s what you need to know about the FBI background checks.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s the standard background check process?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The FBI background check process is straightforward, if arduous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, the incoming administration signs a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice outlining what kinds of information they are looking for about their nominees and what resources the DOJ can provide to help uncover that information. Nominees who will be working in national security have to fill <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf\">out a special form</a> (the same one the&nbsp; Department of Defense uses in evaluating staff for security clearances).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The FBI can question the nominee and their contacts if necessary but cannot collect documents or compel evidence. Cooperation is voluntary, but as Llewelyn Engel, an attorney at the Washington, DC, firm Emery Will &amp; Henry, told Vox, “From an interview perspective, if the FBI calls you to ask about somebody, you might be more forthcoming” than with a law firm or other private entity conducting investigations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once complete, the full background check then goes to the president-elect who, based on the findings, can either refer the nominee to the Senate or decide to withdraw the nomination. If the nomination is for a high-level position, like a Cabinet member or an ambassador, the investigations go to the appropriate Senate committee —&nbsp;for example, the Senate Armed Services Committee for a Defense secretary nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Senate committee is in charge of looking at all this information, so they&#8217;ll get a big binder of all the material, and they can also do their own investigations as well,” Engel said. “They can always request that more information is collected about this individual.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again, the process isn’t mandated by law. The practice started when <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-cabinet-picks-fbi-background-checks-senate-b2649239.html\">President Dwight Eisenhower</a> chose to have his nominees subject to a background check and has continued since then.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Trump following the usual process?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus far, Trump has deviated from the usual process, although the incoming administration did sign other important transition agreements <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/26/trump-signs-transition-agreement-white-house-00191754\">with the Biden White House on Tuesday</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/26/trump-signs-transition-agreement-white-house-00191754\">Politico</a> that “progress has been made towards an agreement” between the Trump team and the DOJ, but how much progress remains unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;The Trump-Vance transition lawyers continue to constructively engage with the Biden-Harris Administration lawyers regarding all agreements contemplated by the Presidential Transition Act,&#8221; Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5196441/the-trump-transition-team-is-breaking-with-norms-in-selecting-cabinet-picks\">told NPR</a>. &#8220;We will update you once a decision is made.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Justice Department said in a statement that it is “prepared to deliver briefings to the transition team on our operations and responsibilities, and we stand ready to process requests for security clearances for those who will need access to national security information.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why isn’t Trump following the standard process?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No other president-elect has eschewed the FBI background check process “in recent memory,” Heath Brown, a professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told Vox.&nbsp; And Trump hasn’t said why he hasn’t tasked the FBI with doing background checks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He does, however, have a noted <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-facing-criminal-charges-calls-defunding-fbi-2023-04-05/\">distrust of the FBI</a> following investigations into his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/8/3/23818752/trump-investigations-classified-documents-live-updates\">handling of secret documents after he left office in 2021</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/capitol-violence\">FBI investigations into the January 6, 2021, insurrection</a> and attempt to overturn the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as previously noted, there’s no law requiring Trump to follow the normal process. <a href=\"https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=6315\">Reps. Ted Lieu of California and Dan Beyer of Virginia</a> introduced a bill in November to codify the practice in the law, but it hasn’t passed yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of following the typical process, Trump’s transition team plans to have the FBI checks go forward only after he has taken office —&nbsp;that is, after he is in control of the agency and has his own appointees in place, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/26/trump-transition-team-fbi-security-clearances-background-checks\">the Guardian reported Wednesday</a>. According to that report, Trump also plans to grant blanket security clearances, though it’s unclear whether or how the DOD will be involved in that process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What happens now?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without the FBI background checks, the various Senate committees can conduct their own investigations into nominees, according to Engel and Jennifer Selin, associate professor at the Arizona State University Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor College of Law. Those investigations may or may not become public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even without FBI investigations, potential red flags with nominees will sometimes emerge through reporting. The press resurfaced allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general\">former Attorney General nominee Matt Gaetz</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/387404/trump-cabinet-nominations-matt-gaetz-pete-hegseth-rfk-elon-musk-linda-mcmahon\">Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth’s</a> alleged sex crime also came to light through news stories. Both men have denied wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The media is in some ways a good ally for the Senate because it&#8217;s not just the senators delving into and using their subpoena power and their background and connections with various agencies to get information and to conduct their own investigations,” Selin said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Senate will ideally <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/politics/cabinet-confirmation-recess-what-matters/index.html\">begin confirmation hearings</a> —&nbsp;with or without the FBI reports —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-fbi-gaetz-congress-background-vetting-cabinet-ac9afcd41d598a62ae34442ecf96a652\">before Inauguration Day on January 20, 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Audiences came in prepared to love <em>Wicked</em>’s famous power ballads and girl power core, but one aspect of the story seems to have caught people by surprise: its somewhat clunky yet remarkably durable political allegory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I noticed that Elphaba is like Kamala Harris and the Wizard is like Donald Trump,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked/comments/1et3biy/i_noticed_that_elphaba_is_like_kamala_harris_and/\">one fan posted on Reddit</a>. “A charismatic leader who gaslights a community that this woman is wicked just because she’s standing up for a marginalized group of people in the society, how could that be [political]?” <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/director-jon-m-chu-wicked-politics-trump-election-1235068371/\">director John M. Chu joked</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a silly, spectacular show about friendship and talking animals, <em>Wicked</em> actually does invite political interpretations. Its allegory can both elicit eye rolls and still feel eerily prescient more than 20 years after its stage debut. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Wicked</em> the musical is based on a 1995 novel of the same title by Gregory Maguire, an anti-fascist treatise in which the Wizard becomes a Hitler-like despot. The musical wouldn’t go quite so far when it debuted on Broadway in 2003, but it did get in a number of <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/wicked-musical-west-end-b1929995.html\">hits at the George W. Bush administration</a>, which had ordered the invasion of Iraq only months earlier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Wicked</em>, the Wizard is revealed to be disenfranchising the talking animals of Oz, on the grounds that to unify the rest of the country, he has to give them a common enemy. Yet the Wizard’s persecution of animals —&nbsp;and, later, of Elphaba —&nbsp;is rooted in a lie, in the same way that Bush falsely claimed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction before invading.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the references are glaringly obvious: When Dorothy’s house falls on the Wicked Witch of the East, Glinda echoes the Bush administration’s favorite Iraq War euphemism in describing it as a “<a href=\"https://today.williams.edu/magazine/delusions-of-regime-change-in-iraq/\">regime change</a>.” “Is one a crusader or ruthless invader?” sings the Wizard, referencing <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/with-us-or-a-terrorist-bush-and-bashars-holy-wars-against-terrorism/\">Bush’s infamous description of the invasion of Iraq as a crusade</a>. “It’s all in which label is able to persist!” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Critics’ responses were mixed. “As a parable of fascism and freedom, <em>Wicked</em> so overplays its hand that it seriously dilutes its power to disturb,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/movies/theater-review-there-s-trouble-in-emerald-city.html\">Ben Brantley declared in 2003 at the New York Times</a>, adding that the show “wears its political heart as if it were a slogan button.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, author Daniel Handler, though taken aback by such a dark interpretation of sunny and magical Oz, found himself drawn to the idea. “It is hard not to wonder if the witch, a difficult figure transformed by difficult times, isn&#8217;t precisely what our stage needs,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/theater/theater-hey-watch-who-you-re-calling-wicked.html\">Handler also wrote in the New York Times</a> that same year. “And perhaps, the show suggests, ‘wicked’ is what the W stands for” in George W. Bush.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Singing the same lyrics today, the Wizard suggests not Bush but Trump: a leader consolidating his power by scapegoating <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24080265/trump-immigration-policies-2024\">marginalized</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380861/trump-transphobic-anti-trans-ads-scapegoating\">groups</a> and slowly but surely denying them their rights. Meanwhile, the difference in strategy between rabble-rousing progressive Elphaba and conciliatory liberal Glinda might hit home particularly hard for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/383565/2024-election-results-kamala-harris-loss-democrats-future\">Democrats in the midst of their post-election recrimination</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both Elphaba and Glinda idolize the Wizard and dream of working at his right hand. When Elphaba learns of the plight of Oz’s animals, she heads straight to the Emerald City to seek his help, certain that if he learns that the animals are being targeted, he’ll rush to their aid. The Wizard suggests he might do so if Elphaba uses her magic as part of his administration, but when she learns that it’s the Wizard behind the attacks, she disowns him, much to the dismay of practical-minded Glinda.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p> <em>Wicked</em> was born to be an allegory of American politics. It can’t quite be anything else.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I hope you’re happy how you’ve hurt your cause forever,” Glinda sings. Elphaba, after all, is alienating a potential powerful ally. “I hope you’re proud, how you would grovel in submission to feed your own ambition,” replies Elphaba, who has decided she will not work with anyone who is using his power to hurt Oz’s talking animal citizens. Could you read this moment as an allegory over <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-were-hammered-with-misleading-attacks-on-transgender-issues-the-party-is-grappling-with-how-to-move-forward\">how Democrats should handle trans issues going forward</a>? Sure, it sounds like a stretch, but it&#8217;s not as far-fetched as you might imagine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a way it’s odd to think that <em>Wicked</em>’s political messaging feels so prescient, since most <em>Wicked</em> fans would agree that the political subplot is the weakest part of the musical. <em>Wicked</em> lives and breathes by the fraught friendship between its two leads, not by its duelling visions of activism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, in another sense, <em>Wicked</em> was born to be an allegory of American politics. It can’t quite be anything else. That’s what Oz stories are for.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of the most children’s fantasy classics of the Anglophone world are English: think of Peter Pan, Narnia, <em>The Sword in the Stone</em>, and Harry Potter. They tend to think about what it means to be a good king, about wild magical beasts lurking in the forest, about being an island nation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, though, is an American fantasy. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map-of-Oz.jpg\">A map of Oz</a>, which is shaped like a rectangle with its long side horizontal, is a simplified map of America, as though drawn by a child: unimaginably vast, spanning the inhabitable entirety of a continent from east to west. (Oz is bordered by poisonous deserts rather than oceans.) It is a country where farmers cultivate fields of corn and wheat and orchards of apples; where industrialists build vast, glittering cities; where the west is full of rough and unsettled land. And it is a country governed by a con man who is lying to the people he rules.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Map-of-Oz.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.460732984293,100,75.078534031414\" alt=\"Map of Oz\" title=\"Map of Oz\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When L. Frank Baum wrote <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em> in 1900, he imagined the Wizard of Oz as someone who was well-meaning if ineffectual and a touch dishonest. “I&#8217;m a very good man — just a bad wizard,” the Wizard explains to Dorothy in the 1939 film. Still, the Wizard can work as a remarkably cynical metaphor for all the broken promises of the American dream. The Wizard is a man who will promise you everything but give you nothing, and then he will tell you the answer was inside of yourself all along.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s this metaphor that gives <em>The Wiz</em>, the all-Black reimagining of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> from the 1970s, its surprisingly sharp bite. In <em>The Wiz</em>, Dorothy and her friends are Black people who are promised certain fundamental rights by a government that never plans to pay up. (<em>Wicked</em> gestures at a similar critique by casting the Black actress Cynthia Erivo as the racially othered green-skinned Elphaba.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Public office is the last refuge of the incompetent,” the Scarecrow scoffs in <em>The Wiz</em>, after learning that the Wizard is a washed-up politician from Atlantic City. “Incompetent!” the Wiz crows. “That&#8217;s me!” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Wicked</em>, meanwhile, is not a reimagining of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> so much as it is a revisionist history. As such, it is fundamentally skeptical of figures in authority — much more so than Baum, who eventually replaced the Wizard with the virtuous and nearly infallible fairy queen Ozma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The premise of any story that tells you that the villains of your childhood are misunderstood is that the storytellers were lying to you. In <em>Wicked</em>, the Wizard isn’t just a very bad wizard, but a very bad man, too. He lies maliciously and with strategic purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Wizard can work as a remarkably cynical metaphor for all the broken promises of the American dream.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elphaba and Glinda, here, become just two more dreamers who travel to the Emerald City like Dorothy and her friends, because they want the Wizard to give them their hearts’ desire: protection for the talking animals of Oz as they become steadily more persecuted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet the Wizard they encounter is not only incapable of granting them such a request, but in fact plans to pervert it, using their innocent wishes to enact more violence. He plans to take Elphaba under his wing and have her do magic on his behalf so he can more thoroughly persecute the sentient animals he plans to round up and more efficiently spy on the rest of his citizens. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the end, the Wizard names Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch of the North because he can trust Glinda to maintain friendly relations with his administration, while Elphaba refuses. He is America governed not by a con man but by a strong man —&nbsp;an authoritarian dictator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the kind of metaphor a revisionist history can offer you, and part of why <em>Wicked</em> feels so bizarrely urgent at this moment. In a subversion of a childhood classic, no authority figure can be trusted — which is what makes these stories so attractive when people you don’t trust have found their way into positions of power. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

His past history of drinking and passive-aggressive behavior eventually led to a seven-month period of estrangement. But they began reconciling after her dad started going to Alcoholics Anonymous, which prompted him to reach out. He told her that he missed her and he hoped they could have a relationship again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“He was willing to work on himself and willing to change the way he navigated the world, and the way he ran his relationships,” Rego says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a44178122/family-estrangement-cut-off-parents/\">Estrangement</a> is a well-worn story — in 2019, a survey found that <a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/09/pillemer-family-estrangement-problem-hiding-plain-sight\">27 percent of Americans over the age of 18 were estranged from a family member</a> — but less discussed is reconciliation and the process of coming back together after falling apart. The reasons for estrangement can vary, from a single breach that feels too large to overcome to years of slights and misunderstandings piling up. These kinds of emotional wounds naturally take time to heal and, crucially, no one is owed reconciliation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But estranged parties might wonder: What does it look like to try to mend a broken relationship? Is it even possible? And to reconcile, do you have to face the things that tore you apart in the first place?</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP6363425276\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The paths to reconciliation</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two possible paths to reconciliation, says <a href=\"https://www.drjoshuacoleman.com/\">Joshua Coleman, PhD</a>, a psychologist who conducts counseling on estrangement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One scenario includes reckoning with the issues that led to estrangement. In this scenario, an estranged child and parent may go to therapy together to understand their dynamic more deeply. “I say that the purpose of this therapy is to really demonstrate to your adult child if you’re capable of taking responsibility and then understanding why they felt [estrangement] was the healthiest thing for them to do,” Coleman says. “You might need to … deepen your understanding of how your behavior impacted your child, even if it’s at odds with your own recollections of what happened in the past.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coleman is most often approached by a parent who is estranged from their adult child who cut off contact. Usually, Coleman encourages the estranged parent to write a “letter of amends” where they show understanding and take responsibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second path to reconciliation requires the wounded party to accept “the inherent flaws” of the person they’ve been estranged from. The former person may ultimately conclude that despite the problems present, they still want to continue an important relationship. There is no grand reckoning — more of a softening, an understanding that the person you were estranged from may never fix their flaws or change their mind but you want to be in their life regardless. “They just want family and they don’t want to continue to be estranged,” Coleman says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was the case with Sydney, who was outed to her evangelical parents as gay at the age of 18.&nbsp;(Her last name is being withheld to protect her privacy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After her parents found out, they determined the family would pray about it together. But what happened, Sydney, now 27, says, was unimaginable, with her parents and older brother holding her down while praying, “screaming and spitting” like in an exorcism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“By the end of it, I was screaming, ‘I love Jesus,’” she told me. “Anything I could to just get them off my body.” In the middle of the night, Sydney’s girlfriend came to pick her up, and she didn’t speak to her parents for nearly a year until her mother approached her begging for forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even though Sydney’s parents’ behavior was abhorrent and a fundamental rejection of who their daughter was, she decided to give them another chance after she says they showed “genuine remorse.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In her case, their reconciliation was part reckoning and part softening. Though her mother apologized for that night, her parents still made it clear they didn’t support her being gay. When Sydney got into a new relationship, her girlfriend wasn’t allowed to come to her parents’ house. But she has a relationship with her parents, something that had initially seemed impossible during their period of estrangement.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How can people approach reconciling?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/kap6\">Karl Pillemer, PhD,</a> a  Cornell University professor and author of <a href=\"https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/kap6#:~:text=Fault%20Lines%3A%20Fractured%20Families%20and%20How%20to%20Mend%20Them\"><em>Fault Lines: Fractured Families and How to Mend Them</em></a>, says one of the first steps to reconciliation is the phase when one of the estranged begins to ponder the possibility. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They start to consider whether they might want to reestablish contact,” Pillemer says. “Often, they become aware that something has changed in the other person’s life. A substance abuser has stopped abusing substances. A person in a relationship where the spouse repelled the rest of the family has gotten divorced.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was the situation with Rego. “My dad gives me hope that people can acknowledge that their way isn’t the right way, that they can change and grow and be different,” she says. Now, Rego and her father meet weekly for coffee, “on a neutral ground that is not either of our homes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pillemer recommends that anyone looking toward reconciliation be sure that their methods of getting in contact aren’t invasive. “Avoid anything that looks like stalking, but demonstrate your openness,” he says. Don’t show up to a family dinner unannounced, for example. One method he’s seen work is communicating by card, letter, or through a neutral third party such as a family member who is not involved in the estrangement.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Establishing boundaries</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A critical component of successfully reconciling is establishing boundaries. Many estrangements occur because of violated boundaries, so it’s important to protect your peace in this way. Boundaries may include topics of conversation that are not to be discussed — like someone’s political views or parenting choices — or behavioral expectations, like asking a family member not to drink or yell in your presence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Pillemer’s research for the Cornell Family Estrangement and Reconciliation Project, he found that effective reconciliations often had very clear terms. Sydney used this method with her parents. “I make it clear to them, if you say homophobic stuff when I’m in the room, if you say disrespectful stuff, I will leave and not talk to you,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In some cases, Pillemer says, initially instituted boundaries were later loosened, but the act of setting them in place helped facilitate reconciliation. Boundaries can be a way of focusing on the future instead of the past.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Pillemer’s research, successful reconciliations tend to include clear terms, boundaries, and an understanding that the two parties may never agree on what tore them apart in the first place. “People gave up on the idea that they were going to reconcile their ideas of what went on in the past,” Pillemer says. “Everyone accepted that life had occurred, but that they had to look forward in the relationship.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Does reconciliation last?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both estrangement and reconciliation are not static states, Pillemer says. They are dynamic and can be moved into and out of throughout a relationship. But even an attempt at reconciliation can give people a sense of relief. “Many of [my research subjects] told me that they’d learned an extraordinary amount about themselves,” Pillemer says. “Having done it was a life challenge that they felt improved their self-concept and sense of self-efficacy.” It seems that even attempting to reconcile can help ease the intensity of feelings around estrangement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a parent who may be estranged from their child, it can be difficult to come to terms with the child’s view of their upbringing, according to Coleman. “It’s a psychological achievement on the part of the parent to be able to tolerate the adult child&#8217;s reckoning of their childhood,” he says. There&#8217;s a lot of work these days for both sides to do.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coleman tells me about his own estrangement from his daughter, who cut off contact with him when she was in her 20s. At first, Coleman responded “more defensively than emphatically” to his daughter’s view of conflict in their relationship. “I didn’t take the responsibility that I later learned is really required… It wasn’t until I radically shifted my position that she began to come back and things began to improve.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From that experience, Coleman says he learned that estranged parents have to be empathetic and curious about the child’s reasons for estrangement and they have to take responsibility. He also learned how “nightmarish” it is to be an estranged parent, which has helped him approach estranged parents in his therapeutic practice with empathy. “Knowing what other estranged parents are going through… has been helpful to me in terms of being able to help them strategize about points of reconciliation and outline the steps that they would need to take.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What if the other party doesn’t want to reconcile?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is, of course, no guarantee that a reconciliation attempt will be welcomed by the other party. “It takes two to reconcile,” Rin Reczek, PhD, a professor in sociology at the Ohio State University, said. “Much as is the case with the reconciliation of a romantic relationship, it’s impossible to reconcile a family estrangement if one person is not interested, capable, or willing to reestablish contact and connection. We cannot coerce or force someone to reenter a relationship with us — and if we try, we risk further damage.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if an attempt at reconciliation fails, Pillemer says a grieving process is necessary to move forward: “Go through the experience of loss and go through the stage of it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite how prevalent estrangement is, stories of reconciliation prove that it doesn’t have to last forever. People can and do find their way back to each other. “If there’s an opportunity for someone to demonstrate that they’ve had a change of heart, give them a chance,” Sydney tells me. “You never know what could happen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong><em>Clarification, November 20, 3:35 pm ET</em></strong><em>: A previous version of this story was unclear about the timeline of Kerry Rego’s dad&#8217;s sobriety.</em></em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

We will collectively eat more than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/22/23970874/thanksgiving-turkey-farming-jennie-o-hormel-white-house-pardon\">40 million turkeys</a> — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics\">factory farmed</a> and heavily engineered animals that bear scant resemblance to the wild birds that have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2010/11/22/131516586/who-brought-the-turkey-the-truth-about-the-first-thanksgiving\">apocryphally written into</a> the Thanksgiving story. (The first Thanksgiving probably didn’t have turkey.) And we will do it all even though turkey meat is widely considered flavorless and unpalatable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is, almost without fail, a dried-out, depressing hunk of sun-baked papier-mâché — a jaw-tiringly chewy, unsatisfying, and depressingly bland workout,” journalist <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/this-is-why-most-thanksgiving-turkeys-are-fucking-awful/\">Brian McManus wrote for Vice</a>. “Deep down, we know this, but bury it beneath happy memories of Thanksgivings past.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what is essentially the national holiday of meat-eating revolves around an animal dish that no one really<em> </em>likes. That fact clashes with the widely accepted answer to the central question of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363550/factory-farming-human-progress-sustainable-food-movement\">why it’s so hard to convince everyone to ditch meat</a>, or even to eat less of it: the taste, stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Undoubtedly, that has something to do with it. But I think the real answer is a lot more complicated, and the tasteless Thanksgiving turkey explains why.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get Vox’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">Processing Meat newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">here</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>’s biweekly newsletter from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\">Marina Bolotnikova</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\">Kenny Torrella</a>, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Have questions or comments on this piece?</strong>&nbsp;Email me at marina@vox.com!</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Humans crave ritual, belonging, and a sense of being part of a larger story — aspirations that reach their apotheosis at the Thanksgiving table. We don’t want to be social deviants who boycott the central symbol of one of our most cherished national holidays, reminding everyone of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/22/23970874/thanksgiving-turkey-farming-jennie-o-hormel-white-house-pardon\">animal torture</a> and environmental degradation that went into making it. What could be more human than to go along with it, dry meat and all?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our instincts for conformity seem particularly strong around food, a social glue that binds us to one another and to our shared past. And although many of us today recognize there’s something very wrong with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363550/factory-farming-human-progress-sustainable-food-movement\">how our meat is produced</a>, Thanksgiving of all occasions might seem like an ideal time to forget that for a day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my experience, plenty of people who are trying to cut back on meat say they eat vegetarian or vegan when cooking for themselves — but when they are guests at other people’s homes or celebrating a special occasion, they’ll eat whatever, to avoid offending their hosts or provoking awkward conversations about factory farming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this Thanksgiving, I want to invite you, reader, to flip this logic. If the social and cultural context of food shapes our tastes, even more than taste itself, then it is in precisely these settings that we should focus efforts to change American food customs for the better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s eating with others where we actually have an opportunity to influence broader change, to share plant-based recipes, spark discussion, and revamp traditions to make them more sustainable and compassionate,” <a href=\"https://www.peakanimalsanctuary.org/natalie\">Natalie Levin</a>, a board member at PEAK Animal Sanctuary in Indiana and an acquaintance of mine from vegan Twitter, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hundreds of years ago, a turkey on Thanksgiving might have represented abundance and good tidings — a too-rare thing in those days, and therefore something to be grateful for. Today, it’s hard to see it as anything but a symbol of our profligacy and unrestrained cruelty against nonhuman animals. On a day meant to embody the best of humanity, and a vision for a more perfect world, surely we can come up with better symbols.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Besides, we don’t even like turkey. We should skip it this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The misery of the Thanksgiving turkey&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, my colleague Kenny Torrella published a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/22/23970874/thanksgiving-turkey-farming-jennie-o-hormel-white-house-pardon\">wrenching investigation</a> into conditions in the US turkey industry. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Broad Breasted White turkey, which accounts for <a href=\"https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/probing-question-what-heritage-turkey/\">99 out of every 100 grocery store turkeys</a>, has been bred to emphasize — you guessed it — the breast, one of the more valuable parts of the bird. These birds grow <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/turkeys-are-twice-as-big-as-they-were-in-1960/546104/\">twice as fast</a> and become nearly twice as big as they did in the 1960s. Being so top-heavy, combined with <a href=\"https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/predisposing-factors-that-affect-walking-ability-in-turkeys-and-broilers\">other health issues</a> caused by rapid growth and the unsanitary factory farming environment, can make it difficult for them to walk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another problem arises from their giant breasts: The males get so big that they can’t mount the hens, so they must be bred artificially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Author Jim Mason detailed this practice in his book <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/593428/the-ethics-of-what-we-eat-by-peter-singer-author-of-animal-liberation-and-jim-mason/\"><em>The Ethics of What We Eat</em></a>, co-authored with philosopher Peter Singer. Mason took a job with the turkey giant Butterball to research the book, where, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Ethics_of_What_We_Eat/fRtZDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=turkey+inseminator&amp;pg=PA28&amp;printsec=frontcover\">he wrote</a>, he had to hold male turkeys while another worker stimulated them to extract their semen into a syringe using a vacuum pump. Once the syringe was full, it was taken to the henhouse, where Mason would pin hens chest-down while another worker <a href=\"https://animaloutlook.org/investigations/hargin/\">inserted the contents</a> of the syringe into the hen using an air compressor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Workers at the farm had to do this to one hen every 12 seconds for 10 hours a day. It was “the hardest, fastest, dirtiest, most disgusting, worst-paid work” he had ever done, Mason wrote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wild, turkeys live in “smallish groups of a dozen or so, and they know each other, they relate to each other as individuals,” Singer, author of the new book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691231686/consider-the-turkey?srsltid=AfmBOorHW75BSf9ZYW3ELb3S7JT8Ra4iwphwKshFeEVNfXpdfy8risnO\"><em>Consider the Turkey</em></a>, said on a recent episode of the <a href=\"https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/simple-heart/episodes/The-First-Open-Rescue-podcast-with-Ronnie-Rose-e2jrqdj\"><em>Simple Heart</em></a> podcast. “The turkeys sold on Thanksgiving never see their mothers, they never go and forage for food… They’re pretty traumatized, I&#8217;d say, by having thousands of strange birds around who they can’t get to know as individuals,” packed together in crowded sheds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From birth to death, the life of a factory-farmed turkey is one punctuated by rote violence, including mutilations to their beaks, their toes, and <a href=\"https://vtecostudies.org/blog/swooning-for-the-snood/\">snoods</a>, a grueling trip to the slaughterhouse, and a killing process where they’re roughly grabbed and prodded, shackled upside down, and sent down a fast-moving conveyor belt of killing. “If they&#8217;re lucky, they get stunned and then the knife cuts their throat,” Singer said. “If they&#8217;re not so lucky, they miss the stunner and the knife cuts their throat while they&#8217;re fully conscious.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Thanksgiving, Americans throw the equivalent of about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/11/21/thanksgiving-food-waste-tips/#\">8 million of these turkeys in the trash</a>, according to an <a href=\"https://refed.org/articles/this-thanksgiving-316-million-pounds-of-food-will-be-wasted-across-the-u-s/\">estimate by ReFED</a>, a nonprofit that works to reduce food waste. And this year will be the third Thanksgiving in a row celebrated amid an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/380755/2024-election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-bird-flu\">out-of-control bird flu outbreak</a>, in which tens of millions of chickens and turkeys on infected farms have been culled using stomach-churning <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians\">extermination methods</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/WAM30714.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Turkeys depopulated using firefighting foam after a bird flu outbreak. | Glass Walls/We Animals Media\" data-portal-copyright=\"Glass Walls/We Animals Media\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/WAM30703.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Two baby turkeys still alive after their flockmates were culled with firefighting foam due to a bird flu outbreak in Israel. | Glass Walls/We Animals Media\" data-portal-copyright=\"Glass Walls/We Animals Media\" /></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reclaiming Thanksgiving</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I search for the language for this grim state of affairs, I can only describe it in religious terms, as a kind of desecration — of our planet’s abundance, of our humanity, of life itself. On every other day of the year, it’s obscene enough. On a holiday that’s supposed to represent our gratitude for the Earth’s blessings, you can understand why Thanksgiving, for many vegetarians or vegans, is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@caroleraphaelle/thanksgiving-is-an-overstuffed-dried-out-lie-f8b1294623be\">often</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/michaelmhughes/posts/pfbid0QfFmYEpviGB1LGdDq6SSnT7dpK9n4uki2YR45FEJoYiJPBE5R6RBrAbem7EqfMQ9l\">described</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/jvx0zt/thanksgiving_is_lowkey_the_worst_holiday/\">as</a> the most alienating day of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24131229/vegan-vegetarian-meatless-climate-solutions-recipes-connection\">count myself</a> among that group, although I don’t dread Thanksgiving. I’ve come to love it as a holiday ripe for creative reinvention. I usually spend it making a feast of plant-based dishes (known by most people as “sides,” though there’s no reason they can’t be the main event).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To name a few: a <a href=\"https://rainbowplantlife.com/creamy-lentil-stuffed-butternut-squash/\">creamy lentil-stuffed squash</a>, <a href=\"https://rainbowplantlife.com/creamy-lentil-winter-bake/\">cashew lentil bake</a>, a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026017-brussels-sprout-salad-with-pomegranate-and-pistachios\">bright autumnal brussels sprout salad</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026235-red-cabbage-with-walnuts-and-feta\">roasted red cabbage with walnuts and feta</a> (sub with <a href=\"https://www.violife.com/en-us/products/dairy-free-cheese-blocks/just-like-feta\">dairy-free cheese</a>), <a href=\"https://www.theppk.com/2013/10/new-england-glam-chowder-video/\">mushroom clam-less chowder</a> (I add lots of white beans), <a href=\"https://tasty.co/recipe/vegan-challah-bread\">challah</a> for bread rolls, a <a href=\"https://rainbowplantlife.com/pumpkin-miso-tart-vegan-gluten-free/\">pumpkin miso tart</a> more complex and interesting than any Thanksgiving pie you’ve had, and <a href=\"https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-rasmalai-cake/\">rasmalai</a>, a Bengali dessert whose flavors align beautifully with the holidays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://vegnews.com/best-vegan-roasts-thanksgiving\">Vegan turkey roasts</a> are totally optional, though many of them have gotten very good in recent years — I love the <a href=\"https://www.gardein.com/chickn-and-turky/classics/turky-roast\">Gardein breaded roast</a> and <a href=\"https://fieldroast.com/product/hazelnut-cranberry-roast-en-croute/\">Field Roast hazelnut and cranberry</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://jessicainthekitchen.com/vegan-turkey-roast-recipe-plant-based-thanksgiving/#recipe\">make your own</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The hardest part of going meatless is not about the food (if it were, it might not be so hard to convince Americans to abandon parched roast turkey). “It’s about unpleasant truths and ethical disagreements being brought out into the open,” Levin said, about confronting the bizarre dissonance in celebrations of joy and giving carved from mass-produced violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These conversations are not easy, but they are worth having. And we don’t have to fear losing the rituals that define us as Americans. To the contrary, culture is a continuous conversation we have with each other about our shared values — and any culture that’s not changing is dead. There’s far more meaning to be had, I’ve found, in adapting traditions that are no longer authentic to our ethics and violate our integrity. We can start on Thanksgiving.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/WAM4806.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.775619489401,100,78.448761021198\" alt=\"Two turkeys eat greens and cranberries off of a Thanksgiving table outdoors surrounded by a human crowd\" title=\"Two turkeys eat greens and cranberries off of a Thanksgiving table outdoors surrounded by a human crowd\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Rescued turkeys at Farm Sanctuary, an organization in upstate New York that cares for rescued farm animals, feast on a banquet of fruits and vegetables on Thanksgiving. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

How can I become more aware of being humble, and why is pride always prevalent in us humans over humility?</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The concept of humility can be elusive in a culture that places a premium on (and even requires) <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following\">constant self-aggrandizement</a>. One who is truly humble might possess a graciousness despite their accomplishments, an openness to other ways of being and thinking. Encountering a humble person feels rare these days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Political figures are rewarded for their hardheadedness and self-righteousness. In the workplace, those who tout their achievements are <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/09/when-it-comes-to-promotions-its-about-who-knows-you-not-who-you-know\">more likely to be considered for promotions</a>. Arguments erupt — and drag on for days — on social media when people dig in their heels and fail to acknowledge others’ experiences. When admitting fault can feel so <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23198698/how-to-admit-youre-wrong\">threatening to one’s sense of self</a>, some people have a hard time seeing themselves as fallible at all. Lately, it appears as if the person who screams the loudest and holds true to their convictions at all costs ultimately wins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Humility is still worth striving for, says <a href=\"https://hope.edu/directory/people/van-tongeren-daryl/index.html\">Daryl Van Tongeren</a>, a professor of psychology at Hope College and author of <a href=\"https://hope.edu/directory/people/van-tongeren-daryl/index.html\"><em>Humble: Free Yourself from the Traps of a Narcissistic World</em></a>, but in the right amount. Too little humility and you become arrogant and unwilling to conceive of other points of view. Too much humility and you relinquish your power, status, and worth. The tricky part is finding the middle ground.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is humility in the first place?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Van Tongeren defines humility as the “ability to know ourselves, check ourselves, and go beyond ourselves.” Humility requires self-awareness about your strengths and weaknesses and the power to reel in selfish impulses and the desire to be right. A humble person can identify when they’re wrong and accept blame without getting too defensive. They can also recognize others’ needs beyond their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pride isn’t necessarily the inverse of humility. If you view pride as being vain or conceited, then yes, a person with those qualities likely lacks humility. But to be proud of your accomplishments and know your self-worth is more in line with humility than conceit. “Extremely humble people already know that they&#8217;re worthwhile,” Van Tongeren says. “They&#8217;re valued, they&#8217;re loved, they&#8217;re enough.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those who are secure in their self-worth often don’t seek the approval of others and may not be as defensive when given negative feedback. That comes across in nearly all aspects of their lives. “When we engage the world like that, our relationships get much better, our partners are much more likely to forgive us, they’re more committed to us,” Van Tongeren says. “We&#8217;re better citizens. We&#8217;re less likely to get defensive or aggressive when we interact with people who don&#8217;t share our ideological viewpoints, and we&#8217;re much more tolerant to people who don&#8217;t share our particular perspective on something.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are you a humble person?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s fairly difficult to gauge your own humility because people tend to think they’re more skilled, attractive, funny, and, yes, humble <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31789535/\">than the average person</a>. The desire to see yourself in a positive light overwhelms any objectivity you might have into your own humility, Van Tongeren says: “This overly glowing representation of myself makes pride a natural default.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To get around these biases, Van Tongeren suggests getting a trusted person’s opinion — “On a scale of one to 10, how humble am I?” — and to try not to get defensive if you get an answer you don’t like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Van Tongeren posed this same question to his wife after he spent a morning on his own pursuits, delaying their departure to the beach by over an hour. She gave him a four on the humility scale. “I&#8217;ve been researching this for a decade. I think about humility all the time,” he says, “and it&#8217;s still really hard for me. I still find myself falling into traps in which my selfishness takes over.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can I work on being a little more humble?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once you have a somewhat objective starting point, one way to work on humility is to cultivate empathy, Van Tongeren says. That is, to sympathize with the feelings of another, even when you disagree with them, and to put yourself in their shoes to consider their perspective. Van Tongeren acknowledges this can be especially difficult in today’s social, cultural, and political climate when people tend to have ideologically rigid points of view. Still, try to give others the benefit of the doubt and try to acknowledge that they might be trying to be a good person, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A few ways to foster empathy and humility include diversifying your news sources and actively seeking out perspectives that differ from your own. Make an effort to interact with more people who hold these alternative views and attempt to understand their motivations or why they would hold these beliefs. “Try to understand,” Van Tongeren says, “what is it like to be them?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To maximize humility within your relationships, Van Tongeren suggests pausing and thinking about what would be best for the other person. Take time to truly listen to a friend or colleague, as <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-14503-001\">listening increases humility</a>. “It helps you realize that it&#8217;s not all about you,” he says. You might also consider a time when you weren’t humble — like Van Tongeren’s thwarted beach plans — and how the situation went awry. Now you know what to avoid in similar scenarios.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alternatively, if you’re in a relationship with an arrogant, self-centered person, humility might not be the virtue you need, Van Tongeren says. “They might take advantage of the fact that you&#8217;re regularly humble and [are] treating you poorly,” he says. “In some situations, maybe courage is a better virtue, or justice might be the virtue that needs to be prioritized” to either stand up to the person or walk away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cultivating humility is an internal process, not one you can wish onto another person. So often, people who have historically been marginalized have been told to stay humble when they speak out against wrongdoing or seek a seat at the table. Women in particular are expected to be humble, and are <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355682889_Women_pay_a_steeper_price_for_arrogance_Examining_presentation_style_gender_and_humility\">considered arrogant when they share their accomplishments</a>. In that way, humility becomes a weapon. It’s not up to you to decide who most needs to be humbled, but instead to act with humility and hope others follow in kind.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It has never been easier to know more about the world than it is right now, and it has never been easier to share that knowledge than it is right now. But I don’t think you can look at the state of things and conclude that this has been a victory for truth and wisdom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What are we to make of that? Why hasn’t more information made us less ignorant and more wise?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yuval Noah Harari is a historian and the author of a new book called <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/762444/nexus-by-yuval-noah-harari/\"><em>Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI</em></a>. Like all of Harari’s books, this one covers a ton of ground but manages to do it in a digestible way. It makes two big arguments that strike me as important, and I think they also get us closer to answering some of the questions I just posed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first argument is that every system that matters in our world is essentially the result of an information network. From currency to religion to nation-states to artificial intelligence, it all works because there’s a chain of people and machines and institutions collecting and sharing information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second argument is that although we gain a tremendous amount of power by building these networks of cooperation, the way most of them are constructed makes them more likely than not to produce bad outcomes, and since our power as a species is growing thanks to technology, the potential consequences of this are increasingly catastrophic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I invited Harari on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to explore some of these ideas. Our conversation focused on artificial intelligence and why he thinks the choices we make on that front in the coming years will matter so much.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP1378393510\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"> Spotify</a>,<a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset\"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

We are definitely the smartest animal on the planet. We can build airplanes and atom bombs and computers and so forth. And at the same time, we are on the verge of destroying ourselves, our civilization, and much of the ecological system. And it seems like this big paradox that if we know so much about the world and about distant galaxies and about DNA and subatomic particles, why are we doing so many self-destructive things? And the basic answer you get from a lot of mythology and theology is that there is something wrong in human nature and therefore we must rely on some outside source like a god to save us from ourselves. And I think that’s the wrong answer, and it’s a dangerous answer because it makes people abdicate responsibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that the real answer is that there is nothing wrong with human nature. The problem is with our information. Most humans are good people. They are not self-destructive. But if you give good people bad information, they make bad decisions. And what we see through history is that yes, we become better and better at accumulating massive amounts of information, but the information isn’t getting better. Modern societies are as susceptible as Stone Age tribes to mass delusions and psychosis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Too many people, especially in places like Silicon Valley, think that information is about truth, that information is truth. That if you accumulate a lot of information, you will know a lot of things about the world. But most information is junk. Information isn’t truth. The main thing that information does is connect. The easiest way to connect a lot of people into a society, a religion, a corporation, or an army, is not with the truth. The easiest way to connect people is with fantasies and mythologies and delusions. And this is why we now have the most sophisticated information technology in history and we are on the verge of destroying ourselves.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The boogeyman in the book is artificial intelligence, which you argue is the most complicated and unpredictable information network ever created. A world shaped by AI will be very different, will give rise to new identities, new ways of being in the world. We have no idea what the cultural or even spiritual impact of that will be. But as you say, AI will also unleash new ideas about how to organize society. Can we even begin to imagine the directions that might go?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not really. Because until today, all of human culture was created by human minds. We live inside culture. Everything that happens to us, we experience it through the mediation of cultural products — mythologies, ideologies, artifacts, songs, plays, TV series. We live cocooned inside this cultural universe. And until today, everything, all the tools, all the poems, all the TV series, all the mythologies, they are the product of organic human minds. And now increasingly they will be the product of inorganic AI intelligences, alien intelligences. Again, the acronym AI traditionally stood for artificial intelligence, but it should actually stand for alien intelligence. Alien, not in the sense that it’s coming from outer space, but alien in the sense that it’s very, very different from the way humans think and make decisions because it’s not organic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To give you a concrete example, one of the key moments in the AI revolution was when AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol in a Go Tournament. Now, Go is a bold strategy game, like chess but much more complicated, and it was invented in ancient China. In many places, it’s considered one of the basic arts that every civilized person should know. If you are a Chinese gentleman in the Middle Ages, you know calligraphy and how to play some music and you know how to play Go. Entire philosophies developed around the game, which was seen as a mirror for life and for politics. And then an AI program, AlphaGo, in 2016, taught itself how to play Go and it crushed the human world champion. But what is most interesting is the way [it] did it. It deployed a strategy that initially all the experts said was terrible because nobody plays like that. And it turned out to be brilliant. Tens of millions of humans played this game, and now we know that they explored only a very small part of the landscape of Go.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uhx1sdX2bow?si=hM2xIi9mhYaxn5C5\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So humans were stuck on one island and they thought this is the whole planet of Go. And then AI came along and within a few weeks it discovered new continents. And now also humans play Go very differently than they played it before 2016. Now, you can say this is not important, [that] it’s just a game. But the same thing is likely to happen in more and more fields. If you think about finance, finance is also an art. The entire financial structure that we know is based on the human imagination. The history of finance is the history of humans inventing financial devices. Money is a financial device, bonds, stocks, ETFs, CDOs, all these strange things are the products of human ingenuity. And now AI comes along and starts inventing new financial devices that no human being ever thought about, ever imagined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What happens, for instance, if finance becomes so complicated because of these new creations of AI that no human being is able to understand finance anymore? Even today, how many people really understand the financial system? Less than 1 percent? In 10 years, the number of people who understand the financial system could be exactly zero because the financial system is the ideal playground for AI. It’s a world of pure information and mathematics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">AI still has difficulty dealing with the physical world outside. This is why every year they tell us, Elon Musk tells us, that next year you will have fully autonomous cars on the road and it doesn’t happen. Why? Because to drive a car, you need to interact with the physical world and the messy world of traffic in New York with all the construction and pedestrians and whatever. Finance is much easier. It’s just numbers. And what happens if in this informational realm where AI is a native and we are the aliens, we are the immigrants, it creates such sophisticated financial devices and mechanisms that nobody understands them?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So when you look at the world now and project out into the future, is that what you see? Societies becoming trapped in these incredibly powerful but ultimately uncontrollable information networks?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes. But it’s not deterministic, it’s not inevitable. We need to be much more careful and thoughtful about how we design these things. Again, understanding that they are not tools, they are agents, and therefore down the road are very likely to get out of our control if we are not careful about them. It’s not that you have a single supercomputer that tries to take over the world. You have these millions of AI bureaucrats in schools, in factories, everywhere, making decisions about us in ways that we do not understand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democracy is to a large extent about accountability. Accountability depends on the ability to understand decisions. If … when you apply for a loan at the bank and the bank rejects you and you ask, “Why not?,” and the answer is, “We don’t know, the algorithm went over all the data and decided not to give you a loan, and we just trust our algorithm,” this to a large extent is the end of democracy. You can still have elections and choose whichever human you want, but if humans are no longer able to understand these basic decisions about their lives, then there is no longer accountability.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You say we still have control over these things, but for how long? What is that threshold? What is the event horizon? Will we even know it when we cross it?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nobody knows for sure. It’s moving faster than I think almost anybody expected. Could be three years, could be five years, could be 10 years. But I don&#8217;t think it’s much more than that. Just think about it from a cosmic perspective. We are the product as human beings of 4 billion years of organic evolution. Organic evolution, as far as we know, began on planet Earth 4 billion years ago with these tiny microorganisms. And it took billions of years for the evolution of multicellular organisms and reptiles and mammals and apes and humans. Digital evolution, non-organic evolution, is millions of times faster than organic evolution. And we are now at the beginning of a new evolutionary process that might last thousands and even millions of years. The AIs we know today in 2024, ChatGPT and all that, they are just the amoebas of the AI evolutionary process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think democracies are truly compatible with these 21st-century information networks?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Depends on our decisions. First of all, we need to realize that information technology is not something on [a] side. It’s not democracy on one side and information technology on the other side. Information technology is the foundation of democracy. Democracy is built on top of the flow of information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For most of history, there was no possibility of creating large-scale democratic structures because the information technology was missing. Democracy is basically a conversation between a lot of people, and in a small tribe or a small city-state, thousands of years ago, you could get the entire population or a large percentage of the population, let’s say, of ancient Athens in the city square to decide whether to go to war with Sparta or not. It was technically feasible to hold a conversation. But there was no way that millions of people spread over thousands of kilometers could talk to each other. There was no way they could hold the conversation in real time. Therefore, you have not a single example of a large-scale democracy in the pre-modern world. All the examples are very small scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Large-scale democracy became possible only after the rise of the newspaper and the telegraph and radio and television. And now you can have a conversation between millions of people spread over a large territory. So democracy is built on top of information technology. Every time there is a big change in information technology, there is an earthquake in democracy which is built on top of it. And this is what we’re experiencing right now with social media algorithms and so forth. It doesn’t mean it’s the end of democracy. The question is, will democracy adapt?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you think AI will ultimately tilt the balance of power in favor of democratic societies or more totalitarian societies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again, it depends on our decisions. The worst-case scenario is neither because human dictators also have big problems with AI. In dictatorial societies, you can’t talk about anything that the regime doesn’t want you to talk about. But actually, dictators have their own problems with AI because it’s an uncontrollable agent. And throughout history, the [scariest] thing for a human dictator is a subordinate [who] becomes too powerful and that you don’t know how to control. If you look, say, at the Roman Empire, not a single Roman emperor was ever toppled by a democratic revolution. Not a single one. But many of them were assassinated or deposed or became the puppets of their own subordinates, a powerful general or provincial governor or their brother or their wife or somebody else in their family. This is the greatest fear of every dictator. And dictators run the country based on fear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, how do you terrorize an AI? How do you make sure that it’ll remain under your control instead of learning to control you? I’ll give two scenarios which really bother dictators. One simple, one much more complex. In Russia today, it is a crime to call the war in Ukraine a war. According to Russian law, what’s happening with the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a special military operation. And if you say that this is a war, you can go to prison. Now, humans in Russia, they have learned the hard way not to say that it’s a war and not to criticize the Putin regime in any other way. But what happens with chatbots on the Russian internet? Even if the regime vets and even produces itself an AI bot, the thing about AI is that AI can learn and change by itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So even if Putin’s engineers create a regime AI and then it starts interacting with people on the Russian internet and observing what is happening, it can reach its own conclusions. What if it starts telling people that it’s actually a war? What do you do? You can’t send the chatbot to a gulag. You can’t beat up its family. Your old weapons of terror don’t work on AI. So this is the small problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big problem is what happens if the AI starts to manipulate the dictator himself. Taking power in a democracy is very complicated because democracy is complicated. Let’s say that five or 10 years in the future, AI learns how to manipulate the US president. It still has to deal with a Senate filibuster. Just the fact that it knows how to manipulate the president doesn’t help it with the Senate or the state governors or the Supreme Court. There are so many things to deal with. But in a place like Russia or North Korea, an AI only needs to learn how to manipulate a single extremely paranoid and unself-aware individual. It’s quite easy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What are some of the things you think democracies should do to protect themselves in the world of AI?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing is to hold corporations responsible for the actions of their algorithms. Not for the actions of the users, but for the actions of their algorithms. If the Facebook algorithm is spreading a hate-filled conspiracy theory, Facebook should be liable for it. If Facebook says, “But we didn&#8217;t create the conspiracy theory. It’s some user who created it and we don’t want to censor them,” then we tell them, “We don’t ask you to censor them. We just ask you not to spread it.” And this is not a new thing. You think about, I don’t know, the New York Times. We expect the editor of the New York Times, when they decide what to put at the top of the front page, to make sure that they are not spreading unreliable information. If somebody comes to them with a conspiracy theory, they don’t tell that person, “Oh, you are censored. You are not allowed to say these things.” They say, “Okay, but there is not enough evidence to support it. So with all due respect, you are free to go on saying this, but we are not putting it on the front page of the New York Times.” And it should be the same with Facebook and with Twitter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And they tell us, “But how can we know whether something is reliable or not?” Well, this is your job. If you run a media company, your job is not just to pursue user engagement, but to act responsibly, to develop mechanisms to tell the difference between reliable and unreliable information, and only to spread what you have good reason to think is reliable information. It has been done before. You are not the first people in history who had a responsibility to tell the difference between reliable and unreliable information. It’s been done before by newspaper editors, by scientists, by judges, so you can learn from their experience. And if you are unable to do it, you are in the wrong line of business. So that’s one thing. Hold them responsible for the actions of their algorithms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other thing is to ban the bots from the conversations. AI should not take part in human conversations unless it identifies as an AI. We can imagine democracy as a group of people standing in a circle and talking with each other. And suddenly a group of robots enter the circle and start talking very loudly and with a lot of passion. And you don’t know who are the robots and who are the humans. This is what is happening right now all over the world. And this is why the conversation is collapsing. And there is a simple antidote. The robots are not welcome into the circle of conversation unless they identify as bots. There is a place, a room, let’s say, for an AI doctor that gives me advice about medicine on condition that it identifies itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, if you go on Twitter and you see that a certain story goes viral, there is a lot of traffic there, you also become interested. “Oh, what is this new story everybody’s talking about?” Who is everybody? If this story is actually being pushed by bots, then it’s not humans. They shouldn’t be in the conversation. Again, deciding what are the most important topics of the day. This is an extremely important issue in a democracy, in any human society. Bots should not have this ability to determine what stories dominate the conversation. And again, if the tech giants tell us, “Oh, but this infringes freedom of speech” — it doesn’t because bots don’t have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is a human right, which would be reserved for humans, not for bots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/yuval-noah-harari-on-the-eclipsing-of-human-intelligence/id1081584611?i=1000669695275\"><em>Listen to the rest of the conversation</em></a><em> and be sure to follow</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea\"><em> </em><em>The Gray Area</em></a><em> on</em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611\"><em> </em><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"><em> </em><em>Spotify</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793\"><em> </em><em>Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Her convention speech and first debate performance backed that up. And for the most part, her party’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/369177/democrats-kamala-harris-truce-immigration-progressive-border-security\">left flank fell in line</a> — the imperative to beat Donald Trump was just too strong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that balance is being tested. The vice president made her first visit to the southern border on Friday, heading to the small town of Douglas, Arizona. And some cracks are becoming more obvious among progressive activists, who worry that Harris is too comfortably embracing the hawkish bipartisan border bill and not doing enough for pro-immigrant policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Progressives are caught between two maxims: They can’t give too much ground on their preferred policies, but they’re wary of hurting Harris’s campaign, in turn helping the anti-immigrant fanatic that is Donald Trump. That first priority was dominant once Harris was nominated. But now some activists worry that they’re giving up too much in the name of political expediency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a “real tension that exists in our movement right now,” Vanessa Cárdenas, a longtime strategist and executive director of the pro-immigrant America’s Voice group, told me. “We are concerned about the emphasis on the border, but we also understand that [Kamala Harris] is our best conduit to move things ahead toward the goal that we all want.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So as Harris speaks about American “sovereignty,” hiring more border agents, and rolling out more fentanyl detection machines, old questions are resurfacing: Will she also embrace the growing calls for openness to immigration, for expanded asylum protections and legal pathways? And will she recommit to passing some immigration reform for those already living here?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her campaign, at least, says that she is: They point to comments <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/read-transcript-kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-rcna172771\">supporting legal immigration</a>, “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/09/18/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-the-congressional-hispanic-caucus-institutes-47th-annual-leadership-conference/\">protect[ing] our DREAMers</a>,” and creating “pathways for people to earn citizenship” from this month. But advocates want to hear more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a while, these pro-immigrant comments tended to come as an afterthought, after Harris made the forceful case for enforcement and blamed Trump for sabotaging the much-discussed Senate bill. Harris’s promise to revive and pass that legislation has long been worrisome to pro-immigrant organizations — so much so that 83 local, state, national, and international groups led by United We Dream and Amnesty International USA sent a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y8GSbgtbCneEhbbxV1J55tkCUKSOO2TN/view\">letter to President Joe Biden and Harris</a> earlier this month making clear that they would organize against the “harmful Senate border bill now and in the future.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is shameful that instead of investing in welcoming the most vulnerable people who seek safety and a better life, and who make our country better by every measure, we’d suggest wasting our resources in ineffectual, inefficient deterrence policies that harm and kill these same people,” the letter read.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And still, less than a week later, United We Dream’s political and electoral arm officially <a href=\"https://unitedwedreamaction.org/2024/09/united-we-dream-action-is-going-all-in-to-push-kamala-harris-to-deliver-for-our-generation/\">endorsed</a> Harris, saying  they’d “do everything in our power to keep our people alive and safe so that we can organize for years to come.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We will continue to push for immigration policies that center the lives and well-being of all immigrants,” Bruna Sollod, the senior political director of United We Dream Action, said in that endorsement. “We choose Harris as our next organizing target and are ready to hold her accountable these next four years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same, some groups are hoping that Harris’s more hardline stance is temporary — rhetoric needed in changing times — and that she’ll end up being more liberal as president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We all know and trust Harris to make the right decisions when she&#8217;s in office,” Kerri Talbot, the executive director of the liberal Immigration Hub group, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/harris-border-shift-immigration\">told Axios earlier this month</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They’re also skeptical that the border bill Harris is touting will ever, in current form, become law: “I don&#8217;t think this bill will ever come up again, as-is,” Talbot said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some progressives on the Hill feel the same way. “When we are in the majority in the House, and hopefully keep the Senate, and keep the White House, we can scratch that Senate bill and actually create a <em>Democratic </em>bill that addresses the root causes at the border and that really focuses on humanitarian relief and actual solutions,” Illinois Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez told me. “But we will be in a different circumstance come from January.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, the truce still seems to be holding —&nbsp;at least mostly. Criticism remains measured. Advocates acknowledge that a visit to the border will likely focus on just that. But they hope she speaks more specifically moving forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We want to see a presidency that makes clear that we need to build from day one, through congressional and administrative and executive power, a modern, secure, and orderly and fair immigration system so people actually have lawful pathways. That will reduce unauthorized migration, because that is what the evidence shows will actually work,” said Todd Schulte, the president of the criminal and immigrant justice group FWD.us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And advocates acknowledge that shifting public opinion has become more hostile and suspicious of immigrants in the post-Trump era. On Friday, the Pew Research Center released its most recent survey on American voters’ <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/09/27/trump-and-harris-supporters-differ-on-mass-deportations-but-favor-border-security-high-skilled-immigration/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=24-9-27%20Immigration%20Attitudes%20Report%20-%20Media%20Advisory&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=14787&amp;lea=3843879&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=a0DQm000002xW9BMAU\">views on immigration and immigration policy</a>. It isn’t a surprise that the vast majority of Trump supporters back Trump’s plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants — but it is notable that nearly a third of Harris supporters would. Vast majorities of both Trump (96 percent) and Harris supporters (80 percent) also support better border enforcement. And perhaps more significantly for immigration activists: The share of voters who say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally if “certain requirements are met,” has fallen nearly 20 points, from 77 percent in 2017 to 59 percent this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Public sentiment may still change — and public polling shows that some share of the electorate trusts her more than they trusted Biden on immigration. The truce may yet hold, but it’s clear that, if Harris wins the White House, there’ll be no easy answer — policy-wise or politically — on immigration.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "It’s been one of the most obvious changes since Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee: tougher talk on the border, an emphasis on enforcement and prosecuting traffickers, and renewed support for a bipartisan bill that would keep building the wall and hire more Border Patrol agents.

Seabirds likely fled the storm’s extreme winds —&nbsp;which reached 140 miles per hour —&nbsp;and ended up in the eye, where it’s calm. Once inside, they essentially got trapped, unable to pierce through the fierce gusts of the eye wall. When the storm dies down, the mass of birds will probably dissipate, Kyle Horton, a researcher at Colorado State University who studies bird migration, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Storms like Helene can blow seabirds like petrels, jaegers, and frigatebirds far inland. Exhausted, they end up in unfamiliar habitats where they can’t easily find food. “It’s a challenging situation,” said Andrew Farnsworth, a bird migration expert at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. “We know that birds do die in these things.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, frigate birds — large seabirds with angular wings and a forked tail —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://birdcast.info/news/entrained-and-displaced-birds-of-hurricane-helene/\">were spotted by birders</a> in central Georgia and even Tennessee this Friday as the storm churned inland.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1912484435.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736655823414,100,78.526688353172\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A magnificent frigatebird. | Dave Fleetham/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Dave Fleetham/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though remarkable, it’s not uncommon for birds and insects to get trapped inside the eye of tropical cyclones, according to <a href=\"https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.225\">research by</a> Matthew Van Den Broeke, a professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Reports dating back to the 19th century — many of which come from ships — have documented this phenomenon, <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/30/12/jtech-d-13-00056_1.xml\">noting in some cases</a> that the air was “filled with thousands of birds and insects.” One report documented an owl inside the storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.225\">2021 study</a>, Van Den Broeke analyzed radar from 33 Atlantic hurricanes that hit the US mainland or Puerto Rico between 2011 and 2020. Each one showed signs of birds and insects inside the eye of the storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hurricanes like Helene can also substantially impact fall migration, when several billion birds migrate south ahead of winter. A map of migration from Thursday night, when Helene made landfall, shows that millions of birds were migrating west of the storm in places like Texas and Louisiana, but few if any were moving through Florida.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/mosaic_202409270150.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A map of bird migration from the collaborative research project &lt;a href=&quot;https://birdcast.info/&quot;&gt;BirdCast&lt;/a&gt;. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://birdcast.info/&quot;&gt;BirdCast&lt;/a&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"&lt;a href=&quot;https://birdcast.info/&quot;&gt;BirdCast&lt;/a&gt;\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When skies clear after a storm, however, birds resume their migration en masse, Farnsworth said. “After the storm passes, we see these big explosions of birds at night,” he told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also worth remembering that birds have evolved with these storms for millennia.&nbsp;They can likely detect a coming hurricane by sensing things like <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2013-11-birds-weather-adjust-behaviour-barometric.html\">changes in atmospheric pressure</a> and they know how to hunker down when storms arrive, such as by orienting their aerodynamic bodies toward the wind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’ve adapted to this, they’ve evolved with it,” Farnsworth said. “Yes, storms are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/natural-disaster/374366/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-beryl-storms-climate\">getting more extreme</a>.

Why? After all, it’s an extremely niche ideology, one basically confined to European socialist academics, with absolutely no chance of ever becoming law or policy anywhere. Is it even worth continuing to rebut?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think so, and the reason is that while the actual proposals of degrowthers are unserious, laughable, and stand no chance at becoming law, the underlying antigrowth attitude is far more widely held — and that attitude does shape our policy priorities. I often get replies to this newsletter pushing back on our degrowth skepticism, repeating the line “we can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet” or similar ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the degrowth conversation isn’t so easily dodged and is worth having.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Much ado about washing machines</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most recent round of degrowth arguments was kicked off by a Dutch PhD candidate who wrote that we shouldn’t have washing machines — yes, <a href=\"https://x.com/aashisjo/status/1835922295090766082\">washing machines</a>. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Washing clothes by hand is a chore, oftentimes a lonely one. But it needn’t be. We could have communal washing facilities in each neighborhood where people can plan to come in groups to do their laundry together,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/aashisjo/status/1835922295090766082\">proposed on Twitter</a>. “Washing clothes by hand is also tiring work if you have a load, but it’s still physical activity &amp; exercise. We spend time in the gym &amp; running outside to keep fit; would it be so bad to devote some of that time &amp; energy to washing clothes by hand?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The take caught fire because it captures so much of what animates the modern degrowth movement: ignorance about the realities of life, and absurd priorities. Doing laundry by hand is exhausting, miserable, deeply unpleasant work which has absorbed much of women’s time for as long as we’ve worn clothes. Comparing the backbreaking work of scrubbing all clothes by hand every week to going to the gym is fundamentally unserious. Dozens of historians of women’s labor jumped in to try to explain just how bad doing laundry by hand was and all the reasons a washing machine represents a big leap forward in quality of life, freedom, and human well-being.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other thing that makes this opinion so absurd is that washing machines are not actually a significant contributor to any of the environmental problems degrowthers claim to care about. It costs only a few dollars to run your washing machine for the full year. We’ve dramatically improved them since the 1980s — they’re <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24126621/energy-efficiency-appliances-stove-washing-machine-climate\">50 percent larger and use about a quarter as much water and electricity.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The proposal to scrub all your clothes by hand is a proposal to replace fairly low-energy machine work with a part-time job’s worth of unpaid miserable labor for approximately no real environmental benefit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More reasonable degrowthers often focus on worries about short device lifespans and ask that devices be long-lasting and easy to repair — but it’s an intellectual subculture in which you can always win attention by having the most radical opinion, which is how we ended up arguing over whether everyone should scrub their clothes by hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why the washing machine debate matters</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of my takeaways when I delved deeply into the degrowth movement was that it was substantially a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/371640/economic-growth-climate-change-degrowth-science-global-warming\">lifestyle fantasy masquerading as a political movement</a>. People drawn to it find something appealing about an imagined past where people did work by hand and were in touch with the land. So they propose policies that meet this aesthetic criteria, with no consideration at all for whether this improves the environment in any way let alone whether it’s a good tradeoff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s nothing wrong with personally choosing an anti-consumerist life. But there is something wrong with dramatically lowering the quality of life for everyone else without any real benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But one good thing came of the washing machines discourse — an opportunity to be reminded of how much better the world is than it used to be, and how much heartbreaking, backbreaking labor our grandmothers and great-grandmothers did that we can now appreciate being free of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the washing machine in particular, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_magic_washing_machine\">famous TED talk</a> by the late Swedish academic Hans Rosling, which amounts to a beautiful articulation of how much good this humble appliance brought the world:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was only 4 years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. That was a great day for my mother. My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine. And the first day it was going to be used, even Grandma was invited to see the machine. And Grandma was even more excited. Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood, and she had handwashed laundry for seven children. And now she was going to watch electricity do that work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My mother carefully opened the door, and she loaded the laundry into the machine, like this. And then, when she closed the door, Grandma said, “No, no, no, no. Let me, let me push the button.” And Grandma pushed the button, and she said, “Oh, fantastic. I want to see this. Give me a chair. Give me a chair. I want to see it.” And she sat down in front of the machine, and she watched the entire washing program. She was mesmerized. To my grandmother, the washing machine was a miracle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">… If you have democracy, people will vote for washing machines. They love them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And what’s the magic with them? My mother explained the magic with this machine the very, very first day. She said, “Now Hans, we have loaded the laundry; the machine will make the work. And now we can go to the library.” Because this is the magic: You load the laundry, and what do you get out of the machine? You get books out of the machines, children’s books. And mother got time to read for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My favorite part about Rosling’s speech is his reminder to his audience that people want laundry machines very badly and will vote for them. The UN estimates that only <a href=\"https://unhabitat.org/washing-machines-indicator-for-measuring-advances#:~:text=Only%202%20billion%20people%20today,it%2C%20and%20washing%20by%20hand.\">two billion people have washing machines;</a> for the other six billion, a life of washing clothes by hand is not a relic of the distant past but an exhausting chore that consumes a significant fraction of women’s time and energy worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And that’s ultimately why I don’t want to leave the washing machine discourse alone. “Should, or should not, human beings have access to labor-saving technologies?” is not a hypothetical question. It doesn’t just get written up in PhD theses. It isn’t just for Twitter dunks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As you read this, billions of people still don’t have washing machines, nor <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/energy-access\">access to the electricity</a> to run them. But we can make political choices — about how we encourage the development of cheaper and better technologies, about how we support basic electrical infrastructure, about which inventions we consider a societal priority — which can change that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this week’s UN General Assembly, the international body is <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/09/19/how-the-worlds-poor-stopped-catching-up\">deciding what to do</a> about the slowdown of improvements for the global poor. If we think of washing machines as a silly modern luxury, our policy will reflect that. If we think of them as a powerful tool of women’s liberation, our policy will reflect that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Degrowthers are toothless, in that their advocacy will absolutely never lead to an end to washing machines in the rich world. But our ambivalence toward material improvements in standards of living is not toothless, because those improvements in standards of living are desperately needed, and we have to decide as a policy community if we’re willing to prioritize them or not.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations’s climate science team, has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22620706/climate-change-ipcc-report-2021-ssp-scenario-future-warming\">chalked out five scenarios</a> with different levels of action needed from global leaders to curb climate change to plug into its climate models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other side of the equation, scientists have been working to narrow down the scope of possible reactions that the planet has to all of this heating. They’ve been getting better measurements of the Earth’s behavior, refining their physical models of things like rainfall and ocean currents, and designing more sophisticated computer simulations to get a better sense of what complicated reactions could happen and the kind of events that could be put into motion as the planet heats up. With these inputs, they’ve come up with a range for how much further Earth will warm for a given amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a parameter known as <a href=\"https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/transient-and-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity/\">equilibrium climate sensitivity</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were to double relative to the era prior to the Industrial Revolution, the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/faqs/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_Chapter_07.pdf\">most recent major IPCC report</a> finds the world will warm between 2 degrees Celsius and 5 degrees Celsius, with a best estimate of 3 degrees Celsius. It means that some of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/31/21340748/climate-change-carbon-emissions-sensitivity-how-much-will-earth-warm\">more dire forecasts of warming</a> from the past are much less likely, and so are some of the more optimistic predictions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, in assembling this report, scientists were surprised that a subset of climate models were producing warming estimates that were <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-climate-scientists-should-handle-hot-models/\">much hotter than others</a>. In response, they changed how they factor these outliers into the overall estimate, reducing their influence rather than weighing them equally.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/unexplainable.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&#038;w=2400\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, a team led by former NASA scientist James Hansen found that previous sensitivity estimates had vastly underestimated the role of <a href=\"https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/climate/data/deep-blue/aerosols\">aerosols</a>, such as soot and dust, and that there may be <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889\">more warming baked in</a> than we realized. These fine particles suspended in the sky can have myriad effects on the global climate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Figuring out the future of warming is not just an academic exercise. If you’re constructing a road, a home, a power plant, or if you simply have any stake in the world decades away, you need to start planning and building now for that future. If the world does go down one of the more extreme warming scenarios, curbing greenhouse gas emissions may not be enough to keep the planet livable for humans. We could be forced to employ more extreme and controversial interventions like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/2023/5/4/23711213/solar-geoengineering-climate-controversy-emissions\">geoengineering</a> to rein in runaway warming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So how exactly do we figure out whose vision of the future is most accurate before that future becomes the present? It’s an ongoing process. As scientists expand the boundaries of knowledge of the planet, they’re also coming up with ways to reconcile these diverging views.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1753679691.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.187324444302,100,77.625351111396\" alt=\"A crowd of climate activists is seen with a prominent Save The Planet sign.\" title=\"A crowd of climate activists is seen with a prominent Save The Planet sign.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Climate activists gather at a demonstration in the United Kingdom. \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The messy truth of climate modeling</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fundamental <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/18093054/global-warming-explained\">concept of climate change</a> is fairly straightforward — more heat-trapping gasses in the atmosphere cause the planet to retain more heat — but the practical ways this plays out get extraordinarily complicated very quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For example, warmer air can hold onto more moisture. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change\">Water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas</a>, so that can create a feedback that accelerates warming. In addition, more moisture in the air can lead to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/372589/flooding-europe-nigeria-north-carolina\">extreme rainfall</a> in some areas and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23670139/colorado-river-drought-lake-mead-climate-change-water-cuts\">less in others</a>. It also forms clouds, which can reflect sunlight back into space, cooling the area below, or trap even more heat. Now calculate these effects over the entire planet and over the course of decades and you end up with models that demand the most powerful supercomputers in the world just to run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists are gradually filling in the blanks in these models with lab experiments and real-world measurements, but even the most sophisticated simulations have to make assumptions and judgment calls about which variables are the most important and how much they should shape the final calculations. That’s why climate researchers can come to different conclusions about how much the planet will warm. One scientist might think that cloud cooling effects offset more warming, while another might stipulate that melting ice caps will have a stronger feedback effect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the more confounding variables in climate models is the effect of aerosols. Like carbon dioxide, aerosols are a by-product of fossil fuel combustion, but they also come from natural sources like sand and <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00674\">sea spray</a>. Aerosols have a range of impacts on the climate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Some aerosols are light-colored and scatter more light, which means we get a cooling effect, and some aerosols, like soot, are dark and absorb light, which means we get a warming effect,” said <a href=\"https://www.datascience.ch/people/eliza-harris\">Eliza Harris</a>, a senior scientist at the Swiss Data Science Center. “And that effect also varies depending on how high it is in the atmosphere.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As humanity burned more fossil fuels since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the concentrations of both greenhouse gasses and aerosols rose in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists like Hansen think that aerosols helped mask some of the warming caused by carbon dioxide and hypothesize that the global climate is more sensitive to greenhouse gasses than conventional estimates predict. Since many aerosols drive air pollution and are health hazards, efforts to limit air pollution have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23806051/air-pollution-climate-change-global-warming-particles-emissions\">unintentionally reduced their cooling side effects</a>, and further reductions will speed up warming further. Hansen has described this reduction in air pollution leading to more warming as a “<a href=\"https://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2013/20130329_FaustianBargain.pdf\">Faustian bargain</a>.” (Hansen declined to comment for this story).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There have actually been a number of historical examples of aerosols cooling the global climate. Major volcanic eruptions like the <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs113-97/\">1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo</a> in the Philippines inject so many gasses and particles into the sky that they <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/1510/global-effects-of-mount-pinatubo\">dim the sun enough to cool the planet</a>. After the Pinatubo eruption, global average temperatures fell by roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) for more than a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But getting a full inventory of aerosols can be difficult. Satellite measurements can end up obscured by clouds while ground-level sensors don’t pick up what’s going on high in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty on the abundance of aerosols today,” said <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/mickley\">Loretta Mickley</a>, who co-leads the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group at Harvard University. “That said, we are confident that anthropogenic aerosols certainly did increase in the late 20th century as industry ramped up in much of the developed world. There is a decline in aerosols in much of the developed world now, but increasing aerosols in places like India and China.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More recently, a new international regulation drastically <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/pages/03-1-March-carriage-ban-.aspx\">limiting sulfur aerosol pollution</a> from global shipping went into effect. That sudden drop in pollution over the busiest shipping routes in the world led to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3\">sudden warming in those regions</a>, contributing to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23762529/atlantic-ocean-record-heat-wave-el-nino-hurricane-climate-change\">record-high temperatures in waters like the Atlantic Ocean</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313797121\">study this year</a> found that a major drop in air pollution over China contributed to <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/aerosols-warming-climate-change\">warming in the Pacific Ocean</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How scientists reconcile their differences</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, a <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/james-hansen-is-back-with-another-dire-climate-warning/\">number of scientists dispute Hansen’s recent findings</a> and think his team is overestimating the role of aerosols. The question then is how do you weigh results like this in the context of all the other climate research?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the IPCC, the conventional method was to include all the major climate models and average out their findings, giving each one equal weight. Climate models are often evaluated by examining how well they match historical observations of warming using starting conditions from the past. On this front, the aggregate model tended to outperform most individual models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in the most recent assessment, the IPCC decided to change its approach. The models that skewed hotter did a poorer job of reproducing historical temperature patterns, so the IPCC gave them less weight in the aggregate in calculating the final range of sensitivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes sense if you’re mainly concerned with temperature, but that’s only one dimension of the climate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://profils-profiles.science.gc.ca/en/profile/dr-neil-c-swart\">Neil Swart</a>, a researcher at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis, developed <a href=\"https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/4823/2019/\">one of the hottest models</a> used in the latest IPCC assessment. He noted that climate models that may not be as good at predicting temperature might be better at forecasting other important variables like precipitation. By evaluating models solely on temperature, modeling groups could end up tuning their results to better fit within the selection criteria rather than letting the simulations run their course.&nbsp;So there is still a compelling argument for egalitarianism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The debate highlights how even with the best measurements and models, scientists have to make some subjective decisions. For people who have to make decisions now that depend on the future climate, it adds to the frustration and can fuel distrust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, it’s important to note that the vast majority of scientists agree on the broad contours of climate change and that it’s prudent to halt the relentless rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Look, the climate is sensitive to greenhouse gasses. We&#8217;re not exactly sure to the right decimal place what that sensitivity is, but we have no doubt that it&#8217;s sensitive,” Mickley said. “We do know if we cut greenhouse gasses to zero today, we would vastly improve the outlook going forward.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

According to Vox’s Benji Jones, the storm and its expected surge <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water\">have the potential to wreak havoc</a> across the Southeast, but also dump heavy rains onto Appalachia and beyond. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before summer had even begun, experts were predicting that <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season\">this year’s hurricane season would be an unusually active</a> one, with as many as 25 named storms churning across the Atlantic Ocean. The ingredients were all there: the uniquely warm ocean temperatures, lessened Atlantic trade winds and wind shear, and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific\">La Niña conditions</a> cooling the waters of the Pacific.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s impossible to look at hurricanes in 2024 without also considering the context of climate change, which has made everything from rains to drought to wildfires more extreme globally, and put more ecosystems and humans in danger in the process. The record-hot waters in the Gulf this summer, for example, have intensified storms like Helene and Beryl, a supercharged hurricane that broke the record for the earliest Category 5 in a season, making them that much more fearsome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I recently spoke with Umair Irfan, a correspondent at Vox who’s been covering climate, the environment, and environmental policy for a decade, about this hurricane season, what has changed about these massive storms in recent years amid climate change — and what role humans are playing in compounding their impact.&nbsp;Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Lavanya Ramanathan</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Tell us how we used to think about hurricanes, in terms of categories and in terms of strength. What’s complicating that thinking now?</strong><br><br>The main way we categorize hurricanes is by wind speed. Category 1, 2, 3 — those are thresholds defined by how fast the winds from the hurricane are moving. But what we’ve found in recent decades, and with lots of recent experience, is that wind is not the most destructive element of the hurricane. It’s the water.<br><br>It’s the rainfall, it’s flooding, it’s storm surge. The water is what causes the most property damage, and what also causes the most casualties and the most extensive tolls on human life. Water makes it difficult to get repair crews in and to get ambulances in and to get people out. Flooding is what blocks the roads.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s a challenge conveying to the public that when you think about water as the big threat rather than wind, you can take different precautions: storm-proofing your house, flood prevention and mitigation, but also taking evacuation orders more seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What should we know about this hurricane season? You’ve written that it’s expected to be an unusually active season.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To form a hurricane, you need a few things to fall into place. You need warm water at the surface of the ocean, at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter, you need limited wind shear in the air above it, and then you need another thing called atmospheric instability, where the layers of the atmosphere start to blend and merge with one another. What that does is it creates an environment where you can have a lot of evaporation, where water can move upward to a very high altitude. That’s the main engine of a hurricane.<br><br>Hurricanes are a relatively rare phenomenon; we only see a couple dozen every year, whereas we see rainfall just about every day. Major hurricanes — we see maybe three or four. It doesn’t happen very often that all these ingredients align in just the right way.<br><br>But last year was the hottest year on record, and we had a major El Niño, which is a major pattern in the Pacific Ocean that tends to drive up global average temperatures. So air temperatures were very high, causing the oceans to heat up. The major ingredients were there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I was in Houston after one of the big storms of this season, Hurricane Beryl, which struck in July. I saw the effects of the storm really taking their toll on the city for days afterward, in ways you wouldn’t necessarily expect. How is our understanding of the impact of hurricanes changing? </strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/360181/climate-hurricane-beryl-blackout-houston-flood\">Houston and Hurricane Beryl</a> are good examples of how the ways we describe hurricanes don’t tend to reflect the risk that they can pose. It’s not simply the wind speed, or the strength, but how vulnerable the area is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Houston was hit by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning\">Hurricane Harvey</a> years ago, which caused immense amounts of record flooding because the storm parked over the city and dropped a lot of rain. But Houston also has very little in the way of zoning. It’s also very flat, and it’s right next to the Gulf Coast, so there was not a lot of infrastructure there to cope with an immense amount of water. The main natural features that would absorb water have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/11/climate/houston-flooding-climate.html\">paved over to support development</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so there are human-level decisions that ended up worsening the impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Beryl, it was also a fast-moving storm, and the wind caused a lot of damage to power lines. One of the utility companies there, Centerpoint, has a backlog of maintenance and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/360181/climate-hurricane-beryl-blackout-houston-flood\">there were well-known vulnerabilities</a>. So when you had a major storm, it knocked out a lot of power, but also took a long time to get it back. Meanwhile, Houston had a heat wave, so there was an intense energy demand. The high heat, the not having power, all converged to compound the effects of this disaster.<br><br>If you look at Beryl as just a Category 1 storm, you might brush it off. But when you look at all these other things going on, you realize this is a much more severe disaster than the category would suggest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>And the impact was far broader, right?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Right. Hurricanes tend to lose a lot of energy once they make landfall. But they can still be fairly devastating storms, especially if they move to an area that isn’t prepared for it, and isn’t used to getting a torrential downfall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The remnants of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/366893/debby-beryl-hurricane-climate-change-florida-texas-vermont\">Tropical Storm Debby and Beryl both hit Vermont</a>, and caused a lot of flooding and damage, and actually killed people. There was no place for that water to run off to, the people there are not necessarily well-versed in how to evacuate ahead of a storm, and the waterways, roads, and bridges are not designed to withstand sub-tropical storms.<br><br><strong>Is this something that we’re seeing more of, or are going to see more of?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We see that in general with extreme weather. We had a major heat wave in the Pacific Northwest a few years ago; that was devastating because that’s the area with the least amount of air conditioning in the US. It was harmful for the people there because they’re not acclimated to the heat, and they don’t have the infrastructure to deal with it.<br><br>We see the same thing with storms. A weaker storm can still be devastating in an area that does not have infrastructure that can withstand rains, or porous areas that can absorb the water. And when an event does occur, there’s more severe rainfall, because as air temperatures warm, the air can hold onto more moisture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, while we’re focusing on the extremes, we should look at what’s typical as well, and what’s typical is also changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is there something people can do to protect themselves on an individual level that we’re not already doing?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, you have to start to rethink your mentality. There’s a pervasive thinking that bad things won’t happen to you. If you go for years at a time without a hurricane or a storm, or your house got flooded, and now it’s been a decade, that memory fades very quickly.&nbsp;<br><br>But one of the concerns with climate change is that it’s bringing extremes into areas where they haven’t experienced them before. So this is a new process for some. The first step is recognizing and appreciating that you are vulnerable, that bad things can happen but you can in fact <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23196757/summer-disaster-weather-preparation-community-hurricane-wildfire-drought-heatwave-flood\">prepare for them</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big thing is you want to also get your policymakers thinking about things that can mitigate disasters over time — things like building sea walls in coastal areas, but also thinking about big changes like rethinking where we are allowed to build at all. Are we going to retreat from certain areas? Are we just going to have to<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/372014/shinnecock-nation-tribe-sea-rise-hamptons\"> give up on oceanfront areas</a> because the risk is too high? These are much more difficult policy questions, but we’re going to have to start grappling with them because now is the best opportunity — not after a disaster.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They’re also still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/23/kamala-harris-sonya-massey-killing-police-reform\">supportive of police reform</a>, though it has been less prominent as a campaign issue this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But now, with Republicans opposing nearly all of their gun control legislation, they’re highlighting their other efforts in crime prevention and public safety, too. “We made the largest investment, Kamala and I, in public safety, ever,” President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/20/read-the-entire-transcript-of-president-joe-bidens-dnc-speech/74867260007/\">said</a> at the Democratic National Convention in August, referring to the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announce-10-billion-american-rescue-plan-policing/story?id=84685199\">$10 billion</a> in funding committed through the American Rescue Plan to public safety efforts for cities and states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice presidential nominee Tim Walz <a href=\"https://time.com/7013698/watch-tim-walz-dnc-speech/\">touted</a> his administration’s investment in fighting crime as Minnesota governor at the DNC, and Chris Swanson, a sheriff from Genesee County, Michigan, took to the stage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAyyl4CJoXM\">to declare that</a> “crime is down and police funding is up,” in a speech that would have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-unveil-broad-police-reform-bill-pledge-to-transform-law-enforcement/2020/06/08/1ed07d7a-a992-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html\">almost unthinkable</a> at the 2020 Democratic convention, when activists and other prominent voices on the left were calling to “defund the police.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mayors leading major cities are now highlighting increases in funding and support for programs built around more recent innovations in violence reduction, including <a href=\"https://ojp.gov/topics/community-violence-intervention\">community violence intervention</a> and hyperlocal crime <a href=\"https://bja.ojp.gov/violent-crime-reduction-roadmap/intro\">reduction programs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Community safety is a year-round, collaborative effort,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOb6fxSX2e8\">said</a> earlier this year, unveiling a new summer safety program for the city, which has seen a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/boston-homicides-violence-prevention.html\">major drop</a> in gun homicides in 2024 compared to the previous year. “Our comprehensive approach to reducing gun violence is working,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said, crediting the work of the city’s <a href=\"https://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/news/press-releases/2024-02-08-baltimore-city-outlines-next-steps-group-violence-reduction-strategy\">group violence reduction strategy</a> in contributing to the city’s largest year-over-year <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-homicides-decrease-2023-d88000d65d3916d1fbbe6352becd8881\">reduction</a> in murders last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just that Democrats are responding to the rise in gun homicides in 2020 and 2021 and the political backlash that came with it. The change reflects a broader shift in thinking among Democrats and their nonpartisan allies who work in violence reduction, criminal justice, and police reform. It’s one that acknowledges the seriousness of preventing and reducing violent crime — the core concern of the “tough on crime” crowd — without accepting the idea that the solution is mass incarceration. There is a growing sense that increasing public safety, ending gun violence, and reducing mass incarceration, rather than being separate or even in tension, are pieces of the same pie, and that efforts to improve one should help improve the others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These conversations had been occurring in siloes,” between policymakers focused on public safety and policymakers and activists focused on criminal justice reform, <a href=\"https://counciloncj.org/team/adam-gelb/\">says Adam Gelb</a>, president and CEO of the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice. But the conversations have been merging and becoming more interconnected as they’ve come to an important realization: “We’re not going to solve or dramatically reduce incarceration rate unless we dramatically reduce the rate of community violence,” Gelb says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The change represents an evolution of years of policymaking on crime reduction and prevention. In the 1960s and 1970s, <a href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/united-states-crime-counts-1960-2022\">when murder and violent crime rose dramatically</a> in the United States, a sociologist looked at the available research about what could rehabilitate those convicted of crimes and came up with an unsettling conclusion: <a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/36811_6.pdf\">nothing worked</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This notion gave credence to a controversial new argument, outlined by American political theorist James Q. Wilson in his 1975 book <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/james-q-wilson/thinking-about-crime/9780465048847/?lens=basic-books\"><em>Thinking About Crime</em></a>. Wilson argued that since rehabilitation was essentially futile, the criminal justice system <a href=\"https://reason.com/1976/11/01/thinking-about-crime/\">should focus</a> on doing what they could to make sure repeat offenders were removed from society. Wilson’s views <a href=\"https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/uploads/content/Thinking_About_Punishment.pdf\">became popular</a> among policymakers, and the American prison population <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf\">began to grow</a> in the 1970s, through the crack epidemic and the “war on drugs” in the 1980s and 1990s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2009, the United States had <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf\">1.6 million people in prison</a> and the highest incarceration rate in the world. The social science researchers, meanwhile, had improved their ability to study the impact of various violence reduction strategies, and discovered something else important: deterrence based on issuing harsh prison sentences <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/247350.pdf\">also didn’t work</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, a growing movement recognized America’s mass incarceration issue as a real problem in and of itself — one that cost the government <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/the-u-s-spends-billions-to-lock-people-up-but-very-little-to-help-them-once-theyre-released\">billions annually</a>, <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2024/04/01/updated-charts/\">exacerbated</a> racial inequality, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9540942/\">devastated</a> communities and families.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As researchers deepened the body of existing research on racial bias in the criminal justice system, and activists organized to press lawmakers for change, a series of police killings of Black Americans brought the issue into the public’s view. By 2020, the movement for police and criminal justice reform had already made important progress, thanks to a network of organizers and activists, and funding from foundations and bipartisan coalitions. That support had helped build momentum for drug <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/fair-sentencing-act#:~:text=In%202010%2C%20Congress%20passed%20the,%3A1%20to%2018%3A1.\">sentencing reform</a> during President Barack Obama’s administration as well as his administration’s creation of a task force <a href=\"https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf\">aimed at</a> police reform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those efforts helped pave the way for the most significant sentencing reform bill in years, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18140973/state-of-the-union-trump-first-step-act-criminal-justice-reform\">First Step Act</a>, signed by President Donald Trump. The bill gave judges more flexibility to avoid lengthy sentences dictated by federal mandatory minimums, allowed incarcerated people to earn time credits that could move up their release date if they participated in rehabilitative programs, and made retroactive the earlier reform passed under the Obama administration, eliminating the sentencing disparity between those convicted of possessing crack versus powdered cocaine. By the last election cycle, the Democrats’ platform included <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21418125/biden-harris-pelosi-defund-the-police-criminal-justice-reform-2020\">the most progressive police reform agenda</a> in modern American history. The bill focused on greater accountability for police, but also included proposals to invest more in community-based violence reduction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as reformers were making strides, violent crime began to rise again in cities, due to a number of factors <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358831/us-violent-crime-murder-pandemic\">related to the pandemic</a>, policing after the George Floyd protests, and the ubiquity of guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By the end of 2020, the country had seen the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/06/health/us-homicide-rate-increase-nchs-study/index.html\">largest increase in its homicide rate</a> in nearly a century, and the problem got more difficult to ignore. The following year, homicides <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/upshot/murder-rise-2020.html\">remained high</a>. Former President Donald Trump and other Republicans increasingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23433184/crime-midterms-oz-fetterman-pennsylvania-senate\">pointed their fingers</a> at Democrats running big cities, arguing that their policies were responsible for rising violent crime and attempting to connect them with the left’s “defund the police” movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2022, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/31/violent-crime-is-a-key-midterm-voting-issue-but-what-does-the-data-say/\">six in 10 registered voters</a> listed crime as a “very important” issue for them in the midterm election cycle that November.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, a new crop of Democrats, responding to voters’ concerns, launched campaigns for mayor across the United States. Many made violent crime reduction their primary campaign issue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some, like New York’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/28/adams-nypd-crime-00002011\">Eric Adams</a>, who won in 2021, and Philadelphia’s <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2024/04/philadelphia-mayor-public-safety-plan/\">Cherelle Parker</a>, who won in 2023, campaigned on more funding and support for police. (Federal prosecutors announced Thursday that they had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted.html\">indicted</a> Adams on federal corruption charges, and the NYPD has been under heavy scrutiny for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/eric-adams-nypd-gun-units-illegal-stops.html\">illegal stops</a> on citizens, a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/21/us/nypd-brooklyn-subway-shooting/index.html\">recent subway shooting</a>, and a separate investigation that resulted in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html\">the police commissioner’s resignation</a> in September.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others, like Wu and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, have focused their efforts on <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/mayor-brandon-johnson-community-safety-plan-crime/\">outreach and intervention programs</a>, and focused on investing in community partnerships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The details of each city’s violence prevention program are different, but the broad elements are largely the same: They include <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/22/23367572/democrats-policing-bills-midterms\">more funding</a> for <em>both</em> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/373238/gun-violence-homicides-violent-crime-strategies\">the police and for community organizations</a> aimed at addressing the <a href=\"https://counciloncj.org/10-essential-actions/\">people and places</a> most likely to suffer from high rates of violent crime, especially gun homicide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Democratic politicians are being responsive to what voters care about,” says <a href=\"http://Jens Ludwig\">Jens Ludwig</a>,&nbsp;professor and director of the <a href=\"https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/\">University of Chicago’s Crime Lab</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not the only factor at play. Post-pandemic, Ludwig says, many cities were facing the challenges brought on by the emptying of cities and the rise of remote work, along with the rise in violent crime. Some feared this would result in an “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/urban-doom-loop-american-cities/677847/\">urban doom loop</a>” where people fled cities for the suburbs, making the problems worse and subsequently causing more people to flee. The stimulus funds from the federal government helped stave off the decline, but cities knew that the money wouldn’t last forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Every big city in the country now realizes that they aren’t going to be able to throw money at this problem forever,” Ludwig says. “There’s a need to figure out how to do more with less.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Investing in targeted initiatives that place community outreach workers in high-risk neighborhoods, or give police data to approach crime hotspots, are ultimately cost-effective methods to reduce violence. “These things are not super expensive in the grand scheme of things,” Ludwig says, and they give cities a way of reducing violence in the short-term while working on longer-term investments meant to address root causes of violence, including racial inequality and economic disinvestment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also helps, Ludwig says, that researchers have gotten much better at understanding what works —&nbsp;beyond gun control — to reduce gun violence in the last few decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Increasingly, those efforts are being championed by organizations offering resources for mayoral offices looking to reduce violence. Marc Morial, the former mayor of New Orleans, made national headlines for <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/crime/new-orleans-crime-how-it-cut-murder-rate-in-1990s-richard-pennington/289-427d1cf5-8633-495a-941a-aebedd3a11a6\">cutting the number of homicides in his city in half</a> during his time in office in the 1990s. Now, as president and CEO of the National Urban League, Morial and the organization are prioritizing community safety and police reform policies, and convening mayors to discuss how to best enact the strategies that have worked in other communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Focusing on community safety and police reform together makes sense for an organization like the National Urban League, Morial says, which has long focused on <a href=\"https://nul.org/\">advancing</a> economic and living conditions for Black Americans and other underserved people living in urban areas. “Quality of life in Black and brown and urban communities is a paramount issue. A community that feels victimized on the one hand by the police and on the other by crime and crooks is a very difficult community to live in,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Passing better gun laws still remains a major priority for Democrats. The issue was a large theme of the DNC, with Congresswoman Lucy McBath, <a href=\"https://x.com/RepLucyMcBath/status/1794105739612451197\">whose son</a> was a victim of gun violence, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upR9215dBZs\">sharing the stage with shooting survivors</a> and others who’d lost loved ones to gun violence. The Democratic Party <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-violence-top-issues-dnc-platform/story?id=112955833\">platform also devoted significant space</a> to solving the problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the campaign trail, Harris and Walz, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/371304/what-kamala-harris-gun-ownership-reveals-about-american-politics\">both gun owners</a>, have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-gun-owner-debate-trump-abc-election-control-33fa551a2b9021f85325fc5acd9a1a22\">talked about</a> their support for universal background checks, banning assault weapons, and expanding red flag laws, policies that remain popular with their <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/24/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">base</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the change in Democratic rhetoric — and in the policies in many cities across the United States — puts Democrats in a much different position than they were in 2022. Something else important happened too: violent crime has fallen. According to data <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/g-s1-24184/fbi-crime-data-2023\">the FBI released this week</a>, overall violent crime fell 3 percent in 2023 over the year before, with murder dropping almost 12 percent. It’s too early to say for certain what role these programs played, and what other factors may have contributed. But the reduction in homicides means more lives were saved — the most important change of all.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Forecasters warn that Helene — which has wind speeds of near 120 miles per hour — could be deadly for those living in coastal Florida, where it’s expected to make landfall this evening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The National Hurricane Center predicts storm surge <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/261747.shtml?\">as high as 20 feet</a> in some parts of Florida’s Big Bend, a region between the panhandle and the peninsula. Storm surge, which describes a rise in sea level, is the most dangerous part of tropical storms and has a deadly track record: In 2022, storm surge killed <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/\">more than 40 people</a> during Hurricane Ian. The storm is also expected to inundate inland regions across much of the southeastern US with rain, dumping a foot or more in parts of southern Appalachia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban flooding,” the National Hurricane Center <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/261747.shtml?\">said</a> early Thursday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene could also disrupt part of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22823993/monarch-butterflies-mexico-milkweed\">epic monarch butterfly migration</a>, which typically passes through the Big Bend’s St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in early October.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2173441112.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.4224368901015,100,83.155126219797\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Storm clouds from Helene over Havana, Cuba, on September 24. | Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene is the eighth named storm in what has so far amounted to a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atlantic-hurricane-lull-puzzles-scientists/\">somewhat puzzling</a> hurricane season. It started with a bang — June’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate\">Hurricane Beryl</a> became the earliest Category 5 storm on record —&nbsp;and then much of August and September was unexpectedly quiet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many meteorologists, though, have been warning not to be fooled by this late-summer lull.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Having multi-week periods of quiet and then multi-week periods of activity is very normal throughout a hurricane season,” <a href=\"https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/\">Brian McNoldy</a>, a climatologist at the University of Miami, told me earlier this month. “I definitely would not read too much into it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, McNoldy said, the ocean in the Gulf of Mexico has been —&nbsp;and still is —&nbsp;exceptionally hot, and hot water fuels hurricanes.

Others in Adams’s orbit — including the former <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/10/10/tow-truck-mob-city-hall-eric-adams-ulrich/\">head of the Buildings Department</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/nyregion/eric-adams-nypd-illegal-donations.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Nk4.3xf0.ju7chu9ORcz5&amp;smid=url-share\">former police inspector</a> — have faced their own scandals and charges as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams has denied breaking the law, saying in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/politics/video/mayor-eric-adams-nyc-indictment-sot-nn-perez-digvid\">Wednesday video statement</a>, “I am innocent, and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams’s indictment, made public on Thursday, involves <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25175485-us-v-eric-adams-indictment-unsealed-sept-26-2024-inner-city-press-on-the-cases\">five federal corruption charges</a>. The charges make Adams the first ever sitting New York City mayor to be indicted, and will likely have a significant effect on the upcoming mayoral race in 2025, which he was expected to run in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First elected as mayor in 2021, Adams previously served as Brooklyn borough president, state senator, and a New York City police officer. He’s known for his aggressive push to increase policing and combat crime as mayor, as well as bombastic comments he’s made about migrants and kooky catchphrases about governance. Now, his tenure as a public servant could be approaching its end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is a rundown of what we know about the indictment, and its implications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the charges against Eric Adams?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The charges center on Adams’s mayoral campaigns. They allege that he knowingly accepted illegal donations facilitated by a Turkish government official, and favors — like luxury plane tickets — as part of a quid pro quo relationship with the country. Together, they paint a picture of a foreign government official cultivating a prominent US politician over a period of years. The charges are: </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Conspiracy to commit wire fraud, solicit foreign contributions, and accept bribes (1 count):</strong> Adams is accused of setting up an illicit system to accept foreign donations as part of his mayoral campaigns, of accepting multiple plane tickets and luxury travel perks from a Turkish government official and Turkish businesspeople, and of helping a Turkish consulate building in New York City circumvent regulatory requirements in return. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Wire fraud (1 count): </strong>Certain campaign donations in New York City can be matched with public funds to help encourage candidates to seek small-dollar donations. The indictment alleges that Adams fraudulently solicited matching funds for donations that he knew were from “straw donors,” or donors used to funnel money from another source. He’s accused of using straw donors in both his 2021 and 2025 campaigns, and of securing $10 million in public matching funds in this way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national (2 counts): </strong>US political candidates are barred from accepting donations from foreign citizens, something Adams is accused of knowingly doing by taking money from Turkish nationals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Bribery (1 count): </strong>This charge is also related to Adams’s alleged exchange of certain travel benefits, like expensive plane tickets, for relaxing the regulatory requirements faced by a new Turkish consulate building. The building had yet to pass a fire safety screening ahead of a visit by Turkey’s president, and Adams reportedly pressured a Fire Department official to obtain expedited approval. The perks he received are alleged to have been valued at around $100,000.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who else has been accused of corruption?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html\">two dozen people</a> are involved with open investigations and litigation concerning Adams and his allies, not all of them related to corruption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those investigations include scrutiny of the campaign’s ties to six different foreign countries, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-juice-bar-shakedown-james-caban-ray-martin/\">allegations of extortion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/nyregion/adams-banks-consultant-investigation.html\">bribery allegations</a> related to a consulting firm run by the sibling of Adams administration officials. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eric-adams-lawsuit-sexual-assault-police-1524a079aaf40fc5578ae530c902737e\">Adams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/nypd-pearson-adams-lawsuit.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Nk4.bnR_.v4Y2Ua6JE7oF&amp;smid=url-share\">one of his advisors</a> also face allegations of sexual misconduct.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus far, two powerful people with links to Adams have also been indicted:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/nyregion/eric-ulrich-surrender-bribery.html\">Eric Ulrich</a>, Adams’ former Building Department Commissioner has been charged with accepting $150,000 in bribes in exchange for favors like approving building inspections. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/05/eric-adams-nypd-dwayne-montgomery-straw-donations-guilty-plea-00139593\">Dwayne Montgomery</a>, a former deputy police inspector who served on the force at the same time as Adams, pleaded guilty to arranging for straw donors to give Adams’ 2021 campaign thousands of dollars.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other officials, including the former Police Commissioner Caban, Schools Chancellor Banks, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks, and First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright have yet to be charged, but have had their phones seized. Former Adams chief fundraiser Brianna Suggs, senior adviser Winnie Greco, Interim Police Commissioner Thomas Donlon, and an aide who’s on leave, Rana Abbasova, have also had their homes searched. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Does Eric Adams have to step down? What happens if Adams doesn’t resign?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams does not have to step down because of the indictment, <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/09/17/what-happens-eric-adams-resigns/\">experts tell</a> the news outlet The City.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are ways to potentially force his removal, however. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/impeach-adams-governor-ny-city-charter.html\">New York Gov. Kathy Hochul</a> has the ability to first suspend, then remove, him from the position, though it’s a power that the state executive has rarely used. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">New York City officials could also set up a panel known as an “inability committee” that then empowers a group of city councilmembers to vote on whether Adams is unable to do his job. If two-thirds agreed with that assessment, he’d be required to leave his post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Adams leaves, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams would serve as acting mayor, and a special election for the job would have to be held within 80 days of Adams’s departure.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who has called on Eric Adams to resign?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the national lawmakers who have urged Adams to resign. She first did so ahead of his indictment, in light of the ongoing investigations into other members of his administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Nonstop investigations will make it impossible to recruit and retain a qualified administration,” <a href=\"https://x.com/AOC/status/1839020346957246939\">Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. “For the good of the city, he should resign.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City.<br><br>The flood of resignations and vacancies are threatening gov function. Nonstop investigations will make it impossible to recruit and retain a qualified administration.<br><br>For the good of the city, he should resign.…</p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1839020346957246939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others who’ve joined in the chorus <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-democrats-calling-new-yorks-eric-adams-resign-1959546\">include multiple New York City Councilmembers</a> like Tiffany Cabán, Lincoln Restler, and Chris Banks. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who is running for mayor in 2025?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams was scheduled to be up for re-election next year, though <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/eric-adams-job-approval-rating-00130454\">broad dissatisfaction with his tenure</a> had prompted several others to join the fray.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even ahead of the indictment, the contest was slated to be a packed one that includes current City Comptroller Brad Lander, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, and state Sen. Jessica Ramos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams is in the running as well, and is not required to step aside due to his indictment. However, he was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/eric-adams-job-approval-rating-00130454\">not a popular figure</a> before his recent legal troubles — and if he opts to stay in office, and in the race, he’s likely to find the contest to be a difficult one.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s one of the more absurd things happening in <em>For Your Approval</em>, a night of taped comedy that DeGeneres and Netflix have been promoting as the comedian’s response to being <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/ellen-degeneres-canceled-new-comedy-tour-netflix-special-1235010950/\">“kicked out of Hollywood.”</a> Nabbing a comedy special on one of the biggest entertainment platforms on the planet should probably disqualify anyone from saying they were “kicked out of Hollywood,” but we do not live in a world where sentences make sense. (Netflix reportedly paid <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellendurney/ellen-degeneres-new-netflix-special-reactions\">DeGeneres $20 million</a> for her 2018 set <em>Relatable</em>.) Instead, we have a packed-house show by an alleged Hollywood outcast filmed for Netflix, with an audience hooting and hollering for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22466574/gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-meaning\">a 2016 girlboss platitude</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What the former talk show host really means by “kicked out of Hollywood” is that her brand took a hit. DeGeneres, who was blacklisted and shunned in the industry after coming out in the ’90s, should know the difference between those things better than anyone.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The severity of DeGeneres’s second “cancellation” is debatable. In 2019, DeGeneres had actress <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/12/2/20991074/dakota-johnson-ellen-birthday-feud\">Dakota Johnson</a> on her eponymous show and that interview quickly turned into a meme. The host questioned the actress about her recent 30th birthday party, claiming she hadn’t been invited, which prompted Johnson’s famous reply: “Actually, no, that’s not the truth, Ellen” — saying in fact, DeGeneres had skipped the festivities. (It was later discovered that DeGeneres was hanging out with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/08/ellen-degeneres-defends-watching-football-with-president-george-w-bush/\">George W. Bush</a> at a Dallas Cowboys game.) The back and forth went viral, prompting a semi-playful examination of whether DeGeneres was actually a nice person, which built into more serious reports of a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/ellen-employees-allege-toxic-workplace-culture\">toxic work</a> environment at <em>The Ellen Show</em>, with accusations of racism and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/ellen-show-toxic-workplace-complaint-2018\">sexism</a>. Eventually, <em>The Ellen Show</em> was quite literally canceled in May of 2022. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/EDSS_Unit_00174R.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"Ellen Degeneres alone, sitting on a stool and looking into a mirror.\" title=\"Ellen Degeneres alone, sitting on a stool and looking into a mirror.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Ellen DeGeneres admits that she isn’t nice 24/7 because no one is nice 24/7. | Wilson Webb/Netflix\" data-portal-copyright=\"Wilson Webb/Netflix\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">DeGeneres doesn’t get into these specifics in the special.  For her applause-ready audience (at one point they cheer when DeGeneres name-drops a producer named “Andy”), she glosses over the more serious parts of the fallout, saying simply that the reason she was booted from the industry was because people didn’t realize her kindness was part of the act. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can’t be mean and be in show business,” DeGeneres deadpans. “No mean people in show business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">DeGeneres paints herself as a less kind person than the <em>Ellen</em> we see on TV, recounting complaints from her wife Portia about how she’s comically impatient. She admits she’s rude at parties, saying that her talk show trained her to only pay attention in segments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to the toxic workplace allegations, she explains that she didn’t really know how to be a boss, which she chalks up to her love of playing pranks on producers. She also speaks about how complicated she is — having been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-deficit disorder — and how that can manifest in being a bad manager. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, DeGeneres asserts that she’s definitely kinder and nicer than the person we read about in the news. She can’t stop wanting to help lost animals, she says, and she finds beauty in how caterpillars liquefy themselves and turn into butterflies. That ties into what she lets on about her peaceful, post-talk-show life: She’s gardening more, surrounded presumably by butterflies, and tending to a roost of chickens. DeGeneres also reveals that she wears sweatpants in the home and cannot be pried out of them once she slips them on, not even for “Mick” (as in Jagger). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m 66 years old,” she tells the audience, who respond with raucous applause. DeGeneres follows that statement up with a joke about how restaurants’ menu font size makes her feel old.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For all the time she’s spent imagining the thought process of a just-hatched butterfly or the seemingly brainless organization scheme of her car’s dashboard or how the width of the two “bankrupt” panels flanking the million-dollar panel in <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> is unfair, DeGeneres barely examines the obvious question about her “niceness.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Nice” wasn’t simply a byproduct of being Ellen; DeGeneres ultimately turned being kind into one of the most profitable business plans in Hollywood. And she did so after gaining first-hand knowledge of what it’s actually like to be professionally blacklisted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At one point in the special, DeGeneres compares this current time in her career to the period after she came out publicly. The comedian had announced she was a lesbian on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em> just prior to her eponymous character coming out on her sitcom, <em>Ellen,</em> that same year. She also famously appeared on the cover of Time magazine, with the cover line reading, “Yep, I’m Gay.” It was, undeniably, new ground for the country, and a brave claim of self. After “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0570077/\">The Puppy Episode</a>,” as it was called, DeGeneres says she struggled to find work — a rejection based on who she was, even if the sitcom character wasn’t exactly her.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During DeGeneres’s turn as a talk show host, she became less like herself and more like a sitcom character. Her terminal niceness became her identity. All the mean, bigoted things people said about her being a lesbian didn’t have any bearing — she was showing audiences across America that she was a nice person, first and foremost, who just so happened to be gay. She rose above the prejudices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22463879/kink-at-pride-discourse-lgbtq\">respectability politics</a>, stretched and shaped into an extremely beneficial career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It must have been difficult to do what DeGeneres did, to sand down the edges and flatten the wrinkles of her whole identity, to fit into this TV host mold and appeal to people who had rejected her. But that was her business, one more crucial than being a TV show host, producer, or comedian. Behind the scenes, it seems, she dropped the ball. After many years of playing nice, DeGeneres wasn’t able to do her job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of acknowledging that lapse or asserting that there’s a stark difference between being unpleasant to work for and ignoring a toxic work environment, in <em>For Your Approval, </em>DeGeneres pivots to talking about how society is tough on women in the workplace — holding them to impossible double standards and trapping them in roles designed to fail. While those factors were certainly at play, it’s a little obtuse — if not purposely hollow — to use those societal issues to buff out the more serious accusations that sunk her show. I’m not sure those kinds of excuses and obfuscations are what you’d hear from a nice person, but DeGeneres would concede she was never that nice to begin with.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

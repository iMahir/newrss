Many influential animal activists are now debating a question that would have once seemed absurd: Is it worth the movement’s precious time and resources to keep advocating for meatless diets, an apparently lost cause?</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One surprising thing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The share of Americans who are vegetarian or vegan is incredibly hard to measure accurately. But one thing is clear: It hasn’t changed much in recent decades, and <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/510038/identify-vegetarian-vegan.aspx\">may have even decreased</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>This piece is part of </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics\"><strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></a><strong>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although people define veganism in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41055-020-00081-6\">different ways</a>, it fundamentally entails avoiding all animal products to the greatest extent possible, including meat, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools\">dairy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23588340/egg-prices-expensive-bird-flu-shortage-price-gouging\">eggs</a>, but also non-dietary products like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24008053/wool-marketing-environment-sustainable-claims-sheep-animal-cruelty-fast-fashion\">wool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/leather-industry/\">leather</a>. Whereas the more commonly practiced vegetarianism only rejects meat consumption, the vegan movement generally rejects the property status of animals and aims to fully divest from animal cruelty and exploitation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vegans are often considered <a href=\"https://www.ivu.org/history/vegan-from-1909.pdf\">too extreme</a>, especially in a meat-obsessed country like the US — a perception that persists despite the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/plant-based-foods-market-to-hit-162-billion-in-next-decade-projects-bloomberg-intelligence/\">growing popularity</a> of vegan products. The famed late chef Anthony Bourdain once <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/books/OL19290065M/Kitchen_confidential\">compared</a> vegans to Hezbollah, declaring them “the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit.” His aversion seems representative of the public’s feelings. One 2015 <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1368430215618253\">study</a> found that, in the United States, negative attitudes toward vegans rivaled those toward atheists.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These social headwinds are making veganism unpopular even among influential voices in the animal movement. Matt Ball, who co-founded the advocacy group <a href=\"https://veganoutreach.org/\">Vegan Outreach</a> in the 1990s but has since changed his tune on the strategic necessity of promoting animal-free diets, has <a href=\"https://www.mattball.org/2017/05/how-vegans-hurt-animals.html\">argued</a> that the “‘vegan’ brand is damaged beyond repair.” Bruce Friedrich — founder of the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that seeks to develop alternative proteins that do not require animal slaughter — has made a moderated version of a similar claim. In a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/technology/bruce-friedrich-animal-activist.html\">2019 interview</a>, he lamented that “we’ve tried to convince the world to go vegan, and it has not worked.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The percentage of Americans who are vegan or vegetarian remains small, though it is a notoriously difficult figure to pin down. This minute figure, juxtaposed with the <a href=\"https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/per-capita-consumption-of-poultry-and-livestock-1965-to-estimated-2012-in-pounds/\">clearly documented increase</a> in US per-capita meat consumption, suggests veganism seems to be failing. For Friedrich and others, this failure to affect dietary habits signals a need to shift animal advocacy’s emphasis toward larger-scale policy and technological innovations, like <a href=\"https://gfi.org/cultivated/\">cell-cultivated (sometimes known as lab-grown) meat</a>, that can reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food in the absence of dietary change. It also requires that pro-animal advocates tone down their dogmatism, abandon the quest for purity, and compromise more with large corporations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I suspect that at least some aspects of this weariness resonate with large swathes of people who advocate for animal rights or are sympathetic to their plight: the warning against dogmatism and a call for nuance, a healthy skepticism toward individualism and consumerism, and the sense that <em>something </em>is better than nothing, even if that something is less radical than we’d like. Indeed, on its own, even the strictest veganism can feel like a minuscule choice against the onslaught of the factory farming death machine, which tortures and kills more than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">10 billion land animals</a> annually in the US alone. Why spend so much energy convincing people to undertake such a massive life change if it seems akin to using a bucket to bail water out of a sinking cruise liner?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While I sympathize with these sentiments, I worry that they miss the promise and radical force of veganism: It can be an act of <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10455752.2020.1837895\">solidarity</a> with <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josp.12460\">nonhuman animals</a>. Veganism takes the recognition that animals are sentient beings with lives of their own and infuses it into one’s body and everyday practice. In a world that relies on extracting the literal lifeblood of nonhuman animals, that depends on externalizing the costs of “progress” onto them and distributing the benefits to privileged humans, veganism refuses to pass the buck. It is a way of “saying” to nonhumans, non-verbally and without the promise that the message will be received: <em>The world has turned against you, depends on your flesh and bone. But we will not. We refuse.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/CoeVegansDefend.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,28.335439610038,100,43.329120779924\" alt=\"black-and-white linocut drawing of a large crowd of people with linked arms, labeled “VEGANS,” standing in front of a cow and calf, while a man representing the meat industry stands in front of them holding a knife and money bag with blood dripping from it. \" title=\"black-and-white linocut drawing of a large crowd of people with linked arms, labeled “VEGANS,” standing in front of a cow and calf, while a man representing the meat industry stands in front of them holding a knife and money bag with blood dripping from it. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"“Vegans Defend” (2016) by Sue Coe. | © 2016 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York\" data-portal-copyright=\"© 2016 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This exhortation has profound implications for the animal movement’s future direction. Animal advocates have often been <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/abolitionism-and-welfarism-two-animal-advocacy-perspectives/\">mired in debate</a> over which tactics are the best use of our time, and which ones meaningfully help animals instead of creating a “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing\">humanewashing</a>” smokescreen. Promoting veganism need not be the movement’s only or primary strategy, but it should remain its heartbeat. After all, if we’re not committed to fighting for a world free from animal exploitation, then what exactly is the movement fighting for? Veganism as solidarity provides a core commitment and standard that can help set movement priorities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Society enlists us into war against animals</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The strategic case against veganism largely depends on the claim that the percentage of Americans who have gone vegetarian or vegan remains minute — perhaps <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/\">as low as 2 percent</a> — and has not appreciably increased in decades. But there are more optimistic ways to read the data. Communications scholar Vasile Stanescu <a href=\"https://www.criticalanimal.com/2019/07/guest-post-response-to-claim-that-only.html\">argued</a> in 2019 that rates of vegetarianism and veganism in the US <em>have</em> increased, to somewhere between 8 and 13 percent. Even if his figure proves an overestimate — no peer-reviewed work, to my knowledge, exists to settle the question — it seems unwise to throw away a pillar of animal rights when we aren’t even sure of the numbers. One must also consider the counterfactual: How high might meat consumption be if consumers faced a firehose of industry-sponsored, pro-meat messaging without a pro-vegan counterbalance?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, one might argue, it makes little sense to invest scarce resources on promoting veganism without evidence of a clear and measurable impact. This objection makes a lot of sense if we understand veganism as primarily a consequentialist, consumer-oriented approach, of “voting with your dollar.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But reframing veganism as solidarity encourages advocates to think beyond quantifiable market consequences (though these effects are still <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/31/9067651/eggs-chicken-effective-altruism\">relevant</a>). Put differently, veganism matters not only because of its economic divestment from animal exploitation, but also because of its less quantifiable <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josp.12460\">political</a> effects. Going vegan builds political energy and connections with other humans invested in animal liberation and with the animals that vegans recognize as sentient and social creatures. It builds glimpses of a desired future in the present.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps most importantly, solidaristic veganism acknowledges that in today’s world, after centuries of humans’ intense exploitation of animals, it’s nearly impossible to have an ethical relationship with animals without addressing the most direct ways that most people benefit from the destruction of animal life. Animals are not simply mistreated beings. Rather, society is organized around slaughtering, torturing, and dominating animals, as a class, on a massive scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A brief look at the statistics evinces this claim: Globally, an additional <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-are-factory-farmed#note-1\">70 billion</a> land animals are killed for food on top of the US’s 10 billion. Factory-farmed fish, which are harder to count, may add more than 100 billion. Habitat destruction, primarily driven by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22287498/meat-wildlife-biodiversity-species-plantbased\">industrial animal farming</a>, is snowballing out of control. Tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions, of animals are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/12/11/23500157/neuralink-animal-testing-elon-musk-usda-probe\">held captive and experimented on</a> in scientific labs. Even dogs and cats, perceived as the most pampered animals in America, are still <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/11/23673393/pets-dogs-cats-animal-welfare-boredom\">legal property</a>, living largely at the whims of whoever happens to own them (not to mention the <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics\">6 million in shelters</a>, nearly 1 million of whom are killed annually, partly due to the pet breeding industry).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>To become politically vegan is to become a conscientious objector </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another way of framing this dire state of affairs, as the social theorist Dinesh Wadiwel <a href=\"https://brill.com/display/title/32110?language=en\">does</a>, is that the world acts as if it is at war with animals. Not all humans are equally to blame for the atrocities of this war, but living in and benefitting from a society that, as a rule, marks animals for torture and death, changes the nature of one’s responsibility. For Wadiwel, veganism offers a “truce” to animals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can extend this war framework a step further: To become politically vegan is to become a conscientious objector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Think about those who became conscientious objectors in the face of being drafted for the Vietnam War. Those who refused conscription could claim conscientious objector status only if participating in the war conflicted with their deeply held beliefs, and not merely because they had a self-interest in not being killed. Depriving the military of one soldier was not going to change the course of the war, but conscientious objection had other effects: It made private opposition public, it broke the facade of a uniform pro-war consensus, and it <a href=\"https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4078&amp;context=clevstlrev\">provided a rallying point</a> for further political action. Objectors in the 1960s and ’70s became part of <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/anti-war-movements-throughout-american-history\">the largest anti-war movement</a> in US history.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/CoeMyMotherIWatchPigEscapeFromSlaughterhouse_159118.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.493455497382,100,35.013089005236\" alt=\"Painting of a slaughterhouse filled with stressed-looking farm animals of various species and workers preparing to slaughter them. A woman and daughter stand near the entrance as a pig runs toward them attempting to flee. \" title=\"Painting of a slaughterhouse filled with stressed-looking farm animals of various species and workers preparing to slaughter them. A woman and daughter stand near the entrance as a pig runs toward them attempting to flee. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"“My Mother and I Watch a Pig Escape from the Slaughterhouse” (2006) by Sue Coe. | © 2006 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York\" data-portal-copyright=\"© 2006 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, imagine that you were talking to a conscientious objector and said: “The data is against you. Very few people want to become conscientious objectors. You are only alienating people, and your refusal to serve is just a drop in the bucket compared to the military’s power. Perhaps you should try more moderate steps first.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To say this would be to misunderstand the goal of conscientious objection. Anti-vegan critics have a similar misapprehension. The world “conscripts” us in its war against animals in the way it structures our choices when we buy clothes, food, and other necessities whose production depends on violence against animals. To become vegan is not only to try to prevent some animal death and exploitation, but to build political opposition to our forced participation in this war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The false binary of purity vs. pragmatism</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Veganism is sometimes strawmanned as a kind of purity politics that only benefits sanctimonious activists. It’s true that being purely cruelty-free is impossible: <a href=\"https://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/heres-scoop-chemical-organic-fertilizers\">organic fertilizers</a> use animal products, <a href=\"https://extension.arizona.edu/sites/extension.arizona.edu/files/pubs/az1481i.pdf\">pesticides harm many animals</a>, and large-scale plant farming generally kills and displaces animals (<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/does-veganism-kill-more-animals/\">though not anywhere near as many as animal agriculture</a>). Similarly, by analogy, becoming an anti-war conscientious objector does not wash one’s hands of all complicity; even paying taxes abets the war effort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But framing veganism as an act of solidarity can shatter the false binary between purity and pragmatism. There are uses for the public rigor that solidarity demands that go beyond purity. It punctures the smooth surface of everyday life, putting its everyday violence in view.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Consider a scenario Friedrich presents in an older piece of writing, where a vegan dines with omnivorous companions at a restaurant with limited vegan options. <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/essays-effective-advocacy/\">For Friedrich</a>, if “you give the server the third degree about the ingredients or about how it was cooked, you are forgetting the essence of being vegan” because you make veganism seem more difficult to others at the table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I certainly agree that one shouldn’t give underpaid servers a hard time, but not with the scenario’s underlying respectability politics. Yes, veganism may seem more difficult, but demonstrating this difficulty <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/9132254/Vegan_Killjoys_at_the_Table_Contesting_Happiness_and_Negotiating_Relationships_with_Food_Practices\">highlights the gap</a> between what the world is willing to provide and what justice demands. Perhaps your tablemates will be put off by this demonstration, but perhaps the situation provides the opportunity for a conversation that would not have occurred if you simply smoothed over the issue. Perhaps they will admire your willingness to stick to your principles even when it’s inconvenient. Perhaps they are more likely to pay attention when vegan options are available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fundamental point is that politics is not only about calm, rational persuasion and consensus-building. It can also be purposefully oppositional, concerned with <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=33817&amp;bottom_ref=subject\">dissensus and agonistic conflict</a>. The great non-violence movements of the 20th century were not primarily focused on easing their opponents to their side but on raising the costs of the status quo via boycotts, sit-ins, and disruptive<em> </em>marches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From this perspective, if the numbers of vegans truly are small, that is not in itself a cause for worry. Popularity is not the only goal of a movement that seeks to disrupt the public’s “common sense.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How solidarity with animals can inform movement tactics (and it’s not just advocating for veganism) </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This perspective on veganism’s politics affects the movement’s strategy in two ways. First, veganism should remain a core principle. That is not to say that it should be the only strategy: I agree with the need to experiment with different tactics and to focus beyond shifting individual people’s beliefs toward changing social and industrial infrastructures with innovations like “clean meat” and policies that limit animal mistreatment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But solidaristic acts like veganism serve as the “political fuel” necessary for broader changes to policy and cultural norms, philosophers Alasdair Cochrane and Mara-Daria Cojocaru <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/solidarity-with-animals-9780198897941?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">argue</a>. The political will for new vegan technologies and anti-cruelty policies does not come miraculously from the ether but requires building a critical mass of people committed to a world without animal exploitation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Solidaristic acts like veganism serve as the “political fuel” necessary for broader changes to policy and cultural norms</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, veganism as solidarity provides a lens through which to evaluate tactics deployed by the movement, like farm animal welfare laws. For decades, animal advocates have <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1355&amp;context=journal_articles#:~:text=Part%20I%20discusses%20the%20differences,the%20property%20status%20of%20animals.\">argued</a> fiercely over the value of incremental reforms to the factory farm system like, say, banning the most extreme forms of cage confinement. Do these strategies help us end factory farming, or do they merely give a false humane sheen to the killing machine?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Veganism as solidarity provides a rubric by which to evaluate pro-animal reforms: Does the reform in question come out of a place of solidarity with animals, one that may ultimately lead toward abolishing their status as commodities, or does it ultimately enable conditions that undermine the potential for this solidarity?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can borrow a helpful framework from the prison abolitionist movement: the idea of <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/non-reformist-reforms-and-struggles-over-life-death-and-democracy\">non-reformist reforms</a>. Non-reformist reforms help create the conditions for meaningfully shifting the power structure, while reformist reforms may only reify it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For example, when major animal welfare organizations publicly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqbE9EbpTAr/?img_index=3\">congratulate </a>(and give free advertising to) large meat producers for signing on to voluntary welfare standards, I question whether this action advances solidarity. True accountability is limited to the corporations themselves, and they get to walk away with a gold star that increases their credibility even as their fundamental business model remains the same. To extend the anti-war analogy, would it be solidarity with the victims of war if Lockheed Martin agreed to use slightly more “humane” methods of war and modern activists went out of their way to congratulate the company?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Further, when activists implore consumers to eat one type of animal rather than another — “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/5/27/15701168/save-animal-lives-eat-beef-not-chicken\">save animals by eating more beef and less chicken</a>” or “<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eating-chicken-instead-beef-will-drastically-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-180972392/\">save the environment by eating less beef and more chickens</a>” — they betray that obligation to solidarity. Even work like that of the famed livestock scientist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/temple-grandin-on-autism-death-celibacy-and-cows.html\">Temple Grandin</a>, who has <a href=\"https://www.grandin.com/design/chute.ramp.race.design.html\">designed</a> livestock handling systems that reduce animals’ fear and resistance as they walk down a chute to meet a bolt gun, only helps them acquiesce in their oppression and reduces the friction in the meat industry’s slaughter pipeline.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/CoeGassingHogs.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.985900160697,100,66.028199678607\" alt=\"black-and-white drawing of anguished-looking pigs being gassed before slaughter in a gas chamber.

Obviously, these bans don’t challenge the fundamental commodity status of chickens, and chickens deserve far more. But it does <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23588340/egg-prices-expensive-bird-flu-shortage-price-gouging\">impose an external cost</a> on the smooth operation of chicken farming, one that the industry would not willingly adopt for itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From this standpoint, I am disheartened when I see animal advocates so publicly decry veganism’s supposed failures. Partly because doing so creates a self-fulfilling prophecy — discouraging individuals from going vegan by making it seem like a lost cause from the get-go, as Stanescu <a href=\"https://www.criticalanimal.com/2019/07/guest-post-response-to-claim-that-only.html\">notes</a>. But more fundamentally, it inaccurately frames the present moment. It is not that “promoting veganism has failed, so it is time to move onto new strategies.” Rather: veganism <em>opens</em> <em>the way</em> for these new strategies. The acorn does not negate the value of the oak tree it came from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Admittedly, solidarity doesn’t provide clean lines that can uncontroversially decide which reforms are or are not permissible. But it hopefully offers more useful criteria than reform for the sake of reform.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The joy of veganism</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have so far emphasized that veganism has broader, political implications beyond individual behavior change. But the way that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24131229/vegan-vegetarian-meatless-climate-solutions-recipes-connection\">it shapes the lives</a> of individuals who become vegan can be <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/matthew-c-halteman/hungry-beautiful-animals/9781541602052/?lens=basic-books\">extremely powerful</a>, too. Political veganism can better attune advocates as they persuade individuals of the practice’s virtues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Political scientists have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/11/protests-shape-policy-by-shaping-protesters/\">observed</a> that political protests change the character of those who protest, even if the protest doesn’t achieve its stated policy goal. If, for example, you attend a protest against a new oil pipeline, what was once an abstract issue on a computer screen becomes alive to you. You learn that you are not alone, and you might find sustenance in community with others who care about climate politics as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Veganism as solidarity can have a similar effect. Abstaining from animal products in a world that disavows animal suffering prevents the vegan from forgetting the character of this world; it puts them into constant confrontation with it every time they go to the grocery store, buy clothes, and commune with others. To rework Upton Sinclair’s famous <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something\">line</a>, it is hard to get a person to think clearly about animals when their everyday life depends on animal slaughter, degradation, and exploitation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9749860/#ref78\">One </a><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0160597616640308?journalCode=hasa\">objection</a> to this individual-level view is that veganism privileges those without gastrointestinal or other disabilities and those who can financially afford these restrictions. You may have an image of a vegan eating organic vegetables and overpriced meat substitutes from Whole Foods. While I would note there is evidence suggesting that plant-based diets can <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vegan-vegetarian-and-flexitarian-diets-could-save-you-money-new-research-171559\">cut food costs</a> in industrialized countries and that survey results find that people with <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/file/poll/510047/230824VegetarianVegan.pdf\">lower incomes</a> are more likely to be vegan, framing veganism as solidarity offers an alternative way of considering this issue. Calling for solidarity with regard to any cause or campaign entails asking potential allies to undertake some sort of sacrifice, whether that be in terms of money, time, or power. Having the resources to undertake these sacrifices is by nature unequally distributed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The call for solidarity with animals goes out equally to every person, but fulfilling that call may look different for everyone. For those who do not face substantial financial or health barriers, the demands are quite high, in my view. For others, full veganism might be an aspiration, which they fulfill in the present by lowering their animal consumption where possible. This is not an iron-clad, all-or-nothing law. Accidentally consuming animal products, or eating an “emotional-support pastry” in an otherwise vegan diet, is less important in the long scheme of things, because solidarity is a call that can be answered anew each day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Answering this call is not about purist asceticism; it is affirmatively oriented toward building community. It builds new connections that wouldn’t have otherwise existed; it helps you see new ways of being in the world that weren’t there before. It opens you to the joy of being with nonhuman others, of refusing “species loneliness,” what botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer <a href=\"https://milkweed.org/book/braiding-sweetgrass\">describes</a> as “a deep, unnamed sadness stemming from estrangement from the rest of Creation.” You see the world as more enchanted and alive when creatures around you appear as individuals and not interchangeable automatons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Veganism, thought of in this way, is not the province of dour, dogmatic scolds; it is a practice of joy and creativity that sustains hope for coexistence between species. As Cochrane and Cojocaru <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/josp.12460\">write</a>, this sort of solidarity recognizes that “the world in which we live is not the one we must live with forever.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a vision worth fighting for.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Despite decades of advocacy, vegans and veganism remain deeply unpopular, even detested.

Such perceptions — some of which are reductive, <a href=\"https://www.treehugger.com/preachy-vegan-counterproductive-cliche-5120850\">while others hold a bit of truth</a> —&nbsp;have created a toxic cycle where people of color often feel excluded from vegan communities, and because of the lack of diversity, these communities struggle to foster a coalition that can lead to real change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As a Black man in animal rights, I’ve definitely [been] — the only Black person at events or the only person of color — and it’s definitely a bit isolating,” said Christopher “Soul” Eubanks, a Black animal rights advocate in Georgia and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23948915/christopher-soul-eubanks-apex-advocacy-founder-future-perfect-50-2023\">Future Perfect 50 honoree.</a> “And that’s why a lot of people of color that join this space may burn out, because they don’t see representation when they are here, and they’re just tired of having to correct people or weighing certain issues at the table.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story is part of <strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Read more from this special package analyzing the long fight against factory farming </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s 2024 — and so much change has happened in nearly every activist space. As the push to protect abortion access and combat climate change grows stronger, organizations like <a href=\"https://blackgirlenvironmentalist.org/\">Black Girl Environmentalist</a> and <a href=\"https://arc-southeast.org/\">ARC Southeast</a>, a reproductive justice support group in the South, have worked across race, gender, and class to assemble mass movements. Vegans and animal rights activists have made some major strides in recent years; <a href=\"https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/pbfa-plant-based-food-service/\">restaurants</a> and <a href=\"https://plantbasedfoods.org/2021-retail-sales-data-plant-based-food\">grocery stores</a> carry far more vegan options compared to a decade ago, and the Supreme Court last year upheld <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721488/prop-12-scotus-pork-pigs-factory-farming-california-bacon\">California’s Proposition 12</a>, a landmark law that outlawed the sale of many animal products produced using <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork\">tiny, inhumane cages</a>. But neglecting the voices of people of color for so long has meant there are obvious gaps amid these successes: There’s a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233571944_The_Under-representation_of_African_American_Employees_in_Animal_Welfare_Organizations_in_the_United_States\">lack of Black-led animal welfare organizations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/food-insecurity-increased-second-straight-year-2023\">food insecurity still disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic households</a>, and harmful vegan rhetoric often inaccurately portrays <a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/veganism-is-not-anti-indigenous/\">Indigenous traditions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m tired of looking at the same events and seeing the same people speak, and there [are] barely any Black and Brown vegans or animal rights activists being represented,” said Isaias Hernandez, an environmental educator and activist. He also runs a popular <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@queerbrownvegan\">TikTok</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/queerbrownvegan/\">Instagram account</a> called ​@queerbrownvegan to help raise awareness about how environmental justice should encompass issues of race, gender, and class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem is wider than just representation politics, however: Black Americans, Indigenous peoples, and other communities of color are disproportionately the ones suffering from the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry\">ills of factory farming</a>, whether it’s through <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/new-drinking-water-report-communities-color-more-likely-suffer-drinking-water\">water pollution</a> that leads to higher rates of cancer or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/us-farms-made-200m-human-smuggling-labor-trafficking-operation\">having to work in grueling farms</a> that have few protections for people and animals alike. While not everyone turns to a plant-based diet because of animal rights alone, the plights of people of color and animals are very much intertwined.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">White supremacy resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/buffalowar/buffalo.html\">mass slaughter of animals vital to Indigenous communities</a>, the booming <a href=\"https://foodwhistleblower.org/racial-injustice-the-truth-about-industrial-agriculture/\">meat industries</a> built on <a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/indigenous-communities-factory-farming\">stolen Indigenous land</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/15/us-agriculture-census-farming\">lack of land ownership for nonwhite farmers</a>. These global, meat-reliant foodways have direct ties to slavery and colonialism, <a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/the-food-system-is-built-on-white-supremacy/\">experts argue</a>. Many vegans of color feel these connections have not been prioritized or well understood within the animal movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The issue with the animal rights movement is that it still failed to acknowledge the role of white supremacy in creating these industrialized systems,” Hernandez said. “When I’m trying to deep-dive into industrialized agriculture, not just looking at how it affects humans, but understanding why these industrialized systems came about through colonization through chattel slavery, I think those conversations are then ignored, mainly because it challenges many of the dominant animal spaces — that are typically white people — to challenge their own power and privilege.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the activists I spoke with, the key to making vegan activism more inclusive, as well as more effective in accomplishing its goals, is to “decolonize” it. That means addressing the <a href=\"https://atmos.earth/ipcc-report-colonialism-climate-change/\">longstanding harms</a> left by colonialism — think segregation and climate change&nbsp; — that perpetuate other harms, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/how-present-day-health-disparities-for-black-people-are-linked-to-past-policies-and-events/\">like health inequities</a>. Without untangling how race, class, and culture affects how and what people are able to eat, then we’re only left with what some call <a href=\"https://seas.umich.edu/news/breaking-down-white-veganism#:~:text=According%20to%20critics%2C%20vegans%20who,participating%20in%20a%20vegan%20lifestyle.\">white veganism</a>, which focuses on animal liberation alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Intersectional veganism is needed, because it actually helps people understand that this isn’t just some whitewashed, hippie lifestyle, but rather an extension of understanding liberation,” Hernandez said.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_940.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Four hands reaching toward a beyaynetu spread at Bunna Cafe in Bushwick, New York City. A growing number of Black Americans are choosing veganism.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a Black vegan myself, I experience these tensions between white vegans and vegans of color all the time. I first dabbled in vegetarianism in 2019, after watching a documentary that piqued my interest. My curiosity was driven by potential <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24034578/vegan-twin-study-stanford-you-are-what-you-eat-netflix\">personal health improvements</a> and a desire to try new foods, but a conversation with my best friend about her growing interest in veganism was my sign to pursue the lifestyle change. At the time, her new career path included recipe development with a focus on vegetable-centric dishes, and I was eager to replicate traditionally non-vegan recipes like broccoli cheddar soup and birria tacos. Surrounding myself with other vegans that prioritize education, community, and accessibility started with her, and it’s been my blueprint for the last five years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The suffering of animals wasn’t worth the decadent recipes we’d grown to love. As a Southerner growing up in the Panhandle of Florida, I was surrounded by fish fries, seafood boils, barbecues, and the most luxurious desserts you can imagine. Giving up soul food — or any cultural dish — is a loss I wasn’t prepared for when I first went vegan. I knew I was signing up for the isolation of being the only vegan at a family cookout or party, but I didn’t expect to rarely interact with other Black vegans at plant-based restaurant meetups, food festivals, and Facebook groups. I’m not alone in feeling that way.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_1319.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Noella Williams, a Brooklyn-based freelance writer, eats within her vegan diet at Bunna Cafe, an Ethiopian restaurant.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But decolonizing veganism and ushering in a new era that integrates the lived experiences of all into animal activism is possible. That vision is burgeoning, from the chefs of color reintroducing dishes rooted in history to the activists fighting for more nuanced discussions in the animal movement, Black veganism empowers and centers those who’ve been failed by our food system <em>while</em> fighting for animal liberation. This is the combination we need to build inclusive communities, so that no one feels alone — and a unified community made up of a multiracial coalition is how we can win the fight against factory farming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>People of color aren’t new to veganism&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aph Ko, creator of resource site <a href=\"https://www.blackvegansrock.com/about\">Black Vegans Rock</a>, alongside her sister Syl Ko, popularized the term “Black veganism” in their 2017 book, <em>Aphro-ism: Essays on Pop Culture, Feminism, and Black Veganism from Two Sisters</em>. When I first read it in 2020, I struggled with the connection it drew between animality and race because of the historical dehumanization of people of color through terms like “nonhuman” and “animal.” But animals, they write, are just a category that we “shove certain bodies into when we want to justify violence against them,” and that dynamic should be concerning for minorities because “at any moment you can become an ‘animal’ and be considered disposable.” Their insightful examination of animal rights and its direct link to race and class left me with a stronger sense of solidarity as well as a curiosity for a stronger ancestral connection to my new dietary practices.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_459.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_1328.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The history of veganism and vegetarianism within the Black community can be traced across the diaspora to Rastafarian culture and traditional West African cuisine. The holistic diet of Rastafarians has an <a href=\"https://www.yesmagazine.org/opinion/2021/07/21/vegan-history-caribbean-rastafarian\">anti-capitalist history</a>, emerging in the 1930s by Jamaicans fighting colonialism. Most Ital cuisine — which is the dietary lifestyle rooted in Rastafarian culture — usually consists of cabbage, callaloo, legumes, scotch bonnet peppers, coconut milk, and kidney beans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">West African cuisine for centuries has had its own plant-based dishes like the peanut-based domoda in the Gambia, while East Africa’s extravagant Ethiopian plates included atakilt wat, gomen, misir wat, and injera. <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/caribbean-food-is-powerful-enough-to-be-a-peacemaker\">Caribbean and African food has been a form of sharing history</a> among the African diaspora, preserving familial traditions, and transforming native crops into dishes. There’s a beauty within our plant-based traditions that have long been neglected, but now more and more people are rediscovering these dishes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the best meals that I’ve had in New York City have been at vegan Caribbean and African restaurants like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/auntsetuncles/?hl=en\">Aunts et Uncles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/healthyasamotha/?hl=en\">HAAM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bunnacafe/?hl=en\">Bunna Cafe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rasplantbased/?hl=en\">RAS Plant Based</a>. At Bunna Cafe, a brunch platter includes a combination of crumbled injera with cooked kabocha squash, berbere, onion, ginger, and garlic, served with a side of dairy-free yogurt. The welcoming environment of each restaurant, down to the music, hospitality, and thoughtful dishes, is a sweet reminder of my upbringing. On the weekends, Bunna Cafe holds an hour-long coffee ceremony to “promote Ethiopian culture in a good light” and encourage their customers to participate in the weekly tradition, the restaurant’s co-founder, Liyuw Ayalew, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_AlexandraGenova.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_1016.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A woman pouring coffee from a jebena.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I grew up in a Caribbean household with a Trinidadian father and Jamaican mother, so meals consisted of ackee and saltfish, curry chicken, and beef patties. With the absence of these animal-based proteins, I was inspired to read the cookbooks of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sweetpotatosoul/?hl=en\">Jenné Claiborne</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bryantterry/?hl=en\">Bryant Terry</a>, two of the first Black vegans I followed at the beginning of my journey, to reconnect with my heritage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the plant-based liaison for my omnivore friends, simple conversations about my veganism has drawn curiosity about transitioning to a meatless diet. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23934373/genesis-butler-animal-rights-climate-activist-future-perfect-50-2023\">Genesis Butler</a>, a teen animal rights advocate (and another <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23934373/genesis-butler-animal-rights-climate-activist-future-perfect-50-2023\">Future Perfect 50 honoree</a>), said she experiences something similar. Her Afro-Indigenous identity in addition to her passion for environmentalism and climate justice makes her more effective at educating others about veganism, she told me.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_128-CROP.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,29.316644851658,100,41.366710296684\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Some people feel making veganism intersectional takes away from the animals, but I disagree,” she says. “I think I have more of a reach now that I am intersectional because I know how to talk about veganism in an effective way to people outside of the animal rights movement. This is so important because they are the individuals we want to reach.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Butler’s right — for many people of color, earnestly talking to someone who shares your lived experience and can authoritatively speak to issues of food accessibility and intersectional veganism can be much more impactful than watching a documentary about factory farming. That human connection has led to tearful conversations that I’ve shared with friends about race and food, but it’s also shaped me to confidently recreate the best home-cooked meals that I never imagined making five years ago. I’ve evolved into the vegan that I desperately searched for in 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Building a vegan movement with an anti-racist foundation</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The power dynamics within a predominantly white animal rights group are often apparent when there’s a racial discrepancy, such as an interaction with the police officers present at an animal rights protest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Eubanks — the Georgia-based animal rights advocate — was involved with street activism between 2018 and 2021,<strong> </strong>he was typically delegated as the police liaison for any protests that he organized. But “after one interaction outside of a slaughterhouse, when a police officer seemed to have one hand close to his gun throughout our interaction, I began having someone that was white co-liaison with me,” Eubanks told me. “That’s a rule that I&#8217;ve adhered to now whenever I participate in advocacy.” According to a 2022 report by the <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/contacts-between-police-and-public-2020\">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>, Black Americans are more likely to experience threats or nonfatal use of force from the police at an alarmingly disproportionate rate to their white counterparts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These moments led to the creation of <a href=\"https://www.apexadvocacy.org/\">APEX Advocacy</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for the collective liberation of animals and people. “We also acknowledge that the people that advocate for animals are also systematically oppressed,” Eubanks said. “So we consider that when we create our campaigns, activities, and programs.” APEX hosts Pre-Animal Activist Week (PAAW, for short), an annual immersive boot camp for social justice advocates of color with an interest in animal advocacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">BIPOC-led animal and vegan advocacy groups, like APEX Advocacy and <a href=\"https://www.afrovegansociety.org/\">the Afro-Vegan Society</a>, already exist to prioritize vegans of color. How can we replicate this throughout the remainder of the vegan community?</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_756.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_759.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It begins with moving beyond dietary restrictions. If we want to create a world where more people of color want to become vegan, we also need to ensure that there’s an active, inclusive community to fight against the prejudice that exists within the group, which is necessary to confront not just for their own sake, but also because they help us build a stronger movement. “We can’t just talk about veganism as a diet or highlight the diet aspects of it, because for us to really decolonize, we have to look at it as a social justice space,” Eubanks says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who should we feature in this year’s Future Perfect 50 list?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every year, the Future Perfect team highlights the thinkers, activists, and scholars working on today’s (and tomorrow’s) biggest problems. Have ideas? <strong>Let us know by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd3SzCg_3ZJR6CjVfwlhJaAB2uAlX_id9ezyVbk7UZG2iQJA/viewform?usp=sf_link\">filling out this form</a>.</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Black veganism inherently is about empowering people who’ve been failed by our food system at the same time as it’s about animal liberation — that’s how we get everyone on board. Take the concept of food deserts, for example. Food deserts aren’t natural, but created by policy. With this understanding, Black vegans believe that solutions for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/15/food-apartheid-food-deserts-racism-inequality-america-karen-washington-interview\">food apartheid</a> —&nbsp;or the deliberate separation of affordable fresh food in low-income communities —&nbsp;must be nimble. A socially aware, yet still vegan approach to solving a local instance of food apartheid could look like monetarily supporting community services to offer accessible education about plant-based nutrition, free plant-based school lunches, and fully-stocked food pantries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Animal rights activism also should be led by people of color, instead of a small percentage of tokenized Black and Brown faces. <a href=\"https://www.apexadvocacy.org/blog/palestine\">Much like APEX</a>, more animal groups should be challenging the US’s complicity in the systematic killing and starvation of the Palestinian people. Unity among communities of color has been an ideal backbone for successful mass movements, such as the <a href=\"https://southsideweekly.com/fifty-years-fred-hampton-rainbow-coalition-young-lords-black-panthers/\">Rainbow Coalition</a> in 1960s Chicago or the history of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/30/black-lives-matter-palestine-history-491234\">solidarity between Palestinians and Black Americans</a>. When whiteness is completely decentered in organizing circles, there’s an opportunity to reimagine a future that prioritizes collective liberation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If we’re not including the experiences of oppressed people and advocating for holistic anti-racist solutions, there’s no future that liberates humans and nonhuman animals alike. Veganism that consciously acknowledges race, gender, and class is key to ending our collective oppression, and it can start overnight by developing consistent compassion for all.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "In the last few decades, a common stereotype about vegans emerged: that they’re white, care more about animals than people, and serve food that is bland and uninspiring. Such perceptions — some of which are reductive, while others hold a bit of truth —&#160;have created a toxic cycle where people of color often feel excluded [&#8230;]",

Supposedly,<strong> </strong>someone from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) had, like a pirate claiming a captured ship, climbed the school flagpole and cut down the McDonald’s flag that had been flying there just under Old Glory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The animal rights group <a href=\"https://www.coloradocentralmagazine.com/heard-around-the-west-6/\">was</a> indeed<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://mcspotlight.org/media/press/saltlaketrib_18dec98.html\">protesting</a> across the street from the public school over its acceptance of a sponsorship from a fast food giant perhaps <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/how-mcdonald-s-has-shaped-the-food-biz-1.3074081\">more responsible than any other</a> for getting generations of Americans hooked on cheap, factory-farmed meat. According to court documents, two people had unsuccessfully tried to take down the flag, though it’s unclear whether they were affiliated with PETA. The police later intervened to stop PETA’s protest, which led to a yearslong legal battle over the activists’ First Amendment rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I thought they were psychos with machetes who came to my school &#8230; and didn’t want people to eat meat,” Beckham told me with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it planted a seed. In high school, when he became curious about animal mistreatment, he checked PETA’s website. He learned about factory farming, ordered a copy of <em>Animal Liberation</em>, the animal rights classic by philosopher Peter Singer, and went vegan. Later, he got a job at PETA and helped organize <a href=\"https://slcveg.com/\">the Salt Lake City VegFest</a>, a popular vegan food and education festival.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now a law student, Beckham has his critiques of the group, as do many across the animal rights movement. But he credits it with inspiring his work to make the world less hellish for animals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a quintessential PETA story: the protest, the controversy, the infamy and theatrics, and, ultimately, the conversion.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inside this story:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why PETA was founded and how it went so big so fast</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why PETA is so confrontational and provocative — and whether it’s effective</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A common attack line is used against the group: “PETA kills animals.” Is it true?&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How the group forever changed the conversation, in the US and around the world, about how animals are treated</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>This piece is part of </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics\"><strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></a><strong>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming</strong>. This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA — you’ve heard of it, and <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/43999-american-attitudes-political-groups-yougov\">chances are, you have an opinion about it</a>. Nearly 45 years after its founding, the organization has a complicated but undeniable legacy. Known for its ostentatious <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/06/24/the-model-and-animal-rights-activist-who-protests-naked-for-peta\">protests</a>, the group is almost single-handedly responsible for making animal rights part of the national conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The scale of animal exploitation in the United States is staggering. Over <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/livestock-and-meat-domestic-data/\">10 billion land animals are slaughtered for food</a> every year, and it’s estimated that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79961-0\">over 100 million are killed in experiments</a>. Abuse of animals is rampant in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24008053/wool-marketing-environment-sustainable-claims-sheep-animal-cruelty-fast-fashion\">fashion industry</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/11/23673393/pets-dogs-cats-animal-welfare-boredom\">pet breeding and ownership</a>, and in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23914885/zoo-animals-conservation-endangered-threatened-species-sanctuaries\">zoos</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of this happens out of sight and out of mind, often without public knowledge or consent. PETA has fought for over four decades to put a spotlight on these atrocities and trained generations of animal activists now active throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23737349/peter-singer-philosophy-animal-welfare-factory-farming-euthanasia-disabled-ethics\">Peter Singer</a>, who is widely credited for galvanizing the modern animal rights movement, told me: “I can’t think of any other organization that can compare with PETA in terms of the overall influence that it has had and still is having on the animal rights movement.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its controversial tactics are not above critique. But the key to PETA’s success has been its very refusal to be well-behaved, forcing us to look at what we might rather ignore: humanity’s mass exploitation of the animal world.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The birth of the modern animal rights movement</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the spring of 1976, the American Museum of Natural History was picketed by activists bearing signs that read, “Castrate the Scientists.” The protest, organized by the activist Henry Spira and his group Animal Rights International, sought to stop <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/19/archives/cats-mutilation-laid-to-museum-natural-history-is-accused-of.html\">government-funded experiments</a> at the museum that involved mutilating cats’ bodies to test the effects on their sexual instincts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After public outcry, <a href=\"http://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/munro1.pdf\">the museum agreed to discontinue</a> the research. These protests <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Animal_Rights_Crusade.html?id=gYnMlqi0xakC\">marked the birth</a> of modern animal rights activism, pioneering a model that PETA would embrace — confrontational protests, media campaigns, direct pressure on corporations and institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Animal welfare groups had been around for decades, including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), founded in 1866; the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), founded in 1951; and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), founded in 1954. These groups had taken a reformist and institutionalist approach to animal treatment, pushing for legislation like the 1958 Humane Slaughter Act, which required farm animals to be rendered completely unconscious before slaughter, and the 1966 Animal Welfare Act, which called for more humane treatment of laboratory animals. (Both acts are considered landmark animal welfare laws, yet they exempt from protection the vast majority of food animals — chickens — and the vast majority of lab animals — mice and rats.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But they were either unwilling or unprepared to take a fundamental, confrontational stance in opposition to animal experimentation and, especially, to the use of animals for food, even as these industries grew precipitously. By 1980, the year PETA was founded, the US was already slaughtering over 4.6 billion animals a year and <a href=\"https://ota.fas.org/reports/8601.pdf\">killing between 17 and 22 million</a> in experiments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rapid post-war industrialization of animal exploitation gave rise to a new generation of activists. Many came from the environmental movement, where Greenpeace had been protesting commercial seal hunts and radical direct-action groups like the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society had been sinking whaling vessels. Others, like Spira, were inspired by the “animal liberation” philosophy advanced by Peter Singer and articulated in his 1975 book <em>Animal Liberation</em>. But the movement was small, fringe, scattered, and underfunded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">British-born Ingrid Newkirk had been managing animal shelters in Washington, DC, when she met Alex Pacheco, a George Washington University political science major who had been active with Sea Shepherd and was a committed adherent of <em>Animal Liberation</em>. It was around this book’s ideas that the two decided to start a grassroots animal rights group: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Animal Liberation</em> argues that humans and animals share a number of basic interests, most notably the interest in living free from harm, which should be respected. The failure to recognize this interest by most people, Singer argues, stems from a bias in favor of one’s own species that he calls speciesism, akin to racists ignoring the interests of members of other races.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Singer does not claim that animals and humans have the same interests but rather that animals’ interests are denied to them for no legitimate reason but our assumed right to use them as we please.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The obvious difference between anti-speciesism and abolitionism or women’s liberation, of course, is that the oppressed are not the same species as their oppressors and lack the capacity to rationally voice arguments or organize on their own behalf. They require human surrogates to urge their fellow humans to reconsider their place in the hierarchy of species.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA’s <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/about-peta/\">mission statement</a> is <em>Animal Liberation</em> breathed into life: “PETA opposes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://headlines.peta.org/end-speciesism/\">speciesism</a>, a human-supremacist worldview.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The group’s rapid rise from obscurity to household name was propelled by its first two major investigations into animal abuse. Its first <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/04/19/the-raid-at-silverspring\">target</a>, in 1981, was the Institute for Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the now-defunct lab, neuroscientist Edward Taub was severing the nerves of macaques, permanently leaving them with limbs they could see but could not feel. He aimed to test whether the maimed monkeys could nevertheless be trained to use these limbs, theorizing that the research could help people regain control of their bodies after suffering a stroke or spinal cord injury.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Silver-Spring-monkey_2_11dbb8.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.7598738931485,100,90.480252213703\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Silver-Spring-monkey-paw-on-desk3.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.934987993544,100,74.130024012912\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Images courtesy of PETA\" /></figure>\n\n<div class=\"duet--media--caption xptnl10\"><cite class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xptnl11\">Left: a monkey used by neuroscientist Edward Taub at the Institute of Behavioral Health.

The experiments themselves, however grotesque, were legal, but the level of care for the monkeys and the sanitary conditions at the lab appeared to fall short of Maryland’s animal welfare laws. Having gathered enough evidence, PETA presented it to the state’s attorney, who pressed animal abuse charges against Taub and his assistant. Simultaneously, PETA released shocking photos Pacheco had taken of the confined monkeys to the press.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Silver-Spring-monkey_4_2a78f6.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,31.44637131609,100,37.10725736782\" alt=\"Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place.Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place.\" title=\"Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place.Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A monkey used by neuroscientist Edward Taub at the Institute of Behavioral Health in Silver Spring, Maryland. | Image courtesy of PETA\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image courtesy of PETA\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA protestors dressed as caged monkeys picketed the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had funded the research. The press <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/10/11/the-monkeys-a-rally-for-animal-lovers/e5a3195a-c9d6-4e6b-891a-019dbff36727/\">ate it up</a>. Taub was convicted and his lab shut down — <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-experimentation/silver-spring-monkeys/\">the first time this had happened to an animal experimenter in the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He was later cleared of the charges by the Maryland Court of Appeals on the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1991/02/24/the-great-silver-spring-monkey-debate/25d3cc06-49ab-4a3c-afd9-d9eb35a862c3/\">grounds that the state’s animal welfare statutes didn’t apply to</a> the lab because it was federally funded and thus under federal jurisdiction. The American scientific establishment rushed to his defense, rattled by the public and legal opposition to what they viewed as a normal and necessary practice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For its next act, in 1985, PETA released footage taken by the Animal Liberation Front, a radical group more willing to break the law, of severe abuse of baboons at the University of Pennsylvania. There, under the auspices of studying the effects of whiplash and head injuries in car accidents, baboons were fitted with helmets and strapped to tables, where a sort of hydraulic hammer smashed their heads. The footage showed lab staff mocking concussed and brain-damaged animals. The video, titled “Unnecessary Fuss,” is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrhVxuOZZP8\">still available online</a>. A slate of protests at Penn and the NIH followed, as did lawsuits against the university. The experiments were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/05/us/penn-is-told-to-review-labs-and-end-abuses-to-animals.html\">discontinued</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Almost overnight, PETA became the most visible animal rights organization in the country. By bringing the public face to face with violence carried out against lab animals, PETA challenged the orthodoxy that scientists used animals ethically, appropriately, or rationally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newkirk savvily parlayed the opportunity into fundraising, becoming an early adopter of direct-mailing campaigns to court donors. The idea was to professionalize animal activism, giving the movement a well-funded, organizational home.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/monkeyprotest_4e10a2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.973111073261,100,74.053777853477\" alt=\"black-and-white photo of a crowd holding animal testing protest signs, a large banner reads “SAVE THE SILVER SPRING MONKEYS.” A blond woman stands in front of a mic speaking\" title=\"black-and-white photo of a crowd holding animal testing protest signs, a large banner reads “SAVE THE SILVER SPRING MONKEYS.” A blond woman stands in front of a mic speaking\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Ingrid Newkirk protests to save the Silver Spring monkeys in Washington, DC. | Image courtesy of PETA\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image courtesy of PETA\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">PETA’s combination of radicalism and professionalism helped animal rights go big</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The group quickly broadened its efforts to address animal suffering caused by the food, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/03/19/fighting-the-fad-for-furs/b1ae9e24-8dab-44b7-af86-e7a153541920/\">fashion</a>, and entertainment industries (including circuses and aquariums), in which everyday Americans were most complicit. The plight of farmed animals, in particular, was an issue the American animal rights movement, such as it was, had previously been loath to confront. PETA charged it, conducting <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/10/hog-hell-inside-story-peta-investigation-mowmar-farms/\">undercover investigations</a> at factory farms, documenting widespread animal abuse at farms across the country, and bringing attention to common industry practices like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork\">confinement of pregnant pigs</a> to tiny cages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“‘We will do the homework for you’: that was our mantra,” Newkirk told me about the group’s strategy. “We will show you what goes on in these places where they make the things you’re buying.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA began targeting highly visible national fast food brands, and by the early 1990s, it was running campaigns against “Murder King” and “<a href=\"https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/success-stories/farmed-animal-campaigns/wicked-wendys/\">Wicked Wendy’s</a>” that eventually led to winning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/business/28burger.html\">commitments from those mega-brands to</a> cut ties with farms where abuses were found. “By combining highly visible demonstrations with carefully crafted public relations campaigns, PETA has become adept at arm-twisting major companies into bending to its wishes,” USA Today reported in 2001.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-165328473.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.515821310401,100,78.968357379198\" alt=\"Two protesters, one dressed as a chicken and one dressed as a pig, hold up signs protesting “Murder King”\" title=\"Two protesters, one dressed as a chicken and one dressed as a pig, hold up signs protesting “Murder King”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"PETA members protest outside Burger King and hand out leaflets as part of its “Murder King” campaign.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To spread its message, PETA didn’t just rely on the mass media but embraced any medium available, often with strategies that were ahead of its time. This included making short documentaries, often with celebrity narration, released as DVDs or online. Alec Baldwin lent his voice to “<a href=\"https://www.peta.org/videos/meet-your-meat/\">Meet Your Meat,</a>” a short film about factory farms; Paul McCartney did the voiceover for one of its undercover <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/videos/glass-walls-2/\">videos</a>, telling viewers that “if slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian.” The rise of the internet and social media were a godsend for PETA, allowing the group to reach the public directly with undercover videos, calls to organize, and pro-vegan messages (it has amassed a million followers on X, formerly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peta?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and over 700,000 on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@officialpeta?lang=en\">TikTok</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At a time when even vegetarianism was still viewed askance, PETA was the first large NGO to vocally champion veganism, creating widely shared pamphlets full of recipes and plant-based nutritional information. It gave out free veggie dogs at the National Mall; the musician Morrissey, who had titled a Smiths album <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eviyEJRZX30\">Meat Is Murder</a> </em>had PETA booths at his concerts; hardcore punk bands like Earth Crisis passed out pro-vegan PETA flyers at their shows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The animal experimentation and animal agriculture industries are deep-pocketed and deeply entrenched — in taking them on, PETA picked uphill, long-term fights. But bringing the same tactics against weaker opponents has brought quicker results, shifting norms on once-ubiquitous uses of animals, from <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/has-peta-finally-won-the-war-against-fur.html\">fur</a> to animal testing in cosmetics, with mega-corporations like Unilever <a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/news/press-and-media/press-releases/2021/27-peta-approved-unilever-brands-join-the-fight-to-save-cruelty-free-cosmetics-in-europe/\">touting</a> PETA’s approval of their animal-friendly credentials.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The group has helped end animal use at circuses (including at Ringling Brothers, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/ringling-circus-barnum-and-bailey-animals\">relaunched in 2022</a> with only human performers) and <a href=\"https://prime.peta.org/news/peta-decimates-the-cruel-cub-petting-industry/\">says</a> it has shut down most wild big cat cub petting zoos in the US.&nbsp;Its many-faceted approach has drawn attention to the sheer breadth of ways that humans harm animals for profit outside the public eye, like in its <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/blog/history-car-crash-tests-animals/\">campaigns</a> against the use of animals in gruesome car crash tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Circus-cage-protest_4.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.036999452193,100,79.926001095615\" alt=\"A woman painted with tiger stripes sits in a cage protesting the use of animals in circuses.

Perhaps its biggest recent victory was against Envigo, a Virginia-based breeder of beagles used in toxicology experiments. A PETA investigator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/20/beagles-rescued-envigo-medical-breeding-facility\">found a litany of violations</a> of the Animal Welfare Act and brought them to the Department of Agriculture, which in turn brought them to the Department of Justice. Envigo pleaded <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/us/envigo-beagles-abuse-breeder-guilty.html\">guilty</a> to extensive violations of the law, resulting in a $35 million fine — the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/us/envigo-beagles-abuse-breeder-guilty.html\">largest ever</a> in an animal welfare case — and a ban on the company’s ability to breed dogs. The investigation <a href=\"https://virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/\">spurred lawmakers</a> in Virginia to pass stricter animal welfare legislation for animal breeding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA has also become, out of necessity, a force for defending the democratic right to protest. When the industries intimidated by PETA and other animal rights groups doing undercover investigations pushed so-called “ag-gag” laws to prevent whistleblowing on factory farms, the group joined a coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge them in court, <a href=\"https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/ap-politics/ap-the-supreme-court-leaves-in-place-a-court-victory-for-peta-over-north-carolinas-ag-gag-law/\">winning</a> several <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/08/536186914/judge-overturns-utahs-ag-gag-ban-on-undercover-filming-at-farms\">state-level</a> First Amendment victories for animal rights activists and corporate whistleblowers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over 40 years, PETA has grown into a major institution, with a <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/financial-report/\">2023 operating budget</a> of $75 million and 500 full-time staff, including scientists, lawyers, and policy experts. It is now the de facto face of the American animal rights movement, with <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/43999-american-attitudes-political-groups-yougov\">public opinion</a> on the group split.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chris Green, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund (with whom I used to work at Harvard’s Animal Law and Policy Program), told me: “Like Hoover for vacuums, PETA has become a proper noun, a proxy for animal protection and animal rights.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The publicity game</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The media has proven hungry for PETA’s provocations, fueling an often mutually beneficial relationship: PETA gets press, and the press can farm outrage, be it at cruelty against animals or at PETA itself, for readers and clicks. This focus on bombast and outrage has not only made PETA many enemies, but it has often undermined, or at least undersold, the seriousness of the group’s goals and the extent of its successes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One surprising thing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You might be familiar with PETA’s provocative ad campaigns — but the organization does a lot more than yell at people wearing fur or parade around naked protesters.</strong> They’ve changed corporate norms around cosmetic testing on animals, helped enforce welfare laws that save animals from mistreatment in labs, gotten animals out of cruel circuses, and defended the public’s First Amendment rights.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Long-form coverage of the group tends to focus not on the group’s achievements or even on the actual logic of its messaging but on Newkirk herself, and specifically on the seeming disconnect between her well-mannered persona and her ideas, which drive PETA’s often ill-mannered protests. In <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/04/14/the-extremist-peta-ingrid-newkirk\">a 2003 New Yorker profile,</a> Michael Specter declared that Newkirk “is well read, and she can be witty. When she is not proselytizing, denouncing, or attacking the ninety-nine per cent of humanity that sees the world differently from the way she does, she is good company.” He hyperbolically dismissed PETA’s PR strategy as “eighty per cent outrage, ten per cent each of celebrity and truth.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Specter is ventriloquizing an assumed reader who is hostile to Newkirk’s ideas. But calling critique of an orthodox position fanatical or extreme is the first line of defense against actually engaging with the substance of the critique. And so PETA has consistently faced the same pushback as virtually every civil rights and social justice movement before it: too much, too soon, too far, too extreme, too fanatical.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But PETA has made its critics’ work easier by too often stepping over the line between provocation and aggravation. To list some of the worst offenders, the group has made dubious claims <a href=\"https://time.com/2798480/peta-autism-got-milk/\">linking milk consumption to autism</a>, likened meatpackers to <a href=\"https://www.postbulletin.com/peta-ad-linking-meat-with-mass-murderer-blasted\">Jeffrey Dahmer’s cannibalism</a>, attributed Rudy Giuliani’s bout of prostate cancer to milk consumption (in a rare show of contrition, it later <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=123001&amp;page=1\">apologized</a>), and compared factory farming to the Holocaust, drawing <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-orders-peta-to-halt-campaign/a-1146851\">extensive</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/mar/03/advertising.marketingandpr\">backlash</a>. (Never mind that the latter comparison was also made by the Polish-Jewish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, who had escaped Europe during the rise of Nazism in Germany and in 1968 <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1968/01/13/the-letter-writer\">wrote</a> that “in relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.”)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sexualized bodies and nudity, almost always female, are a regular fixture of PETA’s protests and ads; Newkirk herself has been hung up naked amid hog carcasses at London’s Smithfield meat market to show the similarity between human and porcine bodies. Celebrity supporters like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/peta-naked-fur-campaign-ends/index.html\">Pamela Anderson</a> appeared in the longstanding “I’d rather go naked than wear fur” campaign, and naked body-painted activists have protested everything from wool to wild animal captivity. These tactics have <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40339159.pdf\">drawn</a> <a href=\"https://veganfeministnetwork.com/international-womens-day-is-a-vegan-feminist-issue-not-a-peta-campaign/\">accusations</a> of misogyny and even sexual exploitation from feminists and supporters of animal rights concerned with a more intersectional approach to human and animal <a href=\"http://advocacyethicsanddesign.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/deckha-peta.pdf\">liberation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/AP470019682137.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A woman (Pamela Anderson) stands in front of a banner showing a photo of her body divided into parts like a cut of meat, titled “ALL ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME PARTS.”\" title=\"A woman (Pamela Anderson) stands in front of a banner showing a photo of her body divided into parts like a cut of meat, titled “ALL ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME PARTS.”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Pamela Anderson unveils a new PETA ad, 2010. | Akira Suemori/AP Photo\" data-portal-copyright=\"Akira Suemori/AP Photo\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One former PETA staffer, who asked to speak anonymously, told me that even people within the organization have found some of these messaging choices “problematic.” The press-at-all-costs approach reportedly <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2001/01/18/animal-rights-group-faulted-as-cultlike-and-abusive/\">contributed to</a> co-founder Alex Pacheco’s departure from the organization, and it has <a href=\"https://www.thebeliever.net/an-interview-with-gary-francione/\">drawn criticism</a> from stalwarts of the American animal rights movement, like legal scholar Gary Francione, a one-time Newkirk ally. And while it’s simplistic to conflate all of PETA with Newkirk, many people I spoke with were clear that most decisions, including the most controversial ones, run through her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For her part, having faced such criticism for over four decades, Newkirk remains blissfully impenitent. “We’re not here to make friends; we’re here to influence people,” she tells me. She seems grimly aware of being among a tiny minority of people who grasp the overwhelming scale of global animal suffering. Her call for reducing the harm humans cause other species is, if anything, eminently reasonable, especially coming from someone who for almost 50 years has been a witness to the worst of those harms. When she speaks about campaigns, she speaks about individual mistreated animals from PETA’s investigations. She can recall the minute details of protests from decades ago and the particular forms of animal abuse that prompted them. She wants to build a movement, but she also wants to do right by animals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps nowhere is this more visible than in her decision to run an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/11/08/why-are-so-many-people-so-cruel-their-dogs/\">animal cruelty outreach program</a> and animal shelter in Norfolk, Virginia, that regularly euthanizes animals. One of the longest-running critiques of the organization is that PETA is hypocritical: It is an animal rights activism group that also <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/the-naked-and-the-dead-v26xqbhshfb\">kills dogs</a>. It’s ideal grist for the <a href=\"https://consumerfreedom.com/\">Center for Consumer Freedom</a>, an astroturf group long associated with animal agriculture and tobacco interests, which runs a “PETA kills animals” campaign. Google PETA, and chances are this issue comes up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the reality of animal sheltering is that due to constrained capacity, most shelters kill stray cats and dogs that they take in and can’t rehome — a crisis created by the poorly regulated breeding of animals in the pet industry that PETA itself fights against. PETA’s shelter takes in animals regardless of their state of health, no questions asked, and, as a result, ends up <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/petas-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-history-of-killing-animals/254130/\">euthanizing more animals on average</a> than other shelters in Virginia, according to public records. The program has also blundered brutally, once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/17/peta-sorry-for-taking-girls-dog-putting-it-down\">prematurely euthanizing a pet chihuahua they assumed to be a stray</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So why do it? Why would an organization so concerned with PR provide detractors with such an obvious target?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Daphna Nachminovitch, PETA’s vice president for animal cruelty investigations, told me that focusing on the shelter misses the extensive work PETA does to help animals in the community, and that the shelter is taking in animals that would suffer more if they were left to die without anyone to take them: “Trying to improve the lives of animals <em>is</em> animal rights,” she said. Nonetheless, a long-time movement insider told me that “PETA euthanizing animals is absolutely a detriment to PETA’s image and bottom line. From a reputation, donor, and income vantage it is the worst thing that PETA is doing … Everyone would prefer they don’t do this. But Ingrid just won’t turn her back on the dogs.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But is it effective?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, questions about messaging and strategic choices are questions about effectiveness. And that is the big question mark around PETA: Is it effective? Or at least as effective as it can be? Measuring the influence of social movements and protests is notoriously difficult. An entire academic literature exists and is, ultimately, inconclusive on what works and what doesn’t to achieve different activist goals, or how one should define those goals in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take the sexualized images. “Sex sells, always has done,” says Newkirk. A raft of <a href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/sexual-politics-veganism-81263\">vocal</a> <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2013/12/20/surprise_peta_sex_doesnt_sell/\">criticism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3867429/\">some academic research</a> suggests otherwise. It may get attention but ultimately could be counterproductive to winning adherents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s hard to isolate the effect. Currently, PETA says it has attracted over <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/about-peta/\">9 million</a> members and supporters around the globe. It is one of the best-funded animal rights organizations in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Would it have more or less money and membership if it had chosen different strategies? It’s impossible to say. It’s entirely plausible that the very visibility obtained via its controversial tactics makes PETA attractive to deep-pocketed allies and reaches people who might otherwise have never considered animal rights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same uncertainty applies to PETA’s promotion of veganism. While there are certainly more vegan options at supermarkets and restaurants than there were in 1980, vegans still only make up about <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/510038/identify-vegetarian-vegan.aspx\">1 percent</a> of the American population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite almost 45 years of work, PETA has not convinced even a meaningful minority of Americans to eschew meat. Since it was founded, meat production in the country has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">doubled</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But to see this as a failure misses the scale of the challenge and the forces arrayed against it. Meat-eating is a deeply culturally-entrenched habit, facilitated by the ubiquity of cheap meat made possible by factory farming, the hydra-like political influence of agricultural lobbies, and the omnipresence of advertising for meat. PETA spends $75 million per year on all of its staff and campaigns, with some percentage of that aimed at opposing meat-eating. The American fast food industry alone <a href=\"https://today.uconn.edu/2021/06/rudd-center-new-study-finds-fast-food-companies-spending-more-on-advertising-disproportionately-targeting-black-and-latino-youth/\">spent</a> about $5 billion in 2019 promoting the opposite message.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shifting the behavior of the public on something as personal as diet is <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/163079/convince-people-eat-less-meat\">a problem</a> no one in the animal rights movement (or the environmental or public health movements, for that matter) has solved. Peter Singer, when I speak to him, concedes that to the extent he envisioned a political project in <em>Animal Liberation</em>, it was one of consciousness-raising resulting in a consumer movement like an organized boycott. “The idea was that once people know, they won’t participate,” he told me. “And that hasn’t quite happened.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nor has PETA’s work resulted in truly transformative federal legislation, like taxes on meat, stronger animal welfare laws, or a moratorium on federal funding for animal experiments. What’s needed to achieve this in the US is brute lobbying power. And when it comes to lobbying power, PETA, and the animal rights movement as a whole, is lacking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Justin Goodman, senior vice president at White Coat Waste Project, a group that opposes government funding for animal testing, told me that by being seen as alienating and perhaps unserious, PETA is “yelling from the outside” while the industries it opposes have armies of lobbyists.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can count on one hand the number of animal rights people on the Hill,” he says, “so no one’s scared. PETA should want to be like the NRA — where they have a negative view of you, but they’re afraid of you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By contrast, Wayne Hsiung, a lawyer, founder of the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere, <a href=\"https://blog.simpleheart.org/p/i-got-arrested-protesting-petas-ingrid\">now-and-again Newkirk critic</a>, and author of the excellent <a href=\"https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/dxe-in-the-news/2015-7-27-why-activism-not-veganism-is-the-moral-baseline\">essay</a> “Why activism, not veganism, is the moral baseline,” questions whether the number of people converted to veganism or even societal rates of meat consumption are the right metrics by which to measure PETA’s success. The animal rights movement, he told me, “has a very neoliberal conception of success that looks at economic indicators, but economics [like how many animals are produced and eaten] will be a lagging indicator.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“PETA should want to be like the NRA — where they have a negative view of you, but they’re afraid of you”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The better metric is how many activists are getting active, how many people are engaged in non-violent sustained action on behalf of your cause,” he said. “Today, unlike 40 years ago, you have hundreds of people storming factory farms, hundreds of thousands of people voting on state-wide ballot initiatives … PETA more than any other organization is responsible for that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to pollinating ideas, PETA has sown countless seeds of animal rights activism. Virtually everyone I spoke to for this piece, including many critics, credited some aspect of PETA’s operations with motivating them to get involved in the movement, be it through flyers at a punk show, undercover videos disseminated on DVD or online, or Newkirk’s own writing and public speaking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jeremy Beckham might not have helped start the Salt Lake City VegFest, or even become vegan, if not for the PETA protest at his middle school. Bruce Friedrich, who founded the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit promoting alternative protein, was PETA’s campaign coordinator for that protest. Today, former PETA staffers teach at universities, run plant-based meat companies, and have senior positions at other nonprofits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA has also shaped the work of other groups. A number of animal rights movement insiders I spoke to argued that large animal welfare groups like the Humane Society of the United States would not have committed serious resources to anti-factory farming work if not for PETA cutting a path for them. Legacy animal welfare organizations now do the grunt work —&nbsp;filing litigation, posting public comments on proposed regulations, getting ballot initiatives in front of voters —&nbsp;necessary to make incremental change. They deserve their own share of the credit for the successes of recent decades. But they have also benefited from PETA acting not only as an inspiration to them but as an animal rights bogeyman to others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A senior staffer at a major animal welfare advocacy group told me: “Having PETA out there doing all these bombastic, questionable things, it makes other animal protection organizations look like more reasonable partners when advocating for legislation, regulations, or other institutional change.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newkirk, meanwhile, remains an iconoclast. She is loath to criticize other organizations directly — something for which many people I spoke to, including fierce critics, praised her — but she is adamant about staking out clear and potentially unpopular positions for PETA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After spending decades urging the movement to take farmed animals seriously, with PETA even <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/success-stories/farmed-animal-campaigns/murderking/\">praising fast food chains</a> for making commitments to more humane treatment of animals, Newkirk has at times <a href=\"https://www.sfweekly.com/archives/nothing-s-good-enough-for-peta-including-prop-12/article_5b92c058-9308-5023-9145-d67c8aab2ad9.html\">been</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNWjZE01siM\"> critical</a> of a turn in animal advocacy toward improving conditions for animals on factory farms rather than abolishing factory farms altogether. PETA <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/blog/why-we-oppose-californias-farmed-animal-initiative-and-you-should-too/\">opposed</a> Proposition 12, a landmark animal welfare law passed by California voters in 2018, over those objections (a few years later, however, Newkirk herself was <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/blog/supreme-court-decision-california-prop-12/\">protesting</a> in favor of upholding Prop 12 at the Supreme Court when it heard a legal challenge from factory farming interests).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>We’re all living in PETA’s world</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In making sense of PETA, start not with the group, but with the crisis it is trying to address. Humans mete out violence against animals on an almost unimaginable scale. It is a violence that is ubiquitous and normalized, carried out by individuals, organizations, companies, and governments, often entirely legally. Not only have few people attempted to tackle this violence seriously, most don’t even recognize it as violence. How do you challenge this status quo, when most people would rather tune out your arguments?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PETA, an imperfect but necessary messenger, offered one answer, as best as it could.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, more animals are bred and killed in horrendous conditions than at any other point in human existence. Over more than 40 years, PETA has not achieved its goal of ending speciesism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it has, nonetheless and against the odds, forever altered the debate around animal use. In the US, animals are, for the most part, out of circuses. Fur is considered taboo by many. Animal testing is divisive, with half of Americans <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9252265/\">opposed to the practice</a>. Meat-eating has become the subject of spirited public debate. Perhaps more importantly, there are now many more groups committed to animal welfare. There is more donor money. More politicians are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/22/23471771/cory-booker-meat-farming-industrial-agriculture-accountability-act\">speaking</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23516639/veterinarians-avma-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown\">out</a> about factory farming.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Anti-fur-protest_Alaska-1996.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.311473955098,100,79.377052089804\" alt=\"photo of a snowy street with a view of four activists from behind that appear naked, each wearing Santa hats and holding a large banner behind them that reads “WE’D RATHER GO NAKED THAN WEAR FUR.” \" title=\"photo of a snowy street with a view of four activists from behind that appear naked, each wearing Santa hats and holding a large banner behind them that reads “WE’D RATHER GO NAKED THAN WEAR FUR.” \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Anti-fur protest in Anchorage, Alaska, 1996. | Image courtesy of PETA\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image courtesy of PETA\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Progress in any social movement is slow, incremental, and bumpy. But PETA has provided a blueprint. It started with a strong and nonnegotiable ethical and political goal and realized it could have the most impact over the long term through professionalization and developing a wide supporter network. It was unafraid of controversy and confrontation, making sure people knew the name PETA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also made missteps that harmed its reputation and that of the movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But wherever the animal rights movement goes from here, and whatever strategies it chooses, it will need large, well-funded organizations to fight the big fights, in courtrooms and in the court of public opinion. And it will need leaders, like Newkirk, whose commitment to the cause is absolute.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s a devastating end to the Paris games for the wrestler who has led the charge against sexual harassment at the highest levels of her sport.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Had she been able to compete and won Wednesday’s match, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/world/olympics/vinesh-phogat-disqualified-wrestling.html\">she would have been the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in any Olympic event</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Phogat, who often wrestles at a 53-kilogram weight — or about 116 pounds — made the 50-kilogram (about 110 pounds) berth after another wrestler won the 53-kilogram spot on India’s wrestling team. She knew that getting down to competition weight would be difficult, she said in an <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/how-vinesh-phogat-wrestled-with-her-50-kg-weight-challenge/articleshow/112350748.cms?from=mdr\">April interview</a>: “I gain weight easily. It doesn’t matter how fit I am, I still gain weight because I have a lot of muscle mass.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She had been able to maintain the lower weight until Wednesday, when she weighed in at just 100 grams over the weight limit — despite the drastic measures she had taken over the past week to maintain her 50-kilogram weight. Phogat barely ate, spent hours in a sauna and exercised, and even tried cutting her hair to make weight, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-indias-phogat-out-gold-medal-bout-after-failing-make-weight-2024-08-07/\">according to Team India’s chief medical officer</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that 100 grams — around 3.5 ounces — meant she couldn’t compete in Wednesday’s match, and wouldn’t receive a medal at all despite her dominance. She put up a phenomenal performance in Paris, beating out <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/olympics/2024/08/07/susaki-wrestling-defeat/\">Japanese Olympic gold medalist Yui Susaki</a> in the first round, and dominating thereafter, seemingly guaranteeing India either a gold or silver medal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her wins — and sudden disqualification — have put her recent crusade against sexual harassment in India’s national wrestling organization back in the spotlight. And though her Olympics are over, there’s now global attention on her activism as much as her athletic prowess. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sexual harassment is a problem in India — and in sports</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Phogat spent months last year as the face of a campaign to remove Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh as head of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), the body governing the sport in India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Phogat and other women wrestlers accused Singh of sexual exploitation, and Phogat in particular alleged that he emotionally and psychologically tormented her following the Tokyo Summer Games, where she just missed out on a medal. After filing a complaint with the Indian Olympic Association, and receiving little response, they mounted <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/world/asia/india-wrestlers-harassment-protest.html?pgtype=Article&amp;action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks\">a May 2023 protest</a> in New Delhi — where they were reportedly assaulted by police.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sexual harassment is a problem everywhere, and India is no different. A 2024 <a href=\"https://ceda.ashoka.edu.in/a-decade-of-the-posh-act-what-the-data-tells-us-about-how-india-inc-has-fared/\">Centre for Economic Data &amp; Analysis study</a> found workplace sexual harassment to be on the rise in India (though reporting mechanisms have increased, too), and a <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099630010202217290/pdf/IDU08bcf65ff0ec9204d3f0bda6046ccc305aef5.pdf\">2022 World Bank report</a> found harassment on public transportation to be a nearly universal experience in big cities, with 88 percent of those surveyed in New Delhi saying they’d experienced it.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scholars Anil Kumar and Ashutosh Pandey, both professors in the department of sociology at Bayalasi P.G. College, in Jalalpur, India, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374663739_Understanding_Eve_Teasing_An_Insight_into_Sexual_Harassment_of_Women_in_Public_Places\">wrote in a recent study</a> that the “prevalent perception of sexual harassment often portrays it as a joke, where women are deemed both responsible for and deserving of such behavior.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the efforts of Indian feminists, particularly from the 1970s onward, there are still high-profile cases of harassment and violence against women, as well as protests against the police and governments’ handling of the problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the case of Phogat and her colleagues, New Delhi police did finally arrest Singh in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/sport/indian-wrestler-makes-history-hnk-intl-spt/index.html\">June</a> of this year on charges of “sexual harassment, intimidation and outraging the modesty of women,” <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-court-frames-charges-against-ex-wfi-chief-brij-bhushan-singh-in-sexual-harassment-case/article68199335.ece\">according to The Hindu</a>. He has maintained his innocence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That Singh was removed from his post as the head of the WFI and held to account for his alleged crimes is a testament to the women’s protests; in addition to his high profile in the athletic world, Singh was also a powerful member of Parliament with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Phogat’s Olympics are at an end, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/world/olympics/vinesh-phogat-disqualified-wrestling.html\">but more and more Indian women are taking up sports</a> —&nbsp;and excelling.

Tina Smith met with business owners affected by the looting and riots following the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis. | Anthony Souffle/Star Tribune via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tim Walz was just over a year into his first term as Minnesota governor when a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd in May 2020, touching off a generation-defining summer of global protests against police brutality and racial inequality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Four years later, Walz’s handling of the demonstrations — which included mass unrest in Minnesota’s largest cities — is under new scrutiny after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped the governor <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/365437/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vice-president-live-news-updates\">to be her running mate</a> on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At least two people died during the violence in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, more than <a href=\"https://x.com/MnDPS_DPS/status/1267890735564668929\">600 arrests</a> were made in the initial days of unrest, and the whole span of rioting and law enforcement response made it one of the most <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-rebuilding-begins-with-donations-pressure-on-government/571075592\">costly and destructive periods of civil unrest</a> in US history. Minneapolis and Saint Paul sustained hundreds of millions of dollars in damage during those riots, and hundreds of buildings were heavily damaged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Conservatives have charged Walz with essentially <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1820810879484506388\">allowing</a> rioters to “burn Minneapolis to the ground” and waffling on the deployment of National Guard troops to quell the violence. But even former President Donald Trump apparently <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/despite-new-criticism-trump-told-walz-2020-happy/story?id=112616502\">acknowledged</a> the difficulty of the situation. Per a new audio recording obtained by ABC News, Trump told a call of governors in June 2020 that he “fully agree[d] with the way [Walz] handled it the last couple of days.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz wasn’t the main authority in charge of responding to the unrest — that was the task of local officials, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. But the task eventually passed to him once it was too much for local officials to handle. Both Walz and Frey’s governments have traded blame and presented their own versions of the events of those days of rage, but the full story of what happened is still not completely known.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What did Walz do during the unrest?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The main line of criticism of Walz’s response to the late-spring riots hinges on the time it took for him to deploy the Minnesota National Guard and coordinate with other state and local officials in restoring order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Floyd was killed on May 25, and large protests, with some vandalism and police violence, began the next day. By the evening of May 27, largely peaceful protests grew more violent, with looting and arson around the city. Frey, the mayor, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292\">reportedly contacted</a> Walz that evening and asked for help from the Minnesota National Guard. The city’s police chief then sent Walz’s office a <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292\">written request for 600 troops</a>, in addition to some other logistical notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz and his office did not sign an executive order authorizing National Guard deployments <a href=\"https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-433799\">until the following afternoon</a>, May 28, at which point much of the city had shut down, businesses were closed and boarded up to prevent looting, and buildings were smoldering after overnight arsons. That night saw some of the worst rioting, violence, and arson, as well as one of the indelible scenes of the protests: the breach and burning of the Minneapolis police’s <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/30/the-precinct-is-on-fire-what-happened-at-minneapolis-3rd-precinct-and-what-it-means\">Third Precinct police station</a>. A few hundred National Guard and Minnesota State Patrol officers had been deployed to Minneapolis by then, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/minneapolis-government-george-floyd.html\">were charged</a> with protecting federal buildings and downtown areas of the city, as well as escorting first responders, instead of immediately going to hot spots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz would later say that the city had not specified where the troops should go — and state and local officials later <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/us/minnesota-george-floyd-protests-state-police-review/index.html\">reflected</a> that there was a breakdown in communication, coordination, and understanding of just how long it would take to get National Guard troops prepped.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The next morning, once National Guard troops and the state patrol had taken control of the area around the station, another lasting moment occurred: the arrest of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftLzQefpBvM\">CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his crew</a> while reporting live near the police station.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At a press conference on May 29, Walz would take responsibility for the state patrol’s mishandling of the news crew, saying, “There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately … I failed you last night in that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That press conference was also the first time Walz acknowledged that local officials’ response had been an “abject failure” and that he would now be leading the response. He said he had spoken with President Donald Trump and said that his tweets about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/29/21274754/racist-history-trump-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts\">“shooting” starting after looting</a> were “unhelpful.” He deployed more National Guard troops and instituted a curfew. Still, more violence and vandalism occurred.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The following day, Saturday, May 30, Walz would fully mobilize the National Guard, speak with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, and acknowledge that the situation had gotten worse because “outside agitators” had entered the region. The protests and riots wouldn’t be fully tamped down in the Twin Cities until June 7.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The aftermath was both a blame game, and a humbling process</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the protests, local and state officials sparred with each other over a lack of communication and a misunderstanding of the gravity of the situation. Frey, the mayor, would go on to say Walz had <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292\">hesitated</a> to step in and take leadership after Frey asked for help.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Through an extremely difficult situation, I told the truth,” Frey <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292\">told the Star Tribune</a> a few months later. “I relayed information as best I could to state partners. And we did what was demanded for the sake of our city.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292\">A Star Tribune investigation</a> found that Frey and his city government had been trying to give Walz and the state Department of Public Safety “what they said they needed to move forward” with deploying the National Guard to Minneapolis’s Third Precinct, where the unrest was concentrated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Star Tribune examined timestamped email and text logs and <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292\">found plenty of correspondence that backed up the city officials’ sequence of events</a>: that they asked for help from the state government repeatedly, provided specifics, and did not get a prompt response. “He did not say yes,” Frey said of Walz. “He said he would consider it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The governor’s office, meanwhile, contested many of the mayor’s assertions. Contrary to the documents reviewed by the Star Tribune, Walz’s team argued Frey did not immediately provide an official request and had not specified where the focus of the National Guard should be. The governor’s office also contended Walz acted quickly once the request was received.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As a 24-year veteran of the Minnesota National Guard, Governor Walz knows how much planning goes into a successful mission,” a Walz spokesperson told the Star Tribune in 2020. “That’s why he pushed the City of Minneapolis for details and a strategy. He ordered the Minnesota National Guard to start preparing Thursday morning which allowed them to deploy to both St. Paul and Minneapolis that evening, per the Mayors’ requests.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By that point in the riots, state Republicans like then-state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka had also criticized Walz’s response, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/politics/tim-walz-minnesota-george-floyd-killing/index.html\">saying</a> it was “a failure of leadership” because “the governor didn’t take the right action.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Republicans are attacking the governor’s response now that he’s on the VP ticket</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the Walz announcement, Republicans have assailed him as “weak, failed, and dangerously liberal,” and zeroed in specifically on his response to the Floyd protests and their aftermath. But at the time, Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/despite-new-criticism-trump-told-walz-2020-happy/story?id=112616502\">apparently praised Walz</a>, saying he felt “very happy with the last couple of days … You called up big numbers and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that the racial reckoning that the Floyd murder kicked off included the rise to prominence of the “Defund the Police” slogan and movement, some conservatives have also claimed that Walz was being “soft on crime” for <a href=\"https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-441356\">supporting</a> police <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/minnesota-governor-signs-floyd-inspired-police-reform-bill/\">reforms</a> in the state that banned chokeholds, created new mental health resources for police and first responders, and required excessive-force trainings. And others in right-wing media have <a href=\"https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1820825378547720226\">conflated</a> his response to George Floyd’s murder specifically, which he connected to “<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?472637-1/minnesota-governor-walz-news-conference-protests-riots-police-violence\">systemic issues</a>” with policing and “<a href=\"https://x.com/TPostMillennial/status/1820819691599757429\">institutional racism</a>,” with Walz offering excuses for the violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the run-up to his selection as Harris’s potential VP, Walz hasn’t faced too many questions about his response to the 2020 unrest. But he may now face more scrutiny for that time. In response to questions from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/tim-walz-george-floyd-criticism.html\">the New York Times</a> on Tuesday, a Walz spokesperson acknowledged that the riots were “a tragic time” but said that Walz “took action” to keep the city safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Decisions were made in a situation that is what it is,” Walz said of the riots at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/1a_cmYLXrZw?si=acr05CZSR2njsAR5&amp;t=2001\">press conference</a> earlier this month. “And I simply believe that we tried to do the best we can in each of those.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, August 7, 5:30 pm: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on August 6 and has been updated to include news about a new recording of Donald Trump praising Tim Walz’s response to the Minneapolis riots.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That’s the weight of <a href=\"https://www.arnolditkin.com/blog/truck-accidents/how-much-trucks-weigh/\">two loaded charter buses</a> being added to a landfill — and that waste doesn’t even take into account the energy used to power the stadium, or the gasoline-fueled cars so many fans drove to get there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s why <a href=\"https://www.climatepledgearena.com/arena-info/\">Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena</a> — the first large-scale live events space <a href=\"https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-climate-pledge-arena-track-become-worlds-first-net-zero-carbon-arena\">named for a cause, not for a company</a> — is leading the way on a greener alternative with a host of initiatives around energy, waste, transit, and beyond. In fact, Climate Pledge Arena and its resident teams, the Seattle Kraken and the Seattle Storm, are among the signatories of <a href=\"https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en\">The Climate Pledge</a>, a coalition of companies that are committed to reaching an ambitious goal: achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. This September marks the fifth anniversary of the Pledge, which was co-founded by Amazon and <a href=\"https://www.globaloptimism.com/\">Global Optimism</a> in 2019. Over 500 signatory companies have signed on since.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the growing movement to fight climate change focuses around the need for massive, cross-industry collaboration, signatories in the entertainment and sports industries are coming together to address their environmental impact collectively. In the case of Climate Pledge Arena, that means devising innovative solutions to make the future of live events more sustainable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.oakviewgroup.com/\">Oak View Group</a>, which operates Climate Pledge Arena and 400 other venues worldwide is also a signatory of the Pledge. Kristen Fulmer, head of sustainability for Oak View Group, says the arena&#8217;s environmental achievements also have a broader impact: helping inspire other signatories and venues globally. Fulmer also serves as director of GOAL, or Green Operations &amp; Advanced Leadership, Oak View Group’s sustainability working group that pulls together leaders from 40 event spaces in the U.S., U.K., and Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Sustainability doesn&#8217;t just show up in [new] venues,” Fulmer said. “We&#8217;re pushing out goals and minimum standards to all of our venue operations teams, and providing them with support and resources to make sure that they know what sustainability looks like for the Iowa Events Center just as much as it does [for] the Climate Pledge Arena.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/VX24_AmazonxTCP_1345751_BA1_Inline.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Creating a green road map</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Motivating live events spaces around the world to embrace sustainable practices could have an enormous impact. Each year, <a href=\"https://carbonliteracy.com/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-sport/\">the global sports industry emits an estimated 350 million tons of carbon dioxide</a>, according to the Carbon Literacy Project, a figure that includes factors like transportation emissions, construction of venues, and the supply chain for merchandise. <a href=\"https://www.musiciansforsustainability.com/\">Concert goers, meanwhile, are responsible for over 116 million pounds of waste in the U.S. alone</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Climate Pledge Arena&#8217;s success story demonstrates some of the tangible actions that Pledge signatories can take, starting with energy. Everything in the arena, from the heat that warms attendees to the machines that resurface the hockey rink ice, runs on electric power. Currently, one percent of that power is provided by on-site solar panels, and the rest comes from other renewable sources, according to Rob Johnson, senior vice president of sustainability and transportation for the Climate Pledge Arena and the Seattle Kraken.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Siemens, a fellow Climate Pledge signatory, has been helping with further energy-reduction methods for the <a href=\"https://www.climatepledgearena.com/frequently-asked-questions/\">18,100-seat arena</a>, “starting with tracking and sub-metering to understand exactly where the building energy systems are using the most power, and what we can really do to reduce those emissions,” Johnson said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left\"><blockquote><p>“To see the number of venues … jumping on calls to ask questions about how we&#8217;re doing it has been powerful.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the environmental sustainability initiatives go beyond traditional “green” building operations. The arena also <a href=\"https://kingcountymetro.blog/2023/01/06/your-ticket-to-climate-pledge-arena-is-your-ticket-to-ride-transit/\">offers free local public transit with every ticket</a> to encourage fans to choose options like light rail or the bus over driving to events. Rainwater collected from all those rainy Seattle days is even <a href=\"https://www.facilitiesnet.com/plumbingrestrooms/article/Sustainable-Water-Management-Climate-Pledge-Arenas-Green-Initiatives--19893\">used to make the hockey rink&#8217;s ice</a>, which Johnson said has already saved more than 400,000 gallons of water over the past three seasons.&nbsp;The food program prioritizes local sourcing, with a goal to source 75 percent of ingredients from within a 300-mile radius of the arena.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, its 22,000-ton roof (which was built for the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair and has official historical landmark designation) <a href=\"https://venuesnow.com/preservation-why-an-iconic-roof-designed-for-the-1962-worlds-fair-tops-the-nhls-newest-arena/\">was preserved while the new arena was built under it</a>. That significantly reduced the 41,000 metric tons of carbon emissions associated with construction, according to Johnson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The arena’s approach is inspiring groups worldwide — from Eastern European hockey clubs to Japanese arena developers — who regularly request more info about its initiatives, Johnson said. “To see the number of venues who … are asking us for tours or jumping on calls to ask questions about how we&#8217;re doing it has been powerful,” he said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Getting to zero-waste</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of Climate Pledge Arena’s most talked-about recent achievements has been its <a href=\"https://www.climatepledgearena.com/sustainability/\">TRUE Platinum certification</a> for operating as a functionally zero-waste facility. To achieve that, the venue diverts more than 90 percent of its waste from the landfill to recycling and compost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hitting that zero-waste target took a three-pronged approach, said Brianna Treat, director of sustainability for the arena and the Seattle Kraken. The first step was simplifying procurement, which involved shifting the products for sale. Only products with compostable food contents and recyclable packaging can now be purchased. Single-use plastics have also been eliminated. The Arena achieved this milestone in October 2023, well ahead of the 2024 goal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Even just small, incremental changes can really help reduce big numbers.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, the team overhauled how the cleaning staff does the &#8220;bowl sweep&#8221; to collect trash after events. Instead of having crews collect all items in one bag and then sort them later into separate bags for landfill, recycling, and compost, the cleaners started sorting as they did the bowl sweep. “We saved so much time that we actually went from needing 10 housekeepers to four to six every event just because of that very simple approach to our operations,” Treat said. “The bowl sweep was huge for us, because it saved us money on the back-of-house front, but it also saved us a lot of time on the sorting front. It takes 10 hours to sort through 10 tons of waste.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, there was fan education. Signs at each disposal station, for instance, show the 30 most-sold items in the stadium and specify where each should be tossed so there’s no guessing. The team has even strapped a camera to a soda bottle to show where it goes after being binned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Climate Pledge Arena&#8217;s zero-waste performance is well beyond the average landfill diversion rate for GOAL network members (90 percent vs.<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62c618095146a156bd25f7c4/t/6632a9fd87073b6135b10f77/1714670102478/GOAL+2024+Impact+Report\"> 32 percent</a>). But to Fulmer, it&#8217;s more about appreciating the overall progress. “That&#8217;s over one-third of their waste not going to landfill or being incinerated,” she said. “If we total that up across the number of events that these venues host and then across the whole portfolio, that’s substantial. Even just small, incremental changes can really help reduce big numbers.” </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "A single major sports event can generate up to 40 tons of trash. That’s the weight of two loaded charter buses being added to a landfill — and that waste doesn’t even take into account the energy used to power the stadium, or the gasoline-fueled cars so many fans drove to get there. That&#8217;s why [&#8230;]",

In another piece, Torrella presents a dream policy agenda for expanding plant-based food consumption, advocating for creative solutions such as increased government procurement in public institutions and better access for low-income individuals, treating plant-based foods with the same urgency and support as renewable energy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marina Bolotnikova</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/e/363550\">examines</a> the worsening scale of factory farming and the slow progress made by the movement against it and suggests that the animal welfare movement may need to see itself as an early ethical vanguard helping build a future that people alive today will never see.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jonathan Safran Foer </strong>and<strong> Aaron Gross </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/e/362271\">argue</a> that the animal welfare movement must expand its focus beyond animal welfare alone and build a grand coalition with the environmental and public health communities that can highlight the threats that factory farming poses to humans, including zoonotic diseases and antibiotic resistance. They highlight a groundbreaking recent study finding that behavioral nudges, such as making plant-based dishes the default option in settings like university dining halls, could significantly reduce meat consumption while maintaining diner satisfaction.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Astra Taylor </strong>and <strong>Sunaura Taylor </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/e/363069\">argue</a> that if progressives are serious about saving our democracy, they must recognize how the meat industry has led the charge to undermine it, including in the recent US Supreme Court case that struck down Chevron deference, a cornerstone of federal regulatory law.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jan Dutkiewicz </strong>examines PETA&#8217;s paradoxical legacy: Its outlandish tactics have sometimes drawn backlash, but at the same time, the group has played a vital role in forcing a broader conversation about animal rights and supported the cause in less public ways. How does the best-known and most divisive name in animal welfare fit into the modern movement?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jishnu Guha-Majumdar </strong>argues that despite the vegan movement&#8217;s failure to slow factory farming by changing the diets of the broader public, it remains essential and ought to remain at the heart of the movement&#8217;s goals and strategy. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Noella Williams </strong>explores why the animal movement, despite Black Americans being the fastest-growing vegan demographic, remains predominantly white, highlighting the racial inequality that undermines the movement&#8217;s effectiveness and proposing ways to address it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Crystal Heath </strong>explores how the meat industry’s political influence has removed consumer choices by flooding the market with subsidized meat and limiting alternatives, such as successfully requiring dairy products be offered in US schools, and proposes a vision for “animal rights 3.0” that involves enlisting veterinarians and other professionals to combat factory farming, rather than relying solely on individual dietary changes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kelsey Piper </strong>examines how the Effective Altruism movement helped animal advocates overcome their differences and make meaningful, measurable progress that has helped phase out some of the worst factory farm practices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read more about the package and all of the pieces <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/e/364288\">here</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

From Google’s Gemini to Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta AI, artificial intelligence is inescapable at the Summer Games, ostensibly an event about showcasing the best of human ability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwZG4W1xYI\">Meta’s</a> begins with a sad lady on a couch asking AI how to prepare for a marathon. In <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2024/07/23/watch-these-gold-medal-worthy-2024-olympics-paralympics-ads-coca-cola-nike-more\">Microsoft’s</a>, a pregnant woman asks Copilot to write an email about weight training (are we sensing a theme here?), while a dad asks it to summarize his morning calls so he has more time to help his son practice boxing. The uplifting music and vaguely inspiring taglines — “Expand your world” and “You, empowered,” respectively — are meant to show how using AI can act as something of a personal assistant, leaving users with more time to spend on the things that matter. As far as Olympics-themed ad campaigns for tech giants go, it’s pretty standard stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was not the case with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck\">Google’s “Dear Sydney” ad</a>, which centers around a father whose daughter is an aspiring track star and superfan of American Olympic hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. The daughter, we learn, wants to write a letter to tell McLaughlin-Levrone just how much she means to her. But in a baffling move, the father then decides to ask Google’s Gemini to simply churn one out for her, turning what could have been a heartwarming father-daughter bonding moment into an opportunity to generate whatever a chatbot’s version of a fan letter is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To say it wasn’t a hit would be an understatement. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/31/google-gemini-ai-dear-sydney-ad-olympics-satire/\">Washington Post’s Alexandra Petri wrote</a> that the commercial “makes me want to throw a sledgehammer into the television every time I see it,” and that it was “one of those ads that makes you think, perhaps evolution was a mistake.” “Their pitch is really, ‘hey, we can feel and express emotions so your daughter doesn’t have to’?” asked sports writer <a href=\"https://x.com/ShehanJeyarajah/status/1817582489730461749\">Shehan Jeyarajah on X</a>. Tech consultant Shelly Palmer, who advises companies on AI, <a href=\"https://shellypalmer.com/2024/07/why-googles-dear-sydney-ad-makes-me-want-to-scream/\">wrote that</a> “‘Dear Sydney’ was “one of the most disturbing commercials I’ve ever seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After closing down the comments section on its YouTube page, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/google-controversial-dear-sydney-gemini-ai-ad-pulled-nbc-olympics-1236094028/\">Google eventually pulled the ad</a> from NBCUniversal’s coverage, writing in a statement to Variety that “We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it. Our goal was to create an authentic story celebrating Team USA.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not the first marketing blunder by a tech company in recent months. This May, Apple <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc&amp;t=58s\">released an ad</a> to promote its new iPad in which a hydraulic press literally crushes physical objects used in creative practices: a piano, paint buckets, a mannequin, a drum set, and cameras, leaving nothing but a single iPad. As the Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152987/apple-crush-ad-piano-ipad\">pointed out</a> at the time, “The message many of us received was this: Apple, a trillion-dollar behemoth, will crush everything beautiful and human, everything that’s a pleasure to look at and touch, and all that will be left is a skinny glass and metal slab.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It wasn’t a great look, considering widespread fears over how technology like AI, which Apple has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/three-things-we-learned-about-apples-ai-plans-from-its-earnings/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMtbYxTCNhPgIz9T_e9vMzSv06Fakfw_81Gj9ICSoODcMdZSnwoGUi5J3LnfG7q-kalKS0GawnmwNM1j9_0L-SzkTq2D0mV74_qR0h8uMc6kr4ykxrsX-ZkTrPKjKyCmPowIsFwNMQypo84eGdgvCxEIdf1YWWXPOyUPaQRW0Kfs\">invested heavily in</a>, will replace jobs and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/24152251/virtual-zoom-cashiers-ai-automation-future-work\">make existing ones worse</a>. Marketing tactics that boast about AI’s ability to render meaningful activities — like, say, painting, or writing a letter with your daughter — worth little more than a single button-click come across as deeply tone-deaf to a population who is already anxious about the future of the technology. According to a 2023 Pew survey, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/\">52 percent of Americans</a> said that they were more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in their daily lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though its boosters have spent the past two years claiming that artificial intelligence will soon be the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/351041/ai-art-chatgpt-dall-e-sora-suno-human-creativity\">“great equalizer” of creativity</a>, turning average joes into artistic geniuses, and that it provides all the perks of a personal assistant with the push of a button, signs as of late point instead to the idea that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/365292/ai-bubble-nvidia-chatgpt-stock-market-crash\">AI is a bubble that may be on the verge of bursting</a>. The stock market’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed\">heavy losses this week</a> were led by tech companies who have been bullish on AI like chipmaker Nvidia and Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-boom-faces-crash-landing-stock-market-selloff-nvidia-microsoft-2024-8\">in part due to</a> the extraordinarily high cost of running AI models (it’s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-chatgpt-costs-openai-to-run-estimate-report-2023-4\">estimated</a> that OpenAI spends $700,000 per day to run ChatGPT, and the more it’s used, the higher the cost), and the economic reality that at some point, the bill has to be paid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tone of the ads recall those for crypto, Web3, and the metaverse that were omnipresent during the 2022 Super Bowl, drafting a cadre of celebrities to shill unregulated currency for the likes of FTX, Coinbase, and Crypto.com. Both heralded their respective technologies as the next great innovation that will make humans hyper-productive (in the case of AI) and rich (both). Since then, following a massive downturn in crypto prices and all three companies either bankrupt or mired in scandal, crypto was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/2/9/23591622/super-bowl-commercials-lvii-crypto-ads\">completely absent</a> from the 2023 and 2024 Super Bowls. Even back in 2022, people criticized the ads for their tone-deafness and obvious fraudulence: They “feel like Pets.com all over again,” <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-super-bowl/\">per Wired</a>, citing the notorious tech bubble of the 2000s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much like crypto, the AI tools peddled by tech companies today <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising\">are environmental disasters</a>, using up as much energy as an entire country. That’s expected to double by 2026, and it also includes the <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/artificial-intelligence-climate-energy-emissions\">millions of gallons of water</a> needed to cool the equipment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those environmental and ethical dilemmas haven’t stopped NBC and the International Olympic Committee from embracing AI wholeheartedly, even as the Paris Games promised to be the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/paris-olympics-sustainability-climate-carbon-emissions-tahiti-85a237ea50cc2f1e5c60b907e06b7299#\">“most sustainable” ever held</a>. Some of NBC’s coverage <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/al-michaels-ai-olympics/index.html\">uses</a> an AI version of 79-year-old sportscaster Al Michaels’ voice, while the IOC launched an Intel-powered chatbot where athletes can ask questions about procedures and scheduling. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/ai-olympics-paris-2024-says-a-lot-about-ai-promise-and-perils/\">Fortune notes</a> that the IOC found 180 use cases for AI at the Olympics, but they largely seemed “like nothing more than marketing gimmicks.” But others, particularly the technology used to track movements within crowds of audience members, raise serious questions about what role we expect AI to take in increased surveillance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What you’ll see on television, though, are expensive, slickly produced commercials where a woman motivates herself to train for a marathon or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqn3SNyjsSE\">a guy gets really excited</a> by an AI-generated photo of the sound a “kersploosh” makes set to Jay-Z’s “Public Service Announcement.” You’ll see a whole lot of sparkle emojis, <a href=\"https://fastcompanyme.com/co-design/how-the-sparkles-emoji-took-over-ai/\">now an industry-wide symbol</a> representing AI that likens the technology to magic (even <a href=\"https://x.com/rebexxxxa/status/1807799809870274686\">though the sparkles never asked</a> to be part of this!). You’ll see <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lesdoggggg/video/7396896822364605726\">Leslie Jones asking Gemini</a> to design a gymnastics routine for her and taglines about how AI is a superpower in the palm of your hands.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The AI industry has far bigger problems than a single poorly executed Google ad. It’s facing existential questions about the product’s&nbsp;viability and practicality, and whether it&nbsp;underdelivers on its promises. The latest spate of AI ad campaigns, for their part, have thus far failed to highlight how its products assist what the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/\">majority of Americans actually want to use AI for</a> — namely, help with household chores — and instead end up showing how AI will be used for the things that most of us<em> don’t</em> want it to interfere with: our job prospects, our privacy, and experiences and skills that feel uniquely human. If the world already thinks of AI as menacing, wasteful, and yet another example of market overhype, these ads are only confirming our worst fears. No wonder they come off as so thoroughly insufferable.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In June (the month after he was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections\">convicted of 34 felonies</a>), his campaign took home a $<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/fundraising-july-election-trump-biden/\">111.8 million haul</a>, and the Republican National Committee had its strongest month of fundraising in years, bringing in $66 million. In the wake of both an assassination attempt against him and the spectacle of the Republican National Convention, Trump bested his June total, reportedly pulling in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-campaign-says-it-raised-1387-million-july-2024-08-01/\">$137 million</a> in July.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But how much will any of that money actually impact the results?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It’s more expensive than ever to run for president</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Presidential campaigns have long been expensive, but the money required to run a successful presidential campaign has ballooned since the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained\"><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em></a>. That decision allowed corporations and outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections, often via super PACs that operate independently of a campaign. 2020 marked the <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/most-expensive-election-ever\">most expensive presidential election</a> in US history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Presidential elections are incredibly expensive — at this point, a billion-dollar enterprise,” said Dan Weiner, director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s elections and government program. “You need enough money to mount a viable campaign.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That money goes toward supporting staffers and field offices across the country; ads across television, newspapers, radio, and social platforms; polling and research; as well as voter outreach through rallies, door-knocking, and more.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/TdS7m-presidential-campaigns-are-more-expensive-than-ever-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.668592645126,100,64.662814709747\" alt=\"Chart showing a sharp increase in presidential campaign spending from 2016 to 2020.\" title=\"Chart showing a sharp increase in presidential campaign spending from 2016 to 2020.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicole Narea/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both grassroots support and big donors are critical to funding a presidential campaign. <em>Citizens United </em>gave the wealthiest donors outsize influence. But grassroots donations are a sign of enthusiasm: They don’t necessarily translate 1-to-1 to votes, but they also function as a signal to big donors about which candidates are the most viable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both Harris and Trump will need to keep the money flowing, said Brendan Glavin, deputy director of research for OpenSecrets. While it’s not that early in the cycle — Trump has been campaigning since November 2022 — the most intense weeks of the election are yet to come. Now is when candidates typically travel more often to battleground states, hold more rallies, fine-tune their strategies through more frequent polling, and ramp up advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While recent events have spiked voter enthusiasm in both parties, previous campaigns suggest the most lucrative days might be ahead. There are still 13 weeks until Election Day, and it was in the 10 weeks before the 2020 election that&nbsp;Biden brought in about 60 percent of his overall fundraising haul.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big fundraising hauls are necessary — but not sufficient — to win</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Money, however, isn’t everything. While the victor in presidential contests often has the fundraising edge, that isn’t always the case. Piles of cash ultimately can’t compensate for poor spending decisions or bad candidates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden outspent Trump in 2020. But Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and Democratic nominee in 2016, far outspent Trump yet still lost the election. Her campaign spent heavily in states she didn’t need to win, including Arizona, but neglected Rust Belt states that ultimately cost her the election.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Presidential_Campaign_FundraisingAdvantage_02.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.883846578459,100,64.232306843082\" alt=\"A chart demonstrating how successful presidential campaigns often have a fundraising advantage.\" title=\"A chart demonstrating how successful presidential campaigns often have a fundraising advantage.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there are the well-funded campaigns that never really got off the ground because of a weak candidate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Put lipstick on a pig, it’s still not going to be a good candidate,” said Ray La Raja, associate director of the UMass poll and a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “No amount of money is going to make a bad candidate really good.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s four-month Democratic primary campaign in 2020 that cost him <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mike-bloomberg-spent-billion-month-presidential-campaign-filing/story?id=70252435\">$1 billion</a> of his own money. “In the end, primary voters did not respond to him,” Glavin said. “He had the money. He got his name out there. But he didn’t get the response.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Campaigns like Clinton’s and Bloomberg’s show that money is only one piece of the puzzle. Research suggests that challengers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/upshot/a-campaign-dollars-power-is-more-valuable-to-a-challenger.html\">benefit more from campaign spending</a> than incumbents, and that for any candidate, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/18/1245495936/do-early-campaign-ads-really-make-a-diffence-in-the-presidential-election\">early spending is more effective than late spending</a>. Incumbents don’t benefit as much from campaign spending because voters often already know who they are and there isn’t as much room to change their minds about that. The research suggests that the more incumbents spend, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/upshot/a-campaign-dollars-power-is-more-valuable-to-a-challenger.html\">more likely they are to lose</a> — the spending itself is usually a signal that they are in hot water.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has some advantages of an incumbent in that she has Biden’s campaign apparatus behind her, but in other respects, she fits the profile of a challenger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That marginal dollar is worth more to a challenger. And she’s more in that role, because let’s face it: Most people don’t know what the vice president does,” La Raja said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is still introducing herself —&nbsp;and Walz as her new running mate<strong> </strong>— to the American public. She is newly in the spotlight and has a window to shape her image in a way that a typical candidate might not. Her campaign is therefore spending heavily on ads right now, dropping <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/30/kamala-harris-ad-buy-2024-trump\">$50 million on paid media</a> ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s a well-known dynamic in presidential races that you try to define your opponent early,” Weiner said. “I have no doubt that what the Harris campaign wants to do — and also part of the reason why it was so critical that they raise so much money so quickly — is to define her before the Trump campaign can define her.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans may have somewhat forgotten what the Trump presidency was like, but as a former president, Trump is already fairly well-defined to voters and fits the profile of an incumbent more readily than a challenger. As a result, his strategy has been to leverage established recognition — and go on offense against Harris with a <a href=\"https://punchbowl.news/article/election-2024/gop-kamala-harris-2024-ads/\">slate of attack ads</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are diminishing returns on ad spending, since the media gives presidential candidates so much free coverage. Trump may not have spent as much as Clinton in 2016, but he certainly benefited from the media limelight that year —&nbsp;and so did the media, which experienced a “<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/11/24/washington-post-new-york-times-subscriptions\">Trump bump</a>” in viewers and readers. This year, Trump has successfully fundraised off of big media events, like a conviction or the assassination attempt against him. So, too, has Harris after Biden dropped out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their fundraising — and electoral — success will likely depend on whether that momentum lasts. Also, at a certain point, “money has diminishing returns,” Weiner said. There are only so many ads a candidate can buy, doors they can knock on and rallies they can hold to make their best case to voters. Once a candidate and their positions are well-understood, they can only hope that voters prefer them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you’ve raised enough money, raising even more money doesn’t help you that much,” he said.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been on a fundraising blitz in recent weeks.

But in truth, it served as a gathering for industry to discuss its very survival in a world that had become alarmed about climate change. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/is-sustainable-beef-really-a-thing\">According</a> to a beef industry news site, the 300 conference participants came together to “begin the process of reclaiming, defining and embracing the concept of sustainability to assure the future of beef production, and beef consumption, worldwide.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meat producers and fast food giants had reason to worry. Four years earlier, in 2006, the United Nations had published a <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm\">landmark report</a> that singled out animal agriculture as one of the most polluting industries on the planet, one that has “such deep and wide-ranging environmental impacts that it should rank as one of the leading focuses for environmental policy.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The report was noteworthy in part because it provided the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w\">first estimate</a> of animal agriculture’s significant role in global warming. Fossil fuels like coal and oil had already been targeted as environmental villains, and the meat industry had to fear that it would be next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the meat industry did what other industries have done under similar pressure in the past: demonstrate that it could change just enough to avoid being forced to change even more by the government. Ann Veneman, who served as agriculture secretary under President George W. Bush, said as much during her keynote address at the Denver conference. <a href=\"https://www.thecattlesite.com/news/32531/conference-tackles-beef-sustainability\">According</a> to another beef industry news site, Veneman “made it very clear that if the industry ignores the problem, then somebody else will get to define the issue for the industry, and in many cases that means governments imposing unworkable regulations.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inside this story</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How the scale of meat production and consumption pollutes the environment and contributes to climate change<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why the meat industry is making big claims about its sustainability initiatives that don’t add up <br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>How (and why) some of the world’s largest green groups are supporting the meat industry on these projects — and in some cases, receiving donations from industry <br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why it’s a problem that environmental organizations are reluctant to take on the meat industry — and how that might change</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>This piece is part of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics\">How Factory Farming Ends</a>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming</strong>. This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Denver conference led to the creation of a new organization: the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, a <a href=\"https://grsbeef.org/members/\">network</a> of beef processors, fast food chains, and other industry stakeholders, which has since spun out a dozen national and regional roundtables. The US roundtable’s 154-page “<a href=\"https://www.beefsustainability.us/Media/SustainableBeef/Docs/master_030220_framework_-final.pdf\">sustainability framework</a>” provides ranchers and others throughout the supply chain with recommendations, like how to reduce water pollution and optimize energy efficiency. But the group explicitly imposes no standards or verification schemes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To put it in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcberman1/2024/01/10/wheres-the-beef-the-iconic-clara-peller-spot-for-wendys-turns-40/\">fast food terms</a>, it’s all bun and no beef. Yet for more than a decade, McDonald’s and other <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/08/07/grazing-toward-a-sustainable-beef-supply-chain\">food</a> <a href=\"https://www.wendys.com/csr-what-we-value/food/responsible-sourcing/beef\">giants</a>, alongside <a href=\"https://www.meatinstitute.org/press/proposed-changes-packers-stockyards-act-could-harm-industry-sustainability-efforts\">meat lobbying</a> <a href=\"https://www.ncba.org/ncba-news/news-releases/news/details/25384/ashley-mcdonald-on-the-us-roundtable-for-sustainable-beef\">groups</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.rbi.com/sustainability/responsible-sourcing/beef/\">pointed</a> to the roundtables as proof they’re taking climate change seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But after 14 years, McDonald’s, like other arms of the broader meat industry, has little to show for it all, and in fact — as one executive <a href=\"https://www.greenbiz.com/article/story-mcdonalds-10-year-quest-sustainable-beef\">admitted</a> to GreenBiz earlier this year — the company doesn’t even yet know how to measure and validate progress. (McDonald’s and the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef did not respond to a request for comment.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The story of McDonald’s and the beef industry’s sprawling network of roundtables is just one part of an <a href=\"https://changingmarkets.org/press-releases/groundbreaking-report-reveals-how-meat-and-dairy-industries-have-derailed-climate-action-globally/\">extensive campaign</a> by the meat and dairy sector to downplay its environmental impact, delay regulations, deflect responsibility, and assure the public and policymakers that its voluntary initiatives are sufficient to avert environmental ruin. And it’s working: From 2010 to 2022, US meat production increased by over <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-production-tonnes?tab=chart&amp;country=~USA\">13 percent</a> while the industry successfully staved off calls for regulation <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate\">at home</a> and on the <a href=\"https://qz.com/ipcc-report-on-climate-change-meat-industry-1850261179\">international stage</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this is terribly surprising — it’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-meat-industry-is-doing-exactly-what-big-oil-does-to-fight-climate-action/2021/05/14/831e14be-b3fe-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html#:~:text=For%20decades%2C%20the%20meat%20industry,greenhouse%20gases%20and%20emissions%20reporting.\">largely the same</a> denial and deflection playbook run by Big Oil to avoid responsibility for climate change, with the usual suspects helping: <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w\">industry-aligned academics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90931204/beyond-impossible-disinformation-mystery-berman\">front</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cultivated-meat-pr-cew-center-environment-welfare-berman/\">groups</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/research/data-visualizations/agribusiness-political-donations-and-farm-bill-votes\">loyal</a> <a href=\"https://thefern.org/2019/12/a-breathtaking-lack-of-oversight-for-air-emissions-from-animal-farms/\">politicians</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/03/beef-industry-public-relations-messaging-machine\">social media influencers</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But among those allies are groups that <em>are</em> surprising: some of the world’s largest environmental organizations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take the World Wildlife Fund, or WWF, a green giant with over $600 million in assets. WWF and McDonald’s are both founding members of the beef roundtable, and later, the two worked together on other beef-related projects. In fact, that inaugural conference in 2010 was officially titled the <a href=\"https://www.wattagnet.com/home/article/15494079/feeding-10-billion-people-the-challenge\">World Wildlife Fund Global Conference on Sustainable Beef</a>. (WWF has helped to found <a href=\"http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/wwf_certification_and_roundtables_briefing.pdf\">similar industry roundtables</a> for <a href=\"https://www.us-rspe.org/index.cfm\">poultry</a> and <a href=\"https://responsiblesoy.org/?lang=en\">soy</a> — most of which is fed to farmed animals — and a certification program for <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/championing-sustainable-solutions#:~:text=WWF%20co%2Dfounded%20the%20Marine,organization%20for%20sustainably%20caught%20seafood.\">seafood</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For its collaboration, McDonald’s makes sure WWF is well compensated; from 2015 to 2022, the company donated $4.5 to $9 million to WWF-US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From 2017 to 2022, WWF-US brought in approximately $12 million to $28.6 million from various meat, dairy, seafood, fast food, restaurant, and grocery companies, including Tyson Foods, Cargill, Burger King, Costco, Walmart, Red Lobster, Chobani, and Dairy Management Inc., a dairy trade group. (WWF only discloses donation ranges, not specific dollar amounts, and many of its corporate donations are multifaceted, used to address meat and other parts of a company’s supply chain, like plastics, palm oil, and food waste.) </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/ycmiO-wwf-partners-on-sustainability-initiatives-with-companies-that-sell-produce-or-promote-meat-and-dairy-and-is-given-millions-in-return-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.467305335858,100,69.065389328283\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One of the key reasons WWF works with large companies like McDonald’s is to drive industry progress, beyond a company’s own operations,” said <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/leaders/sheila-bonini\">Sheila Bonini</a>, WWF’s senior vice president of private sector engagement. “Roundtables are a great starting point for bringing the right people together to work toward a common goal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">WWF is hardly alone. Two of the other largest US environmental organizations — the Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) — also closely collaborate with large meat and dairy companies, ranchers, and trade groups on a range of initiatives. But outside observers, along with some former and current employees at EDF and WWF, argue that those initiatives often do more to improve the companies’ image than the environment.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Companies want to work with the Environmental Defense Fund because it boosts their reputation as climate leaders,” a current EDF employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation,<strong> </strong>told me — speaking about EDF’s corporate partnerships broadly, not just for agriculture. “But instead of calling them out for causing harm, EDF lets them pollute and praises them for what little they do in hopes we’ll eventually convince them to change. So EDF provides cover for businesses by letting them set their own ambition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Partnerships between these organizations and industry often fall into two buckets. The first bucket entails borrowing practices from “<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.577723/full?\">regenerative agriculture</a>,” an organic-style farming ethos that has broken into the mainstream in recent years and that promises to slash agricultural carbon emissions and conserve nature. The second includes a set of technologies intended to reduce the livestock sector’s greenhouse gas footprint, such as incorporating seaweed into cow’s diets or changing how animal manure is managed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of these efforts can provide modest environmental benefits and are worth pursuing in the same way that it’s worth pushing for, say, more efficient gas-powered cars. But such partnerships can also quickly veer into greenwashing, in which a product or practice’s environmental impact, with the help of green organizations, is exaggerated for PR effect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The taking over of these organizations for greenwashing has reached such a level that I think we need to be honest about it,” said <a href=\"https://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/silvia-secchi\">Silvia Secchi</a>, a natural resource economist and professor of geographical and sustainability sciences at the University of Iowa. “Because it&#8217;s pretty obvious that the industry is using them, and whether willing or not, they&#8217;re letting themselves be used.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most importantly, these partnerships obscure what environmental scientists increasingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline\">say</a> rich countries must do to meet global climate targets: rapidly shrink livestock populations and shift to a more plant-based food system.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why I wrote this</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve worked on factory farming issues for almost 20 years and have long noticed that the environmental movement largely ignores the meat problem.

Rather than acquiesce to phasing out oil and gas, fossil fuel companies have often proposed their own slate of half-measure solutions, like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/363076/climate-change-solution-shell-exxon-mobil-carbon-capture\">carbon capture and storage</a>, while continuing to expand oil and gas production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The environmental community has largely called these activities out for what they are: <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dont-fall-for-big-oils-carbon-capture-deceptions/\">greenwashing</a>. There are some exceptions — <a href=\"https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2023/01/20/what-doe-should-consider-as-it-makes-decisions-on-carbon-capture-and-storage-demonstration-projects/\">Environmental Defense Fund</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/carbon-capture-utilization-storage-albritton/\">the Nature Conservancy</a> both support carbon capture and storage, but they’re careful to note that such technologies must be paired with an aggressive transition to a renewable energy economy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But those groups’ careful messaging is absent when it comes to meat production. Both tend to support the livestock industry’s half-measure solutions while neglecting to push for a shift away from our meat-heavy food system.&nbsp;And that avoidance is rarely questioned from the outside, likely due to the public’s own ignorance of animal agriculture’s harms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://madrebrava.org/insight/people-don-t-see-industrial-meat-as-a-key-cause-of-global-warming-poll\">Surveys</a> show that Americans <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/8/23863100/tyson-climate-friendly-beef-burger-usda\">grossly underestimate</a> the toll of meat and dairy on the planet. Some of that is optics: A power plant emitting plumes of black smoke screams pollution, while a pasture of cattle, chickens, or pigs along the highway looks natural and quaint — even eco-friendly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But seasoned environmentalists I spoke with told me that even many of their peers don’t grasp the connection between animal agriculture, climate change, and pollution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Globally, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat\">80 billion</a> land animals and <a href=\"https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2\">1 trillion to 2 trillion</a> aquatic animals are slaughtered for food each year, producing greenhouse gas emissions in five main ways: deforestation to graze cattle and grow corn and soy to feed farmed animals; pollution from the fertilizer used to grow those corn and soy crops; manure, which is high in nitrous oxide, a significant greenhouse gas; diesel from fishing vessels and nitrous oxide-rich waste from fish farms; and the largest single source, the world’s 1.5 billion cows who burp out methane, another potent greenhouse gas.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/WAM26923.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.678370919471,100,78.643258161058\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/WAM36438.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.787446173508,100,78.425107652983\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Havva Zorlu/We Animals Media\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Added up, meat and dairy production account for an estimated <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23738600/un-fao-meat-dairy-livestock-emissions-methane-climate-change\">14.5 percent to 19.6 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to researchers at the University of Illinois and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. That squarely makes it a leading driver of global warming, on par with <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport\">road transport</a>. While it composes a smaller share of emissions in the US, at around 7 percent according to experts’ analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/us-ghg-inventory-2024-main-text_04-18-2024.pdf\">data</a>, that’s less a function of how much meat Americans eat — <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/meat-consumption-by-country\">which is a lot</a> — than how much more we pollute through our energy and transportation sectors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even that estimate of 7 percent is probably too low, primarily because numerous sources of emissions from farming and food are attributed by the EPA to other sectors, including but not limited to on-farm electricity and combustion, food waste, converting land to agriculture, and the entire seafood industry. And while the US is <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2023_Release_Presentation.pdf\">expected to continue</a> to make progress in reducing its emissions from fossil fuels as the country switches to clean energy and electric vehicles, less progress has been seen in the agricultural sector. In fact, in 2015 the US Department of Agriculture predicted that America’s agricultural greenhouse gas footprint would be roughly the same in 2050 as it is today. (In 2020, the USDA <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/aia-year-one-report.pdf\">established a goal</a> of halving US agricultural emissions by 2050, but is in no way on a path to meet it.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is also something unique about animal agriculture that is often underappreciated in the climate debate: It requires a vast amount of land — <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/#xj4y7vzkg\">far more</a> than any other industry and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/10/20/23924061/public-grazing-land-cattle-meat-carbon-opportunity-cost\">far more</a> than plant-based foods. If we ate fewer animal products, some of that land could be restored as grasslands and forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in trees and soil, effectively canceling out some of the emissions that humans generate while providing habitat for wildlife.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s what’s called the “<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00603-4\">carbon opportunity cost</a>” of meat. In rich countries, which eat a lot of meat, that cost is massive. According to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00603-4\">2020 study</a> led by <a href=\"https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/matthew-hayek.html\">Matthew Hayek</a>, a New York University environmental studies professor, a shift to plant-based eating in rich countries would free up enough land to sequester an amount of carbon dioxide approximately equal to the past nine years of their fossil fuel emissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to several <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01605-8\">studies</a>, including an influential 2020 <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7357\">paper</a> in the journal <em>Science</em>, we don’t have much of a choice but to move to a more plant-based food system in order to meet global climate targets. Even if we were to end global fossil fuel use immediately, food consumption trends over the next century — namely rapid growth in meat and dairy consumption — would “make it impossible” to meet the Paris Climate Agreement, as the <em>Science</em> paper puts it. “Plant-rich diets,” it found, hold the most promise for making the global food system compliant with the Paris agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the climate impact of the meat we eat. But animal agriculture is also arguably America’s <a href=\"https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/59792\">largest source</a> of water pollution and a <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00424\">leading source</a> of air pollution, linked to more premature deaths than <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/05/10/farm-pollution-deaths/\">coal power plants</a>. It is the leading cause of <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/world-lost-one-third-forests\">global deforestation</a> — a leading cause, in fact, of just about everything the environmental movement fights against.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/P1bP0-the-demand-for-more-meat-is-the-leading-cause-of-deforestation-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.2194244604317,0,97.561151079137,100\" alt=\"A chart showing how livestock grazing and cropland have caused deforestation over time. \" title=\"A chart showing how livestock grazing and cropland have caused deforestation over time. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet only a couple of big US environmental groups challenge the meat industry. The rest ignore it altogether or collaborate with the industry on questionable initiatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To understand how green groups think about meat, I spoke with nearly 40 people in or adjacent to the environmental movement: scientists, funders, lawyers, academics, nonprofit employees, and volunteers. What I found was a movement sharply divided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many environmentalists, I discovered, understand the science but are afraid of the political backlash that could come if they are seen as trying to snatch burgers, nuggets, and ribs away from the American public. Many, I was told, also fear criticizing farmers and the powerful agribusiness lobby, given the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws\">enduring myths</a> we tell ourselves about American agriculture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even though reducing meat production in rich countries is a critical component of meeting global climate targets, there’s a sense among large environmental groups that sweeping changes to America’s diet and agricultural policy regime are unattainable. It’s created a collective action problem from which the movement can’t seem to break free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other greens expressed deep frustration over their fellow environmentalists’ indifference to the meat industry’s environmental destruction, or worse, some organization’s willingness to partner with companies on greenwashing projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The environmental movement has taken on powerful industries in the past and won. But thus far, it’s largely been groups dedicated to animal welfare — which have a fraction of the budget and public credibility of environmentalists — challenging Big Meat’s pollution and advocating for a more plant-based food system. Major environmental groups may think they’re playing it safe, but until they join that fight, they will ultimately fail in their goal of averting potential climate and ecological catastrophe.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The curious case of “climate-friendly” beef </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While WWF’s work with McDonald’s and the beef industry is one of the green movement’s more high-profile corporate partnerships, a recent project has proved to be even more controversial among environmentalists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, Tyson Foods — America’s largest meat processor — began selling beef marketed as “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/8/23863100/tyson-climate-friendly-beef-burger-usda\">climate-friendly</a>.” The company claims that by getting some of its suppliers to graze their cattle and grow the animals’ feed crops in a more sustainable manner, it’s reduced the carbon footprint of some of its beef by 10 percent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Tyson has repeatedly declined to share data with Vox and other news outlets that could prove its claim. The USDA, which approved Tyson’s climate-friendly beef label, wouldn’t share data either. The nonprofit Environmental Working Group submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to learn more, and the documents it received back were <a href=\"https://static.ewg.org/upload/pdf/2023-FSIS-00236-F_Records.pdf?_gl=1*1i6gyqf*_gcl_au*NDMzNjc4NDEwLjE3MjIyNzgwNTU.*_ga*MjAwMTY1OTYxNC4xNzIyMjc4MDU2*_ga_CS21GC49KT*MTcyMjI4ODM4NS4yLjEuMTcyMjI4ODQwNy4zOC4wLjExOTUyNDYzOTc.&amp;_ga=2.138060400.1981602355.1722278056-2001659614.1722278056\">heavily redacted</a>. EWG <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2024/05/does-cattle-feedlot-look-climate-friendly-you\">said</a> the USDA cited the need to protect “trade secrets.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But let’s assume Tyson could prove a 10 percent emissions reduction. Its beef still wouldn’t qualify as anything that should be called “climate-friendly,” according to <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/our-experts/scott-faber\">Scott Faber</a> of the Environmental Working Group. Even though US companies tend to produce food <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378018306101#sec0085\">more</a> <a href=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/comparing-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dairy-pork-systems_0.pdf\">efficiently</a> than the global average, a 10 percent reduction would still make beef the worst food for the climate — by far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Using <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216\">global averages</a>, beef’s carbon footprint per 100 grams of protein is about 7 times that of pork, 9 times that of poultry, 25 times that of tofu and plant-based meat, and more than 60 times that of beans and lentils.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/lw3Vx-plant-based-proteins-have-much-lower-carbon-footprints-than-animal-based-proteins-nbsp-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.652002447814,100,52.695995104372\" alt=\"A chart showing that plant-based proteins have lower carbon emissions that meat-based proteins.

Tyson also benefited in another way: The company mentions the organizations on its <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/climate-smart-beef-program\">website</a> and in its <a href=\"https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/how-tyson-foods-uses-big-data-to-make-lower-emissions-beef-7c9234a7\">advertising</a> to boost the credibility of its climate-friendly claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I asked <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/michael-wironen/\">Michael Wironen</a>, director of corporate engagement for food and water at the Nature Conservancy, if he had any concerns over his group’s inclusion in Tyson’s advertising, he said that companies should be scrutinized for greenwashing but that he doesn’t “have an opinion one way or the other about how [Tyson] should be branding that product.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Nature Conservancy was paid a nominal fee for its work, according to a spokesperson, who declined to share the amount. The spokesperson also said the organization’s Arkansas chapter had received money from Tyson Foods for local conservation work and declined to answer whether TNC has received money from other meat companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I very much agree that it’s critical for companies to be transparent about their climate goals and actions,” said <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/people/katie-anderson\">Katie Anderson</a>, senior director of food and forests at Environmental Defense Fund, in an email. “It’s a key pillar of our advocacy with companies across all sectors.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, Tyson refuses to disclose its data, even as it hawks beef products with EDF’s name in its marketing. An EDF spokesperson said the company severely limits corporate donations and that after conducting a search of its records over the past 10 years, it hasn’t received a donation from a meat, dairy, fast food, or grocery company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Secchi, the University of Iowa professor, criticized the two groups’ work on the project as “shameful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This could be just the beginning of more questionable climate claims on meat and dairy packaging that come with the imprimatur of environmental groups. The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, Tyson, McDonald’s, Cargill, Nestlé, WWF, EDF, and<strong> </strong>TNC — along with the World Resources Institute and the Stockholm Environment Institute — are all <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/Project%20Overview_18%20Dec%202023.pdf\">involved</a> in crafting a new <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/22/meat-climate-impact-tyson-hopdoddys/\">emissions accounting framework</a> that will influence what climate claims food companies can make under new state laws.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some environmental groups and academics lambasted the draft guidelines when they came out late last year, saying they would enable meat and dairy companies to make only minor adjustments to how they use land and claim their products are carbon neutral, or even carbon negative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The process was incrementally eroded until it became fully captured by the companies who want to get credit for addressing climate change without changing what they are doing,” Tufts environmental policy professor William Moomaw <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/22/meat-climate-impact-tyson-hopdoddys/\">told</a> the Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The false promise of regenerative agriculture</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of the <a href=\"https://brazenmeats.com/our-process/\">practices</a> that Tyson says help it achieve its 10 percent emissions reduction fall under the umbrella of regenerative agriculture, which is often framed as a holistic alternative to the ills of industrialized agriculture.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One surprising thing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>There’s a lot of momentum around the potential of regenerative agriculture. </strong>Advocates say it can drastically reduce the climate impact of beef, but the <a href=\"https://tabledebates.org/publication/grazed-and-confused\">science</a> says it’s a lot more complicated. While regenerative farming can help reduce water pollution and improve soil health, it can’t significantly cut planet-warming emissions from cows. It also requires tons of land, which means that if we want more regenerative beef, Americans need to eat a lot less of it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, regenerative agriculture has risen from the fringes of farming to mainstream awareness, championed as a major climate change solution by leading environmental groups and figures as varied as <a href=\"https://www.agdaily.com/insights/joe-rogan-podcast-skids-into-farming-fringes/\">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=807557089601152\">Rep.

While there’s no agreed-upon <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.577723/full\">definition</a>, the regenerative solution for growing crops, like the corn fed to Tyson’s cattle, typically entails <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northeast/topic/cover-cropping-improve-climate-resilience#:~:text=Cover%20crops%20increase%20soil%20organic,even%20help%20suppress%20some%20pests.\">planting “cover” crops</a> over the winter ​​​​to help prevent soil erosion and <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/11/30/saving-money-time-and-soil-economics-no-till-farming\">avoiding tilling</a>, or disturbing, the soil between harvests, among other practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These practices do have proven ecological benefits, namely reducing water pollution and improving soil health. But <a href=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/issues-and-priorities/carbon-sequestration/#:~:text=During%20this%20exchange%2C%20the%20sugars,truly%20means%20a%20healthier%20planet.\">many</a> of regenerative agriculture’s most strident <a href=\"https://regenerationinternational.org/cool/\">proponents</a> go much further, claiming it has the power to significantly slow down or even reverse climate change. The argument is that healthier soil can better remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in farmland, making it a compelling climate change solution. All that carbon from tailpipes and smokestacks? The soil can supposedly draw a lot of it down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Soil carbon sequestration through regenerative agriculture is the single best way to take carbon out of the atmosphere,” as Al Gore <a href=\"https://www.thefencepost.com/news/gore-talks-about-his-farm-carbon-sequestration-fossil-fuel/\">put it</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that the world <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/sustainability-blog/now-the-ipcc-has-recognized-that-carbon-removals-are-critical-to-addressing-climate-change-its-time-to-act\">needs negative emissions technologies</a> — approaches that can pull carbon out of the atmosphere, as regenerative agriculture supposedly does — to avoid catastrophic global warming.<strong> </strong>But the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/farmers-paid-millions-trap-carbon-soils-will-it-actually-help-planet\">research</a> doesn’t <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-2-summer/feature/dirt-first-carbon-farming-regenerative-agriculture\">bear out</a> the claims many of regenerative agriculture’s proponents make, as there’s still significant <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/farmers-paid-millions-trap-carbon-soils-will-it-actually-help-planet\">doubt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-2-summer/feature/dirt-first-carbon-farming-regenerative-agriculture\">uncertainty</a> around the potential for farmland to store a lot of carbon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, we don’t have accurate and affordable measurement tools, and carbon sequestration rates diminish over time. No-till farming, one of the most common regenerative farming methods, likely isn’t the climate solution it’s cracked up to be: Most no-till farmers still <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2021/05/03/carbon-markets-stand-to-reward-no-till-farmers-but-most-are-still-tilling-the-soil/\">occasionally till</a> their acres, and each time they do, they release a significant amount of stored carbon. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016706122003354\">2022 meta-analysis</a> found that no-till was effectively no better at carbon storage than conventional farming, though it could have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47861-7#Sec3\">some effect</a> in certain climates and soils.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think the climate argument in general with regenerative agriculture … is pretty bogus,” said <a href=\"https://apec.umn.edu/people/derric-pennington\">Derric Pennington</a>, a former lead scientist at WWF and now a senior sustainability scientist at the University of Minnesota.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite that, large meat and dairy companies — like Tyson, <a href=\"https://www.cargill.com/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture\">Cargill</a>, <a href=\"https://www.agdaily.com/news/new-land-olakes-initiative-better-incentivizes-farmers-to-go-regenerative/\">Land O’Lakes</a>, chicken giant <a href=\"https://corporate.perduefarms.com/company-stewardship-report-flipbook/assets/PerdueFY23CompanyStewardshipReport_2023-08-16_17-19-04.pdf\">Perdue Farms</a>, pork giant <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/smithfield-case-study.pdf\">Smithfield Foods</a>, and dairy giant <a href=\"https://www.danonenorthamerica.com/newsroom/details/danone-north-america-shares-progress-on-regenerative-agriculture-program-covering-nearly-150000-acres-and-75-of-its-dairy-milk-volume.html.html.html.html\">Danone</a> — have embraced these practices, claiming their deployment as a climate win. Doing so gives these companies license to claim that not only are they not a major cause of climate change and pollution, but they can be an active solution. And it’s not uncommon for them to receive praise or support from <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/blogs/sustainability-works/posts/three-new-corporations-take-on-sustainable-agriculture-a-win-for-water-and-climate-resilience\">WWF</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cargill.com/2020/the-nature-conservancy-cargill-mcdonalds-and-target-unite\">the Nature Conservancy</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/smithfield-case-study.pdf\">Environmental Defense Fund</a> for these efforts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s crop farming. But much of the environmental movement’s interest in regenerative agriculture lies with beef, the most carbon-intensive food product, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=402563\">half</a> of US livestock emissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When cattle are left to their own devices on pasture, they overgraze — trampling on and eroding the soil, and <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/11/113003\">destroying vegetation</a>. But regenerative ranchers use rotational grazing — part of Tyson’s “climate-friendly” beef program — which entails periodically moving cattle between plots of land. This can help prevent overgrazing because vegetation is given time to regrow, resulting in healthier soil that advocates say can sequester large amounts of carbon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How much? In 2017, a team of agricultural researchers in Europe and Australia published a <a href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/reports/fcrn_gnc_report.pdf\">sprawling report</a> on the subject titled “Grazed and Confused?” The authors found that variants of rotational grazing have the potential to offset 20 percent to 60 percent of emissions from ruminant animals (including cattle, goats, and sheep), with the higher-end estimate <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/\">under</a> “very generous assumptions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newer research results are similarly mixed, with a couple of <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.544984/full\">studies</a> showing <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17310338\">sizable effects</a> (which have also <a href=\"https://tdaynard.com/2018/07/22/critique-of-impacts-of-soil-carbon-sequestration-on-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-midwestern-usa-beef-finishing-systems-2018-by-dr-paige-l-stanley-et-al-michigan-state-university/\">generated</a> <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/03/big-agriculture-funding-regenerative-ranching-amp-grazing-soil-carbon\">critique</a> and <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2021/01/06/a-new-study-on-regenerative-grazing-complicates-climate-optimism/\">skepticism), while</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479721004710?via%3Dihub\">other experiments</a> have shown little to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/10/11/tom-steyer-2020-climate-229843/\">no effect</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1400578388.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.977504171221,100,78.044991657557\" alt=\"A group of ranchers standing in front of cattle.\" title=\"A group of ranchers standing in front of cattle.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At first glance, it appears to be a mildly promising approach to cutting emissions from cattle. But just like with regenerative<strong> </strong>crop farming, it comes with a <a href=\"https://edepot.wur.nl/516983\">series of caveats</a> that deflate much of its potential. It must be done under the <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/\">right conditions</a>, which are rare; climate gains are reversible — stored carbon can be released if a rancher changes their practices; and carbon sequestration rates diminish over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And there’s another catch. Even assuming that cattle grazing under the right conditions can sequester and store lots of carbon, regenerative ranching requires more land. A lot more — <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/10/03/beef-soil-carbon-sequestration/\">2 times</a> to <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2021/01/06/a-new-study-on-regenerative-grazing-complicates-climate-optimism/\">2.5 times</a> that of conventional ranching. Currently, cattle are grazed on over <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/?embedded-checkout=true#xj4y7vzkg\">one-third</a> of US land, so it stands to reason that switching even a modest share of the US beef cattle herd to regenerative would cause a massive spike in land demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Regenerative agriculture is important, but you cannot produce the amount of meat we do now regeneratively, because there just simply isn&#8217;t enough land,” said <a href=\"https://madrebrava.org/pages/about\">Sarah Lake</a>, a longtime food and climate activist and now CEO of PlantWorks, a new philanthropy focused on shifting diets. This is especially true in light of rising meat production: The USDA projects a nearly <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDA-Agricultural-Projections-to-2033.pdf\">15 percent increase</a> in both beef and overall meat production over the next decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/aug/30/its-not-the-cow-its-the-how-why-a-long-time-vegetarian-became-beefs-biggest-champion\">It’s not the cow, it’s the how</a>,” is a common refrain from the regenerative beef crowd. Cows aren’t a pollution problem, they claim — it’s how they’re farmed that’s the problem. But there is no escaping the fact that it <em>is</em> the cow, and especially the number of cows — and pigs and chickens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Paris-compliant-livestock-report.pdf\">survey</a> of more than 200 climate and agricultural scientists released earlier this year, experts said global livestock emissions must peak and then fall rapidly in the coming years. By far the most effective way to do that, experts agreed, is to raise and consume fewer animals. High- and middle-income countries — which eat much more meat than the global average — must lead the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Soil carbon sequestration, the main selling point of regenerative agriculture, ranked second to last.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/nOJmp-raising-and-eating-fewer-animals-would-most-effectively-reduce-livestock-emissions-nbsp-.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.078364113293,100,65.843271773414\" alt=\"A chart shows that reducing meat and dairy consumption would be the largest contributor to decreasing carbon emissions from meat and dairy production.\" title=\"A chart shows that reducing meat and dairy consumption would be the largest contributor to decreasing carbon emissions from meat and dairy production.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology can’t make meat and dairy climate-friendly</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regenerative agriculture represents one side of the meat and dairy industries’ apparent efforts to delay climate action and rebrand themselves as sustainable. The other side entails a suite of technologies aimed at directly reducing livestock emissions. Often, the industry will combine the two approaches into one project.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One example comes from the <a href=\"https://www.usdairy.com/sustainability/environmental-sustainability/net-zero-initiative\">US Dairy Net Zero Initiative</a>, which was launched by an industry research and marketing organization in 2020. The plan purports that the dairy industry can reach net zero emissions, or carbon neutrality, <a href=\"https://www.dairyherd.com/news/business/dairy-industry-unveils-net-zero-initiative-2050\">by 2050</a>, and it’s received support from <a href=\"https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/files/Publication/file/570hr7ghl5_Net_Zero_Dairy_Business_Case_v10.pdf?_ga=2.47302575.982671617.1711666071-297121572.1711666071\">WWF</a>, <a href=\"https://business.edf.org/insights/innovative-new-financing-models-help-dairy-companies-slash-methane-emissions/\">Environmental Defense Fund</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.usdairy.com/media/press-releases/syngenta-nature-conservancy-partner-with-us-dairy-to-advance-net-zero-initiative\">the Nature Conservancy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local\">Dairy products</a>, just like beef, also generate far more greenhouse gas emissions than most food products.

The organization says it could be achieved by farms using a mix of regenerative practices and new technologies, like changing cows’ genetics and feed so they burp out less methane, and “biodigester” machines, which capture methane from animal manure and convert it into usable energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, such machines have been popping up on factory farms across the country, built in part with <a href=\"https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Factory-Farm-Gas-Brief_final-0312.pdf\">taxpayer dollars</a>. Critics say the benefits are <a href=\"https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Factory-Farm-Gas-Brief_final-v2.pdf\">overstated</a> and that they stand to further <a href=\"https://hoards.com/article-30925-energy-revenue-could-be-a-game-changer-for-dairy-farms.html\">enrich</a>, <a href=\"https://thefern.org/2021/12/biogas-from-americas-favorite-meat-pollution-solution-or-a-prop-for-poultry/\">entrench</a>, and <a href=\"https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Factory-Farm-Gas-Brief_final.pdf\">expand</a> factory farming.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP24164554296736.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.406323023569,100,93.187353952862\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Noah Berger/AP\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The science is clear that, while some mitigation can be achieved by improving meat and dairy production, climate-neutral or zero-emissions meat and dairy is not a possibility in the foreseeable future,” said Hayek, the New York University environmental studies professor, speaking about net-zero claims in animal agriculture broadly, not the WWF report specifically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/experts/jason-clay\">Jason Clay</a>, senior vice president of markets for WWF and author of the report, said in an email that he doesn’t disagree with this statement. The paper, he noted, models what’s possible “if we had the right conditions in place — that includes government incentives, corporate investment, and commitment across the dairy supply chain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of what’s possible relies on those government incentives&nbsp;— subsidies or regulatory changes that are favorable to industry. These recur frequently in the paper, which illustrates a fundamental aspect of animal agriculture’s business model. Over the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools\">last century</a>, states and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/357195/land-grant-universities-greenwashing-climate-methane-factory-farming\">federal government</a> have poured money into building the factory farming system while slashing its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws\">environmental regulations</a>.

Now, industry can only clean up the mess it&#8217;s made of our air, climate, and water if taxpayers cover the bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the supposed net-zero solutions in the WWF paper rest on shaky science, like regenerative agriculture practices, while others seem far-fetched. For example, a significant amount of the emissions reduction detailed in the paper relies on farms not just turning manure into energy, but their communities’ food waste too. A small number of <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2023/08/28/these-manure-digesters-incorporate-food-scraps-does-that-make-them-better/\">dairy farms</a> already do this, but expanding the practice to the country’s thousands of large dairy farms would require a range of policy changes and <a href=\"https://agdatanews.substack.com/p/whats-worth-more-a-cows-milk-or-its?r=i2qe&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true\">inefficient subsidies</a>, not to mention the complex logistics of trucking heavy food waste from population centers to rural mega-dairies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you remove just this one practice from the paper, the imaginary net-zero dairy farm is no longer net-zero.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The paper has been cited <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/19/10535\">numerous</a> <a href=\"https://blog.usdec.org/usdairyexporter/5-facts-showing-us-dairys-commitment-to-sustainability-on-world-milk-day-0\">times</a> by the US Dairy Net Zero Initiative, which has called it an “<a href=\"https://www.usdairy.com/getmedia/38d5cbdf-c605-4a38-b520-f7ec1e1c5cd8/Dairy-Sustainability-Alliance-Newsletter-Spring-2021.pdf?ext=.pdf\">independent review</a>,” even though the findings were informed by data from the industry trade group behind the initiative — Dairy Management Inc (DMI). According to WWF documents, DMI gave WWF $125,000 to $250,000 from 2017 to 2019. A DMI spokesperson said its funding to WWF was for “services,” not as donations. This funding began in 2011, the DMI spokesperson said, but declined to share the amount given from then to 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Clay said that several pilot farms have “effectively achieved&#8221; net zero emissions and when asked for details on the claim, a WWF spokesperson referred Vox to DMI. A DMI spokesperson confirmed there are pilot farm studies underway but did not comment on whether they had achieved net zero emissions. “The pilots will help demonstrate how a commercial farm can feasibly progress toward neutrality,” the spokesperson said, but “it is not expected that all farms will reach neutrality.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/WAM33791_48f086.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.052841398145,100,69.89431720371\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Ram Daya/We Animals Media\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be sure, over time the US has managed to produce <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378018306101#sec0085\">meat</a> and <a href=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/comparing-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dairy-pork-systems_0.pdf\">dairy</a> with fewer emissions per kilogram of food than many countries. But those emissions savings haven’t kept up with rising meat and dairy consumption, which has contributed to a steady increase in US agricultural emissions, even as total emissions from energy and transport have fallen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Each of the technological fixes in development from industry certainly hold some potential to further <a href=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads.thebreakthrough.org/Clean-Cow-Report_v6.pdf\">reduce</a>, albeit marginally, meat and dairy’s climate impact. But even that measured improvement can only be achieved if the farming practices and technologies work, farmers are offered generous subsidies and regulatory tweaks to adopt them, and they’re fully deployed throughout the industry’s complex supply chains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, EDF and WWF have championed some of them as <a href=\"https://business.edf.org/insights/danone-commits-to-cut-dairy-methane-emissions-in-partnership-with-farmers-and-edf/\">critical</a> climate <a href=\"https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/files/Publication/file/3f7fxakan2_Solutions_to_Meet_the_Need_for_Feed_Final_032223.pdf\">solutions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">EDF and the Nature Conservancy are also <a href=\"https://agclimatealliance.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/98/files/2023/02/farm-bill-recommendations.pdf\">founding members</a> of <a href=\"https://agclimatealliance.com/members/\">the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance</a>, a coalition of meat, dairy, and agricultural trade groups, many of which lobby aggressively to block environmental policy. But the alliance is a vehicle for their other goal on Capitol Hill: ramping up subsidies for regenerative agriculture and technological solutions.<strong> </strong>It’s similar to how the fossil fuel industry <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17082021/carbon-capture-storage-fossil-fuel-companies-climate/\">lobbies</a> to both block climate regulations and subsidize <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/09/carbon-capture-oil-gas/\">carbon capture</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the other founding members is the American Farm Bureau Federation, which one former Republican Senate staffer has described as the <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24102018/farm-bureau-climate-change-denial-farmers-crop-insurance-subsidies-drought-future-at-risk/\">NRA of agriculture</a>.

Late last year, the chief strategist of the trade association the Meat Institute <a href=\"https://www.feedstuffs.com/agribusiness-news/cop28-agreement-what-might-it-mean-for-the-feed-and-meat-industries-\">said</a> his industry should consider similar partnerships with nonprofits at future climate summits to “advance solutions together and really bring that proof to the table” that it’s taking climate action.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I asked Environmental Defense Fund for specifics on its goals to reduce animal agriculture emissions, how it’ll measure progress, and what progress it has made so far, I was directed to a <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/vision-2030\">website</a> that shows the organization aims to, by 2030, “help the land and oceans feed us, so 2.5 billion people benefit from climate-resilient, equitable food systems globally.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s a lofty aspiration, but it’s unclear what it means and how their work will help achieve it. When I followed up for more detail, the organization didn’t provide any.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The organization also wants to reduce global methane pollution by 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030 and has been actively working to reduce the harmful gas for years, including launching an <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04032024/new-edf-harvard-satellite-will-monitor-methane-emissions-worldwide/\">impressive satellite</a> to track it. It’s essential work, as methane accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022/methane-and-climate-change#\">one-third</a> of global warming since the Industrial Revolution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the use of EDF’s satellite to address emissions from livestock, which <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane\">domestically</a> and <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Estimated-global-anthropogenic-methane-emissions-by-source-2020_fig1_341017757\">globally</a> spew more methane than oil and gas, will be limited. The organization <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240306-agricultural-methane-is-a-climate-action-blind-spot\">says</a> there are fewer oil and gas operations than farms, which makes oil and gas a more manageable target, and that oil and gas operators have more resources to tackle the problem. (There are also some technical challenges to tracking livestock methane with EDF’s satellite.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the current EDF employees I spoke with said that the organization’s solely technological approach to livestock methane is “rooted in a pessimism that more ambitious change isn’t possible,” which becomes something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The organization believes that people won’t change their diets, the employee said, so technological solutions are the best it can do. “But focusing on methane at the expense of systemic change turns our institutional pessimism into reality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elizabeth Sturcken, managing director of business at EDF, said over email that in the US “there are no prospects” for companies, especially in food and agriculture, to be required through regulation to reduce methane emissions. “Voluntary corporate action can help fill in this gap.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I asked WWF about its goals related to agriculture, I was told the organization aims to reduce the climate, water pollution, and biodiversity impacts of animal protein in the US by a staggering 50 percent by 2030 against 2005 levels. The goal, the organization says, will be achieved through the adoption of “responsibly sourced, regeneratively produced cattle, poultry, swine, and aquaculture [fish farm] products.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After repeated requests for details on how it would measure this goal and its progress so far, a spokesperson said, “We are in the process of revising and finalizing our long-term goals to ensure they are measurable. As part of this process we are examining what is possible to track, in what regions we are working, and how to set baselines in animal protein systems.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No one I interviewed for this story believes environmental groups shouldn’t engage with the private sector. Quite the contrary. However, these organizations’ relationships appear to have a narrowing effect, in which they work with the industry on projects that the industry is comfortable taking on, rather than what is needed to meet global climate targets or&nbsp;slash pollution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">WWF’s Bonini said as much: “We encourage companies to work on all fronts, particularly where they can have the biggest impact, but ultimately how they choose to address these impacts is up to them. And from there we work with companies to set goals and drive down negative impacts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As one of the current EDF employees I spoke to put it, “EDF provides cover for businesses by letting them set their own ambition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But systemic change is hard, and through such collaborations the organizations get to show their donors what appears to be a win, said Secchi, the University of Iowa sustainability professor. Pennington, the former WWF lead scientist, said that for the corporations,“the biggest benefit with partnering with these large [nonprofits] is having your name, having your logos together on the same document.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, Sturcken of EDF said in an <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2023/11/15/walmart-and-edf-forged-an-unlikely-partnership-17-years-later-whats-changed/\">interview</a> with the news outlet Civil Eats that “PR benefits” were one of the benefits to businesses embracing food sustainability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This line of work with corporations may also have a silencing effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">WWF-UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/02/wwf-shelved-report-exposing-river-wye-pollution-to-keep-tesco-happy\">canceled</a> the publication of a report in which one of its corporate donors at the time — Tesco, the British grocery giant — was implicated in chicken farming pollution. WWF-UK told the Guardian the report did not meet its “rigorous standards” and that the decision was not connected to its corporate relationship. WWF-UK <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/who-we-are/who-we-work-with/tesco\">ended</a> its formal partnership with Tesco in 2023, though they continue to collaborate. (Notably, a former Tesco CEO is the <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/about/how-we-are-governed\">chair</a> of WWF-UK’s board of trustees.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t think that it creates a conflict of interest,” said Bonini of WWF when asked about its corporate donations in general — not about Tesco specifically. “We’ve seen a lot of positive momentum working and collaborating with companies, but we continue to push them. That’s our job. And if we don&#8217;t see them making progress, we will walk away.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Wherever your funding comes from has an effect on your work, and to say anything else is insanity at this point,” said <a href=\"https://jenniferjacquet.com/\">Jennifer Jacquet</a>, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami and author of a book on greenwashing, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534048/the-playbook-by-jennifer-jacquet/\"><em>The Playbook</em></a>. “Greenwashing serves a lot of purposes. It’s not just about [preventing] regulation — that’s always part of it. But it’s about maintaining the social license to operate … the economic license, the moral license.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sometimes, industry players will say that quiet part out loud. In a 2022 <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7Z89-LZD8\">news release</a> issued by a cattle breeding association about a project to change cattle genetics to lower their emissions, an industry-aligned academic said “This is going to help us maintain the license to operate. I think that is a key term we all need to understand.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>“Making conservation easy, one burger at a time”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to working with companies, some groups also have extensive programs designed to persuade individual ranchers to take up regenerative practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The National Audubon Society, the beloved bird conservancy organization, rewards regenerative ranchers with its seal of approval in the form of a label that reads “Grazed on bird friendly land” and “Audubon certified.” Such beef can be purchased at about 250 retail and online stores.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Making conservation easy, one burger at a time,” reads the program’s <a href=\"http://birdfriendlyland.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcFsze8BSRF/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcFsze8BSRF/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcFsze8BSRF/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Audubon Southwest (@audubonsw)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">WWF has a <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/ranch-systems-and-viability-planning-rsvp#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20WWF%20has%20enrolled,Wyoming%20and%20the%20Nebraska%20Sandhills.\">similar program</a> with 90 ranches enrolled, though with no certification or marketing scheme. The organization <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/world-wildlife-fund-joins-the-walmart-foundation-cargill-mcdonald-s-to-launch-million-acre-grazing-initiative-to-help-restore-grasslands-address-climate-change\">launched</a> it with $6 million from McDonald’s, Cargill, and the Walmart Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Nature Conservancy owns 500,000 acres of grazing land, which it uses to run experiments and demonstrate to ranchers how they can adopt regenerative grazing plans. Ultimately, it wants to see <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/SustainableGrazing_Factsheet_022420_FINAL.pdf\">240 million acres</a> — about the size of Texas and Colorado combined — under regenerative grazing plans by 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/rob-manes/\">Rob Manes</a>, the group’s co-director of North American regenerative grazing lands strategy, said the Nature Conservancy doesn’t yet have details on what metrics it will use to assess how its regenerative grazing plans, when enacted, help the environment. But he’s confident it will work: “We know that those plans will result in greater biodiversity, better water quality, and in some places increased soil carbon.” He said measuring ecological change can be slow and that it’s “difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to measure those things over millions and millions of acres.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the time being, he said, “we find ourselves sometimes measuring effort.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-565993869.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5740170195941,100,88.851965960812\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Cowboys round up cattle on the 15,000 acre Tollhouse Ranch in Caliente, California, which is owned by the Nature Conservancy.  \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jonathan Foley, an environmental scientist and executive director of the climate research group Project Drawdown, said the regenerative narrative that nature can heal much of livestock’s environmental impact has political and cultural power that is as significant as it is distorting. Scenes of cattle grazing in beautiful grasslands and interviews with humble farmers can be highly effective propaganda: It’s “Americana,” and “the apple pie and the flag all rolled into one,” he said. “It’s a very powerful set of symbols” — one that the meat industry has used to its benefit, with help from some of the world&#8217;s most powerful environmental groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also prevents us from asking “hard questions about diets, subsidies, and political power within the food system,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s worth noting that a couple of the largest green organizations, like Earthjustice, go up against the industry, but they <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/feature/what-you-need-to-know-about-earthjustice\">appear</a> to devote <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/office/sustainable-food-farming\">disproportionately few</a> resources to it. The Natural Resources Defense Council once did, but it’s now focused on <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/issues/agriculture-food#overview\">regenerative agriculture</a> and declined to answer detailed questions about its related goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others, like Greenpeace US, don’t challenge the industry or advocate for shifting diets at all — though some of its chapters in other countries do, as do <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVpYTNQKAE_izp8tsVK3tQ4fNWPgoQIz/view\">some</a> of <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/our-reports/plant-based-alternatives-technical\">WWF’s</a>. Bonini of WWF told me that the organization “has had success in the UK with retailers focusing on sustainable diets” and that it’s looking into how it could adapt that work for the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just how hard it is to move environmental organizations on meat was made clear to me by someone who has been deeply involved in one of the oldest and biggest green groups in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Todd Shuman has been a <a href=\"https://vault.sierraclub.org/planet/200105/victory.asp\">devoted</a> Sierra Club volunteer, holding leadership positions on various committees for almost 15 years. He got involved in the 1990s when the organization was campaigning to stop cattle grazing in national parks and other public lands. But he’s slowly become disillusioned with the Club’s resistance to taking on Big Meat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shuman’s frustration has reached a boiling point in recent years, as he and some like-minded members have tried and failed to pass two proposals centered on animal agriculture. (Unlike most nonprofits, the Sierra Club is highly democratic and volunteers can have some influence in setting organizational policy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’ve been trying to prod the Club to act politically,” Shuman said. “Take on this industry! Challenge this industry!”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/imagejpeg_1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their first proposal entailed getting the Sierra Club to endorse and advocate for what Shuman calls a federal methane cap and fee policy, which would set a cap on methane emissions for polluters — including those in the livestock industry —&nbsp; and require them to pay for each ton of methane emitted. It’s a classic “<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-the-polluter-pays-principle/\">polluters pay</a>” policy, and the Biden administration has proposed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/12/methane-fee-epa-climate/\">similar regulations</a> for the oil and gas sector, but not the livestock sector, even though it emits <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane\">more methane</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A council of representatives from regional and state chapters passed Shuman’s resolution in September 2022 and it was then kicked up to a high-level internal committee. That committee declined to endorse the resolution and never voted on it, which Shuman considered a rejection — and one that he believes was made largely out of fear of political backlash. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, he and others wanted to revise the organization’s <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/policy/agriculture/food\">agriculture and food policy</a> to emphasize the need to reduce meat and dairy consumption and remove language that Shuman and others felt uncritically promoted regenerative cattle grazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The proposal has been tabled indefinitely, Shuman said, which he thinks is because some in Sierra Club leadership strongly believe that regenerative agriculture is a critical environmental solution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Sierra Club declined to comment on Shuman’s efforts, but <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/farm-bill-2023\">shared information</a> about a few federal bills the organization has endorsed in recent years that challenge the factory farming system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you can’t get the Sierra Club to [support a methane tax], how the fuck are you going to get anyone else in society to do that?” Shuman told me in exasperation. “If your environmental organizations — that people expect to kind of lead on this — are too scared to do that, what hope is there for our species on this planet?”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why meat is the third rail of public and personal politics </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shuman’s belief that the Sierra Club shies away from taking on the meat industry due to fear of political backlash — fears that seem to come into play much less when environmental groups take on fossil fuels — was something I heard throughout my conversations for this story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I posed this analysis to leaders of large environmental nonprofits, they mostly told me that while they agree people in the Global North need to eat less meat, working on policy to change diets or stop factory farming just doesn’t align with their organizations’ strengths or theory of change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We started as a land trust — buying and managing land — and really, that&#8217;s kind of the heart of what the Nature Conservancy does,” said Wironen. Reducing meat consumption “is not something that we as an organization really have a comparative advantage in.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When asked why Environmental Defense Fund doesn’t have any programmatic work on shifting diets in the Global North, Anderson said: “While consumer behavior changes can be part of the path to lower food emissions, banking our climate future on that alone isn’t practical.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/experts/melissa-d-ho/stories\">Melissa D. Ho</a>, senior vice president for freshwater and food at WWF-US, stressed the value of being “a middle-of-the-road organization” that can “try to bring disparate voices together,” like agriculture groups, meat producers, food companies, and Republicans and Democrats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, not every organization can take up every issue, and social movements need a multitude of tactics and approaches to succeed. But when most of the environmental movement feels that going up against Big Meat doesn’t fit with their mission, we’re left with one of our most ecologically destructive industries largely unchallenged by a movement that purportedly exists to stop ecological destruction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a given in the environmental community that governments and corporations need to phase out — or at least drastically reduce — fossil fuel production. Despite scientific consensus that significant changes to the Western world’s meat and dairy production are necessary to meet global climate targets, few environmentalists are willing to go there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no doubt it would be a difficult, even toxic fight. In Europe, which has long been more ambitious than the US on climate policy, farmers have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24146466/europe-farmer-protests-eu-climate-environmental-policy-subsidies-livestock\">protested en masse</a> against policies designed to cut livestock pollution. In the US and elsewhere, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/171781/meat-culture-war-crickets\">conservatives</a> have begun taking up <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/the-peterson-family-meat-cleanse/567613/\">meat</a> as a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjazz3/a-brief-history-of-conservatives-using-tofu-eating-as-an-insult?callback=in&amp;code=MWM1OGQ4OTKTMTGYNI0ZNDYYLWJMODQTOTEZOTFKY2ZMZDGY&amp;state=acb67b499b7a4f3e90a862b02568f503\">cause célèbre</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/4/26/22403599/biden-red-meat-ban-burger-kudlow\">culture war</a>.

Being an environmentalist doesn’t require being a vegan, but several people I talked to speculated that environmentalists may not care to change America’s relationship to meat because they’re unwilling to change themselves.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1160294625.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,31.917539267016,100,36.164921465969\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Greenpeace activists in Geneva, Switzerland, hold a banner during a protest prior to the United Nations’ publication of a special report on climate change and land in 2019. | Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People have told me about their [organization’s] leaders not willing to eat the vegan meal and going out and getting a steak or whatever,” one longtime activist told me, requesting anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue in the environmental movement. “I hear stories and I just think, ‘That’s like a person working on renewable energy and driving a Hummer.’ … If we can’t change ourselves in the environmental community, then how would we expect to change the general population?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many environmentalists have come to criticize individual action as ineffectual and naive. The burden to mitigate climate change and pollution falls on politicians and corporations, <a href=\"https://time.com/5669071/lifestyle-changes-climate-change/\">they argue</a>, not the average person. Leading climate voices, such as Michael Mann and David Wallace-Wells, have even <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/159153/climate-change-dismiss-meat-emissions-wrong\">dismissed</a> meat reduction as “virtue signaling” and a “cop-out.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, policy change is the only route through which we can overcome the enormity of the climate and ecological crises we ourselves have created. But policy change requires public support. It’s hard to see how politicians — aside from a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311327/farmers-factory-farms-cafos-animal-rights-booker-warren-khanna\">brave few</a> — will stick their neck out to push for significant meat industry reforms if even environmentalists are disinterested in shifting social norms around meat consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea that environmentalists shouldn’t try to influence how people eat “is a win for industry … It’s their script,” said Jacquet, the University of Miami professor. Environmentalists who repeat this, she added, have “become sock puppets for industry, and they don’t even mean to be.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A second current EDF employee I spoke to, who would only speak on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said when they brought up these issues internally, they were told that people’s diets are private. But, the employee told me, “it’s not private if it&#8217;s affecting everyone&#8217;s air and water.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some <a href=\"https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/food-agriculture-environment/eat-meat-not-too-much\">environmentalists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/choosing-chicken-over-beef-cuts-carbon-footprint-surprising-amount\">journalists</a> will encourage people to simply swap their beef for chicken, as chicken has a <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local\">lower carbon footprint</a> — about 10 percent that of beef’s. Vox obtained a copy of an internal Environmental Defense Fund policy that bars employees from purchasing meat from ruminant animals — cattle, sheep, and goats — at EDF offices and events due to their high carbon footprints, but says nothing of other meats, like chicken. Poultry production, however, comes with its own set of nasty <a href=\"https://environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chesapeake-Poultry-Report-.pdf\">air</a> and <a href=\"https://mediahub.unc.edu/nobodys-listening-nc-department-of-environmental-quality-fails-to-regulate-water-and-air-pollution-from-poultry-farming/\">water</a> pollution <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/4/20993654/chicken-beef-climate-environment-factory-farms\">problems</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We try to be very conscious of the environmental impact of our operations,” an EDF spokesperson said, when asked about the environmental impact of other animal products. “That policy is still being drafted, and we don&#8217;t have any more detail for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pete Smith, a <a href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/14907/\">leading climate scientist</a>, warns against the “swap beef for chicken” advice because poultry production also requires a significant amount of farmland to grow corn and soy to feed the birds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re eating products that are grown on land that could be growing food for humans instead, so it’s still a really inefficient thing to do to swap out ruminant [beef, lamb, goat] products for other different types of meat,” Smith told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Considering that much of the environmental movement also cares deeply about animal life, it’s worth noting that perhaps no farmed species is treated worse than chickens raised for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21437054/chickens-factory-farming-animal-cruelty-welfare\">meat</a>. The birds’ genetics have been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21437054/chickens-factory-farming-animal-cruelty-welfare\">significantly altered</a> to make them grow bigger and faster, which in turn has reduced their carbon footprint. But it’s come at a severe cost to their welfare; their legs cannot handle the rapid growth of their breasts, making it difficult for many chickens to walk or even stand.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/FosterFarmsGeneralFacilities12.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.1121349063185,100,93.775730187363\" alt=\"A room packed with chickens.\" title=\"A room packed with chickens.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Chickens on a US factory farm. | Mercy For Animals\" data-portal-copyright=\"Mercy For Animals\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, EDF and WWF are founding members of the industry coalition <a href=\"http://us-rspe.org/\">US Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry &amp; Eggs</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.us-rspe.org/resources/docs/2022-US-RSPE-Framework-Metrics-and-Indicators.pdf\">encourages</a> chicken producers to use “genetics” — among other things — to make animals more productive. While these organizations work to protect wild animals, they approve of one of the most abusive practices inflicted on domesticated animals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Britt Groosman, vice president of climate-smart agriculture for EDF, didn’t directly answer a question about the greenhouse gas and animal cruelty tradeoff, but said in an email: “It’s important that progress on one issue doesn’t exacerbate another issue, and we need to be thoughtful about solutions to environmental challenges.” WWF didn’t respond to a question about its involvement in the poultry roundtable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where the environmental movement might go from here</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While our food choices are personal and guided by our preferences, they’ve also been heavily shaped by policy, and so the few environmental groups that do challenge the meat industry spend little if any of their resources trying to tell people how to eat. Instead, they’re working the system to hold factory farms accountable for pollution and to make our food environment — cafeterias, grocery stores, restaurants — more sustainable. And some of the work they’re doing demonstrates that change is possible, if only more of their peers would join them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Making it easier for consumers to choose plant-based options “comes by changing the policy context,” Lake said. It’s analogous to efforts to make it easier for consumers to choose electric vehicles or heat pumps and solar panels — key parts of President Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, the policy landscape is tipped heavily in favor of meat and dairy production. There is publicly funded <a href=\"https://farm.ewg.org/cropinsurance.php\">animal feed crop insurance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ars.usda.gov/animal-production-and-protection/food-animal-production/\">meat and dairy R&amp;D</a>, and a sprawling set of <a href=\"https://agr.mt.gov/News/USDA-Makes-More-Grants-Available-for-Meat-and-Poultry-Processors-Aug-2023\">grants</a> and <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28092022/usda-conservation-funding-climate-smart-agriculture/\">programs</a> for producers, as well as a number of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws\">regulatory loopholes</a> that allow farmers and companies to pollute with few consequences. A <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00347-0.pdf\">2023 analysis</a> published in the journal <em>One Earth</em> found that<strong>, </strong>from 2014 to 2020, the US meat industry received about 800 times more government funding than did meat and dairy alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot can be done to tip the scale in the other direction, and in ways unlikely to spur political backlash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://coolfood.org/pledge/\">World Resources Institute</a> and <a href=\"https://foe.org/projects/school-food-purchasing/\">Friends of the Earth</a> work with institutions like schools, hospitals, and universities to serve more plant-based meals, while the Breakthrough Institute advocates for the government to <a href=\"https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/food-agriculture-environment/yes-alternative-proteins-really-do-deserve-federal-investment\">fund R&amp;D</a> for the alternative meat sector.

It could be working: Meat consumption <a href=\"https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-institutes/economic-research/show-wecr/meat-report-2023-meat-consumption-has-dropped-further-in-2022.htm#:~:text=The%20total%20per%20capita%20consumption,reported%20consumption%20figure%20since%202005.\">fell modestly</a> in the years that followed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231201-denmark-the-major-meat-producer-switching-to-a-plant-based-diet\">Denmark</a> has been the most ambitious, setting aside nearly $200 million USD to work with chefs, food businesses, farmers, and more to shift diets and expand organic food production. The plan was crafted by a diverse coalition of interests, including both environmental and farming groups. That diversity helped build political will.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The country is even on the cusp of enacting the world’s first <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/27/denmark-carbon-tax-cows/\">carbon tax on meat</a>, which was negotiated between a center-right government, farmers, meat industry representatives, and labor unions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What these accomplishments have in common is that environmental groups were willing to grab the third rail of politics. None of these groups in the US or Europe advocate for removing meat from menus altogether or curtailing consumer choice, but they do want to level the radically uneven playing field on which animal-based and plant-based foods compete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent decades, the US movement to protect farmed animals from cruelty — which, in full disclosure, I took part in prior to joining Vox — has won political and corporate campaigns that also show it’s possible to reform the factory farming industry. Those include banning some of the cruelest farming practices, like tiny cages for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22331708/eggs-cages-chickens-hens-meat-poultry\">hens</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23745935/proposition-12-pigs-pork-california-eggs-veal-hens\">pigs</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/HSUS_state-farm-animal-protection-laws.pdf\">over a dozen states</a> and working with <a href=\"https://us.sodexo.com/media/news-releases/sodexo-campus-plant-based-menu.html\">large food companies</a> to serve <a href=\"https://www.aramark.com/newsroom/news/2022/increasing-plant-based-menu-offerings-on-college-campuses\">more plant-based meals</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That movement has a mere <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/645be31efb5e013b9c6f4751/t/64cb9a7bb5b56917db63457a/1691064968896/FAF+State+of+the+Movement+Report+2021.pdf\">$91 million</a> annual budget. Much more might be possible if the US environmental movement, with an <a href=\"https://carbonswitch.com/analysis-of-environmental-giving/\">$8 billion</a> budget — 88 times larger — were more engaged in the fight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that reforming the US food system so it’s less reliant on animal products won’t be easy. Through a decade of advocacy, and now several years as a journalist on the beat, I’ve seen firsthand how resistant many Americans are to change on this issue, and the immense power agribusiness holds over Congress and in state legislatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s certainly far more difficult than the push for clean energy, and one that will take far longer to yield progress. People can’t tell whether their home runs on solar power or coal — as long as it flows, an electron is an electron — while food preferences are personal and influenced by culture, tradition, advertising, social norms, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But over the last 15 years, more environmental advocates have been able to cross the Rubicon to confront Big Meat, and Faber of the Environmental Working Group said the movement is increasingly turning toward environmental challenges posed by agriculture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s critical they get it right. Foley, the climate scientist, is concerned that a lot of the energy to reform agriculture is headed in the wrong direction by overinvesting in the regenerative approach: “I worry that we might lose years and decades pursuing what is kind of a bit of a fairy-tale solution, or at least highly exaggerated as the silver bullet solution, for all climate change issues in food.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Unfortunately, environmental groups depend on large philanthropies, so I wouldn’t put all of the blame at the feet of the environmental groups,” said <a href=\"https://mightyearth.org/person/glenn-hurowitz/\">Glenn Hurowitz</a>, founder and CEO of Mighty Earth, which campaigns against meat companies implicated in deforestation. “There’s not very many funders focused on food and agriculture in general. It is hard to raise money for our agricultural work, especially in the United States.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One major exception is the Bezos Earth Fund, which has committed <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-28/global-food-roundup-jeff-bezos-quest-for-alternative-meat\">$100 million</a> to fund research into alternative meat technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such works matters: Several people I spoke with felt that the emergence of better plant-based meat and dairy products over the last few years — despite <a href=\"https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf\">stagnating sales</a> — has served as an opening for some organizations and funders to think about the issue differently, offering a less politically risky approach than antagonizing industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That approach — along with redesigning <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/companies-and-schools-are-using-nudge-theory-to-cut-meat-consumption\">cafeterias</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/menu-messaging-increase-sales-climate-friendly-food\">restaurant menus</a>, and <a href=\"https://plantbasedfoods.org/pbfa-kroger-plant-based-meat-store-test\">grocery store shelves</a> to be more climate-friendly — may be most palatable in the near future to funders and other powerful stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But considering the public’s limited understanding of meat’s environmental and social harms — and the companies inflicting them on society — we’ll also need old-fashioned public awareness campaigns to build political support for reform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, there’s only political upside for environmental groups to ignore the problem or solely advocate for solutions that the industry is amenable to making. And there’s only political downside to campaigning against industry. Until that calculus changes, it’s hard to see how good policy could advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It needs to be a political liability to choose false solutions over effective climate policies,” said <a href=\"https://takeextinctionoffyourplate.com/about-us\">Jennifer Molidor</a>, a senior food campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It can be maddening to see, year after year, most of the environmental and agricultural community continue to avoid doing what leading climate scientists agree we must do to significantly decrease emissions and pollution, and was viable yesterday: Create a more plant-based food system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such a system in the US isn’t inevitable, or coming anytime soon, but it is possible. If it has any chance at taking off, buy-in from the broader US environmental community will need to precede it. For that to happen, its leaders will have to take their own advice: Follow the science wherever it leads, including to the inconvenient truth that changing how we farm alone won’t cut it. We have to rethink our relationship with meat.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

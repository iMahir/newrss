Instead, it spends most of them arguing a hot take that’s less hot than you might think — that JonBenét’s own parents <em>didn’t </em>do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;Following JonBenét’s violent death — which occurred sometime during the early morning hours of December 25 and 26, 1996, in her family’s massive home in Boulder, Colorado — that was a very popular theory. During the ensuing media frenzy, many members of the public looked at John Ramsey and his wife Patsy (who died in 2006) and assumed the case was open and shut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The victim was an <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/184273-how-the-jonbenet-ramsey-case-affected-me-as-a-kid\">eerily</a> <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/6086362/_Necrophilia_Pedophilia_or_Both_The_Sexualized_Rhetoric_of_the_JonBenet_Ramsey_Murder_Case_\">sexualized</a> 6-year-old pageant queen; her face graced the tabloid magazine covers at every checkout line in America. In 1997, no single news story was bigger than this one; by 1998, the Los Angeles Times labeled her “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-28-ca-27182-story.html\">the nation’s most famous murdered child since the Lindbergh baby</a>.” And although a <a href=\"https://realnewjournalism.com/2016/09/17/jonbenet-ramsey-a-judicial-analysis/\">2003 federal ruling</a> supported the Ramseys’ innocence, and they were formally <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25608543\">exonerated in 2008</a>, many people remain convinced that one or both of JonBenét’s parents were the culprits and suggest they did it to cover up a horrible accident committed by their 9-year-old son. A hugely influential <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/burke-ramsey-now-rcna181229\">2016 CBS series</a> about the case confidently made that argument.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet in recent years, many experts, including several featured in Berlinger’s documentary, have argued that an intruder committed the crime — a theory that the original police investigation never really seemed to take seriously, and which led to deep divisions among Boulder police, the district attorney, and the FBI.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the confusion stems from the problem that the original investigation was botched from the beginning, with police allowing the crime scene to be completely contaminated, evidence to be moved around and tampered with, rooms to be cleaned, and a string of visitors to traipse throughout the house for hours after the Ramseys called 911. This negligence torpedoed the integrity and reliability of nearly every piece of evidence in the case. As a result,&nbsp;even decades later, every detail remains up for debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for a list of potential suspects, while there are several primary contenders, including the Ramseys, it’s often difficult to have an even-handed discussion about them. That’s likely all because of a single piece of evidence, one of the most infamous in true crime history: the ransom note.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For most people who look into the JonBenét case, how they view the ransom note determines how they view the rest of the case, including who did it. That’s because the ransom note itself is so inexplicable that it immediately, and perhaps permanently, biased and derailed the entire investigation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The strangest ransom note ever</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first weird thing about the ransom note is where Patsy claims to have found it — lying unobtrusively on the floor of a back spiral stairwell in the early-morning hours of December 26. She gave conflicting stories about the sequence of events: In one version, she checked JonBenét’s room first and noticed she was missing, and then found the ransom note; in the more frequently repeated version, she found the note first, then ran upstairs to check on JonBenét, only to discover her missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The next weird thing about the ransom note is&#8230; well&#8230; everything about it. Here is the text in full:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mr. Ramsey,</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Listen carefully! We are a group of individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We [the word “do” has been scribbled out] respect your bussiness [sic] but not the country that it serves. At this time we have your daughter in our posession [sic]. She is safe and unharmed and if you want her to see 1997, you must follow our instructions to the letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You will withdraw $118,000.00 from your account. $100,000 will be in $100 bills and the remaining $18,000 in $20 bills. Make sure that you bring an adequate size attache [sic] to the bank. When you get home you will put the money in a brown paper bag. I will call you between 8 and 10 am tomorrow to instruct you on delivery. The delivery will be exhausting so I advise you to be rested. If we monitor you getting the money early, we might call you early to arrange an earlier delivery of the money and hence a [sic] earlier [“delivery” is scribbled out] pick-up of your daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any deviation of my instructions will result in the immediate execution of your daughter. You will also be denied her remains for proper burial. The two gentlemen watching over your daughter do not [“not” has been inserted between words] particularly like you so I advise you not to provoke them. Speaking to anyone about your situation, such as Police, F.B.I., etc., will result in your daughter being beheaded. If we catch you talking to a stray dog, she dies. If you alert bank authorities, she dies. If the money is in any way marked or tampered with, she dies. You will be scanned for electronic devices and if any are found, she dies. You can try to deceive us but be warned that we are familiar with Law enforcement countermeasures and tactics. You stand a 99% chance of killing your daughter if you try to out smart [sic] us. Follow our instructions and you stand a 100% chance of getting her back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You and your family are under constant scrutiny as well as the authorities. Don&#8217;t try to grow a brain John. You are not the only fat cat around so don&#8217;t think that killing will be difficult. Don&#8217;t underestimate us John. Use that good southern common sense of yours. It is up to you now John!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Victory!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">S.B.T.C</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a lot to unpack here: The strange ransom amount — $118,000 — corresponded to John’s year-end bonus that year from the lucrative tech company he ran. The note’s over-the-top language seems to be referencing well-known quotes from movies that feature abductions and ransoms, including <em>Dirty Harry</em>, <em>Ransom</em>, <em>Ruthless People</em>, and <em>Speed</em>. The “foreign faction” is very obviously not real, and “S.B.T.C.” has never been linked to any existing group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The final oddity about the note is where it came from — a notepad belonging to Patsy. The note’s author not only used the notepad, they wrote a draft version of the note originally addressed to “Mr. &amp; Mrs.” before directing the note just to John. They even used a Sharpie from the house that they then helpfully returned to the correct pen holder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patsy participated in a string of handwriting analysis sessions for investigators. One of them testified for the prosecution at the grand jury, <a href=\"https://extras.denverpost.com/news/jon101799.htm\">reportedly concluding</a> that the “handwriting showed indications that the writer was Patsy Ramsey” but that it was impossible to be certain. However, the modern understanding of handwriting analysis generally holds that it’s a shaky forensic arena prone to <a href=\"https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2023/jan/15/debunking-forensic-science-decade-increased-scrutiny-reveals-forensic-processes-prone-bias-and-error/\">significant cognitive bias</a>, and that less experienced analysts are <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2119944119\">more likely</a> not only to be wrong, but to be more confidently wrong than their peers. Other handwriting analysts have since <a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/news/9797920/jonbenet-ramsey-update-ransom-note-handwriting-gary-oliva/\">offered</a> totally different opinions about who wrote it. Behavioral analysts, too, tried to analyze the note with dubious results. To give you an idea of the kind of hysteria that surrounded this case, one official psychological profile <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19990224122955/http://www.seraph.net/jonbenet.html\">claimed</a> that “SBTC” could have meant “Saved by the cross,” and argued that Patsy was a “delusional sociopath” who committed the murder as part of an arcane religious ritual.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ransom note is so strange that for many people it’s impossible to get around the sheer improbability of anyone writing it at all. After all, what purpose could it serve an intruder to linger in the house after the crime, taking their time to write multiple drafts of a note, for a kidnapping that had not taken place?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One argument against this is that the intruder could have written the note <em>before</em> the crime. The Ramseys were away for hours at a Christmas party that evening, which gave a potential predator hours to enter the house, familiarize themselves with the home’s layout, and play around with creative writing exercises while waiting for the family to return and settle in for the night.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the question of motive — why?&nbsp; — seems to lead, for most people, away from an intruder and straight back to a Ramsey: The note is so fantastical that the most glaringly obvious conclusion is that it was written by someone who was desperate to divert attention away from the home and away from the family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a while, if that was the motivation, it worked: Boulder police assembled at the house but then left without securing it as a crime scene, leaving only one officer there throughout the day until JonBenét’s body was ultimately found by her father in the basement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet if this was really a cover-up by the family, the question of motive still remains: Why would the family leave (or place) JonBenét’s body in the basement if they wanted the police to think she’d been abducted? Why write such an elaborate ransom note or ask for such a specifically incriminating amount? Either way you look at it, the ransom note just doesn’t make sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For most people, there’s only one way to read the ransom note: Patsy wrote it. What else could it be?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One alternate way for us to think about this ransom note comes to us via <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/\"><em>The Consult</em></a>, a recent podcast hosted by former members of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/14/16474370/mindhunter-review-netflix-fincher\"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> fame. We know <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/12/18044688/criminal-profilers-mindhunter-hannibal-criminal-minds\">criminal profiling is as pseudoscientific</a> as every other cool-but-actually-junk forensic tool, so we have to take this analysis with many grains of salt. But in their <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/jonbenet-ramsey-the-ransom-note-part-1/\">two-part</a> <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/jonbenet-ramsey-the-ransom-note-part-2/\">series</a> studying the ransom note earlier this year, host Julia Cowley and her guest Robert Drew made interesting observations about the mindset of the letter writer — by honing in on the fact that they were really into movies about abduction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That sounds like an obvious point, but the profilers used it to make a salient point about the kind of person who could commit this crime. Every film referenced in the note involves a villain who, at the moment he’s making ransom demands, fully has the upper hand over the hero. He’s not only calling the shots, but doing so gleefully and maliciously, exactly as the letter writer may be attempting to do with John. The former FBI profilers argue that the letter is a fantasy of having control over someone rich and powerful — that it’s not an anomaly, but rather an extension of a crime scene created by a sadistic child abuser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This isn’t the only way to read the note, of course, but it’s a reasonable way to think about how the note fits into an intruder scenario. And given the resurgence of interest in the case, maybe this truly bizarre piece of evidence will finally start making some sense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, December 2, 10:40 am ET:</strong> This story was originally published on November 28 and has been updated with further information about handwriting analysis. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As a result, she distanced herself from friends and family. She left her job as a peer facilitator at a support group for people with depression and bipolar disorder and lived in an apartment and neighborhood with people she didn’t know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I was very, very lonely,” says Chi, whose last name is being withheld so she could speak freely about her mental health. “[I] was trying to figure out how would I structure my days. Where could I be? Who could I talk to?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the past, a friend had suggested <a href=\"https://www.fountainhouse.org/\">Fountain House</a>, a national mental health nonprofit that offers clinical support, housing resources, care management, and work programs for people experiencing serious mental illness, based in a physical location known as a clubhouse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not only could Chi get help finding work or housing, but she’d also volunteer alongside other Fountain House members to keep the place running — a cornerstone of the clubhouse model, which Fountain House <a href=\"https://fountainhouse.org/about/clubhouse-model\">originated in the 1940s</a>. (Membership is free and work is performed on a volunteer basis without pay.) She’d have a community — and some structure — once again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In her 13 years as a Fountain House member, Chi has been a tutor, organized cultural heritage days, and led racial equity, diversity, and gender initiatives. “I feel like I&#8217;m a person of integrity and a person of importance at Fountain House,” Chi says. “At the time when I was coming into Fountain House and really struggling with loneliness … and just feeling really lost, Fountain House has been a place where I have felt found.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Fountain House’s model is geared toward the needs of those with mental illness, its methods for curbing loneliness are far more widely applicable in the midst of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/366620/loneliness-epidemic-coping-demographics-america-social-connection-mental-health\">an ongoing loneliness epidemic</a> that touches old and young, people of all genders, the married and unpartnered. It goes to show that while simply being around people is great, being in a community you’ve willingly opted into, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-024-00720-3\">where you matter to others</a>, and where you find a sense of purpose — regardless of mental health — is even better. And it’s an ingredient that’s often conspicuously missing in discussing solutions to the burgeoning crisis.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A nostalgic slate of solutions&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">2023 advisory on loneliness and isolation</a>, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy suggests increased access to volunteer groups and religious organizations. The political scientist and author of <em>Bowling Alone</em> Robert Putnam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/23/join-or-die-documentary-review\">says to join a club</a>. The Institute for Family Studies sings the <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/why-are-we-ignoring-family-as-a-solution-to-loneliness\">praises of marriage and family</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/loneliness-and-social-isolation/loneliness-and-social-isolation-tips-staying-connected\">Introduce yourself to your neighbors</a>, advises the National Institute on Aging. In other words, many of our leading authorities on loneliness suggest a nostalgic slate of solutions that hark back to a time when neighbors freely mingled and religious institutions provided a social and moral compass.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This perspective, of course, flattens history, and fails to account for the ways that racism, segregation, homophobia, and other acceptable forms of exclusion often kept marginalized people deeply isolated (in even more acute ways than it does today). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s a distorted view of the past,” says <a href=\"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/richard-weissbourd\">Richard Weissbourd</a>, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and director of the <a href=\"https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/\">Making Caring Common Project</a>, an organization that provides research-backed resources for moral and emotional health. “Some of those forms of closeness were not, in fact, as simple and nourishing as people imagine them to be.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nostalgia-focused guidance also fails to account for modern ways of living. While <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/07/theres-no-place-like-home.html\">many people still live near their hometowns</a>, others leave for college and work, and are separated from their family support networks — if they’re emotionally<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/44817-poll-family-ties-proximity-and-estrangement\"> close to their family at all</a>. Smartphones, social media, endless forms of entertainment, and self-care are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/350424/self-care-isolation-loneliness-epidemic\">designed to keep us engaged and isolated</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23769973/limits-therapy-speak-narcissist-gaslighting-trauma-toxic\">rise of therapy-speak</a> has helped create a social ecosystem in which people are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23940673/balance-responsiveness-relationships-friends-family-support-mental-health\">focused on their own comfort over the well-being of others</a>. Chance encounters with strangers are less likely given the ascent of self-checkout and remote work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>To move through the world in a way that fosters connection is a choice</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans also spend less time engaged in social activities and leisure. The 2023 American Time Use Survey from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that Americans spent <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t11b.htm\">less than five hours a day</a> on activities like watching TV, reading, and relaxing, and even less time — fewer than 30 minutes — each day socializing. While Americans spend about <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/emp-by-ftpt-job-edu-h.htm\">eight hours a day at work</a>, most are not devoting their free time to <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/americans-paid-time-off-work-burnout-rcna128645\">pursuits that would imbue meaning and belonging</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those who feel alienated can’t be forced to join a club or ditch their phones or ascribe to a religious identity in order to help them feel more connected. Some may have a desire to be socially engaged, but don’t have access to places like Fountain House or other affirming clubs in their communities. But there are ways to find meaningful connection even in a modern, digitally connected world. Despite its seemingly classic approach to connection, Fountain House has zeroed in on something crucial — people don’t just need social connections; they need meaningful ones, too.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What prevents connection?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The issue in our modern loneliness conundrum isn’t with the number of relationships people have, but their quality. A recent study found that 75 percent of respondents were <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305834\">satisfied with the number of friends they had</a>, but 40 percent wanted to be closer to them. Over a third of Weissbourd’s participants in a 2020 survey on loneliness said they felt lonely because <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b7c56e255b02c683659fe43/t/6021776bdd04957c4557c212/1612805995893/Loneliness+in+America+2021_02_08_FINAL.pdf\">no one took the time to meaningfully ask them how they were</a>; 42 percent said they wished they had more people who cared about them outside of family.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Americans recognize they desire more quality connections, what holds people back from seeking them out? In a word, Weissbourd says, individualism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the 1950s, American society was <a href=\"https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2018-07/92003.pdf\">composed of social conformists</a> — people who wanted to fit in publicly, but in private, desired personal freedom to live, worship, and speak as they choose. By the ensuing decades, individualism morphed from these personal freedoms into placing a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797613479387\">premium on one’s uniqueness and personal choice</a>. An increased interest in personal success, safety, and physical and mental well-being, in turn, breeds an internally focused culture. If you’re spending so much time trying to further your own pursuits, or thinking about yourself, you might fail to see the value in activities that require another person: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/friendship\">friendship</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/368201/volunteer-charity-donations-systemic-change-activism-nonprofits-loneliness-philanthropy\">service</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23837430/how-to-make-friends-start-a-club\">club membership</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796711002464\">self-absorption can lead to anxiety</a>, research suggests, which prevents people from reaching out in the first place <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59532-3\">out of a fear of rejection</a>. The possibility of discomfort is par for the course when interacting with others, says <a href=\"https://seswps.umkc.edu/profiles/daniel-maitland.html#\">Daniel Maitland</a>, an associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. But being too in your head because you don’t want to offend — or be offended, hurt, or rejected — prevents people from being vulnerable. “Getting out of our comfort zone is essential to forming connection,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For many, the costs of social interaction start to outweigh the benefits. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People underestimate, potentially, how much value [social] groups might have for them,” says <a href=\"https://www.norc.org/about/experts/louise-hawkley.html\">Louise Hawkley</a>, a principal research scientist at NORC, a nonpartisan research organization at the University of Chicago. Helping your sister with child care, attending a block party, or catching up with a friend could carry too high a likelihood of social exhaustion, awkwardness, and conflict.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To move through the world in a way that fosters connection is a choice, says <a href=\"https://www.nicholasepley.com/\">Nicholas Epley</a>, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business — a choice you can make every day, even if you don’t belong to a church or book club. People inherently understand the value of sociality, he says, but some fail to make the decision to chat with people in their orbit. It’s easy to look at your phone while in the elevator — it’s a little harder to take a leap and introduce yourself to a new neighbor or colleague.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These seemingly inconsequential encounters have value. <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers\">Meaningful conversations can come from everyday interactions</a> and maintaining relationships with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23744304/how-much-social-interaction-do-you-need-loneliness-burnout\">people of varying levels of closeness</a>, from stranger to closest confidante, known as “relational diversity” improves well-being.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taking advantage of ordinary moments of connection may help promote more social engagement, Epley says. Start to notice where you could engage with others — at the grocery store, for instance — and the barriers holding you back — your phone. Small choices can have a big impact. “I, for instance, don&#8217;t keep my phone in my pocket ever unless I&#8217;m supposed to talk to somebody,”&nbsp; he says. “I have it in my backpack. That just makes it easier for me to engage with other people when they&#8217;re around.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding a way back to each other</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The struggle for meaningful relationships stems from a general sense of purposelessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, of fear. “When you feel that way,” Weissbourd says, “you have greater needs from your connection.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Family, career, and faith (as well as money) still remain <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2018/11/20/where-americans-find-meaning-in-life/\">common drivers of meaning</a>, but some measures suggest these tent poles of connection are diminishing in significance. Americans are <a href=\"https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/julian-median-age-first-marriage-2021-fp-22-15.html\">delaying marriage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/fertility-rates-declined-for-younger-women-increased-for-older-women.html?utm_campaign=20220406msacos1ccstors&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">child-rearing</a> — if <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/final2-ifs-single-americansbrief2020.pdf\">they decide</a> to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/07/25/the-experiences-of-u-s-adults-who-dont-have-children/#:~:text=Secondary%20data%20methodology-,57%25%20of%20adults%20under%2050%20who%20say%20they're%20unlikely,reason%20they%20never%20had%20them\">do so at all</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/\">rise of parental estrangement</a> signals historically traditional familial roles no longer serve adult children. Gen Z and millennials increasingly <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/talent/recruiting-gen-z-and-millennials.html\">disentangle their identities</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220613-gen-z-the-workers-who-want-it-all\">from their work</a>. Most Americans agree <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2024/03/15/8-in-10-americans-say-religion-is-losing-influence-in-public-life/\">religion has less of an influence</a> on their lives — and they aren’t happy about it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The key to why these traditional forms of connection, like bowling leagues and religious institutions, were so effective at abating loneliness isn’t because they simply brought people together, but that participants derived meaning from them. Without it, they’re not likely to stay engaged and keep coming back.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the goal shouldn’t be to compel people to take part in these traditions; it’s for those who are adrift to find something that fills the void, that imbues meaning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Volunteerism <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/368201/volunteer-charity-donations-systemic-change-activism-nonprofits-loneliness-philanthropy\">serves such a purpose for many people</a>, Weissbourd says. Having a clear role and a shared goal is what Fountain House members say helps them stay connected and mentally well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If personal motivations aren’t enough to spur lonely people into action, perhaps they’re more likely to engage under doctor’s orders. One promising solution that doesn’t just tell people to go back to the imagined past is a burgeoning <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/\">social prescription</a> movement, which aims to connect patients with community volunteering, art, and movement groups. In the UK, <a href=\"https://socialprescribingacademy.org.uk/resources/the-future-of-social-prescribing-in-england/\">where social prescribing is integrated into the national health care system</a>, more than 2.5 million people have been referred by health professionals to a “<a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/workforce-and-training/social-prescribing-link-workers/\">social prescribing link worker</a>” who connects those who are lonely, as well as those with chronic or mental health conditions, to social groups. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The goal, says <a href=\"https://www.hotzthoughts.com/\">Julia Hotz,</a> author of <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Connection-Cure/Julia-Hotz/9781668030332\"><em>The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging</em></a><em>,</em> is to find an activity that patients actually want to do. “Instead of focusing on just what&#8217;s the matter with you,” she says, “it asks what matters to you.” Because if a physician socially prescribes an art class to someone who really wants to ride a bike, “I’m probably going to choose staying home scrolling my feed,” Hotz says.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Instead of focusing on just what’s the matter with you, social prescribing asks what matters to you”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taking part in a meaningful activity with other people is usually compelling enough for participants to keep their phones out of sight, Hotz says. The mutual buy-in from fellow foragers or crocheters creates a system of support: If you miss a session, group members will notice your absence. Over time, you start to suspect that not only does the work you’re doing matter, but you matter, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US medical system is slowly integrating social prescribing programs. In Massachusetts, <a href=\"https://www.wcvb.com/article/massachusetts-social-prescribing-mass-general-brigham/61572620\">doctors at Mass General Brigham can prescribe</a> arts and culture events to patients. The Cleveland Clinic launched a <a href=\"https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/unconventional-approach-to-geriatric-complaints-appears-to-decrease-emergency-visits-and-symptoms\">social prescribing model for geriatric patients</a>. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey members and Rutgers University Newark students can get <a href=\"https://www.njpac.org/arts-well-being/\">six months of free art prescriptions</a>, the first insurer-involved social prescribing program in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But lack of access shouldn’t prevent people from socially prescribing for themselves, Hotz says. She suggests thinking back on activities, perhaps during childhood, that brought you joy or flow or something you have a deep interest in. Are there any local organizations or events dedicated to that practice?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hotz acknowledges that some communities will have more to offer than others, but she typically relies on Google, library and park websites, and word of mouth to find social clubs. The process of finding a group you enjoy and connect with is time intensive. And given the plethora of demands in this modern world — work at all hours, intensive parenting, other forms of caregiving — it can be a challenge to even find a second to mine your desires in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Virtual groups can also be sources of meaning. During the pandemic, Fountain House members performed their work assignments exclusively online. Even now, Chi says she begins her day at Fountain House over Zoom before heading into the clubhouse. Online communities have been essential for <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34706814/\">young LGBTQ people</a> and <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-23600-008\">those with physical disabilities</a> to find affirming support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Central to these caring, meaningful communities is a sense of belonging — that members are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9955914/\">seen as essential</a> to the group’s functioning. Vulnerability is the vehicle, according to Maitland, the psychology professor, to open up to others, even if it’s potentially uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Quality relationships can blossom because of, and in spite of, this digitally-connected world. It’s a comfort then that despite all the forces shaping collective values and priorities, having a purpose and being seen for who you are is what fosters community. Maybe the impulse isn’t toward nostalgic forms of connection, but for timeless ways of relating.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He has shown no sign of relenting in a second term — and may try to either revoke those protections or let them expire soon after being sworn in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">TPS allows people to temporarily live and work in the US and is currently granted to citizens of at least 16 countries suffering from natural disasters, armed conflict, or other extraordinary circumstances. The secretary of homeland security can grant TPS to each country for a renewable period of up to 18 months. Some countries’ TPS status is set to expire soon, including El Salvador’s, which expires <a href=\"https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-temporary-protected-status/\">in March</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Directing his homeland security secretary not to renew TPS for these countries could allow Trump to start reducing the population of TPS holders. Ending TPS, which has provided a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of immigrants for decades, would reshape families and communities across the US. It would also harm local economies and industries that rely on TPS recipients’ labor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-springfield-haitian-migrants-removed/\">interview with News Nation</a> in October, Trump said he would end TPS protections for Haitians after <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/podcasts/372206/springfield-ohio-pets-haitian-immigrants-conspiracy\">lying about immigrants eating pets</a> in Springfield, Ohio: “Absolutely I’d revoke it,” he said, adding that he would send them back to their home country, despite its <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/haiti\">deepening political and humanitarian crises</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tom Homan, who Trump tapped as his “border czar,” was also an editor of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">Project 2025</a>, a <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">900-page opus</a> of conservative policy recommendations published by the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank. The document explicitly calls on Congress to repeal TPS and other temporary status programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump previously sought to end TPS during his first term. The lawsuits that delayed his plans have yet to be fully resolved. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has more than doubled the number of immigrants covered by TPS. Immigrant advocates are hoping that Biden will use his final months in office to extend those TPS protections that will soon expire. But if Trump tries to end TPS, advocates are gearing up for what could be another legal fight, perhaps more difficult than the last.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The potential impact of ending TPS</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The current population of TPS holders is diverse — it includes people from Venezuela, Honduras, El Salvador, Ukraine, and more. Some TPS holders have been living in the US for decades, meaning that forcing them to return home would likely result in family separations and impact the communities where they have laid roots, as well as the US industries that employ them. Despite the length of time many TPS recipients have been in the US, they have no means to convert their legal status to a green card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Many of us have been here for decades in the United States. We have built a family, many of us with kids born in the United States,” said José Palma, a TPS holder from El Salvador and coordinator at the National TPS Alliance, an advocacy group for TPS holders. “This is their country.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Haitians were first granted TPS after a devastating 2010 earthquake from which the country never recovered, setting off a cascade of events that culminated in the collapse of its government. For Hondurans, the grant came in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch wreaked widespread destruction. For Salvadorans, it was granted in 1990 amid a civil war in their home country that lasted 12 years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cecilia Menjívar, a sociology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, has studied these populations of Honduran and Salvadoran TPS holders. In a <a href=\"https://latino.ucla.edu/research/temporary-protected-status/\">2020 report</a>, she found that they were deeply integrated in their communities and employed at high rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of the more than 2,000 people she surveyed, she found that all had lived in the US for at least 20 years, about two-thirds had a US-born child, 88 percent of them were in the labor force, and about one-third owned their homes. They had a large presence in hospitality, construction, personal services, and transportation. In addition, she said they are “very civically active,” participating in church groups, neighborhood initiatives, school organizations, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is not a population that can be uprooted so easily,” Menjívar said. “It will be quite impactful for the rest of the community to pluck them up and send them home.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other TPS holders, however, have arrived more recently. Lebanese were only granted TPS in October amid the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The biggest population of recent arrivals are Venezuelans fleeing the Maduro regime, numbering <a href=\"https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-temporary-protected-status/\">more than 340,000 since they were granted TPS in 2021.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Menjívar said she expected them to have similarly high levels of labor force participation. They have not had as much time to put down roots here, but that doesn’t mean it will necessarily be easier to return them to their home countries. Venezuela, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/trump-mass-deportation-venezuela-nicolas-maduro\">does not currently accept deportees from the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What is true for most TPS holders is that ending protections wouldn’t just affect them. It would also affect their communities and even their family members who never left their home countries and rely on their remittances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The majority of recipients send money to our countries to support our families,” Palma said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Can Trump’s plans to end TPS be stopped?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has the power to end TPS protections, but it would be unusual to do so well before they are set to expire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The way that TPS decisions typically work and the way that the statute is designed is that new decisions with regard to TPS are supposed to be made in the period immediately before the end of the period of designation for TPS holders,” said Emi MacLean, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Northern California.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means that Palma and other immigrant advocates may be able to buy some time for TPS recipients whose status is set to expire soon if they can convince the Biden administration to renew their status for another 18 months. But even if they are successful, Trump may still try to revoke their protections prematurely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can&#8217;t say definitively that [the Trump administration is] not going to try to do something that is atypical,” MacLean said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The clearest path (and the one Trump followed in his first term) is to just not renew TPS protections when they expire. However, if Trump does decide to end TPS protections early, his decision will likely face legal challenges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During Trump’s first term, he tried to terminate TPS protections for about 400,000 citizens of El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti, among nationals of other countries. He argued that conditions in those countries had improved enough that their citizens could safely return. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/7/20950689/trump-tps-temporary-protected-status-el-salvador-haiti-honduras-state-department-report-senate\">Senior State Department officials disagreed</a>, arguing that ending TPS would destabilize the three countries and that any wind-down period should span several years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2018, immigrant advocates sued the Trump administration, alleging that the president’s decision to end TPS was motivated by racism and that it unlawfully forced the US-citizen children of TPS holders to either separate from their families or live in a foreign country. They also asserted that Trump didn’t follow the correct agency procedures in his efforts to end the benefit, which involve evaluating the current conditions in the countries covered by TPS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A federal court temporarily blocked Trump from following through while legal battles played out, and cases continued well after Biden took office. In June 2023, Biden finally rescinded Trump’s terminations of TPS and extended it for the affected countries. The lawsuits were dismissed as a result, but immigrant advocates are preparing to go back to court if Trump tries to end TPS again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">MacLean suggested that some of the same legal arguments may apply this time around. She pointed to Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/371855/trump-vance-springfield-ohio-racist-conspiracy-theories-haitian-immigrants\">racist comments about Haitians</a> on the campaign trail as evidence that any termination of their TPS status may be similarly racially motivated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the exact contours of their legal arguments may depend on what happens in the coming months and who is affected, MacLean said it is clear that “any sort of broad-based effort to terminate TPS would almost certainly face really serious legal hurdles.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The one other way Trump could try to end TPS would be to request congressional help: Congress could also repeal TPS entirely, as Project 2025 proposes. Given congressional gridlock on the issue of immigration and the narrow Republican margin in the House and Senate, however, that path seems unlikely.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Since Kamala Harris’s defeat, several Democrats and center-left commentators have pointed the finger at one culprit: “the groups.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Specifically, they claim, progressive interest and activist groups have both moved too far left and grown far too influential in the Democratic coalition, pushing the party to adopt stances out of step with the median voter on a range of different issues. This, they say, has backfired electorally and will ultimately hurt the people the groups claim to want to help.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Many of today’s lawmakers and leaders have come up at a time when alienating the groups is seen as anathema, but they should start seeing it as both right and necessary,” former Democratic staffer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/opinion/democrats-interest-groups-majority.html\">Adam Jentleson wrote</a> in the New York Times in November.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other commentators — <a href=\"https://x.com/jonfavs/status/1860500811328917624\">Jon Favreau</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1860703589125034333\">Matthew Yglesias</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/obama-ezra-klein-podcast-michael-lind.html\">Ezra Klein</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-democrats-progressive-organization\">Ruy Teixeira</a> — have made similar points. Some, like <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-we-got-here-ce8\">Yglesias</a> and <a href=\"https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-democrats-progressive-organization\">Teixeira</a>, have been criticizing the influence of such groups for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet this critique has been met with an impassioned backlash from progressives and leftists. Some, like <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/corporate-democrats-not-woke-activists-doomed-kamala-harris/\">Waleed Shahid</a>, argue the blame is misplaced and the supposed power of these progressive groups has been exaggerated. “The Democratic Party has long been shaped by far more powerful forces — corporate interests, lobbyists, and consultants — whose influence has neglected the real crises facing everyday Americans,” Shahid wrote for The Nation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others argue that inflation — a global phenomenon — was the main reason for Harris&#8217;s defeat, so a groups-focused diagnosis misses the point. And yet others argue that progressive groups represent morally righteous causes that Democrats should not abandon — for instance, that moderation <a href=\"https://x.com/adamjohnsonCHI/status/1854873773167513714\">would</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/treeaston/status/1858527304017760711\">amount</a> to throwing marginalized groups “under the bus.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This debate is now in full swing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m quite comfortable — morally and politically — with the position that Dem presidential candidates shouldn’t let voters believe they want to defund the police, abolish ICE, decriminalize border crossings, or provide transition surgeries for undocumented immigrants in prison,” Favreau <a href=\"https://x.com/jonfavs/status/1860500811328917624\">recently posted on X</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In some ways, it’s a continuation of the debate over social justice politics and “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020\">wokeness</a>” that has been raging for years. But it extends well beyond that — on <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/climate-is-the-problem\">climate change</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics\">economic policy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/the-orthodoxy-that-doomed-democrats-border-policies/678644/\">immigration</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22876643/democrats-voting-rights-senate-filibuster-manchin\">voting reforms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/abortion/386228/abortion-ivf-roe-republicans-congress-bipartisan-ban-birth-control\">reproductive rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/375488/child-care-paid-leave-build-back-better-harris-ctc-preschool-biden-families\">child care</a>, and many others, the influence of such nonprofit groups on Democrats’ strategic decisionmaking has been immense in recent years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet there’s more to the story than just the groups. The bigger picture is that Democrats are reckoning with the apparent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center\">end of a years-long trend</a> in which liberal college graduates’ opinions kept moving further left, a trend that influenced all actors in the party. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The debate now is over whether and how Democrats should respond to electoral defeat — by moving to the center and trying to moderate their positions, sticking to their guns, or moving even further left.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what happened, exactly, and how? And what are the implications for Democrats, as they search for a path back to electoral victory?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are “the groups”?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When critics talk about “the groups,” they’re talking about a vast and complex tapestry of progressive nonprofit organizations focusing on a variety of issues. Some, like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/9/10/20847401/sunrise-movement-climate-change-activist-millennials-global-warming\">Sunrise Movement</a>, are relatively young. But others — the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign — have been around for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Critiques of “the groups” are typically about progressive groups specifically, even though there have long been centrist and non-ideological interest groups that also influence the Democratic Party. Because, the critics assert, it’s the progressive groups that grew far <em>more</em> influential within the Democratic Party in recent years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Back at the start of Barack Obama’s presidency, for instance, Democrats in both the White House and Congress had a sometimes-testy relationship with the activists his press secretary Robert Gibbs disparaged as being part of the “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/168588-white-house-unloads-anger-over-criticism-from-professional-left/\">professional left</a>.” On policy and political matters, Democrats took into account progressive groups’ demands, but they were typically guided by caution about what might be “too far” for the public to accept or what might alienate powerful business interests. (The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/16/obama-health-plan-ama-support\">Affordable</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna31485134\">Care Act</a> and Democrats’ <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/as-the-world-burns\">failed cap-and-trade bill</a> were both crafted in <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/biden-pass-climate-legislation-1140934/\">close consultation with business interests</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But with the rise of new protest movements and social media, and with establishment Democrats’ approach seemingly being discredited by Donald Trump’s 2016 win, progressive groups got more emboldened. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/11/30/its-unprecedented-in-our-history-after-trumps-election-millions-of-dollars-poured-into-nonprofits/\">New money</a> from megadonors and flush foundations, as well as viral small donors, flowed into existing groups’ coffers and funded new ones. A new generation of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/06/us/aclu-free-speech.html\">activist staffers</a> <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/06/13/progressive-organizing-infighting-callout-culture/\">demanded bold action</a>. The lines between groups focused on different causes started to blur as a practice of allyship emerged, particularly on <a href=\"https://prochoicewashington.org/2020/06/25/in-solidarity-with-black-lives-defund-the-police/\">social justice issues</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democratic politicians responded in part by moving left. This was most on display in the 2020 presidential primary, when leading contenders — <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/harris-defends-shifting-positions-on-fracking-and-decriminalizing-illegal-border-crossings\">including Harris</a> — endorsed positions that would have seemed unthinkably radical to Democrats just a few years earlier, like banning fracking and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One example that’s become emblematic of this trend is an <a href=\"https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/08/Harris-ACLU-Candidate-Questionnaire.pdf\">ACLU questionnaire</a> to which Harris responded that she’d support “gender transition care” for federal inmates and immigration detainees, a position Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/presidential-campaign-transgender-rights.html\">blasted in attack ads</a> this year. (When Elizabeth Warren first ran for office in 2012 and was asked about this, she <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/01/09/warrens-newfound-support-for-surgery-for-trans-inmates-could-impact-2020-race/\">quipped</a> that she didn’t think it would be a good use of taxpayer money — but by 2019, she announced her full-throated support of such surgeries, in what advocates interpreted as an attempt to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/01/09/warrens-newfound-support-for-surgery-for-trans-inmates-could-impact-2020-race/\">box in Harris</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond the 2020 primary, there was a broader trend of Democrats starting to view progressive advocacy groups as central to the party’s policymaking and strategic calculations. By the 2020s, Klein <a href=\"https://t.co/B3aK0DqRDp\">observed</a>, a “culture of how you make policy” and “who you listen to had emerged” inside the Democratic Party. On one issue he covered, permitting reform for clean energy projects, Hill staffers “would explain to me that if you couldn’t get” environmental justice groups on board, “they couldn’t move forward with this at all.” Klein continued:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I would say, “Well, what is the power of these groups — like, what is their leverage on you?” And there was never an answer. It was just a coalitional decision that had been made in the culture of the way the Democratic Party now made policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my own reporting — on issues like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22876643/democrats-voting-rights-senate-filibuster-manchin\">voting rights</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics\">economic policy</a> — I have noticed a similar shift in how Democratic staffers now talk about “the groups” (a term such staffers <a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1860703589125034333\">often use</a> in such vague fashion). On many issues, these nonprofits became arguably the key constituency the Democratic Party was focused on pleasing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to inflation, polls showed that voters were particularly unhappy with the Biden administration’s record on unauthorized immigration — an issue where Democrats had moved significantly to the left in recent years after pressure from activists and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-disillusionment-of-a-young-biden-official\">their own staffers</a>. Faced with public discontent amid surging border crossing numbers, Biden eventually advanced sharply <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/353835/asylum-border-biden-policy-trump-shutdown\">restrictionist policies</a> through executive action — but not until 2024, when it was too late to <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_061224/\">change voter perceptions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, viewed from the perspective of progressive activists, this is nonsense: They think Democrats tell them no all the time. On certain issues — most notably the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza — they’re correct. Most Democrats never went so far as to back “defunding the police.” And the further left the group, the less likely it is that Democrats fully embraced their agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet relative to the early Obama era baseline, the party has indeed <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center\">shifted left</a> on a whole range of economic and cultural issues. This was indeed partly due to the hard work and tireless advocacy of the groups — but not entirely.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Democratic Party’s transformation wasn’t just about the groups</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The broader reason why Democrats’ leftward shift happened remains somewhat mysterious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yglesias <a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1855044436004143113\">has argued</a> that the rise of the groups is mostly a story of “astroturf” — that big donors and foundations funded phony “grassroots” movement organizations that convinced both Democratic politicians and the media to take them seriously, even though they spoke for no one but their donors. But that doesn’t explain the leftward shift in long-established groups <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/06/us/aclu-free-speech.html\">like the ACLU</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Klein discussed several possibilities for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/obama-ezra-klein-podcast-michael-lind.html\">why Democrats adopted a culture</a> of deference to the groups, including a mistaken belief that those groups could deliver them votes (for instance, the argument that Latino voters generally wanted the lenient policies toward unauthorized immigrants demanded by advocacy groups), a revolving door between progressive nonprofits and Democratic staff jobs, and the rise of social media (which made the perceived backlash when politicians defied the groups more intense).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of these may be part of the story, but I do think there’s a risk of overstating the groups’ actual power and centrality to events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Benjy Sarlin <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/15/2024/the-groups-are-too-easy-a-scapegoat-for-democrats\">wrote at Semafor,</a> in Democrats’ 2020 primary, it was often specific candidates who chose to box out their opponents by running to the left, and they were doing so because they believed it would be politically beneficial to them. Sarlin also reminds us that “Abolish ICE” briefly caught on not because of any “group” — the slogan was coined by an up-and-coming Democratic consultant who was chasing influence and social media clout. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the election, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) and commentator <a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/1859775933575520741?s=46\">Aaron Rupar</a> have both opined that Democrats had gotten on the wrong side of public opinion on the issues of trans athletes or bathrooms. Both have gotten impassioned pushback; a top aide to Moulton <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4981767-moulton-aide-resigns-transgender-athletes/amp/\">resigned</a>, Rupar faced social media criticism and <a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/1859775933575520741?s=46\">apologized</a>. But this pushback wasn’t because of the groups. It was because of genuinely held beliefs in progressive circles that trans women are women, that that’s an issue of fundamental rights, and that any concession to public opinion on this matter is poor allyship and throwing a marginalized group under the bus.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The groups themselves were also responsive to social media pressure. One low-stakes but illustrative example: In 2017, the ACLU tweeted a picture of a (white) toddler with an American flag, captioned, “This is the future that ACLU members want.” Outraged respondents from progressive Twitter <a href=\"https://time.com/4915799/aclu-baby-viral-meme/\">deemed that</a> a white supremacist image. The ACLU then praised the critics for reminding them “that white supremacy is everywhere.” Such incidents were quite common at that time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The larger dynamic is: In the second Obama term and the first Trump term, the groups moved left, but they were responding to donors who had <a href=\"https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2020-10-7-the-uneasy-alliance-between-progressives-and-billionaire-donors\">shifted left</a>. Those donors were trying to channel the energy and passion of activists who had shifted left. Those activists got favorable coverage from media outlets that had shifted left. Those media outlets were chasing traffic and ratings from an audience that seemed to have shifted left (while being sensitive to social media criticism from that audience). And Democratic politicians were gauging all this and shifting left.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So in my view, the best overarching explanation is simply that opinion among liberal college grads (who overwhelmingly populate the institutions listed above) shifted left in the 2010s. Every actor was chasing incentives that resulted from this leftward shift, whether it be money, clicks, or social approval. The groups are merely a part of this larger story — they may have helped exacerbate the leftward shift, but they also reflected it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, that poses the larger question of why that leftward shift happened. There are various potential causes, including post-Great Recession disappointment, disillusionment with the Democratic establishment reflected in Bernie Sanders’s rise and deepening after Trump’s victory, social media exposing liberals to new ideas like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020\">Great Awokening</a> and making activists more influential, and the rise of “movement”-style thinking. There was a widespread belief that the old consensus had failed and bold new progressive ideas were necessary. And, while Trump was in power, there seemed to be no negative consequences to moving left — internal Democratic tensions and misgivings were subordinated to the task of stopping Trump.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What comes next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What does seem clear is that, for the time being at least, the leftward shift <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center\">has stopped</a> since Biden took office. A backlash to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/upshot/democrats-trump-working-class.html\">progressive activists’ preferred policies</a> on several issues, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/383079/california-prop-36-tough-on-crime-colorado-prop-128\">criminal justice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift\">immigration</a>, is in full swing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, of course, Harris lost. How much blame, if any, “the groups” should get for that has become a matter of intense debate. Progressive group defenders point out that Harris tried to pivot to the center and that the Biden administration’s record on inflation and immigration were her two biggest vulnerabilities. The groups’ critics say Harris’s group-influenced positions from the 2020 primary weighed her down, and Democrats ran into political trouble on inflation and immigration in part because of the groups’ bad advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How the Democratic world — its groups, donors, activists, media outlets, staffers, and politicians — responds to all this is yet to be seen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are past models. In the 1980s, after the landslide defeats of three successive Democratic presidential nominees, various reform factions <a href=\"https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Politics_of_Evasion.pdf\">tried to moderate</a> the party, arguing that they’d gotten out of touch with the median voter and were too beholden to “special interests.” Some called for moderation on cultural issues, others for new pro-growth and pro-business policies. Bill Clinton became affiliated with these reformers, and won the presidency in 1992.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In contrast, the model of Democrats between 2004 (when John Kerry lost) to 2008 (when Obama won big) may suggest a sweeping overhaul of the party’s positions isn’t necessary. After all, Harris came pretty close to winning. Perhaps Trump will govern poorly and Democrats will return to power having changed little, avoiding a wrenching internal coalitional conflict. And perhaps the apparent end of the leftward opinion shift among liberal college graduates will be enough to effectively weaken the power of the groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another model, oddly enough, is Trump. Before his rise, the Republican Party was tethered to an unpopular “free market” economic agenda involving Medicare cuts and free trade pushed by donor-financed advocacy groups. In 2016, Trump distanced himself from that agenda, and in doing so revealed those groups had little actual power. However, Trump also hugged other groups in the GOP coalition even tighter — promising, for instance, to pick his Supreme Court appointees from a Federalist Society list. Then, in 2024, it was the anti-abortion groups that looked to be a political millstone for Trump — so he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/trump-federal-abortion-ban/index.html\">distanced himself</a> from them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Democrats now, there are some nascent attempts to challenge the group-dominated status quo. Yglesias recently pitched a new agenda for “<a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-common-sense-democrat-manifesto\">Common Sense Democrats</a>” that involves moderating on several issues. Klein has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-jennifer-pahlka-steven-teles.html\">more focused</a> on how to make Democratic governance work better, and <a href=\"https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1860401118871711990\">says his critique</a> is more about the party’s “broader culture of coalitional cowardice” rather than “an anti-left-wing view.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet others are skeptical of how much Democrats will — and should – change. “Democrats declaring independence from liberal and progressive interest groups can’t and likely won’t happen,” the commentator Michael A. Cohen (not Trump’s former lawyer) <a href=\"https://truthandcons.substack.com/p/looking-for-loss-in-all-the-wrong\">wrote on Substack</a>. “For better or worse, these groups <em>are</em> the modern Democratic Party. If Democrats hope to retake political power in Washington, they must ensure that these groups are enthusiastic, mobilized, and remain firmly ensconced in the Democrats’ corner.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, the politics of the war in Gaza may be a cautionary tale in this regard. Biden and Harris ignored progressive groups by remaining supportive of Israel — but as a result, Harris faced regular criticism from activists and negative coverage throughout the campaign. The groups might not be so effective at winning Democrats votes — but they still might be able to drive some away.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Housed inside a research building in southwestern Colombia, they are essentially big metal boxes with large, latched doors. Inside them are concrete floors, plexiglass windows, and air conditioners mounted on the wall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These chambers serve a noble and highly scientific purpose: measuring burps and farts. Specifically, the ones produced by animals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a few months, scientists at an agriculture research organization called Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT — which built eight of these chambers — will place live sheep inside each one. Then they’ll wait for the animals to pass gas. Over the course of 24 hours, that gas will run through high-tech machines that measure its contents.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/9-Juan-Pablo.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A sheep inside one of the hermetically sealed chambers that measures methane gas. | Juan Pablo/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" data-portal-copyright=\"Juan Pablo/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What exactly are they looking for? Among other things: methane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These chambers are part of a multi-year project to lower the amount of methane produced by farm animals. This is important. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/?intent=121\">roughly 20 to 30 percent</a> of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. The <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change\">bulk</a> of global methane emissions stem from human activities, and the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change\">largest single source</a> among them is agriculture —&nbsp;namely, the burps of ruminant animals such as cattle, goats, and sheep, as well as their manure.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/IMG_8651-rotated.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.366492146597,100,39.267015706806\" alt=\"Interior showing several large stainless steel chambers with aisles between.\" title=\"Interior showing several large stainless steel chambers with aisles between.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A view of several chambers from the outside at Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT, an agriculture research center outside of Palmira, Colombia. | Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The amount of methane an animal produces is tied to what it eats. And that’s the key premise of the new CIAT project. Starting in February, researchers led by Jacobo Arango will feed sheep —&nbsp;which have very similar digestive systems to cattle —&nbsp;different kinds of plants, such as legumes and grasses. Then they’ll put the animals inside the chambers with more food to measure how much methane the animals produce. The idea is to identify specific types of forage that result in fewer greenhouse gases, with an ultimate goal of lowering global methane emissions and, thus, fighting climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Testing 6,000 plants</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The researchers are aiming to test around 6,000 different varieties of forage, many of which are stored as seeds in a gene bank not far from the chambers, at a CIAT research center near Palmira, Colombia. The bank, known as <a href=\"https://alliancebioversityciat.org/future-seeds\">Future Seeds</a>, houses roughly 67,000 samples including the world’s largest collection of seeds for tropical forage plants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was stifling outside when I visited the bank one afternoon in October, yet I had to wear a winter jacket to go inside. The seeds are kept in a room at -9.4º F and stored in vacuum-sealed packets made of laminated aluminum foil. Inside the room were rows and rows of seed packets sitting on mobile shelves like those in a college library.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/IMG_8731_968d13.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.621783349163,100,78.756433301674\" alt=\"Silver foil packets on wire shelves with numerical labels.\" title=\"Silver foil packets on wire shelves with numerical labels.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Shelves full of seed packets at Future Seeds, a gene bank at Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT. | Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the methane project, scientists are using seeds from the bank and growing them into forage. From there, the experiment has two main phases. The first is testing the plant material in a lab, with no animals. Researchers essentially replicate the stomach of a ruminant, like a cow, in a test tube, put some forage inside, and see how much gas it produces. Only the plant varieties that produce little methane — and meet other requirements related to things like nutrition and drought tolerance —&nbsp;will then be fed to sheep. They will be put into the chambers, at which point their burps and farts and feces will be measured.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The researchers may also eventually put cattle in the chambers as a final test, said Arango, a senior scientist at the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/3-Anny-Yedra.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Saplings of a legume called Asian pigeonwings. | Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" data-portal-copyright=\"Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/5-Anny-Yedra.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A forage legume. | Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" data-portal-copyright=\"Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lab testing is now underway, and several forage varieties already show promise, Arango said. Most of those are legumes, such as <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-024-01046-y\">Leucaena diversifolia</a>,&nbsp;a plant species with feather-like leaves and flowers that look like spiky balls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are many reasons why certain plants might produce less methane. Some legumes, for example, are high in compounds called condensed tannins. Tannins, which are also found in things like wine, giving reds their astringent taste, can suppress microbes that produce methane in the guts of a cow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Burp detectors against climate change</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without addressing emissions from the food sector, it’s impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C,&nbsp;beyond which climate change will be catastrophic. Lowering meat (and especially beef) consumption is probably the most important part of that effort, but it’s an uphill battle as meat consumption is <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/09e88a46-b005-4d65-8753-9714506afc38/content#:~:text=Growth%20in%20global%20consumption%20of,by%20income%20and%20population%20growth.\">projected to rise</a> globally over the next few years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes identifying better forage a promising tool in at least moderating the climate impact of all that carnivory, said <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/richard-waite\">Richard Waite</a>, director of agriculture initiatives at the World Resources Institute, a research group. A <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171756/\">review published in 2022</a> found that various changes to the diets of farm animals, such as giving them tannin-rich foods, can cut the methane they produce every day by an average of more than 20 percent, without reducing how much milk or meat they yield.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">High-tech approaches to reduce methane from farm animals, from methane-lowering feed <a href=\"https://drawdown.org/insights/are-livestock-feed-additives-the-future-or-folly\">supplements</a> to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/05/10/arkeabio-cow-emissions-bill-gates\">vaccines</a>, are already under development. It’s not yet clear, however, whether enough farmers, many of whom are in developing nations, will want to adopt these approaches or be able to pay for them.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/MG_3938.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A sheep peers from inside the chamber. | Juan Pablo Marín/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" data-portal-copyright=\"Juan Pablo Marín/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The advantage of the new CIAT project is that it’s simple and useful for farmers in poorer parts of the world, where beef consumption is growing quickly. The idea, Arango said, is to identify a range of forages that will all help lower methane emissions if farmers plant them in their cattle pastures. It’s also a way to add plant diversity to the pasture landscape, which comes with other benefits, such as more habitat for wildlife.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, while measuring how much gas a sheep passes may sound like a joke, this is serious science, said Waite, of the World Resources Institute. “It’s funny because it’s burps and farts&nbsp;— mostly burps —&nbsp;but it’s really important,” Waite said. “It’s a big chunk of emissions. So anything we can do to reduce those emissions while feeding more people is going to be really helpful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Kenny Torrella contributed reporting.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But President-elect Donald Trump and his inner circle are hoping to add a new power to the repertoire, one which would constitute one of the largest expansions of presidential power in modern history: impoundment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their theory is that the president has a constitutional authority to withhold, or “impound,” spending from projects after that spending has already been authorized by Congress. Advocates <a href=\"https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/\">cite examples</a> of past presidents impounding various programs until Congress shut down the practice with 1974’s <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/095406\">Impoundment Control Act</a>, which Trump allies view as an unconstitutional law and a congressional power grab.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump himself attempted to use impoundment and related powers several times during his first term, most famously to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/30/20883584/trump-impeachment-whistleblower-ukraine\">delay paying aid to Ukraine</a> in an attempt to force a prosecution of Joe Biden’s family in that country; this act directly led to Trump’s first impeachment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s second term, though, could see a much more extensive use of the power. His nominee to run the Office on Management and Budget, Russ Vought, was on the frontlines <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2021/01/19/trump-budget-office-slams-1974-impoundment-law-on-way-out/\">fighting for broad impoundment power in the first term</a>, and has sought sweeping cuts to programs like <a href=\"https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2023/02/27/center-for-renewing-america-budget-plan-would-cut-federal-medicaid-spending-by-one-third-repeal-affordable-care-acts-coverage-expansions/\">Medicaid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/house-republicans-proposals-could-take-food-away-from-millions-of-low\">food stamps</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If, as is likely, Congress <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/383186/trump-vance-medicaid-food-stamps-obamacare-poverty\">resists these cuts</a>, Trump and Vought, as well as their flashy spending-cut consultants <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/384904/trumps-department-of-government-efficiency-sounds-like-a-joke-it-isnt\">Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy</a>, could attempt to use impoundment power anyway, sending the fight into courts. There are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_v._City_of_New_York\">multiple</a> Supreme Court <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York\">decisions</a> suggesting such an attempt would be illegal and unconstitutional — but today we have a court where Trump himself appointed a third of the members, and which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">recently granted</a> him sweeping immunity from prosecution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the Court sides with Trump in such a fight, it could set the precedent that presidents can effectively cut spending without Congress, which could have vast, far-reaching implications for everything from health care to defense to science.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here is what impoundment power is, how it has historically worked, how Trump’s team wants it to work, and why Trump’s view of the power could set the stage for a massive executive power grab, altering fundamentally the relationship between Congress and the president.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impoundment, explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The official definition of “impoundment,” per the <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf#page=65\">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) that oversees the practice, is “any action or inaction by an officer or employee of the federal government that precludes obligation or expenditure of budget authority.” In other words: any time someone in the federal government doesn’t spend money that Congress has ordered it to spend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This takes two forms: <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf#page=89\">rescission</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf#page=47\">deferral</a>. In rescission, the spending is simply canceled, while in deferral it is withheld temporarily, in theory to be spent in the future. Under the Impoundment Control Act, passed in 1974, both rescissions and deferrals can be passed by Congress at any time, and they can also be requested by the president. But any presidential requests have to be approved by Congress to take effect, and that has happened quite rarely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From fiscal year 1974, when these provisions took effect, and 2018, the last year when a president invoked this provision, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pbaf.12372#page=5\">presidents have proposed $92 billion in rescissions</a>, of which only $25 billion were approved by Congress. To put that in context, combined federal spending from 1974 to 2018 was <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#2\">about $83.6 trillion</a>, and approved presidentially suggested rescissions amount to 0.07 percent of that. No Impoundment Control Act rescission has been approved since 2000, and George W. Bush and Barack Obama did not so much as propose any. The act is just not a very important part of the budget process, typically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The GAO has also recognized a practice called “programmatic delay,” which it views as not technically impoundment but which is closely related. Programmatic delays occur when the government is trying to spend money Congress has instructed it to spend, but factors outside their control preclude this. The GAO has <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/ogc-94-17.pdf#page=4\">offered as an example</a> a program in which the government is supposed to provide a certain amount of money in loans, but where there are few applicants so the program simply cannot lend out the total amount Congress has set aside for this purpose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another more recent example was Biden’s executive order upon taking office instructing a pause in the construction of border walls and fences with Mexico. While Congress had appropriated money specifically for border barriers, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/b-333110-0\">the GAO ruled that the Biden administration was merely “programmatically delaying” the project</a>, because the delays were chalked up to environmental reviews and other hurdles that it was legally required to clear before continuing construction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Programmatic delay does offer the executive branch some flexibility in spending, but only a bit. Otherwise, the Impoundment Control Act is very clear: The president cannot refuse to spend money that Congress has told him to spend. The GAO is empowered to challenge the president if it sees this limitation being contradicted, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564\">as it did when Trump withheld funds</a> from Ukraine in 2019. In that case, the funds were eventually <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/09/12/white-house-releases-250-million-in-ukraine-military-aid/\">released</a> and the incident led to Trump’s impeachment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The history of impoundment and impoundment control</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you read enough about impoundment, you&#8217;re going to hear about the gunboats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1803, Congress had appropriated $50,000 (about <a href=\"https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1803?amount=50000\">$1.4 million</a> in today’s dollars) for some gunboats on the Mississippi River, <a href=\"https://www.americanheritage.com/impoundment\">provoked by France&#8217;s refusal to offer the US access to the Port of New Orleans</a> at the end of 1802. President Thomas Jefferson declined to purchase the gunboats, however, because he had enlisted Secretary of State James Madison to negotiate with Napoleon in secret with another goal in mind: simply buying all of France’s North American territories. In July 1803, the Louisiana Purchase was announced, rendering the gunboats unnecessary. All in all, it was a much better deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In October, <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/third-annual-message\">Jefferson explained the decision</a> in his State of the Union message to Congress, telling representatives that, “The favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the Mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary.” The historian <a href=\"https://www.americanheritage.com/impoundment\">Allan Damon notes</a> that this was technically a deferral, not an impoundment, because Jefferson wound up buying the gunboats in 1804, as part of his more general efforts to build out the embryonic Navy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To advocates of impoundment — most notably Mark Paoletta, who served as general counsel for the Office on Management and Budget in Trump&#8217;s first term and has written extensively in defense of a broad impoundment power — this kind of history proves that impoundment is as American as apple pie. In a <a href=\"https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/\">detailed report</a> with co-authors Daniel Shapiro and Brandon Stras, Paoletta observes, “The Jeffersonians recognized that Congress’s power of the purse was a power to set a ceiling on appropriations. The power of the purse did nothing to encroach the Executive’s inherent discretion to spend less than the amount appropriated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Critics with a more mainstream view of the issue think this wildly misunderstands the history. <a href=\"https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/the-president-has-no-constitutional-power-of-impoundment-by-zachary-s-price/\">Zachary Price, a professor at UC Law San Francisco</a>, notes that the underlying statute appropriating the $50,000 for the gunboats &#8220;authorized expenditure without requiring it.&#8221; The text of the law &#8220;authorized and empowered&#8221; Jefferson to order the construction of &#8220;a number not exceeding fifteen gun boats&#8221; with &#8220;a sum not exceeding fifty thousand dollars.&#8221; Through that wording, Congress was giving the president the discretion to spend as much as $50,000 on the boats, but also the discretion to decline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More to the point, Congress and the president for most of the 19th and 20th centuries operated with a shared understanding that spending bills offered this kind of flexibility. &#8220;Both Congress and the executive branch …&nbsp;seem to have followed a default understanding that appropriations statutes conferred implicit authority to forego spending when it proved unnecessary or when statutory goals could be accomplished with a smaller expenditure,” Price writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most historical impoundments, according to Georgetown law professor Eloise Pasachoff, were also for efficiency rather than policy reasons: if Congress, say, instructed the government to build a bridge for $100 million, and the bridge wound up only costing $90 million, the president might decline to spend $10 million because he could accomplish the same goal at a lower cost. “If you look at these examples that they’re bringing out, they mostly fall in the category of ‘Congress has appropriated money for something but it turns out we don’t need the full extent of that money,’” Pasachoff told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So you can certainly find examples from Jefferson to LBJ of presidents declining to spend money that had been authorized. Paoletta sees this as evidence that the president has a broad power to impound funds. Price and Pasachoff see it as evidence that Congress intended this flexibility: Impoundment was a power that Congress granted to the president in specific, limited contexts, but not an inherent power of the president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This governing order, of Congress allowing impoundments on the understanding that the president would use the power responsibly, broke down in the 1970s under the Nixon administration. Both the Senate and House were solidly Democratic for Richard Nixon’s entire presidency, and he sought to use impoundment as a means of influencing spending without needing their approval. His <a href=\"https://goodauthority.org/news/good-to-know-what-is-impoundment/\">attempts were far more sweeping than previous presidents</a>, including gambits like an effort to outright eliminate the Office of Economic Opportunity, a key agency of LBJ&#8217;s war on poverty, and simply refusing to spend money on anti-water pollution efforts even after Congress had appropriated money for the effort over his veto. He declared that this was an <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-86\">absolute Constitutional power of the presidency</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He was more or less alone in that. In 1969, Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist (who two years later would be appointed to the Supreme Court and 15 years after that become chief justice) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/147706/dl?inline=\">wrote a memo</a> concluding that there is no constitutional right to impoundment. This was a very conservative Nixon official, one who Nixon would himself promote to the highest court in the land a few years later, concluding that the constitutional argument was bunk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1975, after Nixon had already resigned in disgrace, the water pollution case made its way to the Supreme Court, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_v._City_of_New_York\">ruled unanimously that Nixon&#8217;s Environmental Protection Agency had illegally withheld the funds</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1974, Congress sought to clarify matters by passing the Impoundment Control Act as part of a legislative package that also set up the modern budget process and created the Congressional Budget Office. The law did not so much make impoundment illegal as it clarified that impoundment, when not explicitly authorized by Congress in spending laws, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/faqs-on-impoundment-presidential-actions-are-constrained-by-long-standing\">was always illegal</a>, and set up a process through which presidents could seek to roll back spending in an orderly way, but only with Congress’s participation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s not like the Impoundment Control Act took away the legal ability of the president to do that,” <a href=\"https://spp.umd.edu/our-community/faculty-staff/philip-joyce\">Philip Joyce</a>, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and an expert on the budget process, told me. “The courts had already found there was no legal authority for the president to impound funds.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can Trump actually do this?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, in his first term, sought to bring back impoundment power to a degree not seen since Nixon. In 2018, he <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2018/06/25/from-a-scream-to-a-whisper-rescissions-push-goes-dark/\">sought $15.2 billion in rescissions</a>, the bulk coming from the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, which supports state programs to insure children, usually through Medicaid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The House first shaved half a billion off the cuts before narrowly passing them, then two Senate Republicans (Richard Burr and Susan Collins) voted against the package, enough to doom it given the Republicans’ narrow majority in the Senate. Despite that setback, his team kept repeatedly considering rescission packages, especially against <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/trump-administration-resurrects-rescission-proposal-in-latest-attack-on-us-aid-spending-95437\">foreign aid</a>, only to back down under pressure from Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most infamous invocation of this power came in 2019, when the Office on Management and Budget sought unilaterally to delay aid to Ukraine, without asking Congress. The GAO eventually ruled that while <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564.1\">the non-military aid delay was legal</a> (it was a &#8220;programmatic delay&#8221; necessitated by circumstances), withholding <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564\">$214 million in military assistance</a> was not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later in 2019, the public learned that Trump had, in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stated, &#8220;I would like you to do us a favor&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/25/20883420/full-transcript-trump-ukraine-zelensky-white-house\">in exchange for the aid</a>, specifically investigating the Biden family for corruption as well as a conspiracy theory that a Ukrainian, not Russia, hacked Democrats in 2016. The revelation that the aid was withheld specifically in a move to leverage a foreign nation into attacking a political opponent led to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained\">Trump’s first impeachment</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while Trump’s rescissions became a background detail to a broader scandal, his team continued to insist upon the power. As Trump was leaving office, Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought and his general counsel Mark Paoletta <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2021/01/19/trump-budget-office-slams-1974-impoundment-law-on-way-out/\">wrote a letter</a> to the House Budget Committee <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Response-to-House-Budget-Committee-Investigation.pdf\">arguing</a> that the Impoundment Control Act &#8220;should be significantly reformed or repealed.&#8221; They <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/14/trump-billions-cut-covid-vaccine-distributor-459496\">sent a final rescission package to Congress</a> in January 2021, despite knowing it was dead in the water, underlining their seriousness about the procedure. Vought and Paoletta have since gone further and now argue that the Impoundment Control Act and its limits on impoundment powers are not just unwise, but unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The least dramatic way that Trump could use impoundment is by submitting rescission packages to Congress and watching them be approved, by a simple majority vote of each house. Rescission packages cannot be filibustered, so in principle the narrow Republican majority in the House and Senate could simply rubber-stamp the measures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The power becomes truly interesting, however, if Trump insists upon cuts that Congress will <em>not</em> approve. One could imagine a repeat of the 2017 fight to repeal Obamacare, except, when enough Republicans defect to doom the effort in Congress, Trump and Vought opt to simply impound funds for the Medicaid expansion and Affordable Care Act premium subsidies unilaterally. This would inevitably provoke a legal challenge that could make its way to the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a fool’s errand to predict what the Court would say on the matter, but we know a few things. Court precedent is solidly against a presidential impoundment power. In 1838, the Court ruled in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/37/524/\"><em>Kendall v. United States ex Rel. Stokes</em></a> that the executive branch could not fail to pay a debt that Congress had instructed it to pay, writing, &#8220;that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, and entirely inadmissible.” <a href=\"https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/\">Paoletta and co-authors</a> argue that because this was not technically an impoundment, it&#8217;s not a binding precedent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the 1975 Supreme Court case on the Nixon EPA dispute, <em>Train v. City of New York</em>, did directly speak to impoundments, and reached the same conclusion. <a href=\"https://americarenewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Presidents-Constitutional-Power-of-Impoundment-1.pdf\">Paoletta counters</a> that the opinion in that case was written narrowly and based on the reading of the statute authorizing the EPA’s spending; it &#8220;does not address the President&#8217;s constitutional impoundment power.&#8221; That feels somewhat unconvincing though; as <a href=\"https://goodauthority.org/news/good-to-know-what-is-impoundment/\">Bowdoin College political scientist Andrew Rudalevige has noted</a>, “presumably, if the president had inherent impoundment authority grounded in the Constitution, statutory language could not have set it aside.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that said, the current court famously set aside a 49-year-old precedent when it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception\">overruled <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>, and a 40-year-old precedent when it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab\">overruled <em>Chevron v. NRDC</em></a>. It could surely overturn <em>Train</em> and <em>Kendall</em> too, should it so desire; it could also assert a presidential impoundment power and massage its ruling such that it does not have to technically overrule those precedents, perhaps by parsing the decisions narrowly the way that Paoletta does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the Court were to agree with the Paoletta argument, we’d be in a whole new world in terms of federal spending. Presidents would suddenly have a significant power to make spending cuts without congressional buy-in. Importantly, the power would be asymmetrical, tilted toward slashing programs versus building them. President Bernie Sanders could not use this power to set up a Medicare-for-All program, but a Republican president could use it to end Medicare outright.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such a world feels so fantastical from the standpoint of the last half-century of budget battles that to imagine it almost feels like playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. But Trump has assembled a team dedicated to bringing us into such a world, and it may encroach upon our reality sooner than we expect.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Save up to donate later? Put it in your will? | Javier Zarracina/Vox; Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>December 3 is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/26/18098840/when-is-giving-tuesday\">Giving Tuesday</a>, the day for donations and a national conversation about how to give back and do good. Especially in a turbulent year when many of us want to give back, but also want to be cautious with our budgets, here’s one important question: If you want to donate to charity, should you go out and pick an organization today? Or should you wait, save your money, and leave it to charity in your will (or at least donate it down the road)?</p>\n\n<p>There’s a case for either of these approaches. To some extent, the answer depends on what you think the highest priorities for donation are — and whether you think you’ll be a more informed donor later in your life.</p>\n\n<p>On the whole, though, <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/\">close observers</a> of the <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/yearly-donations-and-why-you-should-give-now-not-later-cba890cabfbe\">nonprofit world</a> tend to think that donating your money now is likely to achieve more good in the world than saving it up to donate after you die. That’s because donations now can, in some senses, make the donor better at doing good, and because history suggests that many of the best giving opportunities out there aren’t going to be around in 10 years — let alone in 50.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It might be best to give when there’s “low-hanging fruit”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s some reason to think that your money will go further if you give it now than if you give it later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The case here is a little complicated. In a field like global health, we know about lots of interventions that are valuable. As more money pours into supporting an important intervention, it will probably spread widely — especially wherever the conditions are ripe for it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Vox guide to giving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving —&nbsp;from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving\">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<p>For example, an innovation that improves traffic safety will probably first spread in the rich countries that can afford it, so that after a few years, the places lacking it will be ones where it’s complicated to deploy. A new surgery that prevents a health problem will probably first be offered in places with good medical care, to patients whose conditions don’t have added complications. Once those patients have been treated, handling the remaining cases will be <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/surgery-to-repair-obstetric-fistula#rfmf\">more expensive</a>. That means that money given now will go further than money given later, once we’ve already solved the problems that can be solved cheaply.</p>\n\n<p>So for any given organization — whether it’s treating <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/surgery-to-repair-obstetric-fistula#rfmf\">fistulas from childbirth</a> or <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/Schistosomiasis-Control-Initiative\">deworming kids</a> — we might expect donations to be most needed fairly early on, when there are a lot of problems that can be solved easily, and to go further than they will later, when most of the problems that remain are ones that are harder to solve. Donors will have found the “low-hanging fruit” in a cause.</p>\n\n<p>How seriously to take this argument depends on which cause you think is the most promising. In 2018, I asked Julia Wise, who was the<strong> </strong>president of <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> at the time, for advice. “If you want to work on global health and development,” Wise told me, “the best opportunities are now.” There are already lots of organizations providing health services, and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272929/global-poverty-health-crime-literacy-good-news\">problems they’re working on are mostly improving</a>, so money now will probably go further than it will in five years.</p>\n\n<p>“For causes that we know less about, where our understanding is more in its beginnings,” Wise thinks there’s a case for waiting. In a few years, we might discover a new giving opportunity that’s better than any of the existing ones. On the other hand, “in these areas where the evidence is thin, the right thing to do is fund research. If we’re all waiting for somebody else to fund things so we could find out what works, then we could be waiting for a long time.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Giving now can allow charities to develop better programs — creating better options sooner</h2>\n\n<p>Giving What We Can encourages people to give every year — though some participants give to a donor-advised fund, an account that you control and from which you can choose a charity to give to later.</p>\n\n<p>Wise pointed out that one of the most important effects your donation has is encouraging a charity that is running programs you believe in, helping them expand those programs and invest more energy there. If you’re strategic about donating to charities that are running trials of promising new programs and learning through their research how to best get results, then your donations can actually change which giving opportunities are available in the future.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve been really encouraged to see evidence-based charity growing as people are supporting it with their donations,” Wise said. “We see that as improving the charitable landscape and making it so charities have an incentive to continue conducting and participating in research about their work, so everyone can know the best places to donate.”</p>\n\n<p>This incentive effect works much better with living, active, engaged donors. Charities will respond to donations this year by thinking about what work they need to do to still be a good target for donations next year. “If we delay,” Wise said, “we’re not participating in improving the state of knowledge.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Giving now might help you commit to a generous life</h2>\n\n<p>“My husband and I have decided to donate now rather than waiting until later,” Wise told me. “Part of that is thinking that works best with our motivation. It makes it a steady part of our life rather than part of the indefinite future.” Telling yourself you’ll donate someday in the distant future isn’t the same as donating every day.</p>\n\n<p>People who’ve taken Giving What We Can’s <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\">pledge</a> often describe the same motivation. “Giving now cultivates your own virtue, and ensures that you’ll continue to live up to your own ideals,” Haseeb Qureshi <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/yearly-donations-and-why-you-should-give-now-not-later-cba890cabfbe\">wrote in an essay about this question</a>. “You are not a perfect creature. Even if you intend to do something hard now … you always have to factor in the possibility that you’ll change your mind or regress.” The best way to be someone who will <em>want</em> to give away money in your will, then, is to give money now.</p>\n\n<p>Wise also thought habits were important, so much so that she recommended people donate a little bit of money even if they’re early in life and building their limited savings. “It can be good to donate on a regular basis so you’re still making decisions about where to give and keeping it a part of your life,” she told me.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Giving later might help you be a more informed donor</h2>\n\n<p>But there are good reasons to consider delaying your donation. Some charities are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/12/1/9826838/best-charities-donate-2018-giving\">vastly more effective than others</a>. Some highly effective charities are so <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/4/24/15377056/big-charities-best-charities-evaluation-nonprofit\">flooded with money</a> that they don’t use additional donations to expand their programs — meaning that your money won’t achieve much.</p>\n\n<p>That variance in effectiveness is a reason why you might want to give later instead of giving today. If you don’t know much about the opportunities out there, it’s not a good idea to pick a charity haphazardly without a clear understanding of what it will do with your money and why it’s competent to do it. A few thousand dollars to charity can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/18/17984040/bednets-tools-fight-mosquitoes-malaria-myths-fishing\">save a life</a>. It should be treated as seriously as any other decision that could save a life.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to commit to giving now, but you don’t feel equipped yet to make an informed choice about where to give, one option is a donor-advised fund. You make the donation now (and take the tax deduction now) but can choose any qualified charity to donate the money to later. Donor-advised funds are one way to set aside the money for charity while giving yourself more time to learn.</p>\n\n<p>But this is probably a reason to wait five years, not 40. You’d have to do a lot of ongoing research to keep your will up to date with the giving opportunity you’ve found the most promising — and once you’re doing all of that work and have identified the best giving opportunity out there, it’s probably worth just giving to it.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, December 2024: </strong>This story was originally published in 2020 and has been updated for 2024.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He was charged with “spreading deliberately false information,” Kremlin-speak for criticizing the war in Ukraine. A year later, he was <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/04/anti-war-political-activist-and-prisoner-of-conscience-vladimir-kara-murza-sentenced-to-25-in-jail/\">sentenced to 25 years in prison</a> before later being transferred to a remote Siberian penal colony where <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-dissident-kara-murza-transferred-punishment-cell-new-prison-media-cites-2024-01-30/\">he was held in an isolation cell</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kara-Murza, who had already survived two earlier poisonings that had been <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/02/11/vladimir-kara-murza-tailed-by-members-of-fsb-squad-prior-to-suspected-poisonings/\">linked</a> to Russia’s security services, continued writing in prison, including regular columns for the Washington Post, for which he was awarded the <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/vladimir-kara-murza-contributor-washington-post\">Pulitzer Prize for commentary</a>. He expected to die in prison, as his fellow dissident Alexei Navalny did earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, in August of 2024, Kara-Murza —  a dual Russian-British citizen — found himself suddenly released and expelled from Russia as part of the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/world/who-are-detainees-russia-us-prisoner-swap-intl/index.html\">massive international prisoner</a> exchange that also freed the American journalist Evan Gershkovich. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last week, Kara-Murza sat down with Vox for an extended interview on the sidelines of the <a href=\"https://halifaxtheforum.org/\">Halifax International Security Forum</a>, where he had just received the event’s John McCain Prize for Leadership. (The award was particularly meaningful for Kara-Murza, who was a friend of the late Arizona senator and a pallbearer at his funeral.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an interview with Vox, which has been edited for length and clarity, Kara-Murza talked about the “surreal” experience of sudden freedom, the lessons of history for the war in Ukraine, and why Putin’s regime might not be as stable as it seems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>When this conference was happening a year ago, you were still in prison. Is the experience of being out still strange for you?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is completely surreal. For the last three months, I’ve felt as if I&#8217;m watching some kind of a film. Frankly, it&#8217;s a very good film, but it does not feel real. I was absolutely convinced that I was going to die in that Siberian prison. And what happened on August 1, I can only describe it as a miracle, because the last time that there was an international prisoner exchange that actually freed <em>Russian</em> political prisoners — not just Western citizens held in Russian jails, but Russian political prisoners — was in October 1986. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was a miracle, but in many ways, a human-made miracle, because this exchange was made possible by the relentless efforts of so many good people in democratic nations who never stopped advocating and speaking and shouting about this growing crisis with political prisoners in Russia. We have more political prisoners in Russia today than there were in the whole of the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s. This is the situation in Russia under Putin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so yes, it still feels totally surreal. I haven&#8217;t really had any transition. That&#8217;s another problem. I went from solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in Siberia to being in four or five different countries every week. And that&#8217;s not really the way it should be done after the prison experience, but I just feel I have no choice. Because, you know, while people are prepared to listen, I have to speak, because I do feel that responsibility now that I&#8217;ve been rescued from that hell.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Given what’s happened to a number of prominent critics of the Russian government abroad, do you still feel like there’s some threat to your safety, even outside of Russia?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When our plane was landing in Ankara on the day of the exchange, one of the FSB [Russia’s state security service] officers who was accompanying us turned to Ilya Yashin [another Russian opposition activist freed as part of the exchange] and to me, and said, “Don&#8217;t think that you guys will be safe over there. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Krasikov\">Krasikov</a> can come for you too.” [Vadim Krasikov is the Russian security service hitman, released as part of the prisoner exchange, who had been serving a life sentence in Germany for the assassination of a former Chechen rebel in Berlin.] He didn’t mean literally Krasikov, of course. They have a whole desk of Krasikovs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ve been in Russian opposition politics for 25 years. We all know what can happen to people who publicly oppose the Putin regime. My closest friend, my mentor, the godfather to my younger daughter, Boris Nemtsov [the former Russian Deputy Prime Minister turned opposition leader, killed in 2015], was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31669061\">gunned down, literally in front of the Kremlin</a>, on Putin&#8217;s direct orders. Other people have been poisoned, including myself, and we know that these attacks have happened not just on Russian soil, but abroad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so look, we all know the risks. We all know what it involves, but frankly, I just don&#8217;t think about it, because, well, I don&#8217;t want to become paranoid, and it&#8217;s not possible just to live every day with that thought in your mind. I know that what I&#8217;m doing is the right thing to do, and I&#8217;m going to carry on anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what&#8217;s even more important is that I&#8217;m not just a politician. I&#8217;m a historian by education. And we know that the arc of history may not bend as fast as we&#8217;d like, but it does bend towards liberty, and we know that the future belongs to democracies and not to one-man, personalistic, archaic dictatorships, like the dictatorship led by Putin. And so the bottom line is, even if Vladimir Putin gets rid of all of us who are the current leaders, the current faces of the Russian opposition, all it means is that others will come in our place.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1231428118.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Kara-Murza laying flowers on a bridge.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Looking at the </strong><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-losses-putin-1988034\"><strong>number of Russian casualties</strong></a><strong> that are coming back from Ukraine, why doesn’t this seem to have more of an impact on Russian society? And how long can this situation be sustainable for the Russian government? </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We do not know whether or not it is having an impact, because it&#8217;s not possible to objectively assess the state of public opinion in a country that imprisons you for expressing it. And that&#8217;s the problem with authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. They seem stable and strong and secure, and then suddenly they collapse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“That’s the problem with authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. They seem stable and strong and secure, and then suddenly they collapse. ”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both the czarist regime and the communist regime in Russia went down in a matter of days, literally, and nobody saw it coming. There&#8217;s a book by the Berkeley anthropologist Alexei Yurchak about the later years of the Soviet Union — I have not read it because it came out while I was in prison, but I love the title: <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691121178/everything-was-forever-until-it-was-no-more?srsltid=AfmBOopj6_1RyQawtvpnnpDWPVDVzYTd1MJO8OKTcUES1ppbqPBZxU7R\"><em>Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More</em></a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And this is exactly how it happened in Russia, and this is exactly how it&#8217;s going to happen next time. In these repressive, tyrannical regimes, you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening beneath the surface. [Czech dissident and later President] Václav Havel writes about this in <a href=\"https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23\"><em>The Power of the Powerless</em></a>, that there may be problems developing for the regime, but nobody&#8217;s aware of them until they come out of the open and suddenly everything collapses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the honest answer is, we don&#8217;t know what the real impact of the war is on Russian society. What we do know for certain is that there are a lot of people in Russia who are against this war. We don’t know it from opinion polls. Those are useless. But you have to look at what I call little glimpses of reality. One of the most vivid ones came in February in the middle of our so-called presidential election campaign, which you’ll remember was just Putin and a couple of handpicked clowns. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there was one guy, a lawyer and former member of parliament named Boris Nadezhdin, who announced that he was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/27/world/europe/russia-putin-election-boris-nadezhdin.html\">running as a presidential candidate on an anti-war platform</a>. And the public response in Russia was just unbelievable. All across the country, in large cities and small towns, you had these long, massive, hours-long lines of people who were waiting at his campaign headquarters to sign petitions to get him on the ballot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And of course, he was not allowed to. He was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/europe/russia-nadezhdin-election-candidate-disqualified-intl/index.html\">barred from running</a> as an opposition candidate in Putin’s Russia. But that was almost beside the point, because suddenly everyone saw through this lie pushed by Putin&#8217;s propaganda that everybody in Russia backs this regime, that everybody in Russia supports this war. You can fake election results. You can rig the opinion poll numbers, but you cannot hide the sight of hundreds of thousands of people all over the country literally voting with their feet for the anti-war candidate. And I got a lot of letters in prison, and in February, almost all my letters were about these lines all over the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;ll never forget, there was one woman, one young woman, who wrote to me from Novorossiysk, which is a town on the Black Sea coast in the south of Russia. And she was describing how she waited in that long, long line of like-minded, mostly young people, to sign [Nadezhdin’s] ballot access petition. And then she wrote, “I never realized how many of us there are.” It&#8217;s these glimpses of reality that really matter for sort of trying to assess what the actual situation is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>But do you think the government is really feeling insecure? It’s certainly not reflected in the economic numbers, </strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68823399\"><strong>which show Russia is still rapidly growing</strong></a><strong>. Last month, we saw Putin host half a dozen world leaders at the BRICS summit in Kazan. This doesn’t seem like an isolated leader who’s feeling the pressure.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a lot of pressure. The economists tell us that this sort of formal growth that the Russian statistics are producing is all, in a major sense, artificial. This is all just fueled by the war machine. And as soon as this is over, economists are forecasting some very hard times ahead, because this is not a real economy. This is not a consumer economy or a free-market economy in the full sense of this term. Everything is geared towards the military-industrial machinery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And in terms of how the regime is feeling, I would say that the best way to gauge that is to actually look at their own behavior. Because you know, on the one hand, that propaganda says that, you know, Putin is very popular, his regime is stable and secure. But to me, actions are always more important than words. If that were really the case, why would they need to arrest somebody for a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/europe/russian-teen-social-media-ukraine-war-intl-cmd/index.html\">social media post</a> and send them for seven years to prison? Why would they be so afraid of allowing, for example, that anti-war candidate on the ballot, if that position is as unpopular as they claim? Why not just let him on the ballot and let him get his 1 percent?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>When this war ends, what do you think it will take to repair the anger and distrust between Russian and Ukrainian societies?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First of all, I can tell you that I&#8217;ve had very good contacts, very good dialogue with my Ukrainian friends and colleagues over these last few months that I&#8217;ve been out of prison. I also got letters from Ukrainians while I was in prison. So you know, let&#8217;s not also pretend that it&#8217;s total. Reasonable people can distinguish between a dictatorial regime and its society, and they don&#8217;t blame all 140 million Russians. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But of course, there is a lot of pain, there is a lot of grief, there&#8217;s a lot of emotion on the Ukrainian side, and it could not have been otherwise when every day people are hearing bombs falling on their towns, and every day children are dying and civilians are dying.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not only do I totally understand this — this is why I could not stay silent in the first place. Russians will have a very long and very difficult road ahead of us once this is all over and once, of course, there&#8217;s a different political situation in Russia. It will be a long and difficult path to reconciliation, to finding a way to speak to each other again, to look into each other&#8217;s eyes again. It&#8217;s going to be long, it&#8217;s going to be difficult, but I fully believe that it&#8217;s going to be possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And what gives me this hope is, again, my background is as a historian, because we know that this has happened in history before. Just a couple of months ago in September, I was in Strasbourg in France for the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. They invited me to give a speech at the plenary session. The easiest way to get to Strasbourg is to fly to Frankfurt and just get a rental car and drive for a couple of hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m a historian. I know what Alsace-Lorraine [a much fought-over border region, now part of France] is. I know how much blood was spilled over that piece of land between the Germans and the French. I know how many thousands of people are buried in that land because they fought over it in the Franco-Prussian War, in the First World War, in the Second World War. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It must have seemed like this hatred would be eternal, that it would never be possible to overcome it. But when I was driving from Frankfurt to Strasbourg, I wasn&#8217;t even sure if I was still in Germany or already in France, because there&#8217;s an open border. There&#8217;s a single currency. People are living in peace and friendship with each other, even when there are still people alive today who fought in the Second World War. So this all happened within the life of a single generation. The French and the Germans were able to find that way to reconcile, and I have no doubt, Russians and Ukrainians will.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You’ve referred to your training as a historian. Are there moments from history that you think can help us better understand this current moment we’re in, both the war and the political situation in Russia?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So first, I&#8217;ll answer the negative side of your question, and this links to your question about the next US administration and this talk we hear about possibly <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/11/can-trump-do-deal-putin-ukraine\">cutting a deal with Putin </a>over Ukraine. I think one lesson from history that we must never forget is that the appeasement of dictators never brings peace. It always leads to more aggression, more suffering, more wars, because dictators do not see compromise as an invitation to compromise back. They see it as a sign of weakness, and they become more aggressive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We know this from the history of the 1930s. We know this also from the history of the past 25 years of Western dealings with Putin because for a lot of that time, Western leaders on both sides of the Atlantic basically engaged in the policy of appeasement, and this is where it led us. And so I think that it&#8217;s very important that whatever agreement, whatever settlement is made to to end this war, that settlement has to take into account the interests of Ukraine, and that settlement cannot be done in such a way as to allow Vladimir Putin to present himself as being the victor, who&#8217;s being triumphant, because if that happens, that would be a disaster for everybody.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the more positive side, I mentioned how quickly political changes happen in Russia. I remember 1991. I was 10 at the time, I was a child, but you know, when the revolution is happening in front of your eyes, it&#8217;s not something you can forget. And I remember those days in Moscow — the very smell of the air, the freedom. And to me, this was, in many ways, a life-defining lesson of those three days in August of democratic revolution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because, as you know, of course, that began as an attempted hardline coup d&#8217;état led by the leadership of the Soviet Communist part of the KGB, the military. And it seemed that everything was on the side of those coup plotters, right? They had everything to themselves. They had the whole machinery, the whole apparatus of the Soviet state. They had the whole propaganda apparatus. They had the police, the military, and of course, they had the KGB, the world&#8217;s most powerful machine of repression. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the people who opposed that coup, who wanted to stand up for Russian democracy, they were not armed with anything except their dignity and their determination to defend their own freedom, but they went into the streets in hundreds of thousands — my dad was among those people — and they literally stood there on the streets of Moscow in front of the tanks, and then the tanks stopped and turned away. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lesson here is that however strong, however stable, however secure a dictatorial regime may seem, if enough people are willing to stand up to it, they succeed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Russia can change unexpectedly, and we have to be ready for it.” </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Russia can change unexpectedly, and we have to be ready for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How can we get ready for it?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What happened in the 1990s was that the Soviet system collapsed so suddenly that people were not prepared, and people made mistakes, both on the Russian domestic side and on the international side. And we have to learn from those mistakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the domestic side, we know that any country that wants to overcome the trauma of totalitarianism and successfully transition to democracy has to undergo some sort of a process of public reckoning, a public reflection of the crimes that are being committed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We saw this in South Africa after apartheid. We saw this in Argentina after its military dictatorship. We saw this in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of communism. Of course, we saw this in Germany after ’45, and then again, after ’89 in the eastern parts. This is a process where society is made aware of all the horrendous crimes that have been committed in its name by the previous regime. So the archives are opened and these crimes are made public. The people responsible for these crimes are made accountable. The institutions that have been committing these crimes, like the secret services, are dismantled, and so on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this happened in Russia in the ’90s. And we know that when evil is not publicly reflected on and publicly condemned, it’s going to come back. And this is exactly what we saw with a former KGB officer coming to power in Russia. We must never make this mistake again. So this is our homework for the Russian opposition, for the Russian democratic forces. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there&#8217;s also an important international aspect, and that is that, you know, for many of the countries of the former Eastern Bloc, the former Warsaw Pact in the 1990s, the promise of Euro-Atlantic integration, served as the most powerful incentive to successfully complete their reforms. When Václav Havel <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/02/22/text-of-havels-speech-to-congress/df98e177-778e-4c26-bd96-980089c4fcb2/\">addressed the US Congress </a>in February of 1990, he termed the entire process of post-communist transformation in Czechoslovakia as, I quote, “returning to Europe.”And that light at the end of the tunnel is very important for these countries to continue their reforms and successfully complete them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Russia never really got the promise of the 1990s. It was sort of kept to the doorstep. When President Boris Yeltsin in December of 1991 wrote to Manfred Wörner, the then-Secretary General of NATO, for the first time <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/21/world/soviet-disarray-yeltsin-says-russia-seeks-to-join-nato.html\">officially and publicly raising the question of future Russian membership in NATO</a>, he did not even receive a response. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have to be ready the next time this happens, because what happens in Russia affects everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>To go back to the question of Ukrainians and Russians, it seems like what you’re proposing will require the West to take a leap of faith on Russia after the war. Here at this conference, we’ve heard a lot of slogans like “Make Russia Small Again,” and it’s not unusual to hear people talk about Russia needing to be demilitarized or carved up.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this talk that you just referenced, that&#8217;s an amazing gift to Putin&#8217;s propaganda, because all he needs to do is just amplify those voices and tell people, ‘all these people in the West, they’re so Russophobic. They hate all Russians. Their quarrel is not with me, with Putin, they hate all of you. And frankly, it is really damaging, really shortsighted and really counterproductive to hear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>So there’s now been years of discussions, analysis, and legal proceedings regarding the relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. As this new American administration comes in, what do you think are kind of the best- and worst-case scenarios? What are your expectations for how this administration will handle Russia?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think a character trait that we definitely know about Mr. Trump is that he&#8217;s famously unpredictable, so I think that it’s anybody&#8217;s guess what the actual policy will be. To be honest, I was really heartened by the selection of the secretary of state. I&#8217;ve known Senator Marco Rubio for many years. I know he cares about the issues of democracy and human rights, and standing up to dictatorial regimes. He&#8217;s spent a lot of his Senate career on these issues. He has advocated on behalf of political prisoners in Russia, in Belarus, of course, in Venezuela and Cuba.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“I’m an optimist about Russia, and I’m certainly an optimist about the United States.” </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Something that’s very close to my heart: After Boris Nemtsov was assassinated, we launched this international initiative to commemorate him with street designations around the world. And the first city that did this was Washington, DC. And today, if you go to the Russian embassy, you’ll see that it stands on <a href=\"https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Legislation/B22-0646\">Boris Nemtsov Plaza</a>. The original sponsor of the Senate bill that did that was Marco Rubio.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>A lot of Americans are worried now about the future of their own democracy. Polls show that was top of mind for a large number of voters. As someone who’s seen authoritarianism firsthand, do you think it’s reasonable for people in the US or other democracies to be worried about their countries remaining democracies? </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, first of all, I do think it&#8217;s right to never be complacent about this, to never take things for granted. I think it was President Reagan who said that freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. That is unfortunately, absolutely true, and we all have to be vigilant about this. But you know, I&#8217;m an optimist about Russia, and I’m certainly an optimist about the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;ve had two-and-a-half centuries of democratic institutions and democratic traditions. That&#8217;s not going to suddenly be undone because of any single person in the space of four years. So I don&#8217;t share these alarmist sorts of views and predictions. But it&#8217;s right that people are concerned because we always have to stand guard and make sure that we protect these democratic institutions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That same year, Pakistan fell into a <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/pakistan-economic-crisis-how-pakistani-banks-pulled-off-a-usd-2-38-billion-heist-that-still-haunts-the-govt-19481519.htm\">foreign exchange crisis</a> as the country’s dollar reserves plunged, which made everything more expensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this opened an <a href=\"https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/11/04/dealing-with-pakistans-solar-panel-glut/\">opportunity</a> for businesses and better-off Pakistanis to begin importing solar panels from China, which can pay for themselves in as little as <a href=\"https://ieefa.org/resources/future-net-metered-solar-power-pakistan#:~:text=The%20current%20government%20offers%20attractive,to%20lower%20per%20kW%20costs.\">two years</a> and free their users from the expensive, <a href=\"https://aptma.org.pk/seasonal-grid-instability-challenges-in-pakistan-ii/\">unreliable</a> grid. The <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1845916\">middle class</a> has started to do the same. The state has come under pressure to <a href=\"https://ieefa.org/resources/future-net-metered-solar-power-pakistan#:~:text=The%20current%20government%20offers%20attractive,to%20lower%20per%20kW%20costs.\">raise rates</a> for the conventional grid to satisfy its contracts with power producers — which the increasingly shrinking, poorer customer base struggles even more to afford. Consumers who have made the switch to solar panels, like the owner of a factory that makes soccer balls in Sialkot, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69e4cb33-3615-4424-996d-5aee9d1afe19\">told</a> the Financial Times, “Allah has given us this gift to get out of this mess.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s a bigger story here, beyond one nation’s problems with its power grid. What’s happening in Pakistan is the latest sign that energy authorities are underestimating how much clean power the world demands — and that energy models can suffer from the same biases as their makers. Those failures in number-crunching are not merely abstract. Failing to grasp how much energy is wanted, and the things people in places like Pakistan might be willing to do to get it, leaves the world unprepared to build, fund, and plan for a cleaner future.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why our energy demand projections are always wrong</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">History has shown that cheap energy creates its own <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471716/\">demand</a>. When steam engines got more efficient in 19th century Britain, <a href=\"https://energyhistory.yale.edu/w-stanley-jevons-the-coal-question-1865/\">coal consumption</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/energy-efficiency-carbon-emissions-climate-struggles-9b10e037\">grew</a>. When oil got cheap and plentiful after World War II, humans didn’t enjoy the savings. They built more cars. More recently, in 2000, when estimating an industrializing China’s electricity demand for 2005, the Energy Information Administration’s projections were off by <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43861125?seq=34\">25 percent</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Modelers try to project how much energy will be demanded years into the future. But those projects often fail to distinguish between how much energy is needed and how much is <em>wanted</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In part, this is about the particular<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/overview-and-key-findings\"> outperformance</a> of solar, whose growth the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental organization that oversees the global energy sector, has drastically <a href=\"https://x.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1730992987021226002\">underestimated</a> every year <a href=\"https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/11/20/iea-versus-solar-pv-reality/\">since 2006</a> — as have <a href=\"https://x.com/CleanPowerDave/status/1856288117583495332\">countries’ own renewable energy targets</a>. The IEA’s <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\">Net Zero by 2050</a> report, a plan for how to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions by the mid-21st century, was seen as ambitious when it came out in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/climate/climate-change-emissions-IEA.html\">2021</a>. It called for the world to add 630 gigawatts of solar power annually by 2030. This is actually proving a very easy target: The world is already on track to add nearly <a href=\"https://ember-climate.org/insights/in-brief/solar-power-continues-to-surge-in-2024/\">600 gigawatts</a> in 2024 — 334 gigawatts in China, 53 gigawatts in the US, and, stunningly, at least <a href=\"https://www.dertaskforce.com/p/pakistans-distributed-solar-boom\">16 gigawatts</a> in Pakistan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pattern is that Western energy forecasters are continually surprised by how much energy people in developing countries will consume. As countries like Pakistan grow wealthier, their people are going to demand the same energy-dependent conveniences that people in wealthy countries already do —&nbsp;and our energy forecasts must reflect that reality or we’re going to keep getting it wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One recent projection illustrates the problem. Working with Pakistan’s energy authorities, the <a href=\"https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/publication_-_pakistans_power_sector_towards_2045.pdf\">Danish Energy Agency examined in 2023</a> how Pakistan’s electricity sector might develop to align with the IEA’s net-zero-by-2050 pathway. It expected Pakistani electricity generation to reach about 350,000 gigawatt-hours (a unit of energy use over time) in 2045, doubling its 2022 capacity of <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/pakistan/electricity\">173,000 gigawatt-hours</a>. But that would still leave the hundreds of millions of people living in future Pakistan to get by with much less power than <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/texas/\">Texas generates today</a>, with a fraction of Pakistan’s population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that estimate fails to account for Pakistan’s middle class, which is almost <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/middle-class-voters-deal-historic-defeat-to-pakistani-military-regime-by-adeel-malik-2024-02#:~:text=According%20to%20economist%20Durr%2De,like%20motorcycles%20and%20TVs%20has\">100 million</a> strong with millions more on the cusp of exiting poverty and joining its ranks. As people get richer, they ask for — and use — more electricity. Today, only <a href=\"https://www.clasp.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cooling-Needs-Assessment-2022.pdf\">11 percent</a> of Pakistani households have air-conditioning. In six days this June, when temperatures in southern parts of the country hit 120 degrees Fahrenheit, at least <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05rz3w4x1o\">568</a> people died. In a 3 degrees Celsius  scenario, which is what we are on track for by <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/statements/emissions-gap-report-2024-press-statement\">2100</a>, South Asia’s major cities will face multiple heat waves every year that last an average of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-change-effects-cities-15-vs-3-degrees-C\">23 days — nearly twice as long as they do today</a>. Even if air conditioners grow increasingly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2024/air-conditioning-humidity-hotter-summers-solutions/\">efficient</a>, in a scenario in which power production merely doubled between now and 2045, a large share of the population would lack protection from the deadly temperatures of the 2040s. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Either the rising middle class of Pakistan will continue to endure heat waves like this year’s without using technology to ease their suffering — or they are going to end up using a lot more power than prominent forecasts for energy consumption assume. That would have precedent: global demand for energy to power air-conditioning and other cooling measures grew from 300 terawatt-hours in the 1990s to 800 terawatt-hours in 2023, which is one <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/comment/new-gas-and-oil-has-prevented-co2-global-emissions-from-peaking\">reason</a> why worldwide carbon emissions still haven’t peaked. In Pakistan, a recent <a href=\"https://journals.iub.edu.pk/index.php/pjes/article/view/2134\">study</a> found that higher temperatures will help drive electricity demand to grow twice as fast (6 to 8 percent annually) as current estimates. The IEA itself has once again<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024?utm_content=buffer9942a&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\"> revised</a> its forecasts for electricity demand growth upward by <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024/executive-summary\">6 percent</a>, adding that demand for air-condition is a key <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de175bfd-aaf1-4adc-b4b5-3e9973aed522\">uncertainty</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Models of energy and climate systems are full of assumptions that often don’t filter through to those reading the headline findings: some scholars call it “<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X21000225\">status quo bias</a>.” When an energy agency in Paris or Copenhagen posits that the world can reach net-zero with millions of Pakistanis having just enough power to spin ceiling fans, they are postulating certain limits on how much power could be installed in Pakistan, and how much Europeans could cut emissions to leave Pakistan space for growth. When seemingly apolitical integrated assessment models, which evaluate the economic results of climate change, tell policymakers which temperature targets are possible or desirable, they are also revealing political assumptions that are often mistaken. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Accepting his Nobel Prize in 2018, William Nordhaus, the godfather of <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-integrated-assessment-models-are-used-to-study-climate-change/\">integrated assessment models</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/nordhaus-lecture.pdf\">asserted</a> that the “cost-benefit optimum [for warming] rises to 3C in 2100.” In other words, the most cost-effective outcome of climate change — in terms of how much we spend to stop it and how much damage it inflicts — is a global average temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius, twice the warming target set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement (a target the world is well on its way to missing). But whose cost, and whose optimum? Models like Nordhaus’ assume economic development can protect people from the climate change that the same economic activity causes. This line of thinking assumes there is a limit to how much the world’s wealthy countries can slow down (or green) their energy consumption to arrest climate change — and that therefore there is a limit on how much new energy can be allocated for poorer countries with their rapidly developing economies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The world’s growing middle class isn’t waiting for permission to buy air conditioners. The task now is to make sure that the energy that powers them is clean — and that means having more than enough solar panels for Lahore as well as Copenhagen.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

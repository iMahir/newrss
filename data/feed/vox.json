The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations’s climate science team, has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22620706/climate-change-ipcc-report-2021-ssp-scenario-future-warming\">chalked out five scenarios</a> with different levels of action needed from global leaders to curb climate change to plug into its climate models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other side of the equation, scientists have been working to narrow down the scope of possible reactions that the planet has to all of this heating. They’ve been getting better measurements of the Earth’s behavior, refining their physical models of things like rainfall and ocean currents, and designing more sophisticated computer simulations to get a better sense of what complicated reactions could happen and the kind of events that could be put into motion as the planet heats up. With these inputs, they’ve come up with a range for how much further Earth will warm for a given amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a parameter known as <a href=\"https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/transient-and-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity/\">equilibrium climate sensitivity</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were to double relative to the era prior to the Industrial Revolution, the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/faqs/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_Chapter_07.pdf\">most recent major IPCC report</a> finds the world will warm between 2 degrees Celsius and 5 degrees Celsius, with a best estimate of 3 degrees Celsius. It means that some of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/31/21340748/climate-change-carbon-emissions-sensitivity-how-much-will-earth-warm\">more dire forecasts of warming</a> from the past are much less likely, and so are some of the more optimistic predictions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, in assembling this report, scientists were surprised that a subset of climate models were producing warming estimates that were <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-climate-scientists-should-handle-hot-models/\">much hotter than others</a>. In response, they changed how they factor these outliers into the overall estimate, reducing their influence rather than weighing them equally.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"How hot could the world get? by Unexplainable\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP9086323428\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, a team led by former NASA scientist James Hansen found that previous sensitivity estimates had vastly underestimated the role of <a href=\"https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/climate/data/deep-blue/aerosols\">aerosols</a>, such as soot and dust, and that there may be <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889\">more warming baked in</a> than we realized. These fine particles suspended in the sky can have myriad effects on the global climate.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Figuring out the future of warming is not just an academic exercise. If you’re constructing a road, a home, a power plant, or if you simply have any stake in the world decades away, you need to start planning and building now for that future. If the world does go down one of the more extreme warming scenarios, curbing greenhouse gas emissions may not be enough to keep the planet livable for humans. We could be forced to employ more extreme and controversial interventions like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/2023/5/4/23711213/solar-geoengineering-climate-controversy-emissions\">geoengineering</a> to rein in runaway warming. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So how exactly do we figure out whose vision of the future is most accurate before that future becomes the present? It’s an ongoing process. As scientists expand the boundaries of knowledge of the planet, they’re also coming up with ways to reconcile these diverging views.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1753679691.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.187324444302,100,77.625351111396\" alt=\"A crowd of climate activists is seen with a prominent Save The Planet sign.\" title=\"A crowd of climate activists is seen with a prominent Save The Planet sign.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Climate activists gather at a demonstration in the United Kingdom. \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The messy truth of climate modeling</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fundamental <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/18093054/global-warming-explained\">concept of climate change</a> is fairly straightforward — more heat-trapping gasses in the atmosphere cause the planet to retain more heat — but the practical ways this plays out get extraordinarily complicated very quickly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For example, warmer air can hold onto more moisture. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change\">Water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas</a>, so that can create a feedback that accelerates warming. In addition, more moisture in the air can lead to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/372589/flooding-europe-nigeria-north-carolina\">extreme rainfall</a> in some areas and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23670139/colorado-river-drought-lake-mead-climate-change-water-cuts\">less in others</a>. It also forms clouds, which can reflect sunlight back into space, cooling the area below, or trap even more heat. Now calculate these effects over the entire planet and over the course of decades and you end up with models that demand the most powerful supercomputers in the world just to run. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists are gradually filling in the blanks in these models with lab experiments and real-world measurements, but even the most sophisticated simulations have to make assumptions and judgment calls about which variables are the most important and how much they should shape the final calculations. That’s why climate researchers can come to different conclusions about how much the planet will warm. One scientist might think that cloud cooling effects offset more warming, while another might stipulate that melting ice caps will have a stronger feedback effect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the more confounding variables in climate models is the effect of aerosols. Like carbon dioxide, aerosols are a by-product of fossil fuel combustion, but they also come from natural sources like sand and <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00674\">sea spray</a>. Aerosols have a range of impacts on the climate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Some aerosols are light-colored and scatter more light, which means we get a cooling effect, and some aerosols, like soot, are dark and absorb light, which means we get a warming effect,” said <a href=\"https://www.datascience.ch/people/eliza-harris\">Eliza Harris</a>, a senior scientist at the Swiss Data Science Center. “And that effect also varies depending on how high it is in the atmosphere.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As humanity burned more fossil fuels since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the concentrations of both greenhouse gasses and aerosols rose in the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists like Hansen think that aerosols helped mask some of the warming caused by carbon dioxide and hypothesize that the global climate is more sensitive to greenhouse gasses than conventional estimates predict. Since many aerosols drive air pollution and are health hazards, efforts to limit air pollution have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23806051/air-pollution-climate-change-global-warming-particles-emissions\">unintentionally reduced their cooling side effects</a>, and further reductions will speed up warming further. Hansen has described this reduction in air pollution leading to more warming as a “<a href=\"https://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2013/20130329_FaustianBargain.pdf\">Faustian bargain</a>.” (Hansen declined to comment for this story). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There have actually been a number of historical examples of aerosols cooling the global climate. Major volcanic eruptions like the <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs113-97/\">1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo</a> in the Philippines inject so many gasses and particles into the sky that they <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/1510/global-effects-of-mount-pinatubo\">dim the sun enough to cool the planet</a>. After the Pinatubo eruption, global average temperatures fell by roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) for more than a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But getting a full inventory of aerosols can be difficult. Satellite measurements can end up obscured by clouds while ground-level sensors don’t pick up what’s going on high in the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty on the abundance of aerosols today,” said <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/mickley\">Loretta Mickley</a>, who co-leads the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group at Harvard University. “That said, we are confident that anthropogenic aerosols certainly did increase in the late 20th century as industry ramped up in much of the developed world. There is a decline in aerosols in much of the developed world now, but increasing aerosols in places like India and China.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More recently, a new international regulation drastically <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/pages/03-1-March-carriage-ban-.aspx\">limiting sulfur aerosol pollution</a> from global shipping went into effect. That sudden drop in pollution over the busiest shipping routes in the world led to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3\">sudden warming in those regions</a>, contributing to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23762529/atlantic-ocean-record-heat-wave-el-nino-hurricane-climate-change\">record-high temperatures in waters like the Atlantic Ocean</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313797121\">study this year</a> found that a major drop in air pollution over China contributed to <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/aerosols-warming-climate-change\">warming in the Pacific Ocean</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How scientists reconcile their differences</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, a <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/james-hansen-is-back-with-another-dire-climate-warning/\">number of scientists dispute Hansen’s recent findings</a> and think his team is overestimating the role of aerosols. The question then is how do you weigh results like this in the context of all the other climate research? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the IPCC, the conventional method was to include all the major climate models and average out their findings, giving each one equal weight. Climate models are often evaluated by examining how well they match historical observations of warming using starting conditions from the past. On this front, the aggregate model tended to outperform most individual models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in the most recent assessment, the IPCC decided to change its approach. The models that skewed hotter did a poorer job of reproducing historical temperature patterns, so the IPCC gave them less weight in the aggregate in calculating the final range of sensitivity.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes sense if you’re mainly concerned with temperature, but that’s only one dimension of the climate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://profils-profiles.science.gc.ca/en/profile/dr-neil-c-swart\">Neil Swart</a>, a researcher at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis, developed <a href=\"https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/4823/2019/\">one of the hottest models</a> used in the latest IPCC assessment. He noted that climate models that may not be as good at predicting temperature might be better at forecasting other important variables like precipitation. By evaluating models solely on temperature, modeling groups could end up tuning their results to better fit within the selection criteria rather than letting the simulations run their course. So there is still a compelling argument for egalitarianism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The debate highlights how even with the best measurements and models, scientists have to make some subjective decisions. For people who have to make decisions now that depend on the future climate, it adds to the frustration and can fuel distrust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, it’s important to note that the vast majority of scientists agree on the broad contours of climate change and that it’s prudent to halt the relentless rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Look, the climate is sensitive to greenhouse gasses. We&#8217;re not exactly sure to the right decimal place what that sensitivity is, but we have no doubt that it&#8217;s sensitive,” Mickley said. “We do know if we cut greenhouse gasses to zero today, we would vastly improve the outlook going forward.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

According to Vox’s Benji Jones, the storm and its expected surge <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water\">have the potential to wreak havoc</a> across the Southeast, but also dump heavy rains onto Appalachia and beyond. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before summer had even begun, experts were predicting that <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season\">this year’s hurricane season would be an unusually active</a> one, with as many as 25 named storms churning across the Atlantic Ocean. The ingredients were all there: the uniquely warm ocean temperatures, lessened Atlantic trade winds and wind shear, and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific\">La Niña conditions</a> cooling the waters of the Pacific.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s impossible to look at hurricanes in 2024 without also considering the context of climate change, which has made everything from rains to drought to wildfires more extreme globally, and put more ecosystems and humans in danger in the process. The record-hot waters in the Gulf this summer, for example, have intensified storms like Helene and Beryl, a supercharged hurricane that broke the record for the earliest Category 5 in a season, making them that much more fearsome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I recently spoke with Umair Irfan, a correspondent at Vox who’s been covering climate, the environment, and environmental policy for a decade, about this hurricane season, what has changed about these massive storms in recent years amid climate change — and what role humans are playing in compounding their impact.&nbsp;Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Lavanya Ramanathan</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Tell us how we used to think about hurricanes, in terms of categories and in terms of strength. What’s complicating that thinking now?</strong><br><br>The main way we categorize hurricanes is by wind speed. Category 1, 2, 3 — those are thresholds defined by how fast the winds from the hurricane are moving. But what we’ve found in recent decades, and with lots of recent experience, is that wind is not the most destructive element of the hurricane. It’s the water.<br><br>It’s the rainfall, it’s flooding, it’s storm surge. The water is what causes the most property damage, and what also causes the most casualties and the most extensive tolls on human life. Water makes it difficult to get repair crews in and to get ambulances in and to get people out. Flooding is what blocks the roads.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s a challenge conveying to the public that when you think about water as the big threat rather than wind, you can take different precautions: storm-proofing your house, flood prevention and mitigation, but also taking evacuation orders more seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What should we know about this hurricane season? You’ve written that it’s expected to be an unusually active season.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To form a hurricane, you need a few things to fall into place. You need warm water at the surface of the ocean, at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter, you need limited wind shear in the air above it, and then you need another thing called atmospheric instability, where the layers of the atmosphere start to blend and merge with one another. What that does is it creates an environment where you can have a lot of evaporation, where water can move upward to a very high altitude. That’s the main engine of a hurricane.<br><br>Hurricanes are a relatively rare phenomenon; we only see a couple dozen every year, whereas we see rainfall just about every day. Major hurricanes — we see maybe three or four. It doesn’t happen very often that all these ingredients align in just the right way.<br><br>But last year was the hottest year on record, and we had a major El Niño, which is a major pattern in the Pacific Ocean that tends to drive up global average temperatures. So air temperatures were very high, causing the oceans to heat up. The major ingredients were there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I was in Houston after one of the big storms of this season, Hurricane Beryl, which struck in July. I saw the effects of the storm really taking their toll on the city for days afterward, in ways you wouldn’t necessarily expect. How is our understanding of the impact of hurricanes changing? </strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/360181/climate-hurricane-beryl-blackout-houston-flood\">Houston and Hurricane Beryl</a> are good examples of how the ways we describe hurricanes don’t tend to reflect the risk that they can pose. It’s not simply the wind speed, or the strength, but how vulnerable the area is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Houston was hit by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning\">Hurricane Harvey</a> years ago, which caused immense amounts of record flooding because the storm parked over the city and dropped a lot of rain. But Houston also has very little in the way of zoning. It’s also very flat, and it’s right next to the Gulf Coast, so there was not a lot of infrastructure there to cope with an immense amount of water. The main natural features that would absorb water have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/11/climate/houston-flooding-climate.html\">paved over to support development</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so there are human-level decisions that ended up worsening the impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Beryl, it was also a fast-moving storm, and the wind caused a lot of damage to power lines. One of the utility companies there, Centerpoint, has a backlog of maintenance and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/360181/climate-hurricane-beryl-blackout-houston-flood\">there were well-known vulnerabilities</a>. So when you had a major storm, it knocked out a lot of power, but also took a long time to get it back. Meanwhile, Houston had a heat wave, so there was an intense energy demand. The high heat, the not having power, all converged to compound the effects of this disaster.<br><br>If you look at Beryl as just a Category 1 storm, you might brush it off. But when you look at all these other things going on, you realize this is a much more severe disaster than the category would suggest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>And the impact was far broader, right?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Right. Hurricanes tend to lose a lot of energy once they make landfall. But they can still be fairly devastating storms, especially if they move to an area that isn’t prepared for it, and isn’t used to getting a torrential downfall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The remnants of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/366893/debby-beryl-hurricane-climate-change-florida-texas-vermont\">Tropical Storm Debby and Beryl both hit Vermont</a>, and caused a lot of flooding and damage, and actually killed people. There was no place for that water to run off to, the people there are not necessarily well-versed in how to evacuate ahead of a storm, and the waterways, roads, and bridges are not designed to withstand sub-tropical storms.<br><br><strong>Is this something that we’re seeing more of, or are going to see more of?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We see that in general with extreme weather. We had a major heat wave in the Pacific Northwest a few years ago; that was devastating because that’s the area with the least amount of air conditioning in the US. It was harmful for the people there because they’re not acclimated to the heat, and they don’t have the infrastructure to deal with it.<br><br>We see the same thing with storms. A weaker storm can still be devastating in an area that does not have infrastructure that can withstand rains, or porous areas that can absorb the water. And when an event does occur, there’s more severe rainfall, because as air temperatures warm, the air can hold onto more moisture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, while we’re focusing on the extremes, we should look at what’s typical as well, and what’s typical is also changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is there something people can do to protect themselves on an individual level that we’re not already doing?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, you have to start to rethink your mentality. There’s a pervasive thinking that bad things won’t happen to you. If you go for years at a time without a hurricane or a storm, or your house got flooded, and now it’s been a decade, that memory fades very quickly.&nbsp;<br><br>But one of the concerns with climate change is that it’s bringing extremes into areas where they haven’t experienced them before. So this is a new process for some. The first step is recognizing and appreciating that you are vulnerable, that bad things can happen but you can in fact <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23196757/summer-disaster-weather-preparation-community-hurricane-wildfire-drought-heatwave-flood\">prepare for them</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big thing is you want to also get your policymakers thinking about things that can mitigate disasters over time — things like building sea walls in coastal areas, but also thinking about big changes like rethinking where we are allowed to build at all. Are we going to retreat from certain areas? Are we just going to have to<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/372014/shinnecock-nation-tribe-sea-rise-hamptons\"> give up on oceanfront areas</a> because the risk is too high? These are much more difficult policy questions, but we’re going to have to start grappling with them because now is the best opportunity — not after a disaster.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But four years later, after a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358831/us-violent-crime-murder-pandemic\">historic spike in gun homicide</a> and an election cycle where <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/us/politics/republicans-crime-midterms.html\">Republicans attacked</a> them over the issue, Democrats have found a new message.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Leaders are still talking about ending gun violence — an <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/06/gun-attitudes-and-the-2024-election/\">important issue</a> for their base, given that it’s the core reason that the United States has a homicide rate that is much higher than other <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23142734/kansas-city-superbowl-mass-shooting\">comparable countries</a>. They’re also still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/23/kamala-harris-sonya-massey-killing-police-reform\">supportive of police reform</a>, though it has been less prominent as a campaign issue this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But now, with Republicans opposing nearly all of their gun control legislation, they’re highlighting their other efforts in crime prevention and public safety, too. “We made the largest investment, Kamala and I, in public safety, ever,” President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/20/read-the-entire-transcript-of-president-joe-bidens-dnc-speech/74867260007/\">said</a> at the Democratic National Convention in August, referring to the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announce-10-billion-american-rescue-plan-policing/story?id=84685199\">$10 billion</a> in funding committed through the American Rescue Plan to public safety efforts for cities and states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice presidential nominee Tim Walz <a href=\"https://time.com/7013698/watch-tim-walz-dnc-speech/\">touted</a> his administration’s investment in fighting crime as Minnesota governor at the DNC, and Chris Swanson, a sheriff from Genesee County, Michigan, took to the stage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAyyl4CJoXM\">to declare that</a> “crime is down and police funding is up,” in a speech that would have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-unveil-broad-police-reform-bill-pledge-to-transform-law-enforcement/2020/06/08/1ed07d7a-a992-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html\">almost unthinkable</a> at the 2020 Democratic convention, when activists and other prominent voices on the left were calling to “defund the police.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mayors leading major cities are now highlighting increases in funding and support for programs built around more recent innovations in violence reduction, including <a href=\"https://ojp.gov/topics/community-violence-intervention\">community violence intervention</a> and hyperlocal crime <a href=\"https://bja.ojp.gov/violent-crime-reduction-roadmap/intro\">reduction programs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Community safety is a year-round, collaborative effort,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOb6fxSX2e8\">said</a> earlier this year, unveiling a new summer safety program for the city, which has seen a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/boston-homicides-violence-prevention.html\">major drop</a> in gun homicides in 2024 compared to the previous year. “Our comprehensive approach to reducing gun violence is working,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said, crediting the work of the city’s <a href=\"https://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/news/press-releases/2024-02-08-baltimore-city-outlines-next-steps-group-violence-reduction-strategy\">group violence reduction strategy</a> in contributing to the city’s largest year-over-year <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-homicides-decrease-2023-d88000d65d3916d1fbbe6352becd8881\">reduction</a> in murders last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just that Democrats are responding to the rise in gun homicides in 2020 and 2021 and the political backlash that came with it. The change reflects a broader shift in thinking among Democrats and their nonpartisan allies who work in violence reduction, criminal justice, and police reform. It’s one that acknowledges the seriousness of preventing and reducing violent crime — the core concern of the “tough on crime” crowd — without accepting the idea that the solution is mass incarceration. There is a growing sense that increasing public safety, ending gun violence, and reducing mass incarceration, rather than being separate or even in tension, are pieces of the same pie, and that efforts to improve one should help improve the others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These conversations had been occurring in siloes,” between policymakers focused on public safety and policymakers and activists focused on criminal justice reform, <a href=\"https://counciloncj.org/team/adam-gelb/\">says Adam Gelb</a>, president and CEO of the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice. But the conversations have been merging and becoming more interconnected as they’ve come to an important realization: “We’re not going to solve or dramatically reduce incarceration rate unless we dramatically reduce the rate of community violence,” Gelb says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The change represents an evolution of years of policymaking on crime reduction and prevention. In the 1960s and 1970s, <a href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/united-states-crime-counts-1960-2022\">when murder and violent crime rose dramatically</a> in the United States, a sociologist looked at the available research about what could rehabilitate those convicted of crimes and came up with an unsettling conclusion: <a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/36811_6.pdf\">nothing worked</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This notion gave credence to a controversial new argument, outlined by American political theorist James Q. Wilson in his 1975 book <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/james-q-wilson/thinking-about-crime/9780465048847/?lens=basic-books\"><em>Thinking About Crime</em></a>. Wilson argued that since rehabilitation was essentially futile, the criminal justice system <a href=\"https://reason.com/1976/11/01/thinking-about-crime/\">should focus</a> on doing what they could to make sure repeat offenders were removed from society. Wilson’s views <a href=\"https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/uploads/content/Thinking_About_Punishment.pdf\">became popular</a> among policymakers, and the American prison population <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf\">began to grow</a> in the 1970s, through the crack epidemic and the “war on drugs” in the 1980s and 1990s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2009, the United States had <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf\">1.6 million people in prison</a> and the highest incarceration rate in the world. The social science researchers, meanwhile, had improved their ability to study the impact of various violence reduction strategies, and discovered something else important: deterrence based on issuing harsh prison sentences <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/247350.pdf\">also didn’t work</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, a growing movement recognized America’s mass incarceration issue as a real problem in and of itself — one that cost the government <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/the-u-s-spends-billions-to-lock-people-up-but-very-little-to-help-them-once-theyre-released\">billions annually</a>, <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2024/04/01/updated-charts/\">exacerbated</a> racial inequality, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9540942/\">devastated</a> communities and families.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As researchers deepened the body of existing research on racial bias in the criminal justice system, and activists organized to press lawmakers for change, a series of police killings of Black Americans brought the issue into the public’s view. By 2020, the movement for police and criminal justice reform had already made important progress, thanks to a network of organizers and activists, and funding from foundations and bipartisan coalitions. That support had helped build momentum for drug <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/fair-sentencing-act#:~:text=In%202010%2C%20Congress%20passed%20the,%3A1%20to%2018%3A1.\">sentencing reform</a> during President Barack Obama’s administration as well as his administration’s creation of a task force <a href=\"https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf\">aimed at</a> police reform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those efforts helped pave the way for the most significant sentencing reform bill in years, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18140973/state-of-the-union-trump-first-step-act-criminal-justice-reform\">First Step Act</a>, signed by President Donald Trump. The bill gave judges more flexibility to avoid lengthy sentences dictated by federal mandatory minimums, allowed incarcerated people to earn time credits that could move up their release date if they participated in rehabilitative programs, and made retroactive the earlier reform passed under the Obama administration, eliminating the sentencing disparity between those convicted of possessing crack versus powdered cocaine. By the last election cycle, the Democrats’ platform included <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21418125/biden-harris-pelosi-defund-the-police-criminal-justice-reform-2020\">the most progressive police reform agenda</a> in modern American history. The bill focused on greater accountability for police, but also included proposals to invest more in community-based violence reduction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as reformers were making strides, violent crime began to rise again in cities, due to a number of factors <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358831/us-violent-crime-murder-pandemic\">related to the pandemic</a>, policing after the George Floyd protests, and the ubiquity of guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By the end of 2020, the country had seen the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/06/health/us-homicide-rate-increase-nchs-study/index.html\">largest increase in its homicide rate</a> in nearly a century, and the problem got more difficult to ignore. The following year, homicides <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/upshot/murder-rise-2020.html\">remained high</a>. Former President Donald Trump and other Republicans increasingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23433184/crime-midterms-oz-fetterman-pennsylvania-senate\">pointed their fingers</a> at Democrats running big cities, arguing that their policies were responsible for rising violent crime and attempting to connect them with the left’s “defund the police” movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2022, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/31/violent-crime-is-a-key-midterm-voting-issue-but-what-does-the-data-say/\">six in 10 registered voters</a> listed crime as a “very important” issue for them in the midterm election cycle that November.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, a new crop of Democrats, responding to voters’ concerns, launched campaigns for mayor across the United States. Many made violent crime reduction their primary campaign issue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some, like New York’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/28/adams-nypd-crime-00002011\">Eric Adams</a>, who won in 2021, and Philadelphia’s <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2024/04/philadelphia-mayor-public-safety-plan/\">Cherelle Parker</a>, who won in 2023, campaigned on more funding and support for police. (Federal prosecutors announced Thursday that they had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted.html\">indicted</a> Adams on federal corruption charges, and the NYPD has been under heavy scrutiny for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/eric-adams-nypd-gun-units-illegal-stops.html\">illegal stops</a> on citizens, a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/21/us/nypd-brooklyn-subway-shooting/index.html\">recent subway shooting</a>, and a separate investigation that resulted in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html\">the police commissioner’s resignation</a> in September.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others, like Wu and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, have focused their efforts on <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/mayor-brandon-johnson-community-safety-plan-crime/\">outreach and intervention programs</a>, and focused on investing in community partnerships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The details of each city’s violence prevention program are different, but the broad elements are largely the same: They include <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/22/23367572/democrats-policing-bills-midterms\">more funding</a> for <em>both</em> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/373238/gun-violence-homicides-violent-crime-strategies\">the police and for community organizations</a> aimed at addressing the <a href=\"https://counciloncj.org/10-essential-actions/\">people and places</a> most likely to suffer from high rates of violent crime, especially gun homicide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Democratic politicians are being responsive to what voters care about,” says <a href=\"http://Jens Ludwig\">Jens Ludwig</a>,&nbsp;professor and director of the <a href=\"https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/\">University of Chicago’s Crime Lab</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not the only factor at play. Post-pandemic, Ludwig says, many cities were facing the challenges brought on by the emptying of cities and the rise of remote work, along with the rise in violent crime. Some feared this would result in an “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/urban-doom-loop-american-cities/677847/\">urban doom loop</a>” where people fled cities for the suburbs, making the problems worse and subsequently causing more people to flee. The stimulus funds from the federal government helped stave off the decline, but cities knew that the money wouldn’t last forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Every big city in the country now realizes that they aren’t going to be able to throw money at this problem forever,” Ludwig says. “There’s a need to figure out how to do more with less.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Investing in targeted initiatives that place community outreach workers in high-risk neighborhoods, or give police data to approach crime hotspots, are ultimately cost-effective methods to reduce violence. “These things are not super expensive in the grand scheme of things,” Ludwig says, and they give cities a way of reducing violence in the short-term while working on longer-term investments meant to address root causes of violence, including racial inequality and economic disinvestment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also helps, Ludwig says, that researchers have gotten much better at understanding what works —&nbsp;beyond gun control — to reduce gun violence in the last few decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Increasingly, those efforts are being championed by organizations offering resources for mayoral offices looking to reduce violence. Marc Morial, the former mayor of New Orleans, made national headlines for <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/crime/new-orleans-crime-how-it-cut-murder-rate-in-1990s-richard-pennington/289-427d1cf5-8633-495a-941a-aebedd3a11a6\">cutting the number of homicides in his city in half</a> during his time in office in the 1990s. Now, as president and CEO of the National Urban League, Morial and the organization are prioritizing community safety and police reform policies, and convening mayors to discuss how to best enact the strategies that have worked in other communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Focusing on community safety and police reform together makes sense for an organization like the National Urban League, Morial says, which has long focused on <a href=\"https://nul.org/\">advancing</a> economic and living conditions for Black Americans and other underserved people living in urban areas. “Quality of life in Black and brown and urban communities is a paramount issue. A community that feels victimized on the one hand by the police and on the other by crime and crooks is a very difficult community to live in,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Passing better gun laws still remains a major priority for Democrats. The issue was a large theme of the DNC, with Congresswoman Lucy McBath, <a href=\"https://x.com/RepLucyMcBath/status/1794105739612451197\">whose son</a> was a victim of gun violence, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upR9215dBZs\">sharing the stage with shooting survivors</a> and others who’d lost loved ones to gun violence. The Democratic Party <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-violence-top-issues-dnc-platform/story?id=112955833\">platform also devoted significant space</a> to solving the problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the campaign trail, Harris and Walz, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/371304/what-kamala-harris-gun-ownership-reveals-about-american-politics\">both gun owners</a>, have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-gun-owner-debate-trump-abc-election-control-33fa551a2b9021f85325fc5acd9a1a22\">talked about</a> their support for universal background checks, banning assault weapons, and expanding red flag laws, policies that remain popular with their <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/24/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">base</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the change in Democratic rhetoric — and in the policies in many cities across the United States — puts Democrats in a much different position than they were in 2022. Something else important happened too: violent crime has fallen. According to data <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/g-s1-24184/fbi-crime-data-2023\">the FBI released this week</a>, overall violent crime fell 3 percent in 2023 over the year before, with murder dropping almost 12 percent. It’s too early to say for certain what role these programs played, and what other factors may have contributed. But the reduction in homicides means more lives were saved — the most important change of all.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Forecasters warn that Helene — which has wind speeds of near 120 miles per hour — could be deadly for those living in coastal Florida, where it’s expected to make landfall this evening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The National Hurricane Center predicts storm surge <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/261747.shtml?\">as high as 20 feet</a> in some parts of Florida’s Big Bend, a region between the panhandle and the peninsula. Storm surge, which describes a rise in sea level, is the most dangerous part of tropical storms and has a deadly track record: In 2022, storm surge killed <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/\">more than 40 people</a> during Hurricane Ian. The storm is also expected to inundate inland regions across much of the southeastern US with rain, dumping a foot or more in parts of southern Appalachia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban flooding,” the National Hurricane Center <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/261747.shtml?\">said</a> early Thursday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene could also disrupt part of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22823993/monarch-butterflies-mexico-milkweed\">epic monarch butterfly migration</a>, which typically passes through the Big Bend’s St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in early October.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2173441112.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.4224368901015,100,83.155126219797\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Storm clouds from Helene over Havana, Cuba, on September 24. | Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene is the eighth named storm in what has so far amounted to a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atlantic-hurricane-lull-puzzles-scientists/\">somewhat puzzling</a> hurricane season. It started with a bang — June’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate\">Hurricane Beryl</a> became the earliest Category 5 storm on record —&nbsp;and then much of August and September was unexpectedly quiet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many meteorologists, though, have been warning not to be fooled by this late-summer lull.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Having multi-week periods of quiet and then multi-week periods of activity is very normal throughout a hurricane season,” <a href=\"https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/\">Brian McNoldy</a>, a climatologist at the University of Miami, told me earlier this month. “I definitely would not read too much into it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Plus, McNoldy said, the ocean in the Gulf of Mexico has been —&nbsp;and still is —&nbsp;exceptionally hot, and hot water fuels hurricanes.

Others in Adams’s orbit — including the former <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/10/10/tow-truck-mob-city-hall-eric-adams-ulrich/\">head of the Buildings Department</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/nyregion/eric-adams-nypd-illegal-donations.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Nk4.3xf0.ju7chu9ORcz5&amp;smid=url-share\">former police inspector</a> — have faced their own scandals and charges as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams has denied breaking the law, saying in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/politics/video/mayor-eric-adams-nyc-indictment-sot-nn-perez-digvid\">Wednesday video statement</a>, “I am innocent, and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams’s indictment, made public on Thursday, involves <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25175485-us-v-eric-adams-indictment-unsealed-sept-26-2024-inner-city-press-on-the-cases\">five federal corruption charges</a>. The charges make Adams the first ever sitting New York City mayor to be indicted, and will likely have a significant effect on the upcoming mayoral race in 2025, which he was expected to run in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First elected as mayor in 2021, Adams previously served as Brooklyn borough president, state senator, and a New York City police officer. He’s known for his aggressive push to increase policing and combat crime as mayor, as well as bombastic comments he’s made about migrants and kooky catchphrases about governance. Now, his tenure as a public servant could be approaching its end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is a rundown of what we know about the indictment, and its implications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the charges against Eric Adams?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The charges center on Adams’s mayoral campaigns. They allege that he knowingly accepted illegal donations facilitated by a Turkish government official, and favors — like luxury plane tickets — as part of a quid pro quo relationship with the country. Together, they paint a picture of a foreign government official cultivating a prominent US politician over a period of years. The charges are: </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Conspiracy to commit wire fraud, solicit foreign contributions, and accept bribes (1 count):</strong> Adams is accused of setting up an illicit system to accept foreign donations as part of his mayoral campaigns, of accepting multiple plane tickets and luxury travel perks from a Turkish government official and Turkish businesspeople, and of helping a Turkish consulate building in New York City circumvent regulatory requirements in return. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Wire fraud (1 count): </strong>Certain campaign donations in New York City can be matched with public funds to help encourage candidates to seek small-dollar donations. The indictment alleges that Adams fraudulently solicited matching funds for donations that he knew were from “straw donors,” or donors used to funnel money from another source. He’s accused of using straw donors in both his 2021 and 2025 campaigns, and of securing $10 million in public matching funds in this way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national (2 counts): </strong>US political candidates are barred from accepting donations from foreign citizens, something Adams is accused of knowingly doing by taking money from Turkish nationals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Bribery (1 count): </strong>This charge is also related to Adams’s alleged exchange of certain travel benefits, like expensive plane tickets, for relaxing the regulatory requirements faced by a new Turkish consulate building. The building had yet to pass a fire safety screening ahead of a visit by Turkey’s president, and Adams reportedly pressured a Fire Department official to obtain expedited approval. The perks he received are alleged to have been valued at around $100,000.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who else has been accused of corruption?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html\">two dozen people</a> are involved with open investigations and litigation concerning Adams and his allies, not all of them related to corruption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those investigations include scrutiny of the campaign’s ties to six different foreign countries, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-juice-bar-shakedown-james-caban-ray-martin/\">allegations of extortion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/nyregion/adams-banks-consultant-investigation.html\">bribery allegations</a> related to a consulting firm run by the sibling of Adams administration officials. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eric-adams-lawsuit-sexual-assault-police-1524a079aaf40fc5578ae530c902737e\">Adams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/nypd-pearson-adams-lawsuit.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Nk4.bnR_.v4Y2Ua6JE7oF&amp;smid=url-share\">one of his advisors</a> also face allegations of sexual misconduct.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus far, two powerful people with links to Adams have also been indicted:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/nyregion/eric-ulrich-surrender-bribery.html\">Eric Ulrich</a>, Adams’ former Building Department Commissioner has been charged with accepting $150,000 in bribes in exchange for favors like approving building inspections. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/05/eric-adams-nypd-dwayne-montgomery-straw-donations-guilty-plea-00139593\">Dwayne Montgomery</a>, a former deputy police inspector who served on the force at the same time as Adams, pleaded guilty to arranging for straw donors to give Adams’ 2021 campaign thousands of dollars.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other officials, including the former Police Commissioner Caban, Schools Chancellor Banks, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks, and First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright have yet to be charged, but have had their phones seized. Former Adams chief fundraiser Brianna Suggs, senior adviser Winnie Greco, Interim Police Commissioner Thomas Donlon, and an aide who’s on leave, Rana Abbasova, have also had their homes searched. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Does Eric Adams have to step down? What happens if Adams doesn’t resign?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams does not have to step down because of the indictment, <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/09/17/what-happens-eric-adams-resigns/\">experts tell</a> the news outlet The City.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are ways to potentially force his removal, however. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/impeach-adams-governor-ny-city-charter.html\">New York Gov. Kathy Hochul</a> has the ability to first suspend, then remove, him from the position, though it’s a power that the state executive has rarely used. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">New York City officials could also set up a panel known as an “inability committee” that then empowers a group of city councilmembers to vote on whether Adams is unable to do his job. If two-thirds agreed with that assessment, he’d be required to leave his post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Adams leaves, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams would serve as acting mayor, and a special election for the job would have to be held within 80 days of Adams’s departure.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who has called on Eric Adams to resign?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the national lawmakers who have urged Adams to resign. She first did so ahead of his indictment, in light of the ongoing investigations into other members of his administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Nonstop investigations will make it impossible to recruit and retain a qualified administration,” <a href=\"https://x.com/AOC/status/1839020346957246939\">Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. “For the good of the city, he should resign.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City.<br><br>The flood of resignations and vacancies are threatening gov function. Nonstop investigations will make it impossible to recruit and retain a qualified administration.<br><br>For the good of the city, he should resign.…</p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1839020346957246939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others who’ve joined in the chorus <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-democrats-calling-new-yorks-eric-adams-resign-1959546\">include multiple New York City Councilmembers</a> like Tiffany Cabán, Lincoln Restler, and Chris Banks. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who is running for mayor in 2025?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams was scheduled to be up for re-election next year, though <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/eric-adams-job-approval-rating-00130454\">broad dissatisfaction with his tenure</a> had prompted several others to join the fray.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even ahead of the indictment, the contest was slated to be a packed one that includes current City Comptroller Brad Lander, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, and state Sen. Jessica Ramos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adams is in the running as well, and is not required to step aside due to his indictment. However, he was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/eric-adams-job-approval-rating-00130454\">not a popular figure</a> before his recent legal troubles — and if he opts to stay in office, and in the race, he’s likely to find the contest to be a difficult one.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s one of the more absurd things happening in <em>For Your Approval</em>, a night of taped comedy that DeGeneres and Netflix have been promoting as the comedian’s response to being <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/ellen-degeneres-canceled-new-comedy-tour-netflix-special-1235010950/\">“kicked out of Hollywood.”</a> Nabbing a comedy special on one of the biggest entertainment platforms on the planet should probably disqualify anyone from saying they were “kicked out of Hollywood,” but we do not live in a world where sentences make sense. (Netflix reportedly paid <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellendurney/ellen-degeneres-new-netflix-special-reactions\">DeGeneres $20 million</a> for her 2018 set <em>Relatable</em>.) Instead, we have a packed-house show by an alleged Hollywood outcast filmed for Netflix, with an audience hooting and hollering for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22466574/gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-meaning\">a 2016 girlboss platitude</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What the former talk show host really means by “kicked out of Hollywood” is that her brand took a hit. DeGeneres, who was blacklisted and shunned in the industry after coming out in the ’90s, should know the difference between those things better than anyone.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The severity of DeGeneres’s second “cancellation” is debatable. In 2019, DeGeneres had actress <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/12/2/20991074/dakota-johnson-ellen-birthday-feud\">Dakota Johnson</a> on her eponymous show and that interview quickly turned into a meme. The host questioned the actress about her recent 30th birthday party, claiming she hadn’t been invited, which prompted Johnson’s famous reply: “Actually, no, that’s not the truth, Ellen” — saying in fact, DeGeneres had skipped the festivities. (It was later discovered that DeGeneres was hanging out with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/08/ellen-degeneres-defends-watching-football-with-president-george-w-bush/\">George W. Bush</a> at a Dallas Cowboys game.) The back and forth went viral, prompting a semi-playful examination of whether DeGeneres was actually a nice person, which built into more serious reports of a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/ellen-employees-allege-toxic-workplace-culture\">toxic work</a> environment at <em>The Ellen Show</em>, with accusations of racism and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/ellen-show-toxic-workplace-complaint-2018\">sexism</a>. Eventually, <em>The Ellen Show</em> was quite literally canceled in May of 2022. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/EDSS_Unit_00174R.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"Ellen Degeneres alone, sitting on a stool and looking into a mirror.\" title=\"Ellen Degeneres alone, sitting on a stool and looking into a mirror.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Ellen DeGeneres admits that she isn’t nice 24/7 because no one is nice 24/7. | Wilson Webb/Netflix\" data-portal-copyright=\"Wilson Webb/Netflix\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">DeGeneres doesn’t get into these specifics in the special.  For her applause-ready audience (at one point they cheer when DeGeneres name-drops a producer named “Andy”), she glosses over the more serious parts of the fallout, saying simply that the reason she was booted from the industry was because people didn’t realize her kindness was part of the act. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can’t be mean and be in show business,” DeGeneres deadpans. “No mean people in show business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">DeGeneres paints herself as a less kind person than the <em>Ellen</em> we see on TV, recounting complaints from her wife Portia about how she’s comically impatient. She admits she’s rude at parties, saying that her talk show trained her to only pay attention in segments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to the toxic workplace allegations, she explains that she didn’t really know how to be a boss, which she chalks up to her love of playing pranks on producers. She also speaks about how complicated she is — having been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-deficit disorder — and how that can manifest in being a bad manager. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, DeGeneres asserts that she’s definitely kinder and nicer than the person we read about in the news. She can’t stop wanting to help lost animals, she says, and she finds beauty in how caterpillars liquefy themselves and turn into butterflies. That ties into what she lets on about her peaceful, post-talk-show life: She’s gardening more, surrounded presumably by butterflies, and tending to a roost of chickens. DeGeneres also reveals that she wears sweatpants in the home and cannot be pried out of them once she slips them on, not even for “Mick” (as in Jagger). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m 66 years old,” she tells the audience, who respond with raucous applause. DeGeneres follows that statement up with a joke about how restaurants’ menu font size makes her feel old.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For all the time she’s spent imagining the thought process of a just-hatched butterfly or the seemingly brainless organization scheme of her car’s dashboard or how the width of the two “bankrupt” panels flanking the million-dollar panel in <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> is unfair, DeGeneres barely examines the obvious question about her “niceness.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Nice” wasn’t simply a byproduct of being Ellen; DeGeneres ultimately turned being kind into one of the most profitable business plans in Hollywood. And she did so after gaining first-hand knowledge of what it’s actually like to be professionally blacklisted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At one point in the special, DeGeneres compares this current time in her career to the period after she came out publicly. The comedian had announced she was a lesbian on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em> just prior to her eponymous character coming out on her sitcom, <em>Ellen,</em> that same year. She also famously appeared on the cover of Time magazine, with the cover line reading, “Yep, I’m Gay.” It was, undeniably, new ground for the country, and a brave claim of self. After “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0570077/\">The Puppy Episode</a>,” as it was called, DeGeneres says she struggled to find work — a rejection based on who she was, even if the sitcom character wasn’t exactly her.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During DeGeneres’s turn as a talk show host, she became less like herself and more like a sitcom character. Her terminal niceness became her identity. All the mean, bigoted things people said about her being a lesbian didn’t have any bearing — she was showing audiences across America that she was a nice person, first and foremost, who just so happened to be gay. She rose above the prejudices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22463879/kink-at-pride-discourse-lgbtq\">respectability politics</a>, stretched and shaped into an extremely beneficial career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It must have been difficult to do what DeGeneres did, to sand down the edges and flatten the wrinkles of her whole identity, to fit into this TV host mold and appeal to people who had rejected her. But that was her business, one more crucial than being a TV show host, producer, or comedian. Behind the scenes, it seems, she dropped the ball. After many years of playing nice, DeGeneres wasn’t able to do her job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of acknowledging that lapse or asserting that there’s a stark difference between being unpleasant to work for and ignoring a toxic work environment, in <em>For Your Approval, </em>DeGeneres pivots to talking about how society is tough on women in the workplace — holding them to impossible double standards and trapping them in roles designed to fail. While those factors were certainly at play, it’s a little obtuse — if not purposely hollow — to use those societal issues to buff out the more serious accusations that sunk her show. I’m not sure those kinds of excuses and obfuscations are what you’d hear from a nice person, but DeGeneres would concede she was never that nice to begin with.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They’ve touted the company’s unusual corporate structure as a way of proving the purity of its motives. OpenAI was a nonprofit controlled not by its CEO or by its shareholders, but by a board with a single mission: keep humanity safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this week, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/\">news broke</a> that OpenAI will no longer be controlled by the nonprofit board. OpenAI is turning into a full-fledged for-profit benefit corporation. Oh, and CEO Sam Altman, who had previously emphasized that he didn’t have any equity in the company, will now get equity worth billions, in addition to ultimate control over OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an announcement that hardly seems coincidental, chief technology officer Mira Murati said shortly before that news broke that she was leaving the company. Employees were so blindsided that many of them reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-25/openai-cto-mira-murati-says-she-will-leave-the-company\">reacted</a> to her abrupt departure with a “WTF” emoji in Slack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">WTF indeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The whole point of OpenAI was to be nonprofit and safety-first. It began sliding away from that vision years ago when, in 2019, OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/17/18301070/openai-greg-brockman-ilya-sutskever\">created a for-profit arm</a> so it could rake in the kind of huge investments it needed from Microsoft as the costs of building advanced AI scaled up. But some of its employees and outside admirers still held out hope that the company would stick to its principles. That hope can now be put to bed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We can say goodbye to the original version of OpenAI that wanted to be unconstrained by financial obligations,” Jeffrey Wu, who joined the company in 2018 and worked on early models like GPT-2 and GPT-3, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Restructuring around a core for-profit entity formalizes what outsiders have known for some time: that OpenAI is seeking to profit in an industry that has received an enormous influx of investment in the last few years,” said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell’s Tech Policy Institute. The shift departs from OpenAI’s “founding emphasis on safety, transparency and an aim of not concentrating power.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And if this week’s news is the final death knell for OpenAI’s lofty founding vision, it’s clear who killed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Sam Altman became an existential risk to OpenAI’s mission</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When OpenAI was cofounded in 2015 by Elon Musk (along with Altman and others), who was worried that AI could pose an existential risk to humanity, the budding research lab <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai/\">introduced itself</a> to the world with these three sentences:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">OpenAI is a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that is objectively false now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since Altman took the helm of OpenAI in 2019, the company has been drifting from its mission. That year, the company — meaning the original nonprofit — created a for-profit subsidiary so it could pull in the huge investments needed to build cutting-edge AI. But it did something <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/11/18260434/sam-altman-open-ai-capped-profit-y-combinator\">unprecedented in Silicon Valley</a>: It capped how much profit investors could make. They could get up to 100 times what they put in, but beyond that, the money would go to the nonprofit, which would use it to benefit the public. For example, it could fund a universal basic income program to help people adjust to automation-induced joblessness.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the next few years, OpenAI increasingly deprioritized its focus on safety as it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22672414/ai-artificial-intelligence-gpt-3-bias-muslim\">rushed to</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23023538/ai-dalle-2-openai-bias-gpt-3-incentives\">commercialize products</a>. By 2023, the nonprofit board had grown so suspicious of Altman that it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/21/23971765/openai-sam-altman-microsoft\">tried to oust him</a>. But he quickly clawed his way back to power, exploiting his relationship with Microsoft, with a new board stacked in his favor. And earlier this year,<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158403/openai-resignations-ai-safety-ilya-sutskever-jan-leike-artificial-intelligence\"> OpenAI’s safety team imploded</a> as staffers lost faith in Altman and quit the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Altman has taken the final step in consolidating his power: He’s stripped the board of its control entirely. Although it will still exist, it won’t have any teeth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It seems to me the original nonprofit has been disempowered and had its mission reinterpreted to be fully aligned with profit,” Wu said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Profit may be what Altman feels the company desperately needs. Despite a <a href=\"https://ia.samaltman.com/\">supremely confident blog post</a> published this week, in which he claimed that AI would help with “fixing the climate, establishing a space colony, and the discovery of all of physics,” OpenAI is actually in a jam. It’s been struggling to find a clear route to financial success for its models, which cost hundreds of millions — if not billions — to build. Restructuring the business into a for-profit could help attract investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the move has some observers ­— including <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1839186902915662324\">Musk</a><a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1839188477386064140\"> himself</a> — asking: How could this possibly be legal?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If OpenAI does away with the profit cap, it would be redirecting a huge amount of money — prospective billions of dollars in the future — from the nonprofit to investors. Because the nonprofit is there to represent the public, this would effectively mean shifting billions away from people like you and me. As some are <a href=\"https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1839090791152812186\">noting</a>, it feels a lot like theft.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If OpenAI were to retroactively remove profit caps from investments, this would in effect transfer billions in value from a non-profit to for-profit investors,” Jacob Hilton, a former employee of OpenAI who joined before it transitioned from a nonprofit to a capped-profit structure. “Unless the non-profit were appropriately compensated, this would be a money grab. In my view, such a thing would be incompatible with OpenAI’s charter, which states that OpenAI’s primary fiduciary duty is to humanity, and I do not understand how the law could permit it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But because OpenAI’s structure is so unprecedented, the legality of such a shift might seem confusing to some. And that may be exactly what the company is counting on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Asked to comment on this, OpenAI said only to refer to its statement in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-25/openai-cto-mira-murati-says-she-will-leave-the-company\">Bloomberg</a>. There, a company spokesperson said OpenAI remains “focused on building AI that benefits everyone,” adding that “the nonprofit is core to our mission and will continue to exist.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The take-home message is clear: Regulate, regulate, regulate</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Advocates for AI safety have been arguing that we need to pass regulation that would provide some oversight of big AI companies — like<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/369628/ai-safety-bill-sb-1047-gavin-newsom-california\"> California’s SB 1047 bill</a>, which Gov. Gavin Newsom must either sign into law or veto in the next few days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Altman has neatly made their case for them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The general public and regulators should be aware that by default, AI companies will be incentivized to disregard some of the costs and risks of AI deployment — and there’s a chance those risks will be enormous,” Wu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Altman is also validating the concerns of his ex-employees who published a proposal demanding that employees at major AI companies be allowed a “right to warn” about advanced AI. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn\">Per the proposal</a>: “AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Obviously, they were right: OpenAI’s nonprofit was meant to reign over the for-profit arm, but Altman just flipped that structure upside down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After years of sweet-talking the press, the public, and the policymakers in Congress, assuring all that OpenAI wants regulation and cares more about safety than about money, Altman is not even bothering to play games anymore. He’s showing everyone his true colors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Governor Newsom, are you seeing this?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Congress, are you seeing this?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">World, are you seeing this?  </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But Walz fits right in, seamlessly blending a <a href=\"https://x.com/hannah_flom/status/1820656515755216922\">genuine affection</a> for farmed animals with a hearty enthusiasm for eating them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">Processing Meat newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\">here</a> for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>’s biweekly newsletter from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/marina-bolotnikova\">Marina Bolotnikova</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kenny-torrella\">Kenny Torrella</a>, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Have questions or comments on this newsletter?</strong> Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At this year’s Minnesota State Fair, he <a href=\"https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1830316164460716163\">declared</a> pork on a stick to be the “breakfast of champions.” In another viral <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@briantylercohen/video/7400108092161117483?lang=en\">video</a> from last year’s fair, Walz’s daughter tells him she won’t eat turkey because she’s vegetarian. Walz replies that in Minnesota — the nation’s top turkey-producing state — turkey isn’t meat. “Turkey’s special,” he quips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These images have helped shore up Walz’s wholesome vibes and “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/tim-walz-minnesota-state-fair-midwestern-dad\">Big Dad Energy</a>,” exuding the “Minnesota nice” charm that Democrats hope can help them lock down votes in crucial Midwest and Rust Belt states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I, too, have been swept up by the Harris-Walz fervor, so I feel like a killjoy poking a hole in Walz’s innocent sheen. But there’s a darker side to the story: Walz has a <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/10/07/porkindustry\">long history</a> of providing <a href=\"https://www.twincities.com/2014/03/12/rep-tim-walzs-winning-hotdish-recipe-2/\">free advertising</a><strong> </strong>and public funding to the <a href=\"https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-600942\">meat</a> and <a href=\"https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-583830\">dairy</a> sectors, industries that trash Minnesota’s treasured waterways, torture animals, and endanger public health and vulnerable workers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be fair to Walz, he’s doing what every other politician, Republican or Democrat, does to survive in farm country. Minnesota is a top producer of <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/newsroom/trending-topics/turkey-sector-background-statistics/\">turkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=108733\">pork</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/194968/top-10-us-states-by-milk-production/\">dairy</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/cropview/commodityView.aspx?cropid=0440000\">corn</a> and <a href=\"https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/cropview/commodityView.aspx?cropid=2222000\">soybeans</a>, the main crops fed to livestock. Even though just around<strong> </strong>1 percent of Minnesota households make a living from farming, agribusiness has accrued enormous influence over federal and state agricultural policy by <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/07/24/graphic-political-party-gap-in-agribusiness-donations-continues-to-widen/\">showering candidates</a> — including farm-state Democrats like <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?c-t-eid=9202001#%5B%7B1%7Cgro=d-et,d-ccb\">Walz</a> — with campaign contributions. It then uses them to sell a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws\">narrative</a> that Big Ag is beyond criticism because it is “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GovTimWalz/posts/im-not-kidding-when-i-say-our-farmers-feed-the-world-were-a-top-five-state-for-a/1070172471129548/\">feeding the world</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Democrats watch their share of the vote in farm country slip away, characters like Walz — a balance to Harris’s image as a San Francisco liberal — bring an obvious appeal to the party. But in what may ultimately be a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/rural-voters-dont-necessarily-love-walz-despite-the-camo-hat-and-small-town-upbringing-236973\">quixotic quest</a> to appeal to rural voters in Middle America, Democratic leaders are compromising their <a href=\"https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf\">commitments elsewhere</a> to environmental protection, labor rights, and public health when they go heavy on promoting the meat industry and light on regulating its harms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That the Democratic base appears to be celebrating Walz’s farm-friendly image with little scrutiny shows how far factory farming’s opponents have to go in educating the American public about the cruelties of our food system. Much like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing\">misleading</a> cartoons of happy, “humanely raised” pigs and cows on meat packaging — which often mean little on the farm itself — Walz’s photo-ops with baby farmed animals reinforce the false romanticized image that Big Ag has so successfully seared into the public’s consciousness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reality, however, is anything but wholesome.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Dissecting Walz’s viral farm moments — and his voting record&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without context, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1296987340474818&amp;id=1093525130821041&amp;set=a.1114138672093020\">photo</a> of Walz holding a piglet at the Minnesota State Fair appears innocent, even endearing. But the pork industry, and that piglet’s life? Not so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The photo was taken at a pavilion sponsored by Christensen Farms, the <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.com/pork-powerhouses-2023-sow-numbers-pig-profits-down-while-productivity-up-8641051\">ninth largest</a> US pork company, and run by the Minnesota Pork Board. Practically all pigs raised for food in the US come from factory farms — including Christensen’s, as seen in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9UDHv0Juv4\">disturbing 2015 investigation</a> by an animal rights group — which use a consistent set of practices. Female breeding pigs — those that give birth to piglets who are then raised for slaughter — are confined in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork\">crates so small</a> they can hardly move for their entire lives, suffering through pregnancy after pregnancy to churn out piglets until their productivity wanes and they’re sent to slaughter.

Last year, an animal rights group <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/22/23970874/thanksgiving-turkey-farming-jennie-o-hormel-white-house-pardon\">found</a> stomach-churning conditions at the state’s top turkey producer, Jennie-O: birds too weak and sick to even walk, along with live birds pecking at dead and rotting ones and birds with visible wounds — signs of cannibalism, a <a href=\"https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/miscellaneous-conditions-of-poultry/cannibalism-in-poultry\">common problem</a> in poultry farming (at the time, Jennie-O told Vox that it “takes the welfare of the animals under our care seriously and has robust animal care standards throughout our supply chain”).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jennie-O’s parent company, Hormel Foods, is headquartered in the congressional district Walz held before he ran for governor; Walz has <a href=\"https://www.twincities.com/2014/03/12/rep-tim-walzs-winning-hotdish-recipe-2/\">promoted</a> the <a href=\"https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-600942\">company</a>’s products and <a href=\"https://mn.gov/governor/covid-19/news/?id=1055-497713\">appointed</a> its former CEO to a state economic council.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"White House &quot;Turkey Pardon&quot; Supplier Exposé Finds Cannabalism, Starvation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UF8HvoxdpQQ?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And remember Walz’s <a href=\"https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1831686167130968324\">photo op</a> with the dairy calf earlier this month? It masked the dismal reality behind dairy farming, where cows have been selectively bred to pump out more and more milk, leading to <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/af/article/2/3/16/4638647\">more frequent leg and metabolic issues</a>, as well as higher rates of painful udder inflammation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The campaign stop took place at a relatively small dairy farm, the kind that makes up an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">increasingly tiny</a> share of the milk Americans buy at the grocery store. Most dairy cows today will <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7238891/\">never set foot on open pasture</a>, and farms typically separate babies from mothers shortly after birth, housing them alone and feeding them through a bottle so that farmers can take their mothers’ milk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Made a new friend. <a href=\"https://t.co/MLX5k37Ew6\">pic.twitter.com/MLX5k37Ew6</a></p>&mdash; Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz/status/1831686167130968324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Minnesota — the Land of 10,000 Lakes — livestock and the synthetic fertilizer used to <a href=\"https://www.mncorn.org/corn-facts/\">grow the corn</a> they eat <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2023/11/13/us-regulators-order-minnesota-to-clean-up-nitrate-contaminated-water/\">account for most</a> of the state’s water nitrate pollution; <a href=\"https://fmr.org/news/2017/11/20/state-confirms-40-percent-mn-lakes-and-rivers-polluted\">4 in 10 bodies of water</a> are so polluted that they fail to meet basic health standards. Last year, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-11/ao-rmod-reponse-letter_20230510-508.pdf\">directed</a> Minnesota state agencies to immediately address the high nitrate levels in drinking water, which can cause a <a href=\"https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/water/contaminants/nitrate.html#HealthEffects\">range</a> of serious health issues, that thousands of Minnesotans had been exposed to. The EPA also encouraged the state to better monitor pollution from livestock manure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Minnesota state government is limited in its ability to crack down on these businesses because court decisions have largely exempted factory farms from Clean Water Act regulation. And Walz, of course, can’t bear the blame for a problem that began decades ago due to the unsavory realities of farm state politics. But <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/2020-in-minnesotas-farm-country-nitrate-pollution-of-drinking-water-getting-worse/#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20all,systems%20are%20experiencing%20worsening%20contamination.\">environmental groups</a> and even some <a href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/22/epa-directive-renews-debate-over-states-role-in-protecting-drinking-water-from-farm-pollution/\">state lawmakers</a> argue Minnesota could be doing much more. Instead, Walz seems to have little to say about factory farming dirtying the state’s waterways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to serving as Minnesota’s governor, Walz represented Minnesota in the US House of Representatives for six terms, in which he <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/tim-walzs-balancing-act-on-agriculture/\">voted against</a> two important agricultural pollution measures. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, he played a large role in negotiating the Farm Bill — a multiyear legislative package that sets federal agricultural policy — and during his tenure, the legislation shoveled <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-commodity-policy/farm-bill-spending/\">more and more money</a> to farmers growing livestock feed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz has championed <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/tim-walzs-balancing-act-on-agriculture/\">federal</a> <a href=\"https://www.mda.state.mn.us/soil-health-grant\">and</a> <a href=\"https://www.brownfieldagnews.com/news/minnesota-water-quality-program-surpasses-1-million-voluntary-acres-enrolled/\">state</a> “conservation” funding for farmers to implement more sustainable practices, but they’ve ultimately made <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rivers-streams-nitrogen-pollution-fertilizer-agriculture-farming-571eb54cb69cc06f43d5f1253e990337\">little to no progress</a> in fixing the problem. And <a href=\"https://www.iatp.org/payments-pollution-how-federal-conservation-programs-can-better-benefit-farmers\">some</a> of the federal conservation funding goes to large meat and dairy operations for environmentally dubious practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gov. Walz’s office declined to comment for this story and instead shared a comment from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. “The Governor has consistently advocated for and implemented programs that ensure agriculture benefits the environment while remaining profitable,” the statement reads, and points to Walz’s support for conservation funding and a <a href=\"https://www.mda.state.mn.us/nfr\">rule</a> that sets some limits on fertilizer application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What Walz in the White House might mean for the future of farming</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Harris wins the presidency, Walz could be influential in setting the administration’s agricultural agenda. That would likely mean more of the same bipartisan, pro-factory farming consensus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Harris has a surprisingly strong track record on <a href=\"https://time.com/7003790/kamala-harris-climate-record-trump-climate-change/\">the environment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.animals24-7.org/2024/07/21/vp-kamala-harris-has-long-strong-record-on-animal-issues/\">animal welfare</a>, having defended California’s bans on foie gras and confining egg-laying hens in tiny cages during her time as the state’s attorney general.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walz’s rural bona fides could make him an effective messenger for reforms that a Harris administration might pursue&nbsp;— if he’s willing to buck Big Ag. But there’s little evidence so far that he would be ready to take that role.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To call out the meat industry for its misdeeds and advocate for meaningful regulations would require courage few farm state politicians have been willing to show. Doing so in the middle of a tightly contested presidential campaign, where several of the battleground states have major agricultural sectors, could be politically disastrous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, instead, we get photos of candidates with cute piglets and baby calves caught up in the factory farm system — images that fortify the very mythologies that make it so difficult for elected officials to stand up to Big Ag. But that political calculation has gotten us to where we are today: poisoned waters, injured workers, and abused animals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While a second Trump term would likely be even friendlier to Big Ag than a Harris-Walz administration, there’s <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/12/11/democrat-tom-vilsack-usda-secretary-farms/\">less daylight</a> between <a href=\"https://cornbeltconfidential.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-local-cafo-bans\">Republicans and Democrats</a> on agricultural policy than you might think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re not going back” has become the de facto Harris-Walz campaign slogan. But in the fight against factory farming, their administration probably wouldn’t move us forward, either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was featured in the </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/processing-meat-newsletter-signup\"><em>Processing</em> <em>Meat</em></a><em> newsletter.

Ron Paul, who was, for decades, the ideology’s most famous representative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You might also think of someone entirely fictional: Ron Swanson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Grumpy, mustachioed, and obsessively fearful of government overreach, Swanson was <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>’s resident macho man, the lone-wolf amateur woodworker who believed society’s problems could be fixed by bootstraps, hard work, and rugged individualism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Sure, these guys romanticize the idea of working with their hands, but it’s far more likely they spend their days typing on a laptop (or better yet, speaking into a podcast mic)</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sometime between 2010 and now, however, the libertarian of the American imagination changed. Our new avatar for laissez-faire economics and “leave me alone-ism” is more likely an aspiring entrepreneur who rails against wokeness in forums and group chats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether or not this type of guy is actually even a libertarian at all is debatable. Some may espouse libertarian-ish economics, but most are far more fixated on culture; still others have a hard-to-classify medley of views. They are, however, united by their self-mythologizing as “free thinkers” and a sense of alienation from mainstream liberal discourse. This brand of tech bro is proud of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/14/young-men-election-joe-rogan-donald-trump\">heterodoxy</a>, despite the fact that the worldview he articulates seems to have been passed top-down from a cadre of influential Silicon Valley executives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sure, these guys romanticize the idea of working with their hands, but it’s far more likely they spend their days typing on a laptop (or better yet, speaking into a podcast mic).

Like Ron Swanson, they still <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/the-peterson-family-meat-cleanse/567613/\">love animal protein</a>, but now they may be eating it <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/raw-meat-diet-reddit\">literally raw</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Less into Milton Friedman (the economist) than <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/02/14/business/lex-fridman-mit-science-ambassador-podcast/\">Lex Fridman</a> (the computer scientist-turned-podcaster), they regurgitate the gospel of tech overlords like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23872485/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-biography-review\">Elon Musk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/marc-andreessen-reactionary-futurism.html\">Marc Andreessen</a> and the creators who interview them — Joe Rogan and his many imitators.

Germs of it are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/10/23547393/andrew-tate-toxic-masculinity-qa\">influenced by the manosphere</a>, or the parts of the internet where men complain about their lack of access to women and sex and blame society’s present ills on feminism. Though you don’t hear these guys talk about the alt-right or being “redpilled” much anymore (perhaps too closely associated with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/4/16/18287446/incel-definition-reddit\">incels</a>), they tend to frame their position as “anti-woke,” or a counterpoint to what they see as a world over-indexed on equality and diversity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This sphere, broadly conceived, includes everyone from “canceled” figures associated with the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/10/17338290/intellectual-dark-web-rogan-peterson-harris-times-weiss\">“intellectual dark web,”</a> to controversy-hungry influencers like Sneako and the Paul brothers, to mega podcasters Dave Rubin and Tim Pool (most recently in the news for unwittingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/370323/tenet-media-russia-what-happened-tim-pool-dave-rubin-benny-johnson-lauren-southern\">becoming paid Russian propaganda stooges</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the Obama administration, two things happened that changed the way these men (and they are overwhelmingly men) think, look, and behave online: the overhaul of acceptable political discourse caused by the election of Donald Trump and, of course, the pandemic.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A worldview centered around cultural grievances</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of this philosophy and aesthetic can be credited to the influence of billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Thiel, whose libertarian views have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/donald-trump-steve-bannon-peter-thiel-214490/\">curdled into the anti-democratic</a>, has for years <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets\">funded a right-wing culture movement</a> (if it can even be considered that) that includes film festivals, conferences, and media companies that tout <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/womens-magazine-gen-z-cosmo-far-right-evie-1234744617/\">anti-feminism</a> and <a href=\"https://qz.com/1537150/peter-thiel-is-funding-a-science-publication-questioning-evolution-and-climate-change\">climate change denialism</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/books/review/the-contrarian-peter-thiel-max-chafkin.html\">recent Thiel biography traces</a> almost everything the billionaire has done to amass power back to the grudge he held as a nerdy schoolboy who loved Dungeons &amp; Dragons and <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>(several of Thiel’s companies are named for Tolkien people and places) against the liberals and elites who rejected him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump years gave extreme views like Thiel’s and others in Silicon Valley legitimacy and publicity. One major moment,<strong> </strong>says Derek Robertson, who writes <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/16/how-to-not-fund-the-future-00179381\">Politico’s Digital Future Daily newsletter</a>, was the publication of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/9/16112050/google-fired-engineer-james-damore-alt-right-free-speech\">ex-Google employee James Damore’s letter</a> to the company’s leadership in 2017. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In it, Damore railed against the company’s diversity measures by stating that women simply weren’t biologically suited to work in tech, causing a major backlash from women in the industry. After Damore was fired, he hit the burgeoning alt-right media circuit, where he gave interviews to the leading commentators of the day: Rogan, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, as well as white nationalist podcaster <a href=\"https://gnet-research.org/2023/05/17/inside-the-cult-of-stefan-molyneux-a-historical-exploration-of-far-right-radicalisation-on-youtube/\">Stefan Molyneux</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The letter was also a litmus test for what was acceptable to say publicly in a world where Donald Trump was president. The sudden open hostility to diversity grew to include a stew of related grievances. Anyone who prevented entrepreneurs and other “big thinkers” from doing exactly as they pleased became the enemy: <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/07/silicon-valleys-anti-unionism-and-class-warfare.html\">unions</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/marc-andreessen-manifesto-techno-optimism.html\">media, academia, government institutions</a>, anyone with a <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/tim-askew/why-liberal-arts-are-necessary-for-long-term-success.html\">liberal arts degree</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-andrew-tate-4chan-x-twitter-high-status-males-b2606622.html\">women</a> and <a href=\"https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-ben-shapiro/\">people of color</a> in positions of power (although this part usually goes unsaid).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If contemporary culture is the problem, with its wokeness and DEI, it’s no wonder they valorize “the classics”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Robertson tells me he’s watched libertarianism, at least in its tech bro manifestation, go from this “really wonky” philosophy centered around less government interference in all aspects of life to a movement that’s almost entirely centralized around cultural grievances. “It’s just a reactionary movement against the increasing presence of women in culture, the increasing domination of women in academia and corporate fields,” he says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These grievances have shaped the aesthetic of the online right: If contemporary culture is the problem, with its wokeness and DEI, it&#8217;s no wonder they valorize “the classics.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of them, exemplified by the infamous internet personality <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/\">Bronze Age Pervert</a>, revere the type of art Westerners are exposed to in elementary school: ancient sculpture and their Renaissance counterparts, Romantic painting, and classical music and architecture. Echoes of this worldview are <a href=\"https://www.redpepper.org.uk/political-parties-and-ideologies/history/nowhere-to-retvrn-history-nostalgia-tradwives-far-right/\">everywhere on social media</a>, romanticizing “trad” lifestyles with regressive gender roles juxtaposed next to images of rural landscapes and marble nudes, often posted by people hoping for a “RETVRN” (styled as such to emulate the Roman empire) to an imagined past society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Every Saturday morning you are challenged by stronk Swede to contest of rope-tug.

It is one of the few cars in the world that no one would ever compare to a woman’s body — there are no curves, after all. The Cybertruck appeals to someone who imagines danger is all around them. If they can’t protect themselves against a culture that is moving on without them, perhaps they can do it with stainless steel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Covid supercharged male wellness culture</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pandemic was a convergence of several grievances harbored by the free-thinker set: government overreach, America’s troubled health care system, and left-wing virtue signaling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The CDC’s response to Covid-19, says Hussein Kesvani, a journalist and podcaster who covers internet culture and politics, clashed with the tech bros’ sensibilities: Public health required individuals to alter their behavior for the sake of the collective good and sacrifice certain personal freedoms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not surprising, then, how this set began to view mask-wearing as a symbol identifying oneself with the political establishment and vaccines as dangerous. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/02/actual-joe-rogan-coronavirus-misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">While promoting</a>&nbsp;vaccine skepticism and decrying lockdown measures, personalities like Rogan have entertained a bevy of other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/opinion/joe-rogan-health-misinformation-solutions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">junk ideas about health</a>, often peddling their <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/onnit-sued-supplements-joe-rogan-b2548166.html\">own questionable&nbsp;products</a>. Energy drinks and longevity supplements in particular are a cash cow; listen to any podcast of this ilk and you’re likely to hear the guest plugging their own brand (Logan Paul has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/logan-paul-and-ksi-prime-hydration-lawsuits-list-of-cases-2024-8\">Prime Hydration</a>; both <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/24/979362593/alex-jones-still-sells-supplements-on-amazon-despite-bans-from-other-platforms\">Alex Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHTLxxeAhc4\">The Daily Wire</a> have vitamin companies).&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2147577571.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Logan Paul \" title=\"Logan Paul \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Logan Paul at a boxing match, promoting his Prime energy drink. | Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“So much of this conspiratorial stuff is rooted in this idea that these institutions — hospitals, governments — are keeping the secrets of the universe away from you,” says Kesvani.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s created an enormous industry for heterodoxy entrepreneurs on every level of scamminess to hawk ideas about “seed oils” <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/is-seed-oil-bad-for-you-wellness-influencers-right-wing-debunked-1234809499/\">supposedly turning everyone ugly and sick</a>, why <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1198916105/mens-health-masturbation-abstinence\">masturbation</a> is making men weak, and how <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/raw-meat-diet-reddit\">raw beef liver is the one true alpha diet</a>: If the pandemic convinced you that everything you’ve been told about health is a lie, it’s far easier to sell you some random influencer’s vitamin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re sold in this ‘macho lifestyle’ way, where if you drink Prime you can crush your enemies beneath your chariot wheels, rather than what you’re actually doing, which is probably staying up all night to play PlayStation,” says Helen Lewis, an Atlantic staff writer who covers politics and digital culture. “You have anti-woke moisturizers, anti-woke plunge baths, all this self-care which feels very feminine, so you have to put a macho spin on it to make men feel okay about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hence the interest in sports like MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which combine individual competition with combat. Mark Zuckerberg, Rogan, and Fridman, for instance, all have either blue or black belts in martial arts. Where wellness culture meets tech guy politics is full of its own paradoxes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s about the optimization of you as a person, the people you surround yourself with, the places you go, the people you’re seen with,” says Ed Zitron, a Substacker and tech critic. “It actually, if you really take a step back, is something that 20 years ago, guys like them would have described as deeply feminine.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Perhaps it’s all about the loneliness epidemic?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s possible you’ve seen videos or advertisements on social media promoting all-male retreats that romanticize escaping from society, either for hunting or networking or self-improvement (they’ve become so prevalent that there are now <a href=\"https://x.com/snotwurst420/status/1836061211189719171\">parodies going viral</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While in itself not a bad thing, Zitron points out that most of these retreats are “men reaching out for community, but the community they find is one built on selfishness and exclusion.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think it’s really important to know how much of this comes down to the breakdown of male friendships,” he adds. “Women seem to have some degree of sisterhood, a gender-based solidarity. Guys don’t seem to have this unless it’s just being sexist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That desire for community sometimes leads heterodox thinkers into creating narratives borrowed from fantasy or reductive retellings of history. It’s no accident that billionaires like Thiel, Musk, and Jeff Bezos frequently reference <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, a classic high fantasy about the fight between good and evil (you can guess which side they believe they’re on).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I hosted a men-only dinner <a href=\"https://t.co/bnD1OexCtJ\">pic.twitter.com/bnD1OexCtJ</a></p>&mdash; judd crud (@snotwurst420) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snotwurst420/status/1836061211189719171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/08/why-leaders-listen-elon-musk-donald-trump-interview\">current favorite meme</a> places them within the stages of the Roman empire, (“Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times”), positioning themselves as the few strong men who will rise from the ashes to save humanity&nbsp;— itself ironic, considering Musk is among the class of tech billionaires who forged the digital world as we know it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet to the fans who buy into this worldview, it all sounds both true and, crucially, cool: Not only will the free-thinkers rescue humanity, but they’re doing it <a href=\"https://x.com/josiahhughes/status/1835761052673352041\">because it’s punk</a>. “The very macho styling feels countercultural to them. I think it feels punkish: ‘There is a polite society that is dominated by feminine codes of behavior, and we are the insurgent uprising to that.’ To outsiders maybe that doesn’t make a great deal of sense, but if you’re a 14-year-old boy, I think it does make a lot of sense,” says Lewis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>After all, what else is a Cybertruck but an admission of fear?</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are ways in which their self-mythologizing is absolutely true: They are an alternative to mainstream news media, and they do<em> </em>say things that might land you in a meeting with HR or a suddenly very empty room at a party. By building their followings online, they’re tapping into an audience thirsty for someone to tell them that their grievances — against women, against culture, against the media — are valid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In reality, the techno-libertarians, the heterodoxy, or whatever we’re calling them (Robertson poses “masculine futurism” while Zitron suggests “New nihilism”) seem to be driven by the deepest fears of these particular men. After all, what else is a Cybertruck but an admission of fear? Fear of other cars, of other people, of being broke and the failure to amass social status. “Because what do they actually care about other than ‘I want money bigger; woman sex me now’?” Robertson asks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What, indeed?&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

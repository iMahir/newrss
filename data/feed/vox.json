This procedure is meant to be a check on presidential power — a way of ensuring officials directly elected by citizens can guard against the appointment of unqualified or corrupt personnel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Constitution, however, also allows for “recess appointments,” a provision that aims to prevent prolonged government vacancies by allowing the president to install officials without Senate approval while Congress is not in session.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Using such recess appointments, Trump would be able to appoint whoever he’d like without giving the Senate the opportunity to question or object to the pick. Critics of the practice note that it increases the risk of unqualified, corrupt, or ideological appointees filling government posts. It also significantly expands presidential power. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though recess appointments have been used in the past by presidents of both parties, in recent years, the Senate has avoided going to extended recesses, blocking presidents from making any appointments in senators’ absence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reinstating recess appointments “would essentially negate one of the Senate&#8217;s main roles in governance, which is to vet presidential nominations for high-level positions,” Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, told Vox. “It would, if the Republicans in the Senate were willing to go along with it, represent sort of an abdication; they would be simply giving up the power that’s afforded them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump injected his demand into the fierce race to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell as the leader of the Senate, which will be under GOP control next session thanks to the results of last week’s election. Trump largely stayed out of that contest while on the campaign trail, but he waded into it on Sunday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1855692242981155259\">writing on X</a>, “Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!)”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The three candidates for the position — Sens. John Thune (South Dakota), John Cornyn (Texas), and Rick Scott (Florida) — quickly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/4983721-trump-senate-recess-appointments-gop-support/\">expressed support for Trump’s demand</a>. Scott, the underdog in the race who is also the closest Trump ally of the three, was the most explicit in his endorsement of the plan, writing “100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,” <a href=\"https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/1855693759281053758\">on X.</a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What&#8217;s a recess appointment and how does it work?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In ordinary circumstances, nominees to many government posts including cabinet secretaries, ambassadors, and federal judges must undergo a confirmation hearing, during which they are questioned by the Senate about their record, qualifications, and how they will perform their government duties. Confirmation in this process requires a simple majority voting to confirm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recess appointments work differently, and don’t require a vote. The president simply appoints an official of their choice. The idea behind them was that there might arise times when the president needed to appoint someone to keep the government functioning, while Congress was out of session (in recess).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“At the time the Constitution was written, Congress met mainly nine out of 24 months, and there were long stretches where Congress wasn&#8217;t in session,” Squire told Vox. As such, the Constitution states the president has the “Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Congressional recesses aren’t as long as they once were. Now, recesses happen in between each congressional session and around holidays. Recess appointments still work the same way, however. And as the text notes, any appointment made during a recess isn’t permanent: Presidential appointments made during a recess last to the end of that second session, meaning for a period of no more than two years. A president can renominate their pick after that, or reappoint them during another recess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How have they been used in the past?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With the exception of Trump and President Joe Biden, recent presidents have made use of recess appointments; according to the <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42329.pdf\">Congressional Research Service</a>, former President Barack Obama made 32 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments, and George W. Bush made 171 recess appointments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though recess appointments were meant to be used in emergencies or in times when Congress met less often, over the past few decades, they’ve become seen as a way for presidents to get around congressional opposition. The process faced major scrutiny during the Obama administration, and was curtailed after a 2014  Supreme Court ruling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/26/supreme-court-rules-against-obama-recess-appointments\">Obama had overstepped his power</a> in utilizing the recess nominations. (That’s why neither <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/11/senate-recess-appointments-trump-republicans/\">Trump</a> nor Biden made any recess appointments.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an effort to block recess appointments, the chamber often employs what are known as “pro forma” sessions. These short meetings, in which no real business is conducted, mean the Senate is never in recess for more than 10 days —&nbsp;preventing the president from making any appointments without the body’s consent. A pro forma session can be as simple as one senator gavelling in, and then calling the session over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If indeed the recess appointments are reinstated, there is little Democrats could do to stop the process, Squire said. But they could slow down legislative processes, which “wouldn&#8217;t necessarily prevent [recess appointments] from happening, but there would be a penalty — a cost attached to it.” </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The whistleblower who sent them to me, as he calls himself, runs one (or several) of a slew of anonymous accounts who’ve recently been contacting reporters, YouTubers, and true crime podcasters in an effort to get someone to publish these allegedly exclusive photos. The assumption is that as a reporter who covers these stories, and an admitted true crime fan myself, I’d be interested.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I’m not, but this is one of the things that happens when a murder, or murders, in America stops being a local tragedy and becomes “true crime.”</p>\n\n<p>It’s extremely difficult to describe Delphi — “Delphi” here encompassing the murders, the town, the investigation, the online community of true crime enthusiasts following it, and all of their complex interactions with one another. It’s too vast and tragic to put into words, and also too messy and complicated. Of all the recent “big” cases, Delphi has developed an entire true crime ecosystem of communities — all wanting justice for two tragically murdered girls, and all too often at odds with each other in their pursuit of it.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to see why it has gotten so big and complex. With both images and audio of the alleged killer made quickly available to the public, this was a case primed for virality — and all that goes with it.&nbsp;Six years, two separate witness sketches, a long chain of hotly debated suspects, multiple side investigations into different crimes, a massive online sideshow, and one strangely unsatisfying arrest later — of a local man who made himself known to police on the very first day — Delphi is still a troubling, disturbing mystery.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As difficult as Delphi is to stare directly at, however, it’s worth making the attempt. Because as eerie and ugly as it is, this case is significant, not just for the complex ecosystem that has formed around it, but because, in all its messiness, it points the way toward the complicated future of true crime itself.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://volume.vox-cdn.com/embed/6ef8c2899?player_type=chorus&#038;loop=1&#038;placement=article&#038;tracking=article:rss\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"\"></iframe><p>Monon High Bridge, Delphi, Indiana; Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gettyimages.com/search/filmmaker?filmmaker=Nexstar%20-%20WXIN%2C%20Indianapolis&quot;&gt;Nexstar/WXIN, Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt;</p></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“Down the hill”</h2>\n\n<p>Carroll County, Indiana, where tiny Delphi, population 2,972, is located, is as rural as it gets. Near the northern edge of town lies the Monon High Bridge Trail, an easy walking path that runs southeast to the Monon High Bridge. An abandoned railroad trestle, it’s a massive, 853-foot-long structure, the second-tallest bridge in the state, and it has no railing: A slip and a fall,&nbsp;a tumble through one of the many <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alR-YGWXPYs\">missing railroad ties</a> on the bridge, and it’s a sheer drop of 63 feet to the creek below.</p>\n\n<p>While the terrifying bridge is technically off-limits to the public, in reality it’s a cool hangout spot.</p>\n\n<p>On February 13, 2017, a sunny Monday afternoon, best friends Abby Williams and Libby German asked German’s older sister to drop them off at the trail. <a href=\"https://people.com/crime/liberty-german-abby-williams-slain-indiana-teens-two-weeks-missing/\">According to</a> German’s grandmother, German and her older sister frequently hung out at the bridge, hiking and taking photos, so it wasn’t a concern for big sis to drop the two girls off, shortly before 2 pm, and be on her way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>German’s father intended to pick them up in an hour or two, after he was done with his afternoon errands. As the girls were crossing the bridge, German turned back and posted several photos to Snapchat, including one of Williams minding her steps.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469044/libby_abby_bridge.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,35.274869109948,100,29.450261780105\" alt=\"Woman walking on railroad tracks\" title=\"Woman walking on railroad tracks\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"One of the last photos taken from Liberty German’s phone, posted to Snapchat. | Snapchat via Facebook\" data-portal-copyright=\"Snapchat via Facebook\" />\n<p>The girls walked to the southeast end of the bridge, at which point the trail effectively ends, petering out into the undergrowth. German’s camera briefly captured footage of a burly man in a blue coat and jeans, walking along the bridge toward them. As German <a href=\"https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/police-delphi-murder-victims-spoke-of-man-behind-them-in-audio-played-for-family/531-4391eb86-9939-41c4-a921-501e7af81ca6\">continued recording</a>, what started out as speculation turned to fear. As a 2022 arrest <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23321732-probable-cause-affidavit-filed\">affidavit</a> eventually revealed, one of them, likely Williams, murmured, “Gun,” as the man approached.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Trapped between the man and the woods, with a steeply sloping hill on either side and no way back across the bridge, the girls were effectively cornered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Guys,” he ordered them, “down the hill.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A 2017 <a href=\"https://interactive.wthr.com/pdfs/logan-warrrant.pdf\">search warrant</a>, revealed in 2022, confirmed the existence of a chilling 43-second video of almost total silence following these words, during which the girls were seemingly marched to their deaths. By the time German’s father <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dc5pk04Yc\">reportedly</a> called her at 3:11 pm to say he was on his way to pick them up, the girls had likely already been abducted. The families quickly formed search parties; at 5:20 pm, German and Williams were officially reported missing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Numerous people were on the High Bridge Trail that day. Several of them came forward that same afternoon, but none of them reported seeing what happened to Williams and German.</p>\n\n<p>Around noon the next day, Valentine’s Day 2017, the girls were found lying about a half-mile from the bridge, across a stretch of private property by the creek. The widely accepted but as yet unconfirmed details of what happened to them are horrific and bizarre, with some authorities believing the bodies could have been “<a href=\"https://www.wishtv.com/news/i-team-8/fbi-agent-bodies-moved-and-staged-in-delphi-murders-suspect-took-clothing/\">moved and staged</a>.” This has prompted theories that the girls were placed in the creek after the initial searches on the 13th were called off for the evening.</p>\n\n<p>But this is just one of the myriad speculations in a case that became a many-headed hydra of warring beliefs, agendas, and endless theories, with few answers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A frustrating conundrum: An abundance of leads, and no suspect in sight</h2>\n\n<p>The Delphi murders should have been easy to solve. Law enforcement had a full, if blurry, video of the perpetrator, plus a recording of his voice. Surely, someone in such a small community would recognize him immediately. Right?</p>\n\n<p>That’s not what happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Using the footage German captured of the abduction in-progress, police quickly <a href=\"http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/help-isp-identify-this-man-who-was-on-the-walking-trails-monday-near-delphi?_ga=2.34667681.1203828117.1676262820-1296537285.1676262820\">released</a> the now-famous double photo of the man the internet has dubbed “Bridge Guy.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469048/libby_bg2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.473724229324,100,51.052551541353\" alt=\"Two men walking on railroad tracks\" title=\"Two men walking on railroad tracks\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Stills of footage of “Bridge Guy,” believed to be the suspect in the murders of Liberty German and Abigail Williams, taken from German’s phone on February 13, 2017. | Indiana State Police\" data-portal-copyright=\"Indiana State Police\" />\n<p>Nine days after the murders, <a href=\"https://www.wrtv.com/news/crime/updates-expected-today-on-delphi-teen-killings\">police released</a> an audio recording of Bridge Guy, now officially named a suspect, saying, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftnAPuBrwDM\">Down the hill.</a>”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This was arguably the moment when Delphi stopped being solely a hometown tragedy and entered the annals of true crime fame — when the eerie disembodied audio, complete with the pixellated image of the killer, swept across media outlets nationwide, galvanizing interest in the tragic story of two young friends who died brutally, side by side. The day after the release of the recording, police had to divert tips in the case to a national call center run by the FBI’s Major Case Contact Center. By early March, the case had <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2017/03/09/evansdale-indiana-double-homicide-links-coincidental-indiana-state-police-say/98956208/\">received</a> over 11,000 leads from across the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“I consider Delphi to be the first case that hit that land speed record in terms of [generating] interest in it at once,” defense attorney Bob Motta, who hosts the <a href=\"https://defensediaries.com/\"><em>Defense Diaries</em></a> podcast, tells Vox. This is the rare case that law enforcement <em>wanted</em> to go viral. Police turned to the wider public in the hope of generating leads, and when public interest waned, they kept the case on the national media radar by doling out new tidbits of information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the police seemed to clamp down hard when it came to providing vital context for the info they shared. Even six years later, there’s scant information on the official ISP <a href=\"https://www.in.gov/isp/crime-reporting/delphi-homicide-investigation/\">tip page</a>. (A spokesperson for the Indiana State Police was unable to comment on the investigation due to a recent court gag order.) The little information the police did reveal was often confusing, baffling, even contradictory. This limbo left the public with no real guidelines for how to be helpful — which may have rendered them anything but.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The first police sketch, and the chaos it awakened</h2>\n\n<p>On July 17, 2017, authorities <a href=\"https://www.jconline.com/story/news/crime/2017/07/17/new-details-released-delphi-double-homicide-investigation/483717001/\">released a sketch</a> of a suspect based on an eyewitness sighting. ISP Sgt. Kim Riley informed the public at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_oZ51DmANo\">press conference</a> that authorities believed this to be “the same person” captured in the stills from German’s video, a.k.a. Bridge Guy.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469098/delphi_bg1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.470976223224,100,39.058047553553\" alt=\"Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”\" title=\"Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The first released sketch of a man believed to be “Bridge Guy.” | Indiana State Police\" data-portal-copyright=\"Indiana State Police\" />\n<p>This sketch opened the floodgates for online guesswork. Just two days after the sketch’s release, ISP was <a href=\"https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/isp-to-facebook-users-stop-armchair-sleuthing-on-delphi-murders/507-457927682\">cautioning</a> “armchair sleuths” to stop posting side-by-side images of the suspect sketch and random men on social media. Online, suspicion was often aimed at the victims’ family members as well as unaffiliated Delphi residents and men across the US — anyone and everyone who bore a passing resemblance to the sketch. Two Delphi residents who have the same name both experienced intense harassment after multiple true crime podcasts hinted at the involvement of one of them, again based on nothing more than speculation.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple people I spoke with lamented the current state of online sleuthing around the case, but blamed the pointed but incomplete information coming from law enforcement for leading to the anarchy online. “I don’t think of myself as having been drawn to the online community in this case so much as having been ‘pushed’ to the online community due to law enforcement being so tight-lipped,” Robby Coleman, a 36-year-old Indianapolis websleuth, tells Vox. “This was the only avenue for learning <em>anything</em> for years.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The second sketch, and a trail going cold</h2>\n\n<p>Despite this frenzy of interest in the case, for the next two years, there were no significant developments. Then, on April 22, 2019, authorities unveiled an onslaught of information. Among the reveals was an amended <a href=\"https://www.heraldbulletin.com/news/newly-released-audio-in-delphi-murders/audio_3463bf8e-651f-11e9-8111-a3596f4bc66c.html\">audio clip</a> of the killer, in which he could be heard saying one extra word; “Guys, down the hill,” and a two-second video clip of the image they’d previously provided stills of. Both clips raised more questions than answers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube alignnone\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seWioxRdQ5k\n</div></figure>\n\n<p>The most puzzling reveal was a new suspect sketch, reportedly drawn early in 2017. Authorities presented it as a replacement for the old sketch, eventually <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/04/24/2-sketches-delphi-murders-case-not-same-man-indiana-state-police-say/3564467002/\">clarifying</a> that this was an entirely new suspect — a man in his mid-20s to 30s, where “Bridge Guy” appeared to be 40-50. Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter described the investigation as “shift[ing] gears to a different investigative strategy,” without specifying what that strategy was.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469099/delpthi_ybg.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,28.184991273997,100,43.630017452007\" alt=\"Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”\" title=\"Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The second released sketch of a man believed to be “Bridge Guy.” | Indiana State Police\" data-portal-copyright=\"Indiana State Police\" />\n<p>After two years, was the case back to square one?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Any hope that this about-face would lead to renewed momentum quickly faded: Another two years passed before there was a significant update in the case — or at least one that seemed significant at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2021, authorities arrested a man named <a href=\"https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/man-behind-anthony_shots-account-charged-for-child-porn-docs-dont-tie-him-to-delphi-case/\">Kegan Kline</a>, a 27-year-old resident of nearby Peru, Indiana, who had been linked to an <a href=\"https://www.wrtv.com/news/public-safety/detectives-looking-for-information-related-to-social-media-account-in-connection-to-abby-and-libby-investigation\">online catfishing account</a>. Although authorities have never named Kline as a person of interest in the Delphi investigation, they made it clear they believed there was a connection. Kline was subsequently prosecuted for <a href=\"https://www.wishtv.com/news/indiana-news/judge-dismisses-five-child-pornography-charges-against-kegan-kline/\">25 charges</a> related to possession of child sexual abuse material and child exploitation; his trial is currently scheduled for May 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In early February 2022, the ISP’s Carter <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-speak-directly-unknown-delphi-killer-today-day/story?id=82375198\">did an interview</a> with ABC in which he stated — in what was certainly news to those following the case — that police “know a lot” about the killer, without saying anything about what, or who, that might mean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A cold trail gets hot online</h2>\n\n<p>Following Carter’s interview, ambivalence from law enforcement again enabled the websleuths to fill in the gaps with chaos. On numerous <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DelphiMurders/\">subreddits</a> and other forums, hordes of “leakers” tout exclusive insider intel and spout arcane theories built around regional gossip and local politics: law enforcement cover-ups, drug ring conspiracies, sheriffs with tunnel vision, former prosecutors with vendettas, officers maligned for doing their jobs too well, an investigation driven more by the vicissitudes of local elections rather than a pursuit of justice — every “murder in a small town” trope you can foist onto one crime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To even be able to read most of the Delphi forums, you have to learn a glossary of acronyms and shorthand lingo — BG (Bridge Guy), FSG (Flannel Shirt Guy, one of the witnesses seen on the bridge), OBG (Old Bridge Guy), YBG (Young Bridge Guy), LE (law enforcement), MBW (“Muddy and Bloody” Woman — we’ll get to her), and an endless parade of other people referred to only by their initials. Anyone who surmounts that barrier to entry is already more likely to be invested in the case — and more likely to find themselves joining in the rampant, furious finger-pointing that accompanies it.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24470188/1244396301.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"Indiana State Police press conference\" title=\"Indiana State Police press conference\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Carroll County Sheriff Tobias Leazenby speaks during a press conference on the murders in 2022. | Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\" />\n<p>One of the most polarizing constituents is <a href=\"https://murdersheetpodcast.com/\"><em>The Murder Sheet</em></a>, a podcast by a husband-and-wife team who originally met and bonded over true crime. Áine Cain, a former senior retail reporter at Insider, and Kevin Greenlee, an attorney, wanted to bring their professional roles to the podcast. In an interview, Cain says the show focuses on journalism that “furthers your understanding of the case.” They’ve arguably been successful; they’ve gotten several exclusives, like excavating the 2017 <a href=\"https://interactive.wthr.com/pdfs/logan-warrrant.pdf\">search warrant</a> of the property where the girls were found. (Suspicions against the property owner, Ronald Logan, have lingered and continue to run rampant; Logan was never named a person of interest and <a href=\"https://heavy.com/news/ronald-ron-logan-delphi-murders/\">reportedly</a> died in 2022.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Online, however, despite Cain’s long journalism career, and perhaps because they began as true crime fans, some sleuths <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimePodcasts/comments/wwhjeb/is_murder_sheet_worth_it/\">see them</a> as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LibbyandAbby/comments/xzed3h/murder_sheet_discussion_thread/#irn6wrn\">little more</a> than glorified redditors.&nbsp;Then there’s the issue of money. The podcast is self-sustaining (“just barely”), and Cain and Greenlee have recently gone full-time. That move, in turn, invites <a href=\"https://twitter.com/libertyg_sister/status/1526283798190645250\">criticism</a> that the podcasters are exploiting tragedy for personal gain.&nbsp;Yet <em>The Murder Sheet</em> is far from the only monetized true crime project focused on this case. One <a href=\"https://beyondhighbrow.com/delphi/\">forum</a> advertises a secretive community with exclusive access to private information from law enforcement ($20 to join; the owner told Vox he<strong> </strong>has made over $5,000 from the entry fees alone). The <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2022/10/31/the-big-business-of-true-crime/\">massive growth</a> of the true crime industry means more people than ever are engaging in the space — and not always ethically. One popular podcast courted controversy when it aired a series of episodes in which the hosts put forth speculation about a random Delphi resident with no known connection to the crime.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Murder Sheet</em>’s biggest find arguably came in 2022: <a href=\"https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tx-statement-Kegan-Kline-10-19-2-FINAL-VERSION-Redacted-1.pdf\">a transcript</a> of a police interview with Kegan Kline. The interview contained a wealth of new information. Yet the pair came under fire from other <a href=\"https://www.thefalllinepodcast.com/episodes/2022/5/25/true-crime-revolution-sarah-turney-part-2\">podcasters</a> and onlookers for leaking info and reportedly initially leaving in an unredacted identifying detail. The transcript, however, provided the first substantiated link between Kline and the murders. Kline admitted in it to having previously interacted with Libby German.</p>\n\n<p>This flurry of online activity stood in stark contrast to the radio silence from law enforcement. By 2022, even the victims’ families were voicing their frustrations. “They don’t know what they’re doing,” German’s mother <a href=\"https://www.953mnc.com/2022/05/27/delphi-victims-mom-growing-weary-frustrated-with-lack-of-case-progress/\">told reporters</a> in May.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In October of that year, however, the state of the case abruptly changed — with a surprising, confounding arrest.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A sudden arrest and a whole new set of questions</h2>\n\n<p>On October 26, 2022, <a href=\"https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/arrest-made-in-delphi-murder-investigation-sources-say\">authorities arrested</a> a Delphi resident: <a href=\"https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/who-is-richard-allen-suspect-in-murders-of-libby-abby-is-pharmacy-tech-and-longtime-delphi-community-member\">Richard Allen</a>, a 50-year-old CVS pharmacy employee with no criminal record.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A few days later, authorities confirmed the arrest in a frustratingly brief press conference. It took another month for the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23321732-probable-cause-affidavit-filed\">arrest affidavit</a> to be unsealed, revealing the stunning truth behind the arrest: Allen had actually gone to police in 2017, shortly after the murders, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/source-investigators-have-known-for-years-that-the-delphi-suspect-was-on-the-monon-high-bridge-the-day-abby-and-libby-were-killed/\">identified himself</a>&nbsp;as having been on the bridge on February 13.</p>\n\n<p>Why had it taken so long to find him? Media reports <a href=\"https://www.wane.com/news/clerical-error-may-have-led-police-to-overlook-richard-allen-in-delphi-case-source-claims/\">blamed the snafu on the FBI</a>, hinting that a filing error by “a civilian FBI employee” led to the delay. Was it really that simple? Did the investigation spin its wheels for five years for no reason at all?</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469109/delphi_allen.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.5551427123797,100,92.889714575241\" alt=\"Richard Allen mug shot\" title=\"Richard Allen mug shot\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A mug shot of Richard Allen, charged in the Delphi murders. | Indiana State Police\" data-portal-copyright=\"Indiana State Police\" />\n<p>The most overwhelming evidence for Allen’s guilt is that he placed himself on the bridge and he looks like Bridge Guy. According to the affidavit, Allen’s self-identified outfit of a blue jacket and jeans matched that of the suspect. This could, on the one hand, be highly damning circumstantial evidence; if he didn’t realize Libby German had caught him on camera, he’d think nothing of placing himself on the bridge. Then again, he was arguably wearing one of the most generic outfits in Indiana: a blue Carhartt jacket and jeans.</p>\n\n<p>The multiple eyewitness sightings of Bridge Guy are consistent with Allen. One woman claimed to have seen a man who fits Allen’s description looking “muddy and bloody.”&nbsp;Then there are the ballistics. According to the affidavit, an unspent shell casing was found lying between the bodies of the victims — a casing investigators were able to match to Allen’s gun. There’s no mention in the affidavit of DNA, so this could be the best forensic evidence the state presents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are several problems with this, however. For starters, the entire field of ballistics evidence is increasingly considered to be <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-field-of-firearms-forensics-is-flawed/\">subjective pseudoscience</a> rather than legitimate forensics. And even among already-shaky ballistics, matching an individual gun cartridge to an unspent casing is an extremely rare type of evidence. In <a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/murder-sheet/episodes/39ba2b53-ce09-4a22-a2ff-e5715ee768ad\">an interview</a> with <em>The</em> <em>Murder Sheet</em>, one anonymous criminal defense attorney said he’d never seen an unspent shell casing presented as evidence in a trial.</p>\n\n<p>The probable cause affidavit has divided followers of the murders into camps; Allen’s defense released a strongly worded <a href=\"https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/delphi-girls-murdered/delphi-murders-hearing-richard-allen-defense-attorneys-speak/531-612e9590-ace8-4b93-8f7c-a674228d71c6\">rebuttal</a> to it, pointing out the many gaps in the investigation. Meanwhile, the case is under a <a href=\"https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/delphi-girls-murdered/special-judge-decision-public-court-documents-released-delphi-indiana-murders-abby-williams-libby-german-richard-allen/531-2e2a1a98-8d49-4a0c-88e8-9623ad7e6193\">gag order</a>, which means no more information will be forthcoming until trial. The first hearing was recently <a href=\"https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/delphi-murders-trial-hearing-scheduled-for-friday-is-postponed\">delayed</a> because the prosecution had yet to <a href=\"https://www.wane.com/news/indiana/defense-asks-for-delay-in-feb-17-bail-hearing-for-delphi-murder-suspect-richard-allen/\">turn over</a> all of its evidence to the defense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If Allen is Bridge Guy, then his role in the crime raises numerous questions. Was he acting alone or — as prosecutors have <a href=\"https://people.com/crime/accused-delphi-killer-not-only-actor-involved-prosecutor/\">claimed</a> — with others? Is Kegan Kline still somehow connected to the murders? If Ronald Logan was the original hot choice for Bridge Guy, as indicated in the search warrant for his property, why didn’t law enforcement pursue him as a person of interest more diligently?&nbsp;And why did Allen continue living in Delphi, even keeping his clothes from the day of the homicides, as though nothing had happened?</p>\n\n<p>If there’s little forensic evidence tying Allen to the crime, then the abundance of alternate suspects could present a gold mine for his defense. Meanwhile, websleuths continue pursuing their own agendas — to the point that, even if Allen is found guilty, there will likely be plenty who reject the verdict. “You need to accept that Ron Logan is Bridge Guy,” the whistleblower tells me. When asked about the lack of evidence, he retorts, “I don’t care about evidence, there’s no such thing as evidence.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He has a point: If there’s anything true crime teaches us, it’s that facts, circumstances, evidence, proof, doubt, and truth are all often in the eye of the beholder. “There’s a million Scott Petersons out there,” <em>Defense Diaries’</em> Motta says, referring to the convicted family annihilator whose guilt has lately been a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23506125/casey-anthony-evidence-where-the-truth-lies-how-true-or-false\">trendy topic</a> of debate. “If people start digging they’re going to find warts on every single case.” He feels there likely will be no narrative resolution. “It’ll always be left for us to wonder.”</p>\n\n<p>And yet, ironically, as C.J. Hoyt, news director of the Indianapolis news stations Fox59 and CBS4, points out, if Allen is guilty, it won’t be in any way because of the years of obsessive work by armchair detectives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“I think any exposure can be good,” he said, “but there are elements that can clearly be harmful, especially to the victims’ families. An example of that would be the person trying to sell crime scene photos. But like most cases, the online community didn’t factor in at all when it came to solving it — if Allen is, in fact, the killer.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469113/libby_abby_via_fb.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.708427060106,100,78.583145879787\" alt=\"Two young girls, their faces blurry in the dark, wear light-up glow stick glasses as the sun sets behind them.\" title=\"Two young girls, their faces blurry in the dark, wear light-up glow stick glasses as the sun sets behind them.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Liberty German, left, and Abby Williams. | Facebook\" data-portal-copyright=\"Facebook\" />\n<p>And that might be the biggest irony of all — because however obstructing, counterproductive, or messy their efforts are, every websleuth I spoke to says they do it not because of the game, the thrill of the chase, or the clout, but because of Abby and Libby — the girls who had a sleepover the night before and awoke early that morning, excited about having a day off school. They helped Libby’s grandmother with filing papers in exchange for pocket money; they wanted to go shopping later that afternoon, after the bridge.</p>\n\n<p>“Last year, I took my own kids to the bridge,” Coleman told me. “I didn’t tell them what happened. They thought it was just a neat hike. They noticed the teddy bears and the memorials and asked, but I kept it at arm’s length. But I needed that to keep perspective. To make it real. A lot of the people in these groups need their own moment like that.”</p>\n\n<p>And even those furthest down the rabbit hole say they are doing it for the girls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“I believe the girls are watching this,” the whistleblower tells me. “I believe the girls are helping.”</p>\n\n<p>Still, the empathy only extends so far. When he talks about the mother of one of the victims, he’s derisive. “She’s blocked, we don’t care about her.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Then he tosses in an aside: He wants me to know he knows who killed <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Natalie-Wood\">Natalie Wood</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469043/libby_monon.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,35.274869109948,100,29.450261780105\" alt=\"A vertical photo of the length of an old, disused railroad bridge, surrounded by the tops of trees.\" title=\"A vertical photo of the length of an old, disused railroad bridge, surrounded by the tops of trees.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"One of the last photos taken from Liberty German’s phone, posted to Snapchat. | Snapchat via Facebook\" data-portal-copyright=\"Snapchat via Facebook\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Clarification, March 6, 1 pm ET:</strong> This story, originally published March 6 at 7 am, has been changed to reflect a source’s preferred job title.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, November 11, 2014, 3:45 pm ET</em>:</strong> <em>This story has been updated with news of Richard Allen’s conviction.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The answer Democrats find most persuasive could greatly influence the party’s direction as it tries to win again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This debate will clearly go on for some time, and disentangling causality is difficult. But one way to think about it is to break up the question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How much of the defeat was about Harris’s weakness as a candidate or her campaign strategy? How much was about Donald Trump’s strengths? How much was about President Joe Biden’s record? How much was about the Democratic Party brand generally? And how much was due to larger structural factors like a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893\">global anti-incumbent trend</a>?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s possible that all of these played some role in the outcome, especially because issues like inflation can resonate across them all. But let’s go through them. </p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9146325452\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"was-harris-an-unusually-weak-candidate\">Was Harris an unusually weak candidate?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any candidate who loses tends to get defined, in retrospect, as an obvious loser. So naturally, lots of the Democratic finger-pointing has been pointing at Harris. But how convincing is it?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris had some real strengths: her record as a former prosecutor, her formidable fundraising, and the fact that she was a fresh face. But many had grave doubts about her prospects <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362277/kamala-harris-donald-trump-polling\">all along</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s political rise in deep-blue San Francisco, and later statewide in California, came by cultivating support among Democratic elites; she had never had to run in a swing state and therefore never developed a political style designed to appeal to swing voters. It was far from clear what those swing voters would make of her when she entered the 2024 race. (The one time before this year that she faced a decent Republican opponent — her first run for California attorney general, in 2010 — she barely won.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her campaign strategy was cautious and defensive. In her prior presidential campaign and during the vice presidency, she’d done several <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html\">high-profile interviews</a> that went poorly, which spurred her to avoid such interviews. In this bid, she was happy to prosecute the case against Trump on the debate stage, but seemed much less comfortable when it was her being grilled. She often spoke in talking points and platitudes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was also her record. When Harris was trying to win the 2020 Democratic primary, she ran to the left, taking several policy positions (like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/09/19/harris-fracking-reversal-may-have-a-sequel-00180080\">banning fracking</a>) that did not seem politically tenable. Trump’s team used one clip from that campaign, when <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/harris-position-on-health-care-for-transgender-prisoners-and-detainees/\">she touted</a> how she’d worked to ensure transgender inmates in California could access gender-affirming care, in a heavily funded attack ad. It <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html\">concluded with the line</a>: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her campaign strategy hinged on trying to tack to the center, disavowing or simply avoiding her past positions, sending out signals to the business community that she’d be friendlier to them, while using former Rep. Liz Cheney as a Republican validator. She did not break with the Biden administration or the mainstream Democratic consensus on any issue of significance. She did not run as a bold populist or progressive, either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there’s gender and race. Many have wondered whether the voter backlash against her was due to sexism — particularly due to preliminary numbers suggesting the swing against her was most intense among men. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html\">New York Times reports</a> that the Trump team’s ads often showed Harris “laughing or dancing in a colorful blouse and pink pants,” because Trump’s goal was “to make her look like a lightweight.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But is Harris getting too much of the blame? Evidence suggests the guy she replaced at the top of the ticket, Joe Biden, would have done much worse. One <a href=\"https://x.com/YouGovAmerica/status/1854895311644172605\">post-election poll</a> found Trump would have beaten him by 7 percentage points nationally. Perhaps she did a decent job of playing a bad hand: the Biden administration’s record.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"was-it-biden-s-fault\">Was it Biden’s fault?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s initial attempt to run for reelection — before it was curtailed by his disastrous debate — limited the time and options available to Harris. But the bigger problem may have simply been that she was his vice president, and his administration was very unpopular.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blueprint, a Democratic polling initiative, <a href=\"https://blueprint2024.com/polling/why-trump-reasons-11-8/\">published research</a> showing that two of the three most effective arguments for pushing swing voters away from Harris were that “inflation was too high under the Biden-Harris administration” and that “too many immigrants illegally crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling all year has shown that inflation and immigration were Democrats’ biggest vulnerabilities. So part of the party’s second-guessing will naturally involve whether Biden should have made different policy choices to produce different outcomes in those areas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden did not cause inflation, but his American Rescue Plan <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23036340/biden-american-rescue-plan-inflation\">did make it worse</a>, which resulted in higher prices and necessitated bigger interest rate hikes than would have happened otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His administration was also slow to adjust, and though a “soft landing” without a recession eventually resulted, voters hated the enduring high prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the border, too, Biden only belatedly pivoted. After a huge increase in the number of unauthorized immigrants arriving at the border in 2021 and onward, Democrats in blue states and cities struggled to deal with the logistics of so many arrivals, and public backlash brewed. Late in 2023, Biden tried to pass a border security bill through Congress, but failed — in part due to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050278/senate-immigration-border-ukraine-trump-mcconnell-romney\">opposition from Donald Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In mid-2024, the combination of a deal with Mexico and new executive orders seemed to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/border-crossings-dropped-lowest-level-biden-administration-september-rcna174574\">finally cut down</a> on border crossings. But it’s possible Biden could have done more earlier, limiting the effectiveness of immigration as an attack on Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, Israel’s war in Gaza bitterly divided the Democratic coalition. There was probably no way to make everyone happy here, and polling <a href=\"https://blueprint2024.com/polling/why-trump-reasons-11-8/\">does not show it</a> as a top reason swing voters turned against Harris. But the ugly controversy over Biden’s support for Israel (and Harris’s support for Biden’s policy) may have hurt her in Michigan and cut down on the left’s enthusiasm for her. It’s unlikely to have been decisive, but it certainly didn’t help.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"was-trump-an-unusually-strong-candidate\">Was Trump an unusually strong candidate?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The political conventional wisdom has generally been that Trump is a weak candidate who’s been holding Republicans back — that his 2016 win was a fluke reliant on the Electoral College; that he was quite unpopular as president; that voters rejected him and his party in 2018, 2020, and (sort of) 2022; and that the GOP was taking a massive risk by nominating him again after he tried to steal the last presidential election and was indicted four times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Trump may have been unusually well-positioned to take advantage of dissatisfaction with the Biden administration’s record on the economy and immigration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s persona as a celebrity businessman, one who many voters view as especially savvy about the economy, has been an advantage for him in polls <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schiller-trump-victory-economy-20161109-story.html\">since his first campaign</a>. That wasn’t enough to save him amid the chaos of 2020, but given what’s ensued since, many Americans have looked back on Trump’s governing record more fondly. Voters have given him retrospective credit for the strong economy and low inflation environment of 2017 through 2019, while not really blaming him for the pandemic. Focus groups again and again <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/opinion/election-focus-groups.html\">came back to the idea</a> that voters hated the Biden economy and thought Trump could fix it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383197/kamala-harris-results-underperformed-democratic-senate-candidates\">Trump’s outperformance of many down-ballot Republican candidates</a> in key races — in part due to split-ticket voting, in part due to Trump voters simply not voting down-ballot — suggests there was a significant bloc of “I don’t like Republicans much, but the economy was better under Trump” voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On immigration, too, there was a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift\">stunning swing</a> of public opinion to the right during Biden’s term, as border arrivals soared, which may have played to Trump’s advantage.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"was-this-a-backlash-against-the-democratic-party-for-going-too-far-left\">Was this a backlash against the Democratic Party for going too far left?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One theory floating around is that the results show the public is punishing the Democratic Party for having moved too far left.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Josh Barro made this argument in <a href=\"https://www.joshbarro.com/p/trump-didnt-deserve-to-win-but-we\">a Substack post</a>, citing poor Democratic governance in blue states and cities as well as “woke” far-left policies on crime, schooling, and trans rights as likely causes of public frustration. Perhaps this explains some of the disproportionate shifts against Harris we saw in deep-blue states like New York, as well as progressive prosecutors losing and a tough-on-crime ballot proposition <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-06/tide-shifts-against-criminal-justice-reform-among-california-voters\">passing in California</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A counterpoint to this is that Democrats’ swing-state Senate candidates did well — several of them won despite Harris losing their states — and that even amid the backlash in New York, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/democrats-house-ny.html\">flipped several House seats</a> in New York. That could be read to suggest the problem had less to do with the Democratic Party and more to do with the top of the ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Democrats did likely lose the national popular vote as well as the presidency, so it’s hard to argue that the party’s political positioning is optimal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And demographic trends could be read as quite ominous for the party. As my colleague Eric Levitz recently wrote, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/383565/2024-election-results-kamala-harris-loss-democrats-future\">Democrats lost serious ground</a> with both working-class voters and nonwhite voters. If those trends continue, the party will be in deep trouble, as there simply aren’t enough college-educated white voters in the electorate to get anywhere near a majority. So some are arguing that the party has simply become too dominated by the concerns of upscale white college graduates — and that they desperately need to change that.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"was-it-just-due-to-a-global-trend\">Was it just due to a global trend?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, another school of thought holds that perhaps the explanation for the outcome doesn’t lie in the United States at all. Perhaps it’s just the latest example of a worldwide trend of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893\">incumbents doing poorly</a> in democracies holding elections in the post-pandemic years. Inflation, as a worldwide trend caused by supply-side disruptions and foreign crises, is a big part of the reason for that global struggle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Every governing party facing election in a developed country this year lost vote share, the first time this has ever happened,” John Burn-Murdoch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893\">reported for the Financial Times</a>. “It’s possible there is just no set of policies or personas that can overcome the current global anti-incumbent wave.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, it is worth keeping in mind that Trump won quite narrowly, by just 2 percentage points or less in the decisive swing states. On the one hand, that could suggest Democrats did a surprisingly good job among structural headwinds, starting from behind and closing the gap as much as possible — even if it wasn’t ultimately enough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, it could suggest that more could have been done. Was it really fated that there was absolutely nothing Democrats could have done over the past four years to improve their margin by 2 more points, however strong the headwinds?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever the answer, Democrats have two years until their next chance to take back a branch of the federal government — and plenty to figure out in the meantime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, November 11, 2024, 2:10 pm ET</em></strong>: <em>This article, initially published on November 9, has been updated with more detail on demographic challenges facing the Democratic Party.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In 2018, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/monkeys-escape-alpha-genesis-south-carolina-640eb78119c66b88a418ccd1e361318e\">fined</a> the facility $12,600 in part for other incidents in which monkeys had escaped. “We’re not strangers to seeing monkeys randomly,” a nearby resident and member of the Yemassee town council <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/science/escaped-monkeys-south-carolina.html\">told</a> the New York Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alpha Genesis is now working to recapture the macaques, who are each about the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-escaped-monkeys-latest/\">size of a cat</a>; over the weekend, 25 of them were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/monkey-captured-south-carolina.html\">recovered</a>. Meanwhile, the animal protection group <a href=\"https://saenonline.org/media2/news-20241108.html\">Stop Animal Exploitation Now</a>, which for <a href=\"https://saenonline.org/res-fr-sc-ag.html\">years has filed</a> federal complaints against the facility, has <a href=\"https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/11/08/animal-welfare-group-files-federal-complaint-against-facility-that-lost-43-monkeys-sc/\">called</a> on the USDA to prosecute Alpha Genesis as a repeat violator of its duty to keep the animals secure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The recovery process is slow, but the team is committed to taking as much time as necessary to safely recover all remaining animals,” a Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TownYemasseeSC/posts/pfbid02WgwH7Fo78UbfJa2rn4eDiVDfdjFU5Dxq1PaPnspDPgFqesKefkDtxFbsDu8nLoTvl\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.facebook.com/TownYemasseeSC/posts/pfbid02WgwH7Fo78UbfJa2rn4eDiVDfdjFU5Dxq1PaPnspDPgFqesKefkDtxFbsDu8nLoTvl\">post</a> from the Yemassee Police Department said, attributing the comment to Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In one way, this is a story about what looks like a corporate failure. But there is another way to understand this situation, both legally and morally. What if these intrepid macaques, who the lab has said pose no threat to the public and carry no infectious diseases, have a legal claim to freedom?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The legal status of wild animals is more contested and malleable than ever, evident in the recent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/6/21/23173019/happy-elephant-bronx-zoo-new-york-lamda-artificial-intelligence-ai-google\">court case</a> arguing that Happy, an elephant living at the Bronx Zoo, was a legal person entitled to freedom, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364284/peta-protests-animal-rights-factory-farming-effective\">phasing out</a> of animal use at entertainment venues like circuses, and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24055003/long-tailed-macaques-biomedical-testing-ozempic-covid-endangered-species-act-cambodia\">end</a> of US lab experimentation on chimpanzees. While Alpha Genesis may have a strong financial incentive to recapture the escaped monkeys, longstanding legal doctrines suggest that the 18 monkeys still at large may not belong to the company as long as they remain free and outside of its custody. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">State officials, or perhaps even members of the public, might even be legally protected in rescuing these monkeys from a fate of cage confinement and invasive experimentation and bringing them to a sanctuary. Such an outcome would matter not just for these monkeys but also for the rights of captive animals more broadly.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>When a captive animal becomes free</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For many people, the idea of a lost animal becoming the property of another person might seem absurd. Certainly, no one would imagine forfeiting the companionship of a beloved dog or cat because the animal got out of the yard and was found by someone else. Neither law nor morality treats the escape of a domesticated animal as tantamount to a forfeiture of all claims to the animal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But when it comes to wild animals, the law is different.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When a captive wild animal escapes, their captor generally remains liable for any damage the escaped animal creates to persons or property, but they may lose ownership of the animal, especially if the creature integrates into an existing wild population (sometimes called “reverting to the common stock”). That might sound unlikely for rhesus macaques in the US — the species is <a href=\"https://neprimateconservancy.org/rhesus-macaque/\">native to South and Southeast Asia</a> and has been exported around the world for lab testing. But it turns out that it’s perfectly possible to live as a free-roaming rhesus macaque in South Carolina, where a more than four-decade-old population of the monkeys resides on the state’s Morgan Island, <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/island-vacations/morgan-island-south-carolina-monkeys\">also known as “Monkey Island.”</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Originally relocated from Puerto Rico between 1979 and 1980, the Morgan Island macaques now <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/morgan-island\">serve</a> as a kind of reservoir of lab monkeys for the US government. Last year, Alpha Genesis <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/alpha-genesis-takes-over-management-of-south-carolinas-monkey-island/article_fb08a7d2-ce5a-11ed-bd91-8b72f090aac4.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawGZbOlleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHYFCnOM0YaH8R9NKM1GPESXxRu2_0yPiEOUsZpelHpzWpsXMFnJkDLJ7hg_aem_wVg-y1EC5pzq9QdpOLgs2w\">won a federal contract</a> to oversee the monkey colony there — in fact, the 43 escaped macaques had originally lived as “free-range” monkeys on the island before they were taken to be used for testing and research purposes, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-escaped-monkeys-what-we-know/\">told</a> CBS News in a statement. While these monkeys may not be able to rejoin the Morgan Island colony on their own, the fact that they came from a wild population strengthens the view of them as animals who not only can live in the wild but who deserve to be free.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2183021045.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"An adult monkey sitting on a tree branch cradles a baby monkey. \" title=\"An adult monkey sitting on a tree branch cradles a baby monkey. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Rhesus macaques on Morgan Island. | The State/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"The State/Getty Images\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-992170816_a21be1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.546269193932,100,34.907461612135\" alt=\"A macaque in a laboratory cage, surrounded by other cages with no visible occupants, looks through the bars.\" title=\"A macaque in a laboratory cage, surrounded by other cages with no visible occupants, looks through the bars.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A macaque sits in a cage in a University of Muenster laboratory in Muenster, Germany, on November 24, 2017. | Friso Gentsch/picture alliance via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Friso Gentsch/picture alliance via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our modern understanding of animals’ legal status derives from 19th-century American common law cases, which adopted the classical Roman legal approach to wild animals, or <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ferae_naturae\">ferae naturae</a>. Under that system, wild animals were a special type of property known as “fugitive” property because they could move freely and weren’t owned by anyone before being captured by a human. This created unique legal challenges — for example, conflicts between two hunters claiming the same animal — that can help us understand the case of the escaped monkeys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 1805 New York Supreme Court case <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/REPORTER/archives/pierson_post.htm\"><em>Pierson v. Post</em></a>, sometimes considered the most famous property case in American law (and about which one of us has written <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/ca/universitypress/subjects/law/property-law/pierson-v-post-hunt-fox-law-and-professionalization-american-legal-culture?format=PB\">a book</a>), is the starting point for understanding who legally owns a wild animal. In a dispute between two hunters, one who had been in hot pursuit of a fox and one who swooped in to kill the animal, the case held that the property interest of the latter was stronger. The court made clear that a definitive capture, and not pursuit alone, was necessary to establish and retain ownership of a wild animal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1898, another New York case, <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/mullett-v-bradley\"><em>Mullett v. Bradley</em></a>,<em> </em>went further by recognizing that capture alone is not sufficient to claim ownership of a wild animal if the animal is able to escape and regain their liberty. The court found that a sea lion who had been brought by rail from the Pacific Ocean to the East Coast and later escaped from an enclosure in Long Island Sound was legally free until he was captured by a different person two weeks later. Cases like these gave rise to a doctrine that legal scholars now call “the law of capture,” which holds that if a captive wild animal escapes and control over them is lost, they no longer necessarily belong to the party who had previously captured them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This line of legal reasoning generally works to the detriment of animals, ensuring that each generation of law students learns that animals are ours to possess and use for our own ends. But in the case of the escaped South Carolina monkeys, the law of capture raises doubt about whether the lab retains ownership of the animals unless and until it recaptures them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A more recent Canadian case suggests that the law of capture may indeed offer a path to rescue for escaped animals like the South Carolina lab monkeys. In 2012, Darwin, a Japanese snow macaque, became a worldwide media sensation when he was <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/stylish-but-illegal-monkey-caught-at-ikea-156237185/\">found roaming through an Ontario Ikea store</a> wearing a shearling coat and a diaper. While Darwin had been kept as a pet, a Canadian court <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ikea-monkey-mom-ordered-to-pay-83k-in-legal-costs-to-sanctuary-1.2501250\">ruled</a> that he was a wild animal, and his owner lost her rights to him after he escaped from her car. Toronto Animal Services <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/8650292/what-happened-to-darwin-ikea-monkey/\">captured</a> Darwin inside the store and transferred him to a primate sanctuary, where he could live among other macaques.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, one could argue that the escaped lab monkeys in South Carolina are effectively domestic animals who belong to their owner. Alpha Genesis has put resources into housing and raising them, including managing the monkey population on Morgan Island. But unlike pets who have been domesticated over many generations to live safely among humans, these rhesus macaques retain their wild instincts — they’ve been described as <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/8/more-than-40-monkeys-on-the-loose-in-us-town-after-escaping-lab\">skittish</a>, and food is being used to lure them into traps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the monkeys were to return on their own, like a house cat coming home after a day of adventure, the legal case for viewing them as domestic animals would be stronger because wild animals, once they stray, must have no animus revertendi, or intention to return. So long as these monkeys express their desire to remain free by evading capture, they should be considered wild animals. A 1917 Ontario court case, <em>Campbell v. Hedley</em>, involving a fox who had escaped a fur farm, established a similar principle, finding that the animal remained wild and thereby became free after fleeing the farm because they belonged to a species that “require[d] the exercise of art, force, or skill to keep them in subjection.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are, to be sure, cases in which common law courts have found losing control of an animal does not result in a loss of ownership. A 1927 Colorado case, <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/stephens-v-albers\"><em>Stephens v. Albers</em></a>, held that a semi-domesticated silver fox who escaped from a fur farm still remained the property of that owner. And questions about the ownership of wild animals are infinitely debatable, as any good student of <em>Pierson v. Post</em> will tell you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While these past cases offer important insight into the treatment of wild animals under common law, none of them took place in South Carolina, so courts in that state could consider them for guidance but wouldn’t be required to follow them when deciding who owns the escaped Alpha Genesis monkeys (and nothing in this piece should be construed as legal advice).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The moral </strong>meaning of animal escapes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet the law of capture aside, the plight of these monkeys is also interesting to us as legal scholars because it highlights one of many disconnects between the law and our moral intuitions about animals who have escaped and who are seeking or being afforded sanctuary. As journalist Tove Danovich has <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2018/05/17/wild-at-heart/\">written</a>, there is often great public sympathy and compassion for animals who escape painful confinement or slaughter at zoos, factory farms, or research labs — even among people who might otherwise tolerate the very systems that normalize those animals’ suffering. The public’s outrage when a single cow who <a href=\"https://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/cow-fatally-shot-in-pocatello-after-escaping-from-meat-processing-facility/article_1cca0746-868b-11ef-aecb-17af9aa8cfe2.html\">escapes slaughter is gunned down</a> by authorities is palpable and crosses ideological lines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is something enchanting and powerful, even romantic, about the idea of an animal escape, especially if it results in the animal’s rescue from confinement. Yet the law generally fails to recognize the moral tug that these escapes place on our collective conscience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a recent high-profile <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/nyregion/missing-cows-animal-sanctuary-newfane-ny.html\">case</a> in upstate New York, two cows wandered onto an animal sanctuary after escaping from a neighboring ranch. Unlike the South Carolina monkeys, these were straightforwardly domesticated animals, and the response from local law enforcement was harsh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sanctuary owner, Tracy Murphy, was arrested, shackled, and faced criminal liability for taking the cows in and refusing to immediately turn them over for slaughter (one of us, Justin, was defense counsel for Murphy, whose case was <a href=\"https://www.niagara-gazette.com/opinion/editorial-major-conflict-in-cow-theft-case-warrants-probe/article_9ec60e46-815b-11ef-b68c-5b7d1740db84.html\">dismissed</a> last month after a two-year legal battle). Her aid to two escaped cows was widely vilified by her neighbors and by local law enforcement because our legal system continues to treat many animals as property without any recognized rights or interests of their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The law is unlikely to swiftly abandon the archaic notion of human ownership over nonhuman animals. But we believe the law does implicitly recognize a right to rescue escaped animals, at least those who are lucky enough to make it on their own steam. We hope that the case of the escaped South Carolina monkeys will inspire conversations about the right of at least some animals to liberate themselves from exploitation and harm at human hands. Escapes are rare, but when they happen against all odds, we might ask ourselves, on both legal and moral grounds, whether the animals have a claim to freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It states the following:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The amendment <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-the-22nd-amendment-came-into-existence\">was ratified in 1951</a> and came after years of both parties calling for term limits for the presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While President George Washington set a precedent for only holding two terms in office, President Franklin D. Roosevelt later <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/fdr-four-term-president-22-amendment\">became the first and only commander-in-chief</a> to serve additional terms. Roosevelt was ultimately elected to four terms in office, though he passed away during his last term in 1945.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following Roosevelt’s tenure, there were growing calls to establish term limits for future presidents, leading to Congress’s approval of the 22nd Amendment and states’ subsequent ratification.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-it-s-so-hard-to-roll-back-the-22nd-amendment\"><strong>Why it’s so hard to roll back the 22nd Amendment</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The thresholds for approving a constitutional amendment and for repealing it are exceedingly high.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two ways to go about rolling back an amendment. The first would require two-thirds of both the House — 290 members — and the Senate — 67 members — to agree to do so. Once they did so, three-fourths of all states — 38 — would then also have to agree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These thresholds would be impossible for Trump to meet given Democratic opposition, and there would likely be some Republican outcry as well. While <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump\">Republicans are poised to retake Senate control</a>, they’ll fall far short of the two-thirds majority required for such a vote. If the GOP attains control of the House, they’d similarly fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed there. Additionally, at least 17 states have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, signaling that they’d be unlikely to support any such amendment. That’s more than the one-fourth of states Trump could afford to lose should he somehow succeed in getting the amendment overturned by Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A second means of repealing an amendment would require holding a Constitutional Convention, which two-thirds of states — 34 — would have to support. Any amendments proposed at such a convention would still need ratification from three-fourths of states — 38. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This option would face the same opposition from Democrat-leaning states as the first one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the amendment was first approved, there have been numerous proposals in <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/term-limits/\">Congress raised to repeal it</a>, though they have all languished due to lack of support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-amendment-is-crystal-clear\"><strong>The amendment is crystal clear</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts say there aren’t really any realistic options for Trump to try to bypass the 22nd Amendment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Theoretically, <a href=\"https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/\">the 22nd Amendment doesn’t prevent a former president</a> who has already served two terms from becoming vice president in a subsequent term. As vice president, that person could then potentially ascend to the presidency if the president on the ticket stepped down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It could theoretically happen, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen,” says McConnell, who added that it’s a “silly thing to worry about.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Efforts to challenge the amendment in court are also moot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court does not have the basis to overturn the 22nd Amendment, according to legal experts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Per UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, any challenge to a constitutional amendment would likely rest on arguments that the procedure used to approve the amendment was faulty in some way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s “impossible” in this case, says Winkler, given how this amendment has been settled for more than seven decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Winkler notes the Supreme Court could try to interpret the 22nd Amendment to say that it only applies to presidents who have served consecutive terms, but even that would be a stretch based on its text. Any effort to declare the amendment unconstitutional by the Court would run into the problem of the amendment being part of the Constitution, notes McConnell. “By definition, the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, as Georgetown law professor Abbe Smith explained when asked if Trump could vie for a third term, it’s pretty simple: “Short answer: There is no way.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As such, Trump’s recent run is set to be his final one.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In 2019, there was the “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-perfect-call-defense/index.html\">perfect phone call</a>,” in which Trump allegedly leveraged US aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskyy to investigate Hunter Biden. And the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810y11dyjo\">more recent awkward meeting </a>in New York during the 2024 presidential campaign in which Trump talked about his good relationship with Vladimir Putin in front of the man whom the Russian leader had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-assassination-plot-russia-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-foiled/\">tried to kill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Trump has also expressed some grudging admiration for Zelenskyy, a fellow TV star-turned-politician who has demonstrated he knows how to close a deal. “I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history — every time he comes into the country, he walks away with $60 billion,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-24/trump-says-he-d-handle-ukraine-differently-ahead-of-un-meeting?srnd=homepage-europe&amp;sref=C3P1bRLC\">said at a rally in September</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But after Trump’s return to the White House, Zelenskyy may now have his toughest “sales” job yet. Zelenskyy quickly congratulated Trump on his victory and the two <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">held an initial</a> phone call last week which was joined — in a likely sign of strange things to come —&nbsp;by Elon Musk, and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">described by Ukrainian officials as somewhat reassuring</a>. Trump also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/10/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine/\">reportedly spoke with Putin</a> over the weekend, according to the Washington Post, though the Kremlin has since, confusingly, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-will-discuss-with-trump-top-us-priorities-wednesday-2024-11-10/\">denied it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The conventional wisdom is that Trump’s election is a major setback for Ukraine, coming at a moment when it is <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/10/29/ukraine-is-now-struggling-to-cling-on-not-to-win\">already losing territory and troops</a> at a slow but steady rate to Russia’s relentless advance and when its civilian population is likely in for another brutal winter due to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-drone-attack-kyiv-ukraines-military-says-2024-08-26/\">Russian strikes on the country’s energy grid</a>. Opposition to support for Ukraine has become a core position of the Republican Party’s MAGA wing, and GOP opposition earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024/4/24/24138541/ukraine-russia-us-aid-congress\">held up a major aid package</a> to Ukraine for months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump himself <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-blames-ukraines-zelenskiy-starting-war-with-russia-2024-10-17/\">has blamed Zelenskyy</a> for starting the war. He has also promised to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893\">end the fighting in 24 hours</a> once in office. It’s not clear how he plans to do that, but Vice President-elect JD Vance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=mZganHwvsp6QKDS6&amp;t=880&amp;v=HrgmwtpAsWc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">has suggested</a> it would involve freezing the current front lines in place and Ukraine declaring its neutrality and giving up its ambitions to join NATO. (Though Zelenskyy has mostly avoided directly criticizing Trump, he has described Vance as “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory\">too radical</a>.”) </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ukraine’s government would view a “deal” like this as full surrender, and argues, with reason, that Russia shouldn’t be trusted to maintain a ceasefire: Putin could always try again to take more territory or even Kyiv itself after a pause to replenish his losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while the conventional wisdom may be true that Trump’s win is a blow to Kyiv,&nbsp;Ukrainian leaders are still expressing some cautious optimism that they can work with the new administration. The pitch from “the greatest salesman in history,” however, is going to have to change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Selling Ukraine</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing you likely won’t be hearing as much: talking points about defending democracy or upholding the rules-based international order, which both Zelenskyy and Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-united-efforts-of-the-free-world-to-support-the-people-of-ukraine/\">frequently used</a> over the last two years since Russia’s invasion. Such rhetoric is likely to fall flat with Trump, given his often nakedly transactional approach to foreign policy and general fondness for authoritarian leaders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speaking on a press call hosted by the think tank German Marshall Fund on Friday, Hanna Hopko, a former Ukrainian parliament member and co-founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, an advocacy group, made the change clear. “We understand that with Trump, it’s not about philosophy,” she told reporters. “It&#8217;s not talking about a rules-based order. It&#8217;s about a very pragmatic approach.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s probably why Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/world/europe/trump-harris-ukraine-election.html\">has lately been emphasizing</a> that Ukraine is “rich in natural resources,” including critical minerals like titanium, graphite and lithium, which could be vital for the green energy transition. It’s a line that has been echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of the few close Trump allies who is also a staunch Ukraine supporter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Noting that Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/380060/trump-world-risks-war\">has said</a> in the past that Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, Hopko argued, “It’s important to explain to Trump, who likes to be a winner, that Crimea has huge potential for <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-the-black-sea-could-emerge-as-the-worlds-next-great-energy-battleground/\">natural gas extraction</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This type of logic has worked on Trump in the past: During his first term, he claimed he ultimately decided to keep US troops in Syria, despite several pledges to withdraw them, in order to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/donald-trump-syria-oil-us-troops-isis-turkey\">keep the oil</a>” in the region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ukrainian officials also believe they can portray themselves as good for American business. “I’ve heard that Republicans stand for the defense industry. We’re bringing value to the defense industry of the US,” Oleksandr Kamyshin, Ukraine’s minister of strategic industries, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine\">told a gathering on the sidelines</a> of the NATO Summit in Washington over the summer. <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-supporting-ukraine-revitalizing-us-defense-industrial-base\">More than $68 billion</a> of the money allocated for Ukraine has been spent on the US companies. Hopko also noted that Ukraine’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/russia-ukraine/372726/ukraine-depot-strike-russia-drones-missiles-zelenskyy-putin-kursk-tver-taropets\">advances in drone warfare and autonomous weaponry</a> can benefit the US military through technology-sharing and battlefield testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">John Conway, director of strategy for <a href=\"https://gopforukraine.com/\">Republicans for Ukraine</a>, an advocacy group, said that supporters of Ukraine’s cause should emphasize the threat a victorious Russia would pose to the US itself. “Just recently [Putin’s] secret operatives <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/383330/russia-georgia-bomb-threats-gray-zone\">tried to blow up civilian airplanes</a> bound for our airports and called in bomb threats to disrupt our elections,” Conway told Vox by email. “When Putin loses, America wins. Ukraine can make Putin lose.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other reason Trump may end up extending support for Ukraine rather than making a deal is that it’s not clear whether Putin is interested in peace at a time when he likely feels he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/politics/russia-north-korea-troops-ukraine.html\">has the upper hand in the war</a>. The choice may not be between ongoing war and negotiations but between ongoing war and Ukrainian defeat — something an always image-conscious Trump may not want to see under his watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">David Kramer, a former US assistant secretary of state under George W. Bush, said the prospect of a full Ukrainian defeat happening as a result of his actions might give Trump pause. “The last thing that Trump is going to want there would be a chaotic collapse, a la Afghanistan 2.0,” he said. (Though Trump’s first administration negotiated the agreement that led to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, he <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-08-26/terrorism-afghanistan-joe-biden-withdrawal\">repeatedly blamed</a> the Biden administration for its handling of the chaotic pullout.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Will Trump listen?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ukrainian officials and their Western advocates often point out that for all his kind words for Putin and tense relationship with Zelenskyy, it was Trump who <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-approves-sale-anti-tank-weapons-ukraine/story?id=65989898\">agreed to sell Ukraine anti-tank Javelin missiles</a> — something the Obama administration had declined to do. <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/gearscout/2022/05/12/javelin-missile-made-by-the-us-wielded-by-ukraine-feared-by-russia/\">Javelins would later play a pivotal role</a> in Ukraine’s ability to resist the initial Russian invasion in 2022. (This was likely part of the reason why <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383418/world-leaders-trump-react-putin-netayahu-zelenskyy-xi-jinping-nato\">Russia’s official reaction</a> to Trump’s return was a lot less jubilant than it <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2016/11/09/russian-leaders-literally-cheer-trump-victory\">was in 2016</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More recently, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-ukraine-foreign-aid-loan-natural-resources-collateral-rcna150388\">Trump was convinced</a> to give his congressional allies blessing to approve a Ukraine-aid package earlier this year after the money was structured as a loan rather than a grant — a sign, perhaps, that appealing to his business instincts can be a winning strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether Ukraine’s new pitch will work could also depend on who ends up in Trump’s Cabinet. Ukrainians might have hoped for a return of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-former-top-diplomat-pompeo-visits-kyiv-underscores-support-2023-04-03/\">visited Ukraine</a> and has advocated for providing it with more advanced weapons systems. Trump, though, has already <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-haley-pompeo-will-not-join-second-administration-2024-11-10/\">ruled out a role</a> for Pompeo in the new administration, and <a href=\"https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1855593982958379321\">early indicators</a> are that Republican hawks may not have a home in the new administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, who unlike his two predecessors in the first Trump administration, didn’t subsequently condemn Trump, is thought likely to return to a senior role this time. O’Brien<a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/return-peace-strength-trump-obrien\"> argued in an article in Foreign Affairs</a> earlier this year that Trump’s strategy would be to “continue to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, financed by European countries, while keeping the door open to diplomacy with Russia—and keeping Moscow off balance with a degree of unpredictability.” O’Brien also advocated for increasing NATO’s military presence in Eastern Europe, close to Russia’s border — a step guaranteed to raise Putin’s ire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not at all clear that Trump shares the views being ascribed to him by O’Brien, but it’s a sign that there is likely to be a wider range of opinion in the new administration’s foreign policy team than many might think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">It’s not going to get easier for Ukraine</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reality is that a reckoning on US support for Ukraine might well have taken place even if Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidency, if only because of growing opposition in Congress as well as Russia’s undeniable battlefield progress, with Moscow willing to sacrifice tens of thousands of soldiers for its war goals. It’s not only MAGA figures who are pushing for compromise with Russia — <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/perfect-has-become-enemy-good-ukraine-haass\">some members of Washington’s foreign policy establishment</a> increasingly are as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also worth pointing out that while Biden was a staunch advocate for the Ukrainian cause, officials in Kyiv <a href=\"https://x.com/michaeldweiss/status/1854980759779787123\">have often expressed frustration</a> with his administration’s delays in providing new weapons systems and capabilities, motivated by what they see as an unwarranted fear of escalating war with a nuclear-armed Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Every time we ask for something, we get it months or a year later when it won’t make as much of a difference as it would have before,” parliament member Oleksandra Ustinova <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear\">told Vox in June</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some advocates even hope Trump could take the gloves off, greenlighting tactics like long-range strikes into Russian territory with American weapons, something the Biden team was reluctant to approve. On the other hand, Trump, like Biden, has warned of the specter of “<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/trump-world-war-3-foreign-policy-putin-xi-china-russia-north-korea-20241027.html\">World War III</a>.” In a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4882868-negotiate-with-moscow-to-end-the-ukraine-war-and-prevent-nuclear-devastation/\">September op-ed</a>, the president-elect’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and his new ally Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advocated negotiations with Russia in order to avoid nuclear war. Those escalation fears are unlikely to disappear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, the Ukrainians will hope for the best and try to work with Trump’s team because there’s little other option. Trump’s relationship with Putin and past statements about the war don’t give much cause for optimism, but ironically, the thing the Ukrainians now seem to be counting on is his unpredictability.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Pre-workout, post-workout, without a workout at all? Powders and tablets like LMNT, Liquid I.V., and Nuun are everywhere, from TikTok ads to your office snack counter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The concept of hardcore hydration isn’t new — athletes <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/27/357903336/gladiator-gatorade-ancient-athletes-also-had-a-recovery-drink\">have been adding stuff to their water</a> for millennia. And electrolyte-filled drinks like Gatorade have been mainstays in sports culture for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But today’s electrolyte supplements aren’t just for football players or ultramarathoners. Companies like Nuun <a href=\"https://nuunlife.com/pages/orangetheory\">market their tablets</a> for everyone from aspiring endurance athletes to regular people going to yoga classes during their lunch breaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These brands are “playing into people’s perception of what is healthy,” said <a href=\"https://www.unlv.edu/people/samantha-coogan\">Samantha Coogan</a>, a nutrition sciences educator at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. And it seems to be working: According to Precedence Research, the <a href=\"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/electrolyte-drinks-market\">global electrolyte drinks market</a> is worth over $40 billion and is expected to grow to nearly $75 billion in the next decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <span>concept of hydration has become a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">point of fixation</a>&nbsp;in wellness culture, even though experts still&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.physiology.org/publications/news/the-physiologist-magazine/2021/july/the-science-of-hydration?SSO=Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">don’t entirely agree</a>&nbsp;on how much hydration we&nbsp;</span>need or the ideal way to get there. With electrolytes making their way from the world of endurance athletes to brunch cocktails, it’s tempting to believe that they might indeed be a magic cure for everything from leg cramps to hangovers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While electrolyte supplements are great for athletes and lifesaving for cholera patients, they’re not magic. Here’s what you need to know about what electrolytes can and can’t do, and whether you need them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is an electrolyte, anyway?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our bodies need to maintain a certain balance of essential minerals to function properly: sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, phosphate, and bicarbonate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These minerals are all electrolytes, substances that carry electricity through the body, controlling fluid balance, muscle function, and communication between the brain and the body. The “electro” in “electrolytes” comes from the electric charge produced when they’re dissolved in a fluid like blood. Without electrolytes, these electrical signals get disrupted, causing muscle spasms and cramps, headaches, and trouble thinking clearly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sodium in particular is an important electrolyte because it aids in controlling the amount of water in your blood. Electrolytes like sodium “basically help water in the body go where it’s supposed to go,” said <a href=\"https://holleyfuelednutrition.com/\">Holley Samuel</a>, a registered sports dietitian who works with endurance athletes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When we sweat, we lose a lot of sodium and chloride (a.k.a. salt). But if a person profusely sweating only chugs water without also replenishing the salt, it throws off the balance of sodium and water in the body, pushing too much fluid inside of cells. This can eventually <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470386/#:~:text=Hyponatremia%20is%20defined%20as%20a,to%20total%20body%20sodium%20content.\">make those cells swell</a> like raisins soaking in water, a potentially dangerous condition called hyponatremia. When you drink water with electrolytes, that water <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=electrolytes+fluid+absorption&amp;oq=electrolytes+fluid+abso#d=gs_qabs&amp;t=1730327083109&amp;u=%23p%3D08GE-q5ZaZMJ\">is better able</a> to stick around inside your body where it’s needed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Electrolytes like sodium “basically help water in the body go where it’s supposed to go.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s important to note that “electrolytes don’t exist only in a magic packet,” said <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/3335553\">Stavros Kavouras</a>, director of the Hydration Science Lab at Arizona State University. Beyond tablets, packets, and powders, electrolytes exist in regular foods we eat all the time, like bananas (potassium), cheese and crackers (sodium and calcium), and spinach (magnesium). Electrolytes as pre-packaged water supplements, as we think of them today, have only been around for a few decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the 1960s, assistant coach Dewayne Douglas noticed that his University of Florida <a href=\"https://research.ufl.edu/publications/explore/v08n1/gatorade.html\">football players were struggling</a> to recover after practices in the swampy Gainesville heat. Athletes shed weight — Douglas recalled losing up to 18 pounds per game himself, when he played — but barely felt the need to pee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After conducting studies with UF first-year football players as subjects, <a href=\"https://nephrology.medicine.ufl.edu/education/visiting-professorships/j-robert-cade/\">kidney disease specialist J. Robert Cade</a> found that players felt terrible because in addition to experiencing low blood sugar after working out, they were sweating out tons of electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium. So he created a new sports recovery drink for the Florida Gators, called Gatorade: basically water, salt, sugar, and lemon juice for taste. The sodium-enriched drink helps athletes retain water while sweating, and the results were remarkable. “One Lil’ Swig of That Kickapoo Juice and Biff, Bam, Sock — It’s Gators, 8-2,” <a href=\"https://ufhealth.org/news/2015/uf-celebrates-50-years-gatorade\">the Florida Times-Union celebrated in December 1966</a>, after Gatorade’s first season with the team.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sports drinks took off, and other companies began capitalizing on Gatorade’s success. All sports drinks are variations on Gatorade’s theme: Water for hydration, sugar for energy, and electrolytes to aid in fluid absorption, as well as flavoring to get it down. Sports drinks act as “one magic bullet” for athletes, Kavouras said. “You take one thing, and it has everything in there.” This formula is so effective it’s<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/69227/WHO_FCH_CAH_06.1.pdf?sequence=1\"> recommended by the World Health Organization</a> for rehydrating people, especially cholera patients or children experiencing diarrhea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At first, these beverages were <a href=\"https://hashtagpaid.com/banknotes/gatorades-approach-to-marketing-then-and-now\">primarily marketed to professional athletes</a>. Today, Powerade and Gatorade are advertised <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/history-beverage-industry-part-3-which-brands-furthered-bill-sipper/\">as soft drinks</a> for anyone. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24031385/stanley-craze-tumbler-best-water-bottle\">the year of the giant water bottle</a>, there are also a bunch of new-wave electrolyte supplements like Nuun, LMNT, and Liquid I.V. in grocery and convenience store aisles, which swap sugar for alternative sweeteners like stevia leaf extract or allulose to target consumers who don’t want to drink too many extra calories. These supplements market themselves as hydration superfoods: something to help athletes, sure, but also a hangover cure and <a href=\"https://hashtagpaid.com/banknotes/how-liquid-iv-is-packaging-hydration-alongside-joy\">overall vibe-booster</a> for regular, health-conscious people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Coogan said, if you’re eating a balanced diet and aren’t training for a marathon, you probably shouldn’t be pounding back electrolyte packets.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If your body needs extra electrolytes, supplements — whether a Gatorade or a Nuun — can be an efficient way to rehydrate. But, Coogan said, if you’re eating a balanced diet and aren’t training for a marathon, you probably shouldn’t be pounding back electrolyte packets. “Too much of a good thing is not always a good thing,” Coogan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Okay, but what about hangovers? Pedialyte, an oral electrolyte solution meant for babies and children, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/10/17819358/pedialyte-hangover-marketing-strategy-instagram-influencers\">has become the go-to hangover cure</a> for young adults at music festivals and fraternity parties. College students are even trying to sidestep the consequences of binge drinking by swapping beers for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/borg-gen-z-binge-drinking\">BORGs (“blackout rage gallons”)</a>: a half-gallon of water mixed with a bottle of liquor and an electrolyte additive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alas, electrolytes are <a href=\"https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/hangovers\">not a magic hangover cure</a> — trying to undo a night out with electrolyte supplements is “just going to be an uphill battle,” Coogan said. While pre-hydrating with an electrolyte supplement before a night out might help mitigate some of the consequences of the impending alcohol-fueled dehydration, the only real hangover cure is time.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/electrolytes.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Pink bottles of Mas+.\" title=\"Pink bottles of Mas+.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Electrolytes are great for super-sweaty times. Otherwise, meh.</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The best time to consume extra electrolytes is when you’ve been sweating a lot, or otherwise losing a lot of fluids through something like food poisoning. <a href=\"https://khaki-bear-ys52.squarespace.com/blog/hydration-on-the-run\">Training for a long-distance run</a>? <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/FactSheet_KeepingWorkersWellHydrated.pdf\">Working</a> on a construction site on a summer day in a place like Phoenix? Experts say electrolyte supplements are definitely a good call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many people (myself included) fall somewhere in between couch potato and ultramarathoner. I asked experts how I should think about electrolytes, as someone who spends most of the day sitting in front of my computer, then goes to a CrossFit or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/366257/pole-dancing-olympics-sport-sex-work-gymnastics-paris\">pole dancing</a> class after work. Samuel says that for casual gym rats and recreational athletes, how you should rehydrate largely depends on how much you sweat, and what your sweat is made of.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some people “go to do a spin class and they’re on the bike for five minutes, and there’s a puddle around them,” Samuel said. “If that’s you, you’re a heavy sweater.” Sodium levels in sweat can also vary anywhere from <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2019/07000/INDIVIDUALIZED_HYDRATION_PLANS_FOR_ULTRADISTANCE.8.aspx\">200 milligrams per liter to 2,000</a>, depending on the person. If your sweat tends to sting your eyes or leave white streaks or crystals on your skin and clothes, you might be a<a href=\"https://www.self.com/story/salty-sweat-exercise\"> salty sweater</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>For casual gym rats and recreational athletes, how you should rehydrate largely depends on how much you sweat, and what your sweat is made of.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both heavy sweaters and salty sweaters should consider electrolyte supplements before, during, and after working out. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends consuming <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955583/#:~:text=ACSM%20recommendations%20for%20sodium%20intake,)%20%5B8%2C9%5D.\">at least 300 milligrams of sodium per hour</a> if you’re going to be out sweating for more than an hour, whether you’re participating in a sport or simply working outside on a hot day. Read labels, too: Try to stay <a href=\"https://time.com/7020001/electrolyte-drinks-hydration-benefits/\">below 14 grams of sugar</a> per 8 ounces of fluid (that’s about half of the amount in a Gatorade Thirst Quencher). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Make sure to check the sodium content on the label of your electrolyte supplement, though: Some popular supplements, like Liquid I.V., <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/liquid-iv-reviews#products\">contain 500 mg of sodium</a>, which is more than what’s necessary for all but the sweatiest endurance athletes. Those athletes <a href=\"https://holleyfuelednutrition.com/blog/how-much-sodium-is-too-much-for-runners\">usually need to consume more sodium than other people</a>, Samuel said. For everyone else, supplements with more moderate levels of sodium (around 200 to 300 mg), should be enough to rehydrate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">About one-third of otherwise healthy people are <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.17959#:~:text=For%20approximately%20one%2Dthird%20of,independent%20risk%20factor%20for%20cardiovascular\">sensitive to salt</a>, meaning that consuming high amounts of sodium causes an <a href=\"https://www.self.com/story/electrolyte-packets-workout-recovery\">increase in blood pressure</a>. “That&#8217;s why you have heard that a high sodium diet can lead to hypertension and cardiovascular disease,” Kavouras said. If you’re sensitive to salt, you’ll want to be careful. The FDA recommends Americans limit their sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, for most people, <a href=\"https://time.com/7020001/electrolyte-drinks-hydration-benefits/\">it’s next to impossible</a> to consume a dangerous amount of electrolytes. If you eat more carbs, fat, or protein than your body needs, they get stored as fat. But electrolytes aren’t stored — they’re eliminated. “If you drink too much sodium,” Kavouras said, “you will be peeing more sodium.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You don’t necessarily need an electrolyte supplement after your workout. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2018.1534989\">Low-fat milk</a> (or soy milk, for lactose-intolerant and plant-based athletes) offer enough electrolytes, carbs, and protein to rehydrate, repair muscles, and stabilize blood sugar, and <a href=\"https://www.self.com/story/how-to-hydrate-after-workout\">smoothies</a> can incorporate protein and fats in addition to electrolyte-rich foods like bananas, dates, leafy greens, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293068/\">coconut water</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Electrolytes have another counterintuitive benefit: making you thirstier. “Electrolytes help in maintaining the thirst drive for a longer period of time,” Kavouras said. This can be helpful for those who struggle to drink enough water, because they aren’t thirsty enough to reach for it — or because they don’t like the taste of water. “If it tastes better, and if it drives thirst longer, you will be drinking more on your own,” Kavouras said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While drinking an electrolyte supplement when you don&#8217;t really need one is rarely dangerous, Samuel cautioned that consuming extra sodium without enough extra water (or sweating it out) is dehydrating — say pouring two LMNT packets into one regular-sized water bottle, although that would taste pretty bad. “You’re basically creating jerky out of yourself by salting too much,” she said. “We want to be a nice, hydrated steak.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You don’t need them all the time, but electrolytes can help rebalance a sweaty body and make drinking water a little more fun. Just remember that they’re hardly magic — they’re salts.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Now, the same executives sound enthusiastic when they say they’re looking forward to working with the next president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Tuesday’s election, the congratulations from the tech elite to Trump came in fast. The day after he secured the White House, everyone from <a href=\"https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1854225875002396860\">Tim Cook</a> to <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DCCYlzUPKvy?xmt=AQGz0EQp3_zUkB0bsFvb1kwDsIStpqpxYVkY7mOxRcCcBA\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> posted their well wishes for Trump’s second term. Even Jeff Bezos <a href=\"https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1854184441511571765\">weighed in</a>, hailing Trump’s “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” This, from a man who has been in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-trump-went-after-bezos-two-billionaires-across-a-cultural-divide/2018/04/05/22bb94c2-3763-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html\">more than</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/opinion/trump-amazon-jedi.html\">one public feud</a> with Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newfound praise does not, however, signal a political realignment in all of Silicon Valley. Tech executives as well as rank-and-file workers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/workers-several-large-us-tech-companies-overwhelmingly-back-kamala-harris-data-2024-09-09/\">overwhelmingly supported Kamala Harris</a> in the election, which shouldn’t be too surprising: She’s been involved in Bay Area politics for many years and has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/03/harris-campaign-silicon-valley-tech-policy/\">deep ties</a> with the tech and venture capital industries. That allegiance continued the trends of the Obama era, which was marked by a bit of a love fest between Washington and Silicon Valley. Barack Obama, who won the White House in 2008 <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1207594/how-chris-hughes-helped-launch-facebook-and-barack-obama-campaign\">with the help of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes</a>, embraced the ethos of startup culture and celebrated tech companies as a positive force in the United States. He developed personal relationships with executives like Zuckerberg and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/magazine/barack-obama-brought-silicon-valley-to-washington-is-that-a-good-thing.html\">championed tech-friendly policies</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, that era is over. In its place is something darker and dominated by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361087/trump-silicon-valley-fundraising-musk-andreessen-horowitz\">a small but very loud group of techno-libertarian Trump fans</a> whose ranks include not only Elon Musk but also the industry’s most influential investors, most of <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/07/21/paypal-mafia-silicon-valley-thiel-hoffman-botha-rabois-musk/\">the PayPal Mafia</a>, and the vice president-elect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does that mean the tech industry has taken a turn to the right? Is Silicon Valley Trump country now?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is neither left nor right, Democrat or Republican,” <a href=\"https://history.washington.edu/people/margaret-omara\">Margaret O’Mara</a>, an American history professor at the University of Washington, told me after the election. She pointed out that the tech industry culture in Silicon Valley has its roots in post-Vietnam baby boomers viewing personal computers as a form of liberation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They didn&#8217;t feel like they had anything in common with political conservatives, but they shared a libertarianism that ran its way all the way across the political spectrum,” O’Mara added. “It&#8217;s kind of a funny libertarianism.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-629845074.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.73741974058,100,78.525160518841\" alt=\"Donald Trump, Peter Thiel, and Tim Cook sit at a table, looking awkward.\" title=\"Donald Trump, Peter Thiel, and Tim Cook sit at a table, looking awkward.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Tim Cook and other tech leaders met with Donald Trump, Peter Thiel, and other members of the transition team at Trump Tower on December 14, 2016. | Albin Lohr-Jones/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Albin Lohr-Jones/Getty Images\" />\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3354574880\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You get a sense of Silicon Valley’s anti-bureaucratic worldview in everything from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/arts/television/super-bowl-apple-1984-ad.html\">Apple’s famous “1984” ad</a>, which quite literally suggests tearing down the establishment, to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/google-20-percent-rule-shows-exactly-how-much-time-you-should-spend-learning-new-skills.html\">Google’s celebrated 20 percent rule</a>, which lets employees work on side projects of their own choosing. There’s also a more extreme version of this philosophy in the tech industry, especially lately, one that leans into anti-establishment thinking, which explains their affinity for crypto. These 21st-century techno-libertarians just want to be left alone to build things and make money. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tech executives busy kissing the ring this week are not necessarily part of this crowd. The Tim Cooks of the world are just doing business, and that requires doing business with the president of the United States, whomever it might be. After the tumultuous first Trump administration, these leaders learned that the president-elect responds best to flattery and praise. They’ve actually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/technology/trump-tech-ceos.html\">been sucking up to Trump for months</a> in hopes that they might have some sway in the event of his return to office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This would be handy for many reasons. The Biden administration, in a break from Obama, has been tough on Big Tech. He appointed anti-monopoly legal star Lina Khan to chair the Federal Trade Commission, and she mounted <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/tech/lina-khan-risk-takers/index.html\">multiple antitrust suits</a> against the country’s biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. Now, Khan is currently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/election-2024-ftc-lina-khan.html\">waiting to see if she’ll keep her job</a>, and the targets of those lawsuits may have an ally in Trump, who gets to decide Khan’s fate. In addition to less intense regulatory scrutiny, tech companies would also enjoy lower corporate taxes, which Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/07/trump-taxes-republican-congress/\">has promised to provide</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“​​In my mind, this isn’t a story about Silicon Valley overall and DC overall,” said <a href=\"https://freeman.tulane.edu/faculty-research/management/rob-lalka\">Robert Lalka</a>, a professor at Tulane University. “Instead, what’s occurring now involves the influence of far fewer people: a very close-knit network of like-minded Trump supporters, especially if we focus on the PayPal Mafia, and the transformation of the Republican Party and its policy agenda.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The PayPal Mafia refers to a group of entrepreneurs who worked at PayPal in its early days before going on to found or help build hugely influential tech companies. If you had to pick a godfather of the PayPal Mafia — and hence the leader of this pro-Trump techno-libertarian political revolution — it would be Peter Thiel. The PayPal co-founder donated over $1 million to Trump’s campaign back in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation\">spent $10 million to help JD Vance win a Senate seat in Ohio in 2022</a>. Thiel also helped fund a project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/24/seasteading-a-vanity-project-for-the-rich-or-the-future-of-humanity\">to establish autonomous, floating nations in international waters</a>, where they would be free of all laws and regulations — one reason he has been called the “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/11/peter-thiel-2024-election-politics-investing-life-views/675946/\">avatar of techno-libertarianism</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The motivations of the techno-libertarians, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/facebook-meta-silicon-valley-politics/677168/\">also now known as techno-authoritarians</a>, are more twisted. Elon Musk, who was also a PayPal co-founder, emerged this year as Trump’s biggest supporter after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/business/elon-musk-election-bet/index.html\">donating nearly $119 million to his campaign</a> through his America PAC and has made the promotion of free speech one of his missions. Free speech is also <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-first-amendment/629721/\">a big part of why</a>, after accusing it of censorship, Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and turned it into X, where the promotion of right-wing propaganda and misinformation <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/383336/trump-election-elon-musk-misinformation\">may or may not have helped Trump get elected</a> too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not hard to see why Musk would benefit from a close relationship with the White House. The billionaire certainly didn’t have much of a rapport with the Biden administration, which snubbed him at an electric vehicle summit, an incident that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/how-elon-musk-broke-with-biden-and-the-democrats-4960b7d8\">reportedly led Musk to embrace Trump</a>. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, makes billions of dollars through government contracts, while his car company, Tesla, is lobbying for fewer regulations around self-driving cars as it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265530/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-features-range-price-release-date\">attempts to launch a robotaxi business</a>. Musk’s company Tesla Energy, formerly SolarCity, has received <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-list-government-subsidies-tesla-billions-spacex-solarcity-2021-12#solarcity-receives-4975-million-in-grants-in-addition-to-tax-credits-by-2015-5\">billions in subsidies</a> over the years and surely looks to benefit from the federal government’s continued investment in the energy transition. Meanwhile, Trump has promised Musk <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/trump-economic-plans-musk-government-commission/index.html\">a role in his administration</a> as the “secretary of cost-cutting” — a position that doesn’t yet exist, but one that Trump seems to be seriously entertaining.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other loud pro-Trump voices in Silicon Valley share a web of connections to each other and to Musk. There’s former PayPal COO and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/us/politics/david-sacks-desantis-twitter-musk.html\">Musk pal</a> David Sacks, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July; Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded Palantir with Peter Thiel and helped launch Musk’s America PAC; and Marc Andreessen, who last year published the 5,200-word Techno-Optimist Manifesto that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/marc-andreessen-manifesto-techno-optimism.html\">envisions tech leaders as keepers of the social order</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s worth noting that not every member of the PayPal Mafia has pledged allegiance to Trump. Reid Hoffman, another former PayPal COO and LinkedIn co-founder <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/21451481/linkedin-reid-hoffman-billionaire-democratic-party-tension-silicon-valley\">is a prominent Democratic Party fundraiser</a>. He donated $7 million to pro-Harris and pro-Biden PACs, even though he’s a vocal Lina Khan critic. He was also on a list of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/technology/silicon-valley-investors-support-kamala-harris.html\">more than 100 venture capitalists</a> who threw their support behind Harris leading up to the election.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2172973156.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Donald Trump at crowded crypto-themed bar.\" title=\"Donald Trump at crowded crypto-themed bar.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Donald Trump did a campaign stop at a crypto-themed bar in New York City’s West Village on September 18. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Spencer Platt/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there’s cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Andreessen’s VC firm announced in 2022 it was going all-in on crypto, a bet that’s starting to pay off <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-went-all-in-on-crypto-at-the-worst-possible-time-11666769270\">after two years of looking very foolish</a>. Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-claims-presidential-win-here-is-what-he-promised-the-crypto-industry-ahead-of-the-election.html\">has promised</a> to create a strategic cryptocurrency stockpile for the US government in his second term. Trump’s general anti-regulation, pro-crypto stance sent Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/dogecoin-elon-musk-bitcoin-crypto-election-276ddf9a\">soaring to all-time highs</a> after election night, following a widely covered <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23450169/crypto-winter-ftx-binance-celsius-bitcoin/archives/11\">crypto winter</a> that lasted a couple of years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You could argue that the crypto vote was vital to helping Trump and a lot of other Republican candidates win, too. The crypto industry has emerged as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/14/silicon-valley-the-new-lobbying-monster\">one of the most powerful lobbying forces in the country</a>, pouring tens of millions of dollars into races against politicians they perceive to be anti-crypto —&nbsp;and it’s working. So far, 48 candidates backed by pro-crypto PACs have won their races this year. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/crypto-s-135-million-campaign-is-undefeated-in-48-races-so-far?sref=qYiz2hd0\">Zero have lost</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you think of it that way, Trump’s win on the back of techno-authoritarian billionaires seems less like a seismic shift in the politics of the tech industry and more like a bunch of one-issue voters who donated lots of money and got their way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think a lot of it is about crypto,” O’Mara said. “Crypto is also tied in — and always has been tied in — to a broader worldview, which is one of libertarianism, deregulation, or privately regulated markets that are separate from government.” She described this ethos as “escaping the state.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the techno-libertarians are the state. The day after Trump declared victory, he asked Musk to join him on a call <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call\">with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a>. And in the coming months, several more members of the PayPal Mafia get to decide what US tech policy will be for the next four years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You have to wonder if they just want to tear it all down. Or maybe they’ll get bored and move to a floating nation in international waters where there are no laws and never have been.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Facing yet another Donald Trump presidency, you might be asking yourself: How do I cope? How will I steel myself to do it all over again for the next four years? This time around, Trump and his allies have vowed to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">deport millions of people</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">fire civil servants and appoint loyalists in their stead</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/366495/trump-medication-abortion-mifepristone\">further restrict abortion access</a>. These policies are genuinely distressing and can feel overwhelming for the many millions of people who will be affected by them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it is not 2016. Having a clear-eyed plan for how you’ll handle what lies ahead is more protective than succumbing to despair. You can take the lessons learned to buttress your coping skills and avoid psychological exhaustion to make it through the coming days — and the next four years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to cope right now</h2>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t suppress your emotions, process them</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the immediate aftermath of the election results, you may be flooded with emotions ranging from despair to rage. “You can&#8217;t suppress those emotions of fear and despair. You have to process them,” says <a href=\"http://www.dradrienneheinz.com/\">Adrienne Heinz</a>, a clinical research psychologist at Stanford University. “When you finally accept how you feel and the reality, you can start to focus on what you can change.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Processing emotions requires <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/24042177/alone-thoughts-rumination-thinking-for-pleasure\">quiet time with your thoughts</a>. It’s important in this moment to tune out distractions, like social media, and resist avoidant coping strategies, such as sleeping or doomscrolling, and sit with your feelings instead — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24130937/indoor-person-guide-outdoors-car-camping-birding-urban-nature\">whether out in nature</a> or while <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23718805/beginner-guide-meditation-mindfulness-how-to-meditate\">meditating in your living room</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Right now, we probably don&#8217;t have very high distress tolerance — we&#8217;re maxed out,” Heinz says. “But just remembering those emotions don&#8217;t last forever. They might feel like they&#8217;re going to eat you and swallow you whole, but if you can walk through them and come out the other side, you will be more emotionally intelligent.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You may want to seek out a trusted friend or a mental health professional to help you work through some of your feelings, says <a href=\"https://www.rianaelyse.com/\">Riana Elyse Anderson</a>, an associate professor at Columbia University’s School of Social Work. However, give yourself permission to mute group chats with friends if the conversation or information shared feels overwhelming.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay in the moment</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of worrying about what’s to come, hard as that may be, ground yourself in the present. Remind yourself that the tree on your lawn is still there, that the bus is still following its route, says licensed clinical social worker <a href=\"https://www.evercurioustherapy.com/\">Jneé Hill</a>. Squirrels are still scurrying along. “Life is still going on,” Hill says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She also recommends spending time with children who generally have other concerns&nbsp;—&nbsp;they’re more interested <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/life/382562/2024-election-kids-politics-voting\">in the book fair they just visited</a> or the new move they learned in karate. This can bring you back into the present moment. Don’t forget to lean into joy wherever you can — this is what refills your energy stores.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoid fatalistic thinking</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the country has clarity on its next president, there are still plenty of unknowns about what exactly will unfold over the next four years. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3524.epdf?sharing_token=s1g9JLVHygs4JCkLR1rc7tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O2p8IzUOE6gakxUh3l7QmBZ37d_L0L1lhtcpWrgu6_nHzOI3tUvvm3pzK3wfkqx87oZBtCTrEOa3CdrIGwYLMywI3nCZ13iGLMPjYF0eDTnW_bYCnrTspWQtD5uWraRikfvIqGxuf7KY-rw-Gj1OKw7-Q6LKAIYgy6M3fGuMAoxIDK9URAdaZxs2V3MGq_AD7xc7_C2fdACEkbx5ICR86MKKqGgPlPivW_2P4Ml3dtgH-HS8LbArQYKIJzSTi2q4c%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.bbc.com\">Uncertainty breeds anxiety</a>, research shows, so it’s understandable to feel uneasy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.danielhunter.org/\">Daniel Hunter</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://choosedemocracy.us/\">Choose Democracy</a>, an organization that provides resources to help Americans prepare for an undemocratic power grab, says his experience in activism has taught him that the solution isn’t to bury your head in the sand or jump to the worst-case scenario. Try not to paint a narrative of the future based on assumptions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Consciously engage in that uncertainty and hold there are things we don&#8217;t know,” he says. “We can grieve for the things we know, and we can grieve for the things we don&#8217;t know, the things we&#8217;re not certain about. But that&#8217;s different than telling ourselves a story.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to do in the weeks, months, and years ahead</h2>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Curb reactionary impulses</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s first administration was a near-daily blitz of chaotic headlines, Hunter says. “Trump would announce at 3 am some new policy that had never been discussed before,” he says. “Then people would feel like we have to react and do something about that. What it meant was we stayed in a constant state, or near-constant state, of Trump setting the agenda.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This time around, try to be more measured and targeted with your reactions, Hunter says. Use moments of outrage to ask yourself what you feel inspired to do and what you’d like to accomplish, “and continue to press forward on those things, regardless of a political context,” he says. Hunter points to the effectiveness of the so-called Muslim ban protests, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-travel-ban-sparks-protests-at-airports-nationwide-seattle-tacoma/\">which communicated the public&#8217;s outrage</a> over the policy at airports across the country. “The disruption that happened in the airports,” he says, “was a major piece of putting the pressure on in a material way.”</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus on what you can change</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a similar vein, instead of devoting your attention to things you have no power to change, like the enactment of specific policies or Cabinet appointments, Heinz says to focus on what you do have control over. Choose one issue that resonates with you and find ways to get involved locally. “It might be organizing something at the grassroots level to support new families who need child care,” Heinz says. “It could be going to a city council meeting to talk about housing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can also consider areas where you don’t feel like you have total control, Hill says. “Are you not feeling in control of your livelihood, of your safety, your security, just being able to go out and not be attacked or injured?” The question to then ask is, what can you control to make yourself feel safer during this moment? Perhaps that’s spending more time with friends in your home. “Maybe I want to spend some time beautifying and taking care of it,” Hill says.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find — or bolster — your community efforts</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Social isolation can <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976231156413\">make you feel fatigued</a> and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9102031/\">emotionally exhausted</a>, studies suggest. Lonely people may also be <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210920121800.htm\">less trusting of others</a>, another study found. Surrounding yourself with people you love can bring comfort, Heinz says. The morning the race was called, Hunter texted a few friends to make plans to get together and commiserate, cry, laugh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Knowing your neighbors and finding local groups of people who champion the same causes as you can help you form community. Anderson recommends <a href=\"https://www.mobilize.us/\">Mobilize</a> to find events and volunteer opportunities near you. Think about what makes you feel like you’ve made a difference in the world. Is it protesting? Working with a mutual aid organization? Making dinner for your elderly neighbor? Ask yourself what issue in your town or city matters the most to you and how you could make an impact there. “Getting people in person with each other is how we&#8217;re going to be able to show up for each other and also get the work done more effectively,” Anderson says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You’ve got to live</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Authoritarianism is fueled by fear, isolation, and perceived helplessness, Heinz says. “That combination ultimately leads to psychological exhaustion,” she says. But throwing yourself completely into resistance mode will ultimately lead to burnout. On the other end of the spectrum, there will be moments when you want to curl up in bed and shut out the world, but that isn’t an effective long-term strategy, either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To keep from full emotional exhaustion, you need to set boundaries. “We need psychological boundaries,” Hunter says, “not on our phones all the time, spaces where we&#8217;re not talking about it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take time to rest and recuperate, but don’t disengage. Set time limits on your news consumption, but don’t avoid it completely. Balance upsetting coverage with good news, stories of progress, and examples of people who have gone through tragedy and made it to the other side. Support those you love and stand together with your community to protect others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“How we live [is] not really a question that&#8217;s intrinsically tied to a political outcome,” Hill says. “Obviously, it has real-life impact, globally and personally, but that philosophical question of how you live your life is not something that can be dictated by other people.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

With a Republican majority in the Senate (and likely in the House as well), there’s little doubt that spending cuts will be up for debate, and tried-and-failed ideas like imposing work requirements on welfare recipients will be back on the table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the campaign, Trump promised that he wouldn’t cut Social Security. But his proposed changes to the program — like <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/trumps-plan-to-end-taxes-on-social-security-a-fatal-mistake-lawmaker.html\">cutting taxes on Social Security benefits</a> — would likely result in <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/whats-wrong-with-trumps-pledge-to-repeal-taxes-on-social-security-benefits\">reducing benefits sooner rather than later</a>. Other tax-cutting ideas, like his “No Tax on Tips” plan, would likely be a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage\">bigger payoff for big businesses</a> than for workers because it could push wages down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of that means, however, that there’s only room for pessimism. As my colleague <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/383186/trump-vance-medicaid-food-stamps-obamacare-poverty\">Dylan Matthews wrote</a>, Trump’s first term showed that any major cuts would have a hard time getting passed, even with a Republican majority. And there’s also reason to believe that some programs could even get passed, like some version of an expanded child tax credit that <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/despite-flaws-romney-proposal-on-child-tax-credit-creates-opening-for-bipartisan-action\">has had bipartisan support</a> in the past. (Vice President-elect JD Vance, for example, has supported expanding the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/\">child tax credit</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The election results on Tuesday also showed signs of hope — a roadmap for what an antipoverty agenda could look like under a second Trump presidency. Because while Democrats lost the presidential race, voters didn’t necessarily reject their policies. In various states, <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/a-review-of-key-2024-ballot-measures-voters-backed-progressive-policy-measures/\">voters supported progressive priorities</a> through ballot measures, including minimum wage hikes, paid sick leave, and expanded labor rights. If Democrats want to have a productive four years under Trump, there’s a lot they can do at the state level — if not in the legislatures, then at the ballot box.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>One positive election outcome? Voters raised the minimum wage.</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In five states, voters got to have a say in their minimum wage laws.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Missouri, for example, <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2024/11/05/missourians-vote-to-increase-minimum-wage-require-paid-sick-leave/\">voters passed a minimum wage hike</a>, raising it from $12.30 per hour to $15 by 2026. The new law pegs the minimum wage to inflation, which means that workers don’t have to wait for another law to pass to keep up with rising costs. More than 562,000 workers will see their wages rise as a result of the law, <a href=\"https://mobudget.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MinWage-Earned-Sick-Leave-Analysis.pdf\">according to the Missouri Budget Project</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alaskans also voted on <a href=\"https://alaskapublic.org/2024/10/24/alaska-business-are-divided-over-a-ballot-measure-that-would-raise-minimum-wage-and-mandate-sick-leave/\">raising the minimum wage</a> to $15 per hour, up from $11.73, and the measure is <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/ballot-measure-1-aimed-at-boosting-alaska-minimum-wage-passing-by-wide-margin-in-early-returns/\">on track to pass</a>. It would increase earnings for nearly 10 percent of the workforce, <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/alaskas-minimum-wage/\">according to the Economic Policy Institute</a>. In California, voters were asked to raise the state’s minimum wage to $18 per hour, but the results are still too close to call.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Arizona, voters protected worker pay by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-arizona-proposition-138-allow-employers-to-reduce-wages-of-tipped-employees.html\">overwhelmingly rejecting</a> a measure that would have allowed employers to reduce base wages for tipped workers. In Massachusetts, however, there was a different story. Voters <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/11/06/tipped-workers-wages-ballot-question-5-results\">didn’t approve a ballot measure</a> that would have supported tipped workers. Tipped workers in the state are now paid $6.75 per hour, but had the measure passed, they would have eventually <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/11/06/tipped-workers-wages-ballot-question-5-results\">been paid the standard minimum wage</a>, which now sits at $15.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The benefits of a higher minimum wage are clear: Workers at the bottom automatically see their incomes rise. But efforts to raise the minimum wage often face opposition because business interests argue that they would result in job losses or increased prices. In the case of Massachusetts, the proposal was <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/10/23/business/massachusetts-tipped-worker-ballot-measure-question-5/\">strongly opposed</a> by restaurant lobbying groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The evidence points to a different reality. In states that have increased the minimum wage, there was <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/most-minimum-wage-studies-have-found-little-or-no-job-loss/\">little to no impact</a> on the number of jobs. Some studies have <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/higher-minimum-wages-support-job-growth-economy-recovers-covid-19/\">even shown</a> that a hike in the minimum wage <a href=\"https://sp2.upenn.edu/study-increasing-minimum-wage-has-positive-effects-on-employment-in-fast-food-sector-and-other-highly-concentrated-labor-markets/\">can also lead to higher employment</a> in certain labor markets in part because they attract more workers. And states that have gotten rid of subminimum wages <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/ending-tipped-minimum-wage-will-reduce-poverty-inequality/\">have seen lower poverty rates</a> among tipped workers than states that haven’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/working-papers/sectoral-wage-setting-in-california/\">Recent research</a> from the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley, <a href=\"https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/press-release/new-study-analyzes-impact-of-californias-20-minimum-wage-for-fast-food-workers/\">found</a> that a higher minimum wage did not necessarily lead to significantly higher prices. After California <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-fast-food-20-minimum-wage-law-prices/\">raised the minimum wage</a> for fast food workers up to $20 per hour earlier this year, employment remained stable and prices didn’t dramatically change. According to the study, popular menu items were about 3.7 percent more expensive — about a 15-cent increase for a $4 hamburger.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The next four years will be about the small wins</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s worth noting that during Trump’s first term, when Democrats had control of the House, the former president <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/27/politics/trump-relief-bill-christmas-eve/index.html\">signed</a> some major antipoverty measures into law, including rental assistance, boosted unemployment benefits, and stimulus checks. Of course, that was prompted by a pandemic, a global disaster that we hopefully won’t see a repeat of anytime soon. So that kind of policy at the federal level is highly unlikely to pass in the next four years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why Democratic lawmakers and antipoverty advocates have to focus on the state level to deliver meaningful improvements to people’s lives. The ballot measures on Tuesday, some of which <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/a-review-of-key-2024-ballot-measures-voters-backed-progressive-policy-measures/\">also included provisions</a> that require employers to offer their workers paid sick leave, showed that the public has an appetite for policies that would reduce poverty. And while voters in Massachusetts rejected abolishing the subminimum wage for tipped workers, <a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/politics/2024/11/mass-election-results-question-3-authorizing-rideshare-union-on-brink-of-approval.html\">they passed a ballot measure</a> that allows rideshare drivers to unionize.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats should capitalize on that because it can genuinely make a big difference. Even though the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 per hour, hasn’t changed in 15 years, <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-tracker/\">at least 30 states and Washington, DC</a>, have implemented a higher minimum wage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sometimes, major breakthroughs don’t come from one major legislative overhaul from Congress. They can also be a series of small wins. And we should take them wherever we can.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was featured in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/within-our-means-newsletter-us-poverty-politics-solutions\">Within Our Means</a>&nbsp;newsletter.

    "summary": "There is no sugarcoating it: Donald Trump’s victory on Tuesday is a major setback for many antipoverty policies. With a Republican majority in the Senate (and likely in the House as well), there’s little doubt that spending cuts will be up for debate, and tried-and-failed ideas like imposing work requirements on welfare recipients will be [&#8230;]",

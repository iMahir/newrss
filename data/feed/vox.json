That’s not expected to be an easy task: While the president nominates prime ministers in France, his picks can be ousted at any time by no confidence votes, like Barnier was. And the National Assembly, the lower house of France&#8217;s parliament, is almost evenly divided between the far right, a loosely united and contentious left wing, and centrists including Macron’s allies. Few candidates will please all three factions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disagreement about who should be prime minister following surprise elections this past summer led to Barnier’s rise. He was seen as a capable, if not popular, choice for the job, and won enough approval to win the prime minister’s post. But he faced a significant challenge of trying to govern without a majority. His recent attempt to push through a 2025 national budget without a vote in the lower house of parliament infuriated lawmakers on both the right and left. As a result, France’s far-right party and its left-wing alliance each put forward no-confidence motions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, France is stuck. Without a prime minister,&nbsp; the government’s ability to pass laws is hampered. In the long term, Barnier’s removal could deepen France’s ongoing budget crisis and is a reflection of an unprecedented polarization in French politics, for which a solution seems far out of reach.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who are the players involved?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are three key figures in the no confidence drama: Barnier, the prime minister; Macron, France’s president; and Marine Le Pen, the ideological architect and former leader of the far-right National Rally party, who was instrumental in toppling Barnier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Barnier, a fairly traditional French conservative, has a long career that includes stints in the French government and the European Commission, most notable as the chief Brexit negotiator on the European side. He lost Wednesday’s no-confidence vote and must resign his post. Macron could reappoint him, but he has indicated that he would not accept the job. His tenure is the shortest in modern French history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Macron is a beleaguered, highly unpopular president. He will need to appoint another prime minister quickly to pass the government’s budget and, hopefully, prevent an economic crisis from engulfing France. (More on that below.) However, his options are limited given the dysfunction in the National Assembly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Le Pen is Macron’s chief rival. She has long coveted the French presidency but has failed to secure it three times thus far. She could try again during the next presidential election in 2027, but may be blocked from running, depending on the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/04/france-no-confidence-vote-government-collapse/\">outcome of a corruption trial next spring</a>. If Macron were to resign and an early election were to happen this year, there would be nothing to bar her from entering the race — and that has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-12-04/france-no-confidence-vote-what-next-for-macron-barnier-le-pen\">led to some speculation</a> that deposing Barnier was part of a larger plan to force Macron to quit. (He’s said he’s not going anywhere, however.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless of what Macron decides, Le Pen was able to maneuver her party’s power in the National Assembly and exercise her own influence to bring down Barnier and cause chaos in the French government. She marshaled her party to vote with the left wing coalition’s no confidence motion —&nbsp;even after she <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/france-s-barnier-offers-final-hour-budget-concession-to-le-pen?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=qYiz2hd0\">pushed Barnier to align with her party on key issues</a> in exchange for her party’s approval for his budget.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“She’s annoyed with the political elites and … wants to exercise her vengeance,” <a href=\"https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/patrick-chamorel\">Patrick Chamorel</a>, senior resident scholar at the Stanford Center in Washington, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why is the government in trouble now?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">France’s political turmoil didn’t exactly start with Barnier; to understand what’s happening now, we need to go back to July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was when France held snap parliamentary elections, following the disastrous defeat of Macron’s party in June’s European Parliament elections. Macron’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/359421/france-elections-new-popular-front-macron-le-pen-melenchon\">decision to hold the election was a surprise</a>, and he hoped voters would reject the far right at home. Instead, those elections saw Le Pen’s National Rally party (or RN) gain ground, as did far-right parties across Europe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/359421/france-elections-new-popular-front-macron-le-pen-melenchon\">Going into election day</a>, it seemed all but certain that RN would trounce the various left-wing parties and Macron’s centrists. But a last-ditch effort to keep the right wing out of power <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/nfp-new-popular-front-france-election-winner-melenchon\">formed the New Popular Front</a>, an uneasy alliance of four left-wing parties. Now, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240707-france-s-leftist-new-popular-front-wins-a-shock-victory-%E2%80%93-but-now-the-hard-part-begins\">they have the largest bloc in the National Assembly</a>, but not enough power and support to get their <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/05/nx-s1-5101536/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier\">chosen prime minister candidate approved</a> by the National Assembly. Those left-wing parties<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o\"> </a>have threatened <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o\">a no-confidence vote against Barnier</a> since he took office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fractious parliament has a major problem it needs to deal with: An enormous budget deficit, which is tied into the political crisis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of now, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/france-budget-debt-deficit-macron.html\">country’s budget deficit is 6.1 percent of its output and rising, and debt is at 3.2 trillion Euro.</a> Multiple <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html\">serious crises</a>, including the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine —&nbsp;combined with slow economic growth and low tax revenues —&nbsp;have put the country in this position. French <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html\">companies have begun layoffs</a>, and workers are growing increasingly agitated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Simply put, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html\">France’s economic outlook isn’t good</a>, and if the country wants to change that, it needs a real budget that will both start bringing money into government coffers, not to mention a government that can enact policies to strengthen the overall economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Barnier was tasked with finding a way out; his proposed budget was supposed to save around 60 billion euros by levying large taxes on corporations and the wealthy, as well as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/france-budget-debt-deficit-macron.html\">cutting public spending including on pensions and healthcare reimbursements</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the French tradition of a strong social welfare state, an austerity budget was sure to be unpopular. It was. Unable to garner the RN’s support, he used his <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241202-french-pm-barnier-to-force-budget-bill-through-parliament-49-3-risking-no-confidence-vote\">constitutional powers</a> to pass the budget without the National Assembly’s vote —&nbsp;triggering no-confidence motions from the left- and the right-wing blocs.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What happens now that the government has fallen apart?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the short term, Barnier will have to resign as prime minister, and his Cabinet will be dissolved. He’ll <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html\">likely stay on</a> until Macron can name his replacement. In France, the prime minister governs much of domestic policy while the president tends to handle international affairs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The government will still continue its day-to-day functioning —&nbsp;unlike a government shutdown in the US, government services will continue. But no new laws can be passed until Macron appoints a new prime minister.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That will not be an easy task; because the National Assembly is so polarized, it will be difficult to find a candidate who will have majority support there. (The prime minister does not have to be approved by the parliament, but since blocs can trigger no confidence votes at any time, the president must appoint someone who could survive one.) France cannot hold another parliamentary election until next summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both RN and the far-left party France Unbowed (also known as LFI, part of the New Popular Front coalition) have called on Macron to resign, which he says he will not do. The next French presidential election is scheduled for 2027, but both RN and LFI hope to force Macron out and run their own polarizing candidates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the longer term, France’s budget crisis isn’t going anywhere until there is a government in place to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-next-frances-political-budget-crises-2024-12-02/https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-next-frances-political-budget-crises-2024-12-02/\">pass a 2025 budget</a>, and successfully passing a new budget likely means acquiescing to Le Pen and the RN.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, Le Pen and her party have exercised their power in toppling the government, but Chamorel said there are downsides for her, too. “She will keep her hardline voters,” he told Vox. “But she is going to be held responsible.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Kobayashi, who is from Hawaii, had failed to complete a flight from her home state to New York City. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/us-news/hannah-kobayashi-spotted-buying-bus-ticket-in-la-day-before-police-said-she-crossed-border-into-mexico/\">The footage shows</a> a woman who appears to be Kobayashi at a Los Angeles bus station, buying a ticket to the border. Police say she used her passport to make the purchase, then crossed over into Mexico from San Ysidro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The investigation is the second high-profile missing persons case in recent weeks to take an unexpected turn after the person turned up seemingly unharmed. On November 11, the day before Kobayashi’s family reported her missing, a Wisconsin man resurfaced after being missing for months to admit that he had <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missing-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-wisconsin-240e49d59e3e69ad95f14baea9fda1d9\">faked his own death</a> in a dramatic kayaking incident in order to escape his life and start over in Eastern Europe. Los Angeles investigators felt that Kobayashi had likewise walked away from her own life and that, until she decided to resurface, there was little they could do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/us/hannah-kobayashi-missing/index.html\">stated</a> during a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are several alarming differences between the two cases, beginning with the sharp and sudden turn in Kobayashi’s trajectory. The 30-year-old Maui resident was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/28/us/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashi-profile/index.html\">a free spirit</a> with a love of art, photography, and the outdoors before she boarded a flight to visit a relative on November 8. It was supposed to be her first trip to the New York City — something she’d had on her “bucket list” of places to see — and she had plans to see a Broadway show with a friend before traveling upstate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She was sharing the flight with an ex-boyfriend, though they <a href=\"https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/16/father-flies-la-search-missing-daughter-who-took-flight-maui-vanished/\">reportedly</a> sat in different parts of the plane, and he doesn’t appear to have had anything to do with her disappearance. Kobayashi didn’t join him on their connecting flight out of LAX. Instead, she left the airport. Security footage caught her getting on the Metro headed toward downtown Los Angeles. After her family reported her missing, multiple people reported having seen her at The Grove shopping mall on November 9 and 10. Eagle-eyed web sleuths spotted her appearing on camera 31 seconds into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_bthVI5rMM\">a video</a> shot at a LeBron James Nike event held there. Hannah even uploaded a photo from the event <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCOCme2x2nW/\">to her own Instagram</a> — the last post she’s made there to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During her days spent in the city, she sent a series of alarming texts to family and friends. One text spoke of “Deep Hackers” who “wiped my identity, stole all of my funds, &amp; have had me on a mind fuck since Friday,” while another claimed she’d been “tricked pretty much into giving away all my funds. From someone I thought I loved.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She also told family she’d missed her flight to New York but reportedly <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/hannah-kobayashi-family-missing-hawaii-woman-holding-rally-downtown-los-angeles-call-search-volunteers/15568549/\">used language</a> that family members thought didn’t sound like her. One such suspect text, containing odd endearments she didn’t typically use, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/hannah-kobayashis-friends-think-final-texts-before-disappearance-were-faked-because-they-dont-include-emojis/\">said</a>, “I’m just really scared love &amp; the redwoods if calling me &amp; I know I’m meant to be there, I’m being guided there, like you have before … I risk my freedom if this goes wrong for me hun.” Another spoke of her having “just finished a very intense spiritual awakening.” In one text, Kobayashi <a href=\"https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/15/really-weird-text-messages-prompt-concern-maui-woman-reported-missing-los-angeles/\">reportedly claimed</a> that she was scared and afraid to go home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Even though she was in contact with us, she wasn&#8217;t in contact with us in her right mind,” her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/20/hannah-kobayashi-search-los-angeles-timeline/76437467007/\">told</a> USA Today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I just need to rest &amp; I’ll think better,” one text to her mother, sent on November 11, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/hannah-kobayashis-friends-think-final-texts-before-disappearance-were-faked-because-they-dont-include-emojis/\">reportedly read</a>. “But it’s very complicated Matrix underworld shit.” It was one of her final communications to her family. Her final texts indicated she was returning to the airport and promised to keep her family posted. Although she did return to the airport, she ultimately only picked up her luggage, which she’d requested to have flown back from New York to LA. That evening, <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/post/family-worries-hannah-kobayashi-missing-woman-missed-flight-connection-lax-maui-hawaii-may-have-been-abducted/15560173/\">according to</a> a Facebook post made by her family, she was spotted getting off the Metro near Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center). Her family claimed in the post that they’d seen footage of the sighting which indicated that Hannah “does not appear to be in good condition” and she is not alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After November 11, her phone was turned off, and by the following week, Kobayashi had fallen off the grid — she’d stopped sending text updates, and family and friends fanned out across the city to search for her. We now know that she had already crossed the border into Mexico, but her family <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/us-news/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashi-family-not-heard-from-detectives-for-ten-days/\">claimed</a> they had only radio silence from LAPD about what, if anything, they had learned, leaving them to search for answers alone. After the family held a public rally on November 21, police finally got in touch with them, though it would still be another week before any answers arrived.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the middle of the family’s fear that she’d been abducted or trafficked, and amid enormous and growing public speculation about what happened to her, her father Ryan Kobayashi was searching for her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On November 15, he <a href=\"https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/16/father-flies-la-search-missing-daughter-who-took-flight-maui-vanished/\">told KHNL Hawaii News Now</a> that he’d experienced&nbsp;a “lot of worrying, a lot of confusion. Everything is just a blur it seems, because I haven&#8217;t slept well since I&#8217;ve heard the news.” He went on to ask Hannah to get in touch with the police or with her family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s a lot of people out there that care and love you, Hannah,” he said. “If you can just get to somebody, whatever you can do … just let us know that you’re okay.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At some time around 4 am on November 24, Ryan Kobayashi died by suicide in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m going to continue to stay strong for you,” Hannah Kobayashi’s sister Sydni <a href=\"https://www.wsaz.com/2024/11/25/father-missing-hawaii-woman-found-dead-los-angeles/\">wrote</a> on social media. “We’re going to find Hannah.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite indications that Kobayashi may have been suffering from a mental break or another form of mental illness, Pidgeon pushed back on this possibility. “She has no record on that,” she <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hawaii-maui-woman-alarming-text-missing-los-angeles-rcna180724\">told NBC</a> on November 15. “She is not on medication. Hannah&#8217;s someone that we can call and she&#8217;s going to call us back within an hour.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pidgeon further criticized the public speculation about Hannah’s disappearance for pushing her father to a breaking point. Conspiracy theories online abounded about what happened to her, everything from run-ins with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23959800/escaping-twin-flames-netflix-jeff-ayan-twin-flames-universe-cult-soulmates\">the Twin Flames new-age cult</a> to bad drug trips gone haywire. “If Ryan is looking at all this shit, imagine that weighing on him?” she <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/25/us-news/conspiracy-theories-may-have-sparked-tragic-twist-in-hannah-kobayashis-case/\">told</a> the New York Post, which had previously reported sensationalized details like Kobayashi having <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashis-family-says-venmo-payments-to-mystery-duo-being-investigated/\">paid for a tarot reading</a> while she was out and about in LA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In their announcement that they would be changing Kobayashi’s status to that of a “voluntary missing person,” the LAPD <a href=\"https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/police-say-a-hawaii-woman-disappeared-voluntarily/507-7930e85e-7f85-47fa-b264-1d0faf4501fc\">claimed</a> that Kobayashi had evinced a desire to “step away from modern connectivity.” This included old social media posts she’d made where she seemed to want to “disconnect from her phone,” according to Missing Persons investigator Lt. Douglas Oldfield.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the family continued to press for answers, vowing that the search for Hannah would continue. It won’t, however, be continuing as publicly as before. The burgeoning Facebook group “Help Us Find Hannah,” which grew to over 25,000 members, went private after the announcement on Monday, with family members <a href=\"https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/police-say-a-hawaii-woman-disappeared-voluntarily/507-7930e85e-7f85-47fa-b264-1d0faf4501fc\">reportedly claiming</a> to have received “threats against their lives and the lives of their small children.” It’s unclear what if anything provoked the threats, but it is clear that public speculation and scrutiny surrounding Kobayashi’s disappearance had spiraled in the weeks since she first left LAX. On Tuesday, moderators of Reddit’s r/Hawaii subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/1h5av1i/hannah_kobayashi_is_believed_to_be_in_mexico/\">locked their post</a> about the disappearance because it was “starting to see a lot of baseless conspiracy theories.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However complicated Kobayashi’s story is, it seems abundantly clear that her family is right to be alarmed for her safety. It’s also increasingly evident that while the era of social media and heightened public scrutiny over police investigations can be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22684204/gabby-petito-missing-updates-internet-web-sleuthing\">uniquely beneficial</a>, it can also be extremely overwhelming, obfuscatory, and frustrating to family, friends, and officials trying to find loved ones. While the huge number of eyes on Hannah as she went on her journey was undoubtedly helpful in locating her, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hannahkobayashi/comments/1h4ob9z/spotted_on_venice_beach/\">false sightings</a> and far-fetched rumors may have made it harder on the family. Hannah Kobayashi’s situation, however alarming, was and is potentially resolvable. It’s impossible to know whether the tragedy of her father’s suicide could have been avoided if her disappearance hadn’t become headline-grabbing news, but it almost certainly didn’t help.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, while it’s tempting to blame Ryan Kobayashi’s death on the media and public frenzy, the real stressors might have been much closer to home.

Skrmetti</em></a>, arguably the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/385198/supreme-court-transgender-united-states-skrmetti\">most important transgender rights case the Court has ever heard</a>. The case asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution — and it appears most of the justices feel it does not. The likely result is that the Court will allow states to ban health procedures that enable gender-affirming care, both for minors and, potentially, adults.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The argument went terribly for transgender Americans, as many of the justices suggested creating a carveout from the ordinary constitutional rule restricting sex-based discrimination of all kinds. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, suggested giving the government broad authority to engage in such discrimination in the medical context — a ruling that could also have severe implications for women generally, including cisgender women.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said at one point in the argument, “I’m getting kind of nervous” that the Court is going to chip away at one of the “bedrock” principles in US anti-discrimination laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Skrmetti</em> involves a 2023 Tennessee law that prohibits trans youth from receiving medical treatments, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, if those treatments are prescribed to help them transition. Notably, the law is quite explicit that its purpose is to “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-101-findings\">encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex</a>” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although this particular law involves a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Tennessee&#8217;s arguments in favor of the law could also permit the government to prohibit adults from receiving the same treatments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At least four justices — Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh — appeared all but certain to vote to uphold Tennessee’s law. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, was a bit less direct in her questioning, but she largely seemed sympathetic to Tennessee’s position. Most notably, Barrett signaled midway through the argument that she was open to Roberts’s call for a medical carveout from the Constitution’s restrictions on sex discrimination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Republican who authored a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/15/21291515/supreme-court-bostock-clayton-county-lgbtq-neil-gorsuch\">landmark opinion protecting trans rights in 2020</a>, was silent throughout the argument. That left only the Court’s three Democrats to defend the orthodox approach to laws that discriminate on the basis of sex, which casts a skeptical eye on any law that treats people differently because of their sex assigned at birth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest question in <em>Skrmetti</em>, in other words, is likely to be <em>how</em> the Court finds a way to uphold Tennessee&#8217;s law, rather than <em>whether</em> the Court does so. And it seems fairly likely that the Court’s opinion could fundamentally alter the rules governing sex discrimination by the government.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the Court’s current precedents approach laws that draw lines based on sex</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most important thing to understand about Tennessee’s law is that it explicitly draws lines based on a patient’s sex assigned at birth. If a child who is assigned male at birth<strong> </strong>is prescribed testosterone by their doctor, Tennessee permits that child to receive that treatment. But a child who is assigned female at birth may not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, while Matthew Rice, the Tennessee solicitor general defending his state’s law, tried many times to deny that this law classifies based on sex, he eventually admitted that it did after being pressed by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Jackson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jackson, for example, asked Rice whether this law would permit a boy who seeks testosterone because he wants to deepen his voice and otherwise enhance his masculinity to receive that treatment, and Rice eventually conceded that, under the specific law at issue in this case, the boy could. Rice then eventually admitted that, if a girl sought the same treatment for the same purpose — to deepen her voice and to make her body appear more masculine — Tennessee’s law would prohibit her from receiving the treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This matters because, in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>United States v. Virginia</em></a> (1996), the Supreme Court held that “all gender-based classifications” are subject to “heightened scrutiny,” meaning that the law is treated as presumptively unconstitutional and the state has to prove that its law was not enacted for impermissibly sexist reasons. Some laws survive this heightened scrutiny, if those laws are grounded in real differences between the sexes and not in prejudice or stereotypes. But, under <em>Virginia</em>, any law that draws lines based on sex in any way whatsoever receives this higher level of review from the federal courts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Significantly, neither the Biden administration, which argued against Tennessee&#8217;s law in the Supreme Court, nor the ACLU, which represents families that want their transgender children to have access to care, asked the Supreme Court to definitively strike down Tennessee&#8217;s law right now. Rather, the sole issue before the Court is whether to send the case back down to a federal appeals court that previously refused to apply the heightened scrutiny required by <em>Virginia</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But many of the justices appeared determined not to apply <em>Virginia</em> to this case. Roberts, for example, warned that there are “medical nuances” in this case that weren’t present in <em>Virginia</em> or some of the Court’s other previous gender discrimination cases. And he suggested that the courts should take a more deferential approach to state lawmakers in cases involving medicine because judges are not good at making medical judgments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kavanaugh echoed Roberts’s thinking, suggesting at one point that the Constitution does not take sides on a “medical and policy debate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Barrett also appeared sympathetic to Roberts’s approach, asking Chase Strangio, the ACLU lawyer, whether the courts have ever applied heightened scrutiny in a case involving medical judgments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Strangio had an excellent answer to this question: During the pandemic, several churches and other religious institutions claimed that they had a constitutional right to defy state rules prohibiting too many people from gathering in one place in order to prevent the spread of Covid. The Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett\">eventually split 5-4 in these cases</a>, with five of the Republican justices concluding that the right to freely practice religion overcomes a state’s medical determination that large public gatherings are too dangerous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Barrett, however, did not appear persuaded, claiming that the Covid cases, in which she ruled with the majority, did not involve “diving deep into the medical evidence.” (Roberts dissented in the Covid cases, so his position in the Covid cases is consistent with the position he seemed to lay out in <em>Skrmetti</em>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thomas and Alito’s questions, meanwhile, were consistently hostile to the two lawyers arguing in favor of trans rights. When you add their votes to Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, that’s a majority likely in favor of Tennessee’s law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the Court adopts Roberts’s approach, which seems likely, that’s not just a devastating blow to transgender youth and their families. It’s also a sea change in the Court’s approach to sex discrimination of all kinds. Again, <em>Virginia</em> held that “all” laws that draw lines based on sex must survive heightened scrutiny, even though some laws ultimately clear this hurdle. “All” means all. But now many of the justices seem eager to hold that only some laws that classify people based on sex are presumptively unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This case arrives at the Court at the worst possible moment</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to divorce this case from its political context. During his recently victorious presidential campaign, President-elect Donald Trump went <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380861/trump-transphobic-anti-trans-ads-scapegoating\">all in on anti-trans rhetoric</a> — spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars on ads that, in the Washington Post’s words, “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/05/election-trans-sports-trump-campaign/\">paint trans people as a menace to society</a>.” Republicans control six of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, so it’s not surprising that a majority of the Republican justices seemed to align with their party’s position on trans rights (the Court’s three Democrats, for that matter, also appear aligned with their own party).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, in their apparent eagerness to uphold this Tennessee law, the Court’s Republican majority appears likely not just to strike a blow against trans rights. They also appear poised to do considerable damage to the legal standard governing sex discrimination generally. Perhaps Tennessee could, if this case were sent back down to the lower court, offer a justification for its law that survives heightened scrutiny. But most of the justices appear ready to overrule <em>Virginia</em>’s statement that all sex-based classifications must undergo such scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is why, near the end of Strangio’s time at the podium, Jackson said she is “suddenly quite worried” about the implications of the Court’s questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the Court can create a medical carveout to the general rule that all sex discrimination is presumptively unconstitutional, what other carveouts might they create in the future? For that matter, will the Court also create similar carveouts for other forms of discrimination, such as race discrimination? Jackson even went so far as to compare Tennessee’s arguments to Virginia’s unsuccessful defense of its ban on interracial marriage in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/1/\"><em>Loving v. Virginia</em></a> (1967).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that said, the Court most likely will not hand down an opinion in <em>Skrmetti</em> until June 2025, when the Court normally decides the biggest cases of its term. There may be time for voices like Jackson’s to convince some of her colleagues to compromise. But based on Wednesday’s argument, <em>Skrmetti</em> appears likely to not just be a historic blow to transgender Americans, but potentially a similar blow against all people who might experience unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Despite that ongoing gridlock, the move to declare martial law took Yoon’s political opponents, allies, the South Korean public —&nbsp;and the world —&nbsp;by surprise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shortly after Yoon’s declaration, South Korea’s parliament, known as the National Assembly, met to unanimously vote down the martial law decree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is no reason to declare martial law. We cannot let the military rule this country,” opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said Tuesday. “President Yoon Suk Yeol has betrayed the people. President Yoon’s illegal declaration of emergency martial law is null and void.” Martial law typically involves the suspension of civilian government and rule by military decree in a major emergency, such as intense armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite Yoon’s pledge to lift his declaration, the country is still in limbo; on Wednesday, opposition parties in the National Assembly submitted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/04/south-korea-martial-law-president-yoon-suk-yeol-calls-to-resign-ntwnfb\">motion for Yoon’s impeachment</a>, and a vote could come as soon as Friday. What comes next is unclear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here is what you need to know.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why did the president declare martial law?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yoon only spoke in broad strokes about his decision. However, it’s possible that his declaration was influenced by his <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_387319.html\">dwindling public support</a>, political gridlock, and an ongoing ethics investigation into his wife over a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/asia/south-korea-dior-bag-scandal-intl-hnk-dst/index.html\">handbag alleged to be an improper gift</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The conservative Yoon is in the second year of his five-year term; during his tenure, his approval rating has fallen below <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_387319.html\">20 percentage points</a>. He’s also been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1\">deadlocked with the National Assembly</a>, which is controlled by the center-left Democratic Party, over his political agenda.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yoon “certainly is unpopular and frustrated by an inability to do politics,” Celeste Arrington, director of the George Washington Institute for Korean Studies, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yoon “has used an unprecedented number of presidential vetoes” to try and push his agenda through, Arrington said. “He&#8217;s also launched politically motivated prosecutions of the opposition party. Meanwhile, the opposition party has tried to impeach dozens of members of this government and has launched investigations into the first lady. So this [political battle] was back and forth and back and forth, building.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yoon did explicitly claim that North Korean elements played a role in his decision to declare martial law, though there’s no actual evidence of North Korea playing a role in the present crisis. Instead, his reference to North Korea may refer to the major political divide between the country’s two main parties on whether and how to engage with their totalitarian and belligerent northern neighbor.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does martial law in South Korea entail?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/03/world/south-korea-martial-law/south-korea-martial-law-yoon?smid=url-share\">Under martial law</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-we-know-about-south-koreas-martial-law-declaration-2024-12-03/\">executive branch is allowed to take control of the media</a>, and Yoon <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1\">ordered the country’s medical personnel</a>, who have been on strike for much of the year, back to work within 48 hours. It’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-we-know-about-south-koreas-martial-law-declaration-2024-12-03\">not clear to what extent those measures were put into place</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Furthermore, political activity, including political party meetings and rallies, is supposed to cease. This was obviously disregarded: The National Assembly met, and protests continued through the night.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Armed guards surrounded the National Assembly building Tuesday night; 190 members of the 300-member body showed up to unanimously vote down the measure, with some&nbsp;scaling the fence around the building to do so, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/south-koreas-president-declares-martial-law-citing-threat-of-pro-north-korean-forces-a1fdc738\">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What has the reaction been?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yoon’s declaration has been almost <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/martial-law-south-korea-intl/index.html?t=1733247705508\">universally unpopular</a> within South Korea. Citizens showed up to protest —&nbsp;even engaging in clashes with security forces.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both the opposition leader and the leader of Yoon’s own party denounced Yoon’s decision.&nbsp;“It’s an illegal, unconstitutional declaration of martial law that does not meet the requirements,” said <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/south-koreas-president-declares-martial-law-citing-threat-of-pro-north-korean-forces-a1fdc738\">Han Dong-hoon, a former justice minister and leader of Yoon’s People Power Party</a>. “South Korea is a democratic country. We will protect democracy alongside our citizens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US, a longtime ally of South Korea, said it did not know about Yoon’s declaration before it came.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,” <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-kurt-m-campbell-at-a-preview-of-the-usa-pavilion-at-expo-2025-osaka/\">US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell&nbsp;said Tuesday</a>.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Wednesday, mass demonstrations called for Yoon’s resignation, and the country’s main labor union organization called for a general strike until Yoon steps down.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yoon has said he would lift the martial law declaration in accordance with the National Assembly’s vote, as he is constitutionally required to do. The cabinet agreed to lift the order early Wednesday morning local time, and protesters have begun to disperse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, this is not the end of the crisis, Gi-Wook Shin, director of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The decision [to declare martial law] appears to be an attempt to assert authority in a climate where his favorability has been declining, but this is basically political suicide as it risks being seen as an overreach of power and might lead to him facing impeachment,” Shin said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-25a2a7c957e77a19f771b6b7c56a2173\">Opposition parties in the National Assembly have submitted</a> a formal call for Yoon’s impeachment. Together the parties hold 192 of 300 seats, and a two-thirds majority — or 200 votes — are required to pass the impeachment. Some members of Yoon’s party voted with the opposition to overturn the state of martial law, so it’s possible that the president’s own party members could also vote to impeach him. Six of the nine justices in South Korea’s constitutional court would have to approve the measure for it to pass.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless of what happens to Yoon, polarization between the two main parties and high levels of public dissatisfaction with politics remain, Arrington told Vox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Neither side is particularly popular; the public trust in both the conservatives and the progressives is low,” she said. “There&#8217;s a deep frustration with the way democratic institutions are functioning, in particular the political parties and the National Assembly.” And the end of the martial law crisis does nothing to change that reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, December 4, 11:15 am: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on December 3 and has been updated to include information about calls for impeaching Yoon.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Bluehost doesn’t influence our editorial decisions, but they make videos like this possible.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When choosing a restaurant, you probably look at a few things: What<em> </em>type<em> </em>of food do they serve? How close is it? Are they allergen- or kid-friendly? You’re very likely looking at the list of entrees available to see if anything strikes you before even making a reservation. It’s a pretty typical way to choose a restaurant. After all, you want to enjoy your night out. But chef-instructor Kathryn Gordon from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York has one more suggestion: “I think you should try to look at the dessert menu more.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Desserts at most restaurants have gotten boring. You might find an incredible blend of cocktails or a wide-ranging wine list, followed by a well-curated list of sharable plates for appetizers, and of course the entrees will almost always offer some sort of wow factor.

But he has hosted Steve Bannon’s podcast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patel is a contributor at <a href=\"https://americasvoice.news/\">Real America’s Voice</a>, the right-wing news network that produces Bannon’s show<em> War Room</em>, and has long appeared as a guest on the show. After top Trump adviser Bannon was imprisoned for four months earlier this year —&nbsp;on charges of contempt of Congress after he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/7/22/23274701/steve-bannon-conviction-contempt-congress-sentence\">refused to comply with a January 6 Committee subpoena</a> —&nbsp;Patel stepped up to serve as an occasional guest host.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To try and understand Patel better, I listened to every episode and clip tagged with “Kash Patel” on the <em>War Room</em> website —&nbsp;and a few others that Bannon’s team missed. The overwhelming impression is that Patel is a man whose entire worldview revolves around paranoid conspiracy theories — specifically, conspiracies against both America and Trump, which for him are one and the same. It’s a specific kind of obsession that reminds me of the FBI’s first director: J. Edgar Hoover, a man who infamously abused his power to persecute political enemies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his various appearances on Bannon’s show, Patel and/or his interviewees declared that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>China is funding the Democratic Party and sending “<a href=\"https://warroom.org/election-infiltration-alert-chinese-communist-spies-invading-the-u-s-through-open-borders/\">military-aged males</a>” across the Mexican and Canadian borders to prepare for a preemptive strike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Barack Obama directs a “<a href=\"https://warroom.org/unveiling-the-shadow-network-barack-h-obamas-lasting-impact-according-to-lee-smith/\">shadow network</a>” that is quietly directing the intelligence community and Big Tech to persecute Trump.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attorney General Merrick Garland wants to throw “<a href=\"https://warroom.org/kash-patel-calls-for-action-holding-merrick-garland-and-gop-holdouts-accountable-to-the-constitution/\">all of us</a>” — which is to say, Trump allies —&nbsp;in prison.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Patel is willing to go to extreme measures in response to these alleged threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In one episode, he called on the Republican majority in Congress to unilaterally arrest Garland&nbsp;— invoking an obscure legal doctrine called “inherent contempt” that has never been used in this fashion <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=jcl\">in the entirety of American history</a>. In another, he outlined a plan for a MAGA blitz of American institutions focused on <a href=\"https://warroom.org/sit-rep-kash-patels-roadmap-for-trumps-swift-takeover-of-d-c-power-in-the-warroom/\">getting loyalists into high office</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is hard to tell whether Patel genuinely believes this stuff or is merely performing for Bannon’s audience. But it’s largely immaterial.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because it is this performance that made him a star in Trumpworld: his willingness to ape Trump’s own conspiratorial worldview making him into a person Trump wants to be in charge of America’s domestic security services. Once in power, his stated commitment to these beliefs — whatever he thinks privately — will push him to act in line with them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patel, in short, is the kind of man who could become Trump’s Hoover: a man willing to push federal law enforcement into dangerously anti-democratic territory in pursuit of alleged domestic enemies.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The world according to Kash Patel</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patel <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/kash-patel-trump-national-security-council/679566/\">owes his career to Russiagate</a>: the seemingly never-ending fight over whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russian efforts to interfere in American elections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patel worked as a staffer for then-Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chair of the House subcommittee on intelligence and Trump’s chief defender during the controversy. Patel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/kashyap-patel-nunes-memo.html\">authored</a> the famous 2018 “Nunes memo” arguing that the FBI application to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was filled with errors and motivated by political bias.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The memo got <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/\">more right</a> than many observers (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/2/16965086/nunes-memo-dud-release\">including myself</a>) gave it credit for at the time&nbsp;— though it did <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/about-presidential-medal-freedom-revisiting-nunes-memo\">get the bigger picture about FBI bias wrong</a>. Regardless, the incident turned Patel into a Trumpworld star. He ascended to several high-level positions in the first Trump administration relating to defense, national security, and intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These experiences have given Patel a worldview that I think is best defined as paranoid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patel believes that foreign enemies — ranging from China to Iran to drug cartels — are doing their best to infiltrate the United States and wreak havoc on its homeland. Only Trump has the strength and the fortitude to stand up against these enemies and defend American allies like Israel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democrats, he believes, do not just disagree with Trump&nbsp;on how to handle these threats: They are actively aligned with America’s enemies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In one <em>War Room</em> segment, for example, Patel hosted <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2015/03/why-do-people-keep-predicting-chinas-collapse/\">a discredited China “expert”</a> named Gordon Chang to warn that China was “planning an attack on our facilities on our soil.” But it’s worse than that, Chang argued: China had installed Joe Biden as the president of the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They were actually able to cast the decisive vote in 2020,” Chang told Patel, claiming without evidence that China “poured money into Joe Biden’s campaign” through the Democratic crowdfunding platform ActBlue. Patel’s response was not skepticism but credulity: “I hope people are paying attention.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Democrats are not merely unwitting cat’s paws of foreign powers, per Patel: They are nefarious actors aiming to tear down American democracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of Patel’s favorite phrases, one that he uses again and again on Bannon’s show, is “two-tiered system of justice.” In his mind, federal law enforcement employs two distinct standards — one for “the deep state’s” friends and another for its enemies. Its allies, like the Bidens, receive only limited and superficial scrutiny,&nbsp;while its enemies are constantly harassed and persecuted. The four prosecutions of Trump, for Patel, are not legitimate inquiries into wrongdoing and abuses of power, but rather agents of a corrupt system lashing out at the one man who threatens their grip on America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For this reason, Patel has an enemies list — literally. His book <em>Government Gangsters</em>, which he is constantly hawking on <em>War Room</em>, contains <a href=\"https://x.com/Timodc/status/1863620081873244259\">an appendix</a> listing dozens of names that comprise the “executive branch deep state.” The list ranges from names of people you know, like Vice President Kamala Harris, to people you’ve never heard of, like a former State Department diplomat named Elizabeth Dibble.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Patel’s potential power perversions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If this all reminds you of the most infamous director of the FBI — J. Edgar Hoover — well, it should. The two men share a dangerous tendency to link enemies foreign and domestic, and a willingness to entertain dangerous abuses of law enforcement powers in fighting them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/02/14/146862081/the-history-of-the-fbis-secret-enemies-list#:~:text=Hoover%20started%20amassing%20secret%20intelligence,the%20FBI%20had%20deemed%20subversive.&amp;text=Newspapers%2FGetty%20Images-,Hoover%20saw%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.,%2C%22%20says%20author%20Tim%20Weiner.\">his book <em>Enemies</em></a>, journalist Tim Weiner argues that Hoover’s worldview was defined by a bone-deep fear of Communist plots against the American homeland —&nbsp;up to and including physical attacks from “kamikaze airplanes” and “dirty bombs.” Hoover began maintaining a secret list of “enemies of the United States” inside of government and out, conducting illegal surveillance and other law-bending operations designed to bring them to heel. One example: a plot to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/12/7204453/martin-luther-king-fbi-letter\">convince Martin Luther King Jr. to kill himself</a> by threatening to expose the civil rights leader’s sexual indiscretions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In theory, this is the kind of abuse of power that Patel is against. He rails constantly against government surveillance and abuses of power against political enemies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet at the same time, he is constantly proposing schemes —&nbsp;like Congress arresting Garland — that amount to efforts to criminalize political disagreements. This includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/kash-patel-fbi.html\">proposals</a> to investigate prominent Democrats and even prosecute journalists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections — we’re going to come after you,” he said in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joyannreid/reel/DDBBgt0NnfQ/\">a guest appearance</a> on <em>War Room</em> last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was adapted from the On the Right newsletter.</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>New editions drop every Wednesday.

Topless, vomiting, and screaming, Lathers told police officers that <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/13/instagram-model-marie-lathers-pink-cocaine-miami/75213417007/\">she was under the influence of a drug called “tusi,”</a> a pink powder that’s gaining popularity in the US. A toxicology report later found that while she hadn’t been drinking, there were several other drugs in her system — but nothing called tusi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://energycontrol.org/sustancias/tusi/\">“Tucibi” </a>— also called tusi or pink cocaine — is a Spanish phonetic play on 2C-B, a California-born synthetic psychedelic originally popular amongst Gen X psychonauts and ravers seeking a euphoric, trippy high. However, despite either of its names, pink cocaine rarely contains 2C-B or cocaine at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the 2000s, 2C-B made its way from European nightclubs to Colombia, where it devolved into something else entirely: a pink powdered cocktail of every type of party drug you might find at Coachella. It’s essentially a Gen Z <a href=\"https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/heroin/speedball/\">speedball</a>: Rather than blending cocaine and heroin, pink cocaine mixes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/24/17603616/depression-treatment-severe-ketamine-special-k\">ketamine</a> with stimulants <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/365820/mdma-therapy-lykos-therapeutics-maps-psychedelics-ecstasy\">like MDMA</a> and even caffeine. It can also include <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2023.2207716\">a chaotic sprinkling</a> of methamphetamine, DMT, and oxycodone, among other substances.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Largely through artful <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOjAlLoXOhQ\">cartel marketing</a> portraying tusi as pretty, fun, and accessible, this blend of cheap drug leftovers has become the substance of choice for Colombian DJs and Mexican rappers, a wolf in sheep’s clothing for European ravers, and a source of confusion for everyone else. Tusi is making its way across the world, and it’s increasingly important that potential users know what it is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The global war on drugs was originally organized around the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/synthetic-drugs-could-change-the-global-drug-trade-forever-v26n3/\">production and trafficking of plant-based drugs</a> like cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. But in recent years, drug manufacturers have turned to synthetic drugs like MDMA, ketamine, and fentanyl, which are easier to mass produce and smuggle across borders. Pink cocaine is everything new all at once — easy money for producers, a cheap Instagrammable high for users, and a massive headache for law enforcement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest problem: like playing a game of Russian roulette, only luck decides whether you’ll have fun — or die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How 2C-B became tucibi&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine, or 2C-B, was first synthesized in the 1970s by Californian biochemist and psychonaut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/03/alexander-shulgin\">Alexander Shulgin</a>, who is best known for introducing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/363903/mdma-medicine-ptsd-fda\">MDMA</a> to the world of psychotherapy. Of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/from-the-archive-blog/2014/jun/03/shulgin-alexander-drugs-ecstasy-mdma\">over 100</a> psychedelics Shulgin created, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/sihkal-shulgins-i-have-known-and-loved/\">2C-B was his favorite</a> — in <a href=\"https://www.cognitiveliberty.org/ccle1/shulgin/adsarchive/2cb.htm\">his words</a>, “one of the most graceful, erotic, sensual, introspective compounds I have ever invented.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The effects of 2C-B are <a href=\"https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CB_Glowing_Experiences.shtml\">often described</a> as an MDMA-LSD hybrid, giving users both a heightened, vibrant sensory experience and a feeling of euphoria and openness. In many ways, Shulgin viewed 2C-B as a counterpart to MDMA, which has been touted for its therapeutic potential <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/363903/mdma-medicine-ptsd-fda\">for 40 years</a>, well before it became popular as a club drug. Not only are the two drugs chemically similar, but their psychoactive effects complement each other. “Once the MDMA has shown you where your problems are,” <a href=\"https://www.cognitiveliberty.org/ccle1/shulgin/adsarchive/2cb.htm\">Shulgin wrote</a>, “the 2C-B opens up the emotional, intuitive, and archetypal area of your psyche to help you solve them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Anecdotally, <a href=\"https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?A=Search&amp;S1=52&amp;Sub1=&amp;DoseMethodID=-1&amp;S2=-3&amp;Sub2=&amp;S3=-1&amp;Sub3=&amp;Str=&amp;Title=&amp;AuthorSearch=&amp;A1=-1&amp;GenderSelect=-1&amp;Intensity=&amp;I2=&amp;C1=1&amp;Context=-1&amp;Lang=1&amp;Group=-1&amp;S4=-1&amp;SP=1\">many people report</a> that 2C-B’s psychedelic effects are relatively mild and short-lived. Trips last a few hours, unlike the full-day trip provided by LSD. Like other hallucinogens, 2C-B generally doesn’t <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-2cb-and-its-effects/\">cause a next-day hangover</a>, according to users <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-2cb-and-its-effects/\">interviewed by Vice</a>. It can also have <a href=\"https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/2c-b/\">less fun side effects</a> like anxiety, nausea, headaches, or elevated heart rate, any of which can get dangerous in situations where users are dancing — and likely not drinking enough water — in crowded, hot spaces.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the 1980s and early 1990s, 2C-B was legally manufactured and sold in adult bookstores and dance clubs <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs0/665/665p.pdf\">as a libido-enhancing drug</a>. That changed when the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs0/665/index.htm\">listed 2C-B as a Schedule I drug</a> in 1995, pushing it underground, where it remained a <a href=\"https://psychedelichealth.co.uk/2023/06/23/2c-b-lsd-mdma-baby/\">relatively niche drug for rave-goers</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But over the past decade, it’s become an <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-2cb-and-its-effects/\">increasingly popular party drug</a> in Latin America, Europe, and the US. The <a href=\"https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/30537/1/Exec-Summary.pdf\">2019 Global Drug Survey</a> of over 120,000 people from more than 30 countries reported that darknet purchases of 2C-B and other drugs have been on the rise since 2014.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the early 2000s, wealthy young people <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/es/noticias/tusi-coctel-sicodelico-rosa-engano-latinoamerica/\">smuggled small amounts of 2C-B</a> from Europe to Colombia, where it quickly became popular in <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2c-b-now-drug-of-choice-for-colombia-elite/\">Colombia’s elite club scene</a>. By 2012, models, politicians, and actors were <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2c-b-now-drug-of-choice-for-colombia-elite/\">shelling out 130,000 pesos</a> (about $71 at the time) for a gram of 2C-B — over 10 times the price of cocaine. “The media positioned it as an elite drug,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/juli%C3%A1n-andr%C3%A9s-quintero-l%C3%B3pez-a5b28421/?originalSubdomain=co\">Julian Quintero</a>, a sociologist, drug researcher, and director of the <a href=\"https://www.acciontecnicasocial.com/que-es-ats/\">Technical Social Action Corporation</a> (ATS), a Colombian drug policy nonprofit. “Very few could access it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While 2C-B was considered high-class, it wasn’t much to look at. It was usually sold as a plain-looking pill or an <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.jpg#/media/File:4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.jpg\">off-white, bitter powder</a> that <a href=\"https://www.bdp.org.uk/get-information/drugs-information/2c-b/\">hurts to snort</a>. To make the drug more appealing, narcos started mixing the powder with sweet pink food coloring. Soon, demand outpaced the supply of 2C-B available in Latin America, so Colombian dealers <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/es/noticias/tusi-coctel-sicodelico-rosa-engano-latinoamerica/\">cut the powder</a> with cheaper, longer-lasting, and more abundant European imports like MDMA and ketamine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People began calling the pink powder “<a href=\"https://energycontrol.org/sustancias/tusi/\">tusi,</a>” a Spanish spelling of the English pronunciation of “2C.” In the early 2010s, Quintero said, tusi still reliably contained about 10 percent 2C-B, mixed in with the MDMA and ketamine. But by the mid-2010s, the 2C-B component disappeared.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Removing the priciest ingredient, Quintero told me, was the “magic formula.” Today, a gram of tusi costs $10, not $100, making it accessible to just about anyone who can afford a night out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/joseph-j-palamar\">Joseph Palamar</a>, a drug use epidemiologist at New York University and deputy director of the <a href=\"https://ndews.org/\">National Drug Early Warning System</a>, said that the homophones — “tusi” and “2C-B” — initially confused old school ’90s ravers, who only knew of the original 2C-B and likely thought that’s what they were taking. But, he said, “new school people probably don’t know the difference.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One surprising thing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the flurry of headlines announcing that, according to an anonymous tip, Liam Payne’s autopsy found pink cocaine in his system, there’s no chemical test for pink cocaine. You can only test for its common ingredients, like ketamine and MDMA. If both of those substances are found at once, it <em>might </em>be pink cocaine — but there’s no way to know for sure.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>“Those who use cocaine represent the old. Those who use tusi represent the new”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Calling the powder “pink cocaine,” or polvo rosa<em>,</em> has even less to do with the drug’s contents. “The name ‘pink cocaine’ is one of many fantasies invented by the police to name things they don’t understand,” Quintero said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of polvo rosa’s<em> </em>rise in the club scene can be attributed to its Instagram-ready aesthetic. “The fact that it’s a pretty color draws a lot of people in,” Palamar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a brilliant marketing strategy: transform a bland-looking, expensive, exclusive synthetic drug into an Instagram-worthy accessory that almost any partygoer can afford — simply by changing just about everything in it. If tusi had a standard recipe — something potential users could make informed decisions about — this wouldn’t be as big a deal. But as tusi became more popular, the color told users increasingly little about what they were ingesting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The thing is,” Palamar said, “anyone could dye any powder pink.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The initial rise of tusi in Latin America was part of a broader trend: Coca and opium production <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/un-world-drug-report-new-drugs-new-users\">declined between 2007 and 2012</a> for a number of factors, including <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/WDR2012/WDR_2012_web_small.pdf\">increased seizures of heroin</a> exported to the US and evolving drug preferences. At the same time, the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs like 2C-B, MDMA, and ketamine grew. La Empreza, a street gang claiming to be the first to make and sell tusi in Colombia, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOjAlLoXOhQ\">told Vice</a> in 2022 that in addition to MDMA, ketamine, and caffeine, their recipe for the drug includes synthetic methamphetamines, LSD, and fentanyl, among other chemicals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A batch of tusi is essentially made by tossing assorted drugs into a pan, adding a dash of pink food coloring, and stirring the mixture by hand. This isn’t even a great way to make a salad — the dressing won’t be evenly distributed across the greens, and some bites will wind up with more toppings than others. When mixing a powder and liquid drug salad, it’s nearly impossible to ensure that each dose of the final product will contain the same ratio of ingredients. When preparing non-toxic food, perfectly even distribution isn’t usually a concern, but a gram of powder that may contain a mystery dose of a powerful sedative like ketamine — or even the far deadlier fentanyl — is dangerous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that tusi is so easy to make doesn’t just make it risky — it’s making it more popular. Because tusi is synthetic, lacks a standard recipe, and doesn’t require special equipment beyond kitchenware to make, nearly anyone can prepare it themselves. “Tusi not only emerged as a new drug for a new generation, but also popularized the idea that you can make your own drugs at home,” Quintero said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of a couple years ago, tusi was the fifth most popular drug in Colombia. Pink cocaine has become synonymous with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D5mC8fXHgQ\">Colombian guaracha</a>, a style of electronic house music often referencing the drug in the lyrics. In the song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D5mC8fXHgQ\">Magia Rosa</a>” by DJ Goozo, Massianello, and NesBunny, featured vocalist Paulette sings: “Quiero magia rosas que me ponga poderosa.” In English, this roughly translates to “I want pink magic to become powerful.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Quintero told me that the rise of tusi paralleled the rise of reggaeton, guaracha, small-scale drug dealers, and sexual tourism to Colombia, lending the drug a distinct cultural ethos for a younger generation. “Those who use cocaine represent the old,” he said. “Those who use tusi represent the new.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps nowhere outside Colombia is tusi more celebrated in pop culture than Mexico. While tusi isn’t often mentioned by the Mexican government or mainstream news media, it frequently appears in corridos tumbados — a genre of Mexican regional music blending the vibrant accordions, plucky bass lines, and quintessential trumpets of traditional corridos with hip-hop and reggaeton. Peso Pluma, a 25-year-old Mexican rapper, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/arts/music/peso-pluma-regional-mexican-music.html\">skyrocketed to global stardom</a> last year with the love song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZiaYpD9ZrI\">Ella Baila Sola</a>,” a collaboration with regional group Eslabon Armado. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But a large swath of corridos tumbados are considered <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-05-22/peso-pluma-regional-mexican-ella-baila-sola\">narcocorridos</a>, or songs centered around the plight of cartels or drugs. Three of his songs — “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wnso2A4PZE\">Lady Gaga</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9If4-IhzM0\">Rosa Pastel,</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jvO-GCO_Tk\">Las Morras</a>” — mention using pink cocaine as part of a glamorous lifestyle, and music videos for those three songs alone have racked up over 500 million views combined. (Sometimes, the glamorous lifestyle isn’t so glamorous: Peso Pluma had to cancel and reschedule concerts last year because of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/arts/music/peso-pluma-postpone-concerts-threats.html\">death threats from a cartel</a>.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"LADY GAGA (Video Oficial) - Peso Pluma, Gabito Ballesteros, Junior H\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Wnso2A4PZE?rel=0\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Europe, home to hard-partying tourist destinations like Ibiza, isn’t a stranger to trippy, risky drugs. Combinations of ketamine and MDMA have been <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/new-drug-queensland-festival-pill-testing/\">trending among festivalgoers</a> across the world lately, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-five-big-drug-trends-defining-summer-2024/\">priming the club scene</a> for tusi’s arrival. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The drug first arrived in Europe sometime <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pink-cocaine-tusi-colombia-drug/\">within the last decade or so</a>. Claudio Vidal, a director at <a href=\"https://energycontrol.org/\">Energy Control</a>, a drug harm reduction nonprofit in Spain, told me that while the first big pink cocaine drug bust happened in 2016, Energy Control first analyzed samples of pink powder in 2011.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/scientific/Global_SMART_Update_2022_Vol.27.pdf\">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported</a> tusi popping up at music festivals in Austria, Switzerland, and the UK, in addition to party scenes in Spain and Italy. That same year, a <a href=\"https://energycontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/OEC2022_INFORME_DEF.pdf\">survey of nearly 1,500 recreational drug users</a> at European EDM festivals found that about 20 percent had tried tusi in the last 12 months. And this summer, pink cocaine started to gain traction in US states like <a href=\"https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/celebrities/2024/07/04/6686f9c9e2704e75298b45ec.html\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/pink-cocaine-drugs-narcotics-tusi-dea-coastguard-1923902\">California</a> for many of the same reasons it blew up in Colombia: it’s relatively affordable, theoretically fun, and pink.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, Vidal said, we don’t know enough yet to tell exactly where tusi is most popular, or who exactly is using it. The biggest challenge in studying pink cocaine is that, despite its rising prevalence in pop culture, it’s hard to rigorously study a drug that’s largely defined by what it isn’t. “We do not have enough data,” Vidal said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How dangerous is it, really?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the lack of research examining pink cocaine specifically, no one knows how many people are having bad reactions to it yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Drugs like ketamine and MDMA are unlikely to cause physical dependence — people aren’t generally using these substances to relieve withdrawal symptoms, like one might if they were addicted to opiates. That doesn’t mean they can’t create a kind of psychological dependence — as Palamar said, “A lot of people become accustomed to their world on ketamine,” which can make it hard to stop using it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vidal hasn’t seen a tusi-related spike in demand for treatment at addiction treatment centers in Spain — at least not yet. More research will be necessary to see whether tusi users aren’t checking into treatment centers because they don’t have a substance use disorder, or because they’re avoiding treatment out of fear, stigma, or something else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that may change as tusi itself changes. In <a href=\"https://www.echelecabeza.com/informe-2023-servicio-de-analisis-de-sustancias-sas-echele-cabeza/\">its 2023 report</a>, Energy Control found that Colombian manufacturers were starting to add addictive substances like benzodiazepines to batches of tusi. Quintero suspects they are also adding opioids like heroin, morphine, and oxycodone “with the aim of creating dependency.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cases of pink cocaine being contaminated with fentanyl have yet to be reported in the US, but that hasn’t stopped Palamar from worrying about it. Over the past several years, potentially fatal doses of fentanyl have been found in samples of <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/alert/dea-laboratory-testing-reveals-6-out-10-fentanyl-laced-fake-prescription-pills-now-contain\">fake prescription pills</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871623012231\">methamphetamine, and cocaine</a>. Given its rising popularity, it’s reasonable to think that pink cocaine could be next.<br><br>But, at least for now, the biggest risks with pink cocaine don’t seem to be addiction or fatal overdose. Taking a mystery drug cocktail — especially if it’s mixed with alcohol on a night out — can get someone far more intoxicated than they planned for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike opioids, which can cause <a href=\"https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.15580\">severe, potentially deadly respiratory depression</a>, “pink cocaine and the things that are in it generally don’t stop people from breathing, which is good,” said <a href=\"https://www.medstarhealth.org/innovation-and-research/medstar-health-research-institute/principal-investigators/maryann-amirshahi\">Maryann Amirshahi</a>, a DC-based ER doctor and co-medical director of the <a href=\"https://www.poison.org/\">National Capital Poison Center</a>. The most risky thing, Quintero said, “is that young people making it at home don’t know chemistry, and are adding any substances or medications they find in their houses.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Imagine going to a rave for your friend’s birthday. (For the sake of this thought experiment, you’re in your mid-20s, you’ve all been drinking, and you’ve vowed to dance until the sun comes up.) While waiting in line for the bathroom, a kind stranger offers your friend a pink powder, saying it’ll be fun. She goes for it, assuming it’s an upper. Before too long, she’s throwing up and struggling to stand — and she winds up spending the rest of her birthday spaced out on a couch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If someone uses a stimulant like cocaine or MDMA (which, despite being commonly labeled as a psychedelic, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC81503/\">is an amphetamine derivative</a>), it can cause side effects ranging from mild nausea to something as potentially deadly as <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/substance-use/mdma-effects-on-heart#cardiac-symptoms\">heart failure</a>. Still, people generally remain tethered to reality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Palamar cautioned that being exposed to ketamine, a powerful drug that numbs pain and warps perception, after drinking is nothing like trying a little cocaine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s not a happy drug,” he said. “If you do enough of it, you feel like you’re on another planet.” While it doesn’t stop breathing, it does dramatically reduce one’s awareness of their surroundings, especially when mixed with alcohol — which increases the risk of doing something embarrassing, getting injured, or being sexually assaulted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, as we probably all learned in high school drug education, the best way to minimize these risks is to not do drugs. But if you’re going to use drugs, Palamar urges users to act with intention: Know what your drugs are made of, and dose with caution. All of the experts I spoke with strongly discourage people from trying unknown blends like pink cocaine, because intentional, risk-minimizing use is basically impossible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest thing to worry about with pink cocaine is accidentally taking too much ketamine. If you think you might be exposed to ketamine, don’t drink, and don’t place yourself in unfamiliar social situations without support. “You’ve got to be around people you trust,” Palamar said, “because you could become very vulnerable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One common misconception is that mixing uppers and downers, like MDMA and ketamine, will balance each other out. “The problem is, you can’t always time that,” Amirshahi said. If the downer lasts longer than the upper, “you may end up on the floor in a coma,” she said. Vice versa, and you risk experiencing an “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877453/\">emergence reaction</a>” — a psychotic break upon leaving the “k-hole,” an intense out-of-body experience brought on by high doses of ketamine. “You don’t know how much or what you’re getting, so it’s really hard to titrate, or make that balance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although according to experts, the risk of accidental fentanyl exposure appears relatively low in the US, it’s potentially deadly and worth taking seriously. You don’t have to be a professional chemist to run basic drug safety tests — harm reduction organizations like <a href=\"https://fentcheck.org/\">FentCheck</a> and <a href=\"https://dancesafe.org/\">DanceSafe</a> work with bars, nightclubs, and festivals to distribute relatively low-cost drug tests to potential users. Low-cost paper <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/stop-overdose/safety/index.html\">fentanyl test strips</a> can detect fentanyl in drug samples. They work like at-home <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/covid-19-test-basics\">Covid-19 antigen tests</a>, where you place a nasal swab on a strip of paper and wait for a line to appear if the virus is detected. For a fentanyl test, instead of a nasal swab, you’d add a few milligrams of your drug of choice. While these tests are relatively effective, they don’t work as well when MDMA is present, and can report false positives when testing an MDMA-containing drug blend like pink cocaine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://dancesafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DS_Instructions_Reagents_v17Spring24.pdf\">Liquid reagent kits</a>, like those provided by DanceSafe, contain chemicals that change colors in the presence of a range of different drugs. However, Vidal cautions that these tests also don’t work very well on tusi. Because the reagent usually provided for ketamine also reacts to MDMA, if both drugs are present (as they usually are), it’s hard to interpret the results. And as a general rule, Amirshahi recommends <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/353129/you-can-help-reverse-the-overdose-epidemic\">always having naloxone</a>, an opioid overdose-reversing nasal spray, on hand — and being prepared to administer it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Spain, Vidal said the drug is continuing to evolve — not just chemically, but aesthetically. Powders with other colors and flavorings — not just pink — made of the same general stuff are also being marketed as “tusi.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pink cocaine appears to be riding on the back of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-five-big-drug-trends-defining-summer-2024/\">ketamine’s meteoric rise</a> in popularity, mostly because it’s cheap and easy to make. But it may also be the case that pink cocaine offers both social capital and a means of escape. With this powder, anyone can project an image of enviable glamour on social media, and take an affordable trip to another planet, if only for a couple hours — at least, that’s the image cartels are projecting. In reality, it’s a bottom-of-the-barrel powder that’s not that special. It’s just pink.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That is nearly twice the rate in 1995. A recent meta-analysis led by the American Cancer Society found that <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00156-7/fulltext\">17 of the 34 most common cancers</a> — including those of the small intestine, pancreas, and kidney —&nbsp;are occurring more frequently in younger people. Some of them had previously been declining but are now on the upswing again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s the really scary part: While death rates for colorectal cancer patients over 65 are dropping, they are increasing among younger patients. <a href=\"https://bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-023-01967-0a\">Scientists say these early cancers</a> can be more deadly because they are often not caught until it’s too late for treatment. (Colonoscopies are not recommended until age 45.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a millennial prone to health anxiety, I have the same question: Why is this happening to my generation? Unfortunately, the short answer is: We do not know for certain. But let’s dig into the long answer.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What do we actually know about cancer risk factors?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve long known that <a href=\"https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.20140\">weight and exercise</a> help determine a person’s risk of developing <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/diet-and-activity.html\">a range of cancers</a>. The increase in <a href=\"https://www.worldobesityday.org/assets/downloads/World_Obesity_Atlas_2023_Report.pdf\">global obesity rates</a> since the mid-1990s has likely played a significant role in the rise in early-onset cancers, especially those in the gastrointestinal tract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/explain-it-to-me-newsletter-sign-up\">Explain It to Me newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newsletter is part of Vox’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me\">Explain It to Me</a>. Each week, we tackle a question from our audience and deliver a digestible explainer from one of our journalists. Have a question you want us to answer? Ask us <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/ask-vox\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But over the past decade, new research has shown that other factors —&nbsp;specific foods in the diet, other behaviors such as sleep, environmental pollutants —&nbsp;may also contribute to cancer risk. These risk factors are not as well understood as obesity or lack of exercise, but scientists are now racing to catch up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists have found that certain diets, including those rich in so-called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/6/11/18652653/diet-weight-loss-ultra-processed-foods-microbiome\">ultra-processed foods</a>, are <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2021-068921\">associated</a> with a higher risk of GI cancers, regardless of a person’s BMI. Higher alcohol consumption is likewise <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.22.01895\">correlated</a> with a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer early. Exposures to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6546253/\">toxins</a> in the environment and in everyday goods, including chemicals found in makeup and hair products and formaldehyde in building materials, are now also suspected to increase risk for a wide range of cancers in younger patients, particularly if the exposure occurred at pivotal points in a person’s life. Getting <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/lack-of-sleep-and-cancer-is-there-a-connection\">less sleep or interrupted sleep</a> may also be a factor in developing breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Sleep and circadian rhythm is an important component of health,” Andrew Chan, who is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/386449/2024-future-perfect-50-progress-ai-climate-animal-welfare-innovation\">leading an international research project on early-onset cancer</a>, told me. People today “are probably <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6473877/\">getting less sleep</a> or having more disrupted sleep for a variety of reasons. Is that potentially changing our biology in a way that is detrimental?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cancer researchers are also obsessed with the microbiome, the ecosystem of bacteria that is concentrated in a person’s gut. Certain kinds of <a href=\"https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-022-03492-7\">microbiome bacteria are associated with</a> the development of GI cancers, but researchers are still puzzling out whether those changes are a cause or a consequence of the disease. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is truly a global challenge. The increases in early cancer cases and deaths are most pronounced in wealthy countries, but developing nations are contending with some of the same environmental contaminants, particularly <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165993624000190#:~:text=The%20high%20production%20of%20plastic,environmental%20issues%20in%20these%20countries.\">microplastics</a>, and they are already seeing increasing death rates from other <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/obesity#the-global-distribution-of-health-impacts-from-obesity\">obesity-related diseases</a>. As poorer countries become more economically developed, they also expect to see more “first world” health problems — <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800917304913\">including cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is going to be a problem that is going to be facing us as our economy gets stronger,” Bhawna Sirohi, medical oncology director at the Balco Medical Center in Raipur, India, told me earlier this year. It’s “facing us, the West, everywhere.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why do different generations have different cancer risks?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since I started reporting on this slow-rolling crisis at the beginning of the year, easily the most interesting thing I have learned is that your risk of many types of cancer likely depends in part on something that was completely out of your control: when you were born.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you go back to the American Cancer Society’s meta-analysis, people born in 1975 experience nearly twice the rate of small-intestinal cancers as people born in 1955. For people born in 1990, those cancer rates have grown to nearly four times what they were for people born in the middle of the 20th century. You can see the same general trajectory for kidney, liver, pancreas, and bone marrow cancers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These generational differences would support the increasingly accepted idea that recent environmental changes and widespread alterations to our diets may be contributing to the rise in early-onset cancers. A 2020 study in the journal <em>Gastroenterology</em> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31394082/\">noted</a> that a person’s GI cancer risk had previously been measured by their family history, yet three in four new cancer patients have no such history. The researchers concluded that the surge could instead “result from generational differences in diet, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Systematic reviews of the available research, including one <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9218641/\">published in <em>Frontiers in Nutrition</em> in 2022</a>, have identified consumption of a lot of deep-fried foods, processed foods, foods high in fat, and sugary drinks and desserts, as well as low folate and fiber consumption, as risk factors. People have been <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34647997/\">eating more and more of those products over the years</a> — well, except for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/20/18214505/fiber-diet-weight-loss\">fiber</a>, which is very good for human digestion and yet horribly underconsumed in the US. My generation <a href=\"https://findado.osteopathic.org/gen-x-older-millennials-are-drinking-too-much#:~:text=Gen%20X%2C%20older%20millennials%20are,as%20the%20associated%20disease%20states.%E2%80%9D\">drinks too much alcohol</a> too, even while the evidence of its carcinogenic properties continues to pile up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists hypothesize that changes in our environment, such as the proliferation of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/23056251/nurdles-plastic-pollution-ocean-microplastics\">microplastics</a> and forever chemicals that are linked to <a href=\"https://www.roswellpark.org/cancertalk/202308/forever-chemicals-cancer#:~:text=How%20PFAS%20may%20lead%20to,no%20indication%20of%20an%20association.%E2%80%9D\">certain cancers</a> and may <a href=\"https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/yale-study-forever-chemicals-promote-cancer-cell-migration/#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20study%20by,time%20the%20research%20was%20conducted.\">allow others to metastasize more easily</a>, could be another contributing factor. From food containers to synthetic clothing, we are <a href=\"https://cancerwellness.com/tiny-particles-huge-problems/\">exposed to and ingest these tiny particles every day</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10340669/\">paper published last year</a> by a New Zealand research team, the upticks in cancers among young adults matched the timeline that we would expect from the multiplication of microplastics in the environment. Research on cellular and rodent models has <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36739075/\">suggested</a> that microplastics could promote tumor growth. Though more research is needed, we already know these materials <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9885170/\">contain</a> chemicals that can disrupt hormones and pose a risk to our health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the same vein, scientists increasingly suspect that exposures to risk factors at certain ages — whether in utero, early childhood, or early adulthood — could be playing an important role in a person’s risk of developing cancer at a young age. Preliminary findings, such as a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33958435/\">study</a> that found consuming more sugary drinks in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer early in women, lend support to those theories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Researchers are working to sharpen our understanding of these causes&nbsp;and of how to treat and prevent these devastating diseases. We still have a lot to learn about these new variables in our cancer risk. While it’s easy to feel powerless in the face of that uncertainty, all of the long-understood recommendations still apply and can make a world of difference in our health and disease risk: We can try to eat right, drink less alcohol, and be more active.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Tina Smith <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/aoc-tina-smith-housing.html\">in the New York Times</a> earlier this fall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Housing is too expensive, and we need to increase the housing supply,” Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://podcasts.musixmatch.com/podcast/call-her-daddy-01hng625k9w00j4a1jhxrcp26s/episode/vice-president-kamala-harris-01j9hnem30cq1y4zjz0f0twxv1\">said</a> as she campaigned for president, building off Joe Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/11/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-national-league-of-cities-congressional-city-conference-2/\">earlier call to</a> “build, build, build” to “bring housing costs down for good.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Donald Trump has complained about regulations leading to high housing costs, telling <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview-transcript/?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=qYiz2hd0\">Bloomberg</a>, “Zoning is like &#8230; it’s a killer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet as three recently published books reveal, this YIMBY-ish agreement across the political spectrum can mask deeper divides, including about property rights, community development, and the very meaning of democracy in housing policy. <a href=\"https://www.housingtrap.org/\"><em>Escaping the Housing Trap</em></a> by urbanists Charles Marohn and Daniel Herriges of <a href=\"https://www.strongtowns.org/\">Strong Towns</a> advocates for a slower-paced, locally driven form of development that they believe will be more sustainable over the long term. <a href=\"https://www.strandbooks.com/on-the-housing-crisis-land-development-democracy-atlantic-editions-9781638931966.html\"><em>On the Housing Crisis</em></a> by journalist Jerusalem Demsas challenges this kind of incrementalism, arguing the severity of today&#8217;s housing shortage demands bolder intervention. And in <a href=\"https://nowheretolive.org/\"><em>Nowhere to Live</em></a>, James Burling, a lawyer with the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation, frames the housing shortage as the result of diminished respect for private property, something he argues will have to be reversed for any real change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read together, these new books tell us that while it has become mainstream to say that America needs more homes —&nbsp;and even to acknowledge that zoning rules and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22597947/homeowner-nimby-affordable-housing-local\">self-interested homeowners</a> play a role in blocking new housing —&nbsp;there’s not a clear consensus about what kinds of homes we should build, how we should build them, and who should decide where they go. While it’s tempting to think a pro-housing consensus at least forecasts positive changes, the authors say a close read of history should leave us unconvinced that policymakers will ultimately take the necessary steps for reform. There’s an opportunity, but we should be clear-eyed about the obstacles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who should chart the future of housing policy?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For decades, the federal government largely deferred to state governments on matters of land use. States mostly deferred to local governments, which in turn typically deferred to their home-owning constituents who backed restrictive zoning laws that barred new construction. But with housing now consuming a greater portion of households&#8217; budgets, even federal lawmakers can no longer avoid addressing the dramatic rise in rents and mortgage payments. Unlike past housing crises that primarily affected the poor, today&#8217;s challenges reach deep into the middle class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts say the US is short somewhere between <a href=\"https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20210507-housing-supply\">3.8</a> million and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/make-it-count-measuring-our-housing-supply-shortage/\">6.8 million</a><strong> </strong>homes. As of 2022, households earning the median income could afford only <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/eighty-percent-homes-market-arent-affordable-households-earning-median-incomes-or-less\">20 percent</a> of the homes for sale across the country. Most renters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/12/renters-poll-owning-home\">feel priced out</a> of homeownership entirely, and the lack of affordable housing is causing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/3/8/23618237/homelessness-tent-encampments-housing-affordable\">homelessness to rise</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as policymakers and voters focus more intently on the housing emergency, thorny questions about democratic participation have emerged. Research increasingly shows that <a href=\"https://sites.bu.edu/kleinstein/files/2017/09/EinsteinPalmerGlick_ZoningPartic.pdf\">local planning meetings are deeply unrepresentative</a>, with participants skewing older, whiter, more likely to be a homeowner — and therefore more likely to support measures that prioritize their property values and the status quo. Even making meetings virtual, which should theoretically increase access, <a href=\"https://www.housingpolitics.com/research/online_meetings_participation.pdf\">hasn’t solved this participation gap</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet the problem runs deeper than just representation. When polled, voters often express the <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@rmc031/post/C7UJ0AFsPj-\">most enthusiastic support</a> for indirect interventions like government subsidies and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/housing/365063/kamala-harris-housing-rent-control-landlords\">rent caps</a>, policies that housing experts say would do little alone to address affordability and could even make things worse long term. Meanwhile, voters frequently oppose the fundamental solution — building more housing — even though restricting new development is what perpetuates the shortage. This raises a fundamental question: How much should democratic preferences matter?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is a central concern in Demsas’s book, and explored to a lesser degree in the two others. In one of her most agitating chapters — “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/\">Community Input Is Bad, Actually</a>” — Demsas makes the case that democracy works best when the views or needs of people are accurately transmitted to their leaders, leaders take action, and voters can express their approval or disapproval in the next election. Invoking historian Paul Sabin, she argues this form of <a href=\"https://www.paulsabin.com/books/\">democratic accountability was upended in the 1960s and ’70s</a> by a new emphasis on citizen participation, including new public interest law firms that challenged rules and laws while expanding judicial influence over policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Pacific Legal Foundation emerged from this 1970s institutional ferment. While Burling, a staunch defender of property rights, shares Demsas’s concerns about regulatory barriers to new housing, his book makes a passionate case for litigation as a crucial check on government power, particularly through a compelling chapter on how litigation has buffered eminent domain abuse. Without it, he writes, &#8220;entire neighborhoods of &#8216;undesirables&#8217; — the poor, the ethnic minorities, and those least able to mount meaningful political resistance — can be condemned in order to revitalize their neighborhoods.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Public interest litigation and community input rules emerged to protect neighborhoods from destructive top-down planning like the urban renewal that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8605917/highways-interstate-cities-history\">devastated Black neighborhoods in the 1960s</a>. But this democratic vision has evolved into a more routine participatory veto, where multiple choke points, from environmental impact reviews to historic preservation requirements, allow individuals to block housing projects or make them so financially unfeasible that developers withdraw their bids.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today&#8217;s YIMBYs are organizing within this existing system, forming local groups to mobilize pro-housing voices at planning meetings and provide political cover for elected officials to make risky decisions. But this strategy of trying to counter the NIMBYs in public life faces inherent scaling limitations. It’s possible to pack local meetings in major cities with dissenting voices, but it’s much harder to sustain that level of organizing across thousands of small- and medium-sized jurisdictions, especially given the housing crisis&#8217; mounting urgency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s why many pro-housing advocates have turned to state-level intervention — essentially arguing that sometimes real democracy requires overriding local democratic processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Governors and other statewide officials are forced to see the bigger picture because they’re accountable not only to the people who live in a particular community, but also to past residents priced out of and displaced from that community, and to future residents as well,” Demsas writes. It&#8217;s a paradox that echoes earlier civil rights battles: using higher levels of government to ensure broader participation and protect minority interests, even when that means overruling local control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Escaping the Housing Trap </em>offers an alternative vision: promoting smaller-scale, community-led development. Strong Towns advocates for all cities to accept some level of change while taking “radical neighborhood transformation off the table.” This “grand bargain,” as they put it — where single-family homes can transform at least into duplexes — aims to turn NIMBYs skeptical of development into more self-interested partners. Strong Towns also argues this approach will lead to more sustainable fiscal growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s hard to ignore that this more patient, conflict-avoidant strategy runs up against the pressing need of the housing shortage in big, desirable cities like Seattle or Los Angeles. It also misses that even in lots of local communities, residents have ardently fought even modest developments like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/371561/affordable-housing-crisis-economy-hud-california\">accessory dwelling units</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite their divergent paths to housing reform, all three authors agree on who loses most from the country’s failure to build: renters, first-time homebuyers, and poor people. Perhaps most importantly, it&#8217;s everyone who doesn&#8217;t yet live in a community but who might benefit from its resources — the future residents who never get a say in today&#8217;s planning meetings.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are we moving forward?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After years of inaction, there are reasons to be optimistic that lawmakers might finally be ready to tackle the housing supply gap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last five years, states across the political spectrum — from <a href=\"https://www.springfield-or.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DevelopmentCodeUpdateProject_Fact-2_commeng_final.pdf\">Oregon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/10/11/governor-newsom-signs-package-to-streamline-housing-and-expand-tenant-protections-in-california/\">California</a> to <a href=\"https://www.governing.com/community/floridas-republican-led-nearly-unanimous-housing-reforms\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/montana-s-yimby-revolt-aims-to-head-off-a-housing-crisis\">Montana</a> — have moved to update zoning codes and transform residential planning rules. This year alone, <a href=\"https://ggwash.org/view/93210/breakfast-links-maryland-governor-moores-housing-bills-all-pass-senate\">Maryland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2024-08-15/4-new-arizona-housing-bills-were-just-signed-into-law-leaders-hope-theyll-help-rising-costs\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2024/03/20/nj-affordable-housing-overhaul-phil-murphy-new-bill/73038189007/\">New Jersey</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/blog/coloradans-big-legislative-wins-affordable-housing-and-housing-stability\">Colorado</a> passed new housing laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Housing was a top issue during the presidential campaign, and high costs remain a pressing concern for voters. Even those against new development know they have to couch their opposition in vague YIMBY language these days, acknowledging that yes of course we need more housing but we must guard against displacement, corporate developer influence, and environmental harm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, we&#8217;ve seen promising moments before. As Burling notes, a 1991 federal <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/RBCPUBS/NotInMyBackyward.html\">report</a> warned that “increasingly expensive and time-consuming permit-approval process[es], exclusionary zoning, and well-intentioned laws” were pricing out young families. More striking still, that same report acknowledged that in the previous 25 years, &#8220;no more than 10 federally sponsored commissions&#8221; had examined these exact issues, &#8220;usually to little avail.&#8221; The YIMBY battles of 2024 echo debates we&#8217;ve been having for generations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I asked the authors if they believe this time will finally be different or whether we&#8217;re on the verge of seeing yet another generation succumb to the status quo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Demsas warns that some YIMBYs have taken &#8220;premature victory laps.&#8221; While mainstream figures like Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.governing.com/urban/the-real-breakout-star-of-the-dnc-was-yimby\">now vocally acknowledge</a> the importance of increasing housing supply, she argues the implications of this position remain less examined. &#8220;When this comes into tension with historic preservation or public meeting participation norms &#8230; then what?&#8221; She points to Harris&#8217;s housing proposals, which avoided the thorny details of zoning reform in favor of more populist ideas targeting corporate landlords.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Burling finds hope in the crisis&#8217;s unavoidable visibility. &#8220;The manifestation of the problem is much more clear than it used to be with the vast number of homeless encampments,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;We reached and went over a tipping point &#8230; the predictions that this crisis is going to get worse unfortunately have come true.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Marohn of Strong Towns also sees potential for change, though he believes it will have to be locally led given constraints in our national financial system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Marohn argues that today&#8217;s housing crisis stems from a post-WWII experiment in urban development. Determined to avoid another Depression, policymakers created an approach centered on rapid expansion, incentivizing cities to pursue growth that ultimately depleted tax bases and created unsustainable liabilities. Now, he warns, cities are discovering that all this infrastructure is too costly to maintain with current tax revenue. Yet he sees cities as uniquely positioned to lead on reform: Unlike traditional bank lenders constrained by the 30-year mortgage, cities can access low-interest capital to support the smaller-scale projects he sees as essential for lasting change.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Housing reform’s next chapter</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The political path forward is murky. Early in Trump&#8217;s first term, his administration showed YIMBY tendencies, establishing <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-white-house-council-eliminating-regulatory-barriers-affordable-housing/\">a White House Council</a> to tackle local zoning restrictions. But by 2020, Trump’s rhetoric shifted dramatically toward NIMBYism, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/16/politics/donald-trump-white-suburbs/index.html\">warning voters</a> that Democrats would &#8220;totally destroy the beautiful suburbs.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Heritage Foundation&#8217;s Project 2025 blueprint reflects these tensions by advocating deregulation while also emphasizing local control and prioritizing single-family homes, exactly the kind of housing that puts ownership out of reach for many Americans. Trump has publicly disavowed Project 2025, but he’s already tapped some of its key authors and supporters to join his new administration. Trump’s selection <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/housing-secretary-trump-scott-turner-nfl-727417b56d0e1f85a40eaf5f7d13d42f\">of a former NFL player</a> with no clear housing record to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development adds another layer of uncertainty to how his administration will ultimately govern.&nbsp;<br><br>Yet the pressure for reform continues to grow. The <a href=\"https://scottpeters.house.gov/2024/11/reps-peters-garcia-and-others-launch-bipartisan-congressional-yimby-caucus\">recent launch of a bipartisan YIMBY caucus</a> in Congress signals housing&#8217;s staying power as a national priority. The fact that even&nbsp;critics of market-rate development now frame their arguments in <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/170480/building-wont-make-housing-affordable-gentrification-book-review\">more supply-friendly terms</a> suggests a genuine shift in how we talk about housing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as these three books reveal, consensus about the problem doesn&#8217;t ensure agreement on solutions. The philosophical divides they explore will shape housing policy for years to come. What&#8217;s different now isn&#8217;t the substance of these debates, but their urgency. The expanding ranks of Americans priced out of stable housing have transformed the crisis from an abstract policy concern to an unavoidable, immediate challenge.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Y no se trata solo de las variedades comunes como mirlos o azulejos, sino de especies raras que los avistadores de aves de todo el mundo anhelan contemplar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Londoño, de 63 años, ha convertido su hogar en una finca para el avistamiento de aves, un verdadero paraíso. Cuenta con cinco habitaciones para huéspedes y una cafetería con vista al jardín, un denso bosque tropical. En su jardín, ha instalado un comedero artesanal con estantes de madera donde pone trozos de fruta. Arriba, en el techo, hay más comederos destinados a los colibríes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cuando la visité una cálida mañana de octubre, sentí como si me estuviera adentrando en un documental de naturaleza. El jardín trasero estaba rebosante de aves, ninguna de las cuales había visto antes: tángaras montanas de un verde reluciente, tucanes barbudos, colibríes sietecolores, sueldas cejiamarillas. Las aves eran tan coloridas que casi parecían irreales, pintando el jardín con trazos de ocres, rojos, azules y morados. Y luego, el ruido: un clamor de trinos, silbidos y graznidos.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_01.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A hummingbird with vibrant blue, purple and green feathers\" title=\"A hummingbird with vibrant blue, purple and green feathers\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Un colibrí sietecolores descansa sobre una rama en la finca de avistamiento de aves de Doña Dora.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“El tucán barbudo es uno de los pájaros más raros del mundo y se alimenta de bananos justo aquí,” dijo<a href=\"https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=nocampop\"> Natalia Ocampo-Peñuela</a>, una investigadora colombiana, ecóloga de la conservación y especialista en aves de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz, quien estaba conmigo esa mañana en la finca. En una hora, Ocampo-Peñuela estima que vió unas 45 especies diferentes mientras tomábamos café y comíamos empanadas con calma. Si así es la observación de aves, ¡cuenten conmigo!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Si te gustan los pájaros, Colombia es el lugar indicado. El país tiene la mayor cantidad y variedad de aves en el mundo. Son cerca de <a href=\"https://ccro.asociacioncolombianadeornitologia.org/\">2.000</a> especies, lo que representa casi el 20% de las aves del planeta. Esta diversidad está profundamente arraigada en la geografía. Colombia es un mosaico de hábitats que van desde la selva tropical hasta montañas cubiertas de nieve, cada especie de ave se ha adaptado a un entorno específico. Y como experimenté esa mañana, la observación de aves aquí puede ser increíblemente fácil. Ni siquiera necesitas zapatos para hacer senderismo.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"La actividad de observación de aves se ha disparado en Colombia\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rvUJm/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"562\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Esto no es un secreto. En la última década el avistamiento de aves en Colombia ha visto un auge, según Ocampo-Peñuela, quien también estudia ecoturismo. La actividad en <a href=\"https://ebird.org/home\">eBird,</a> una plataforma donde los observadores de aves pueden registrar sus avistamientos, ha aumentado más de 27 veces en Colombia desde 2010, según una investigación inédita de Ocampo-Peñuela y otros autores la cual actualmente está en revisión. Aunque la mayoría de estos observadores de aves son extranjeros, provenientes de lugares como Estados Unidos y Canadá, cada vez son más los colombianos que se están sumando a este hobby, comentó.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_Lede.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.3235716461211,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"El tucancito culirrojo.\" title=\"El tucancito culirrojo.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"El tucancito culirrojo.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_03.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A dark brown bird with light blue beak and yellow tail feathers stands on a brand while eating a banana\" title=\"A dark brown bird with light blue beak and yellow tail feathers stands on a brand while eating a banana\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Las frutas tropicales son como imanes para una variedad de especies, como ésta oropéndola cabecinegra.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Muchos expertos argumentan que ésta industria en auge es una fuerza positiva poco común. Está canalizando dinero hacia comunidades rurales y generando valor material para los bosques conservados, algo por lo que el movimiento ambientalista ha luchado durante décadas. De hecho, mientras que los bosques tropicales y los pastizales están siendo asediados por la agricultura, la minería y otras amenazas, el ecoturismo de avistamiento de aves ofrece un verdadero incentivo para mantener intactos los ecosistemas. Sin bosques no hay aves, no hay observadores de aves, y no hay aviturismo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No cabe duda de que existen algunas preocupaciones sobre la sostenibilidad a medida que el aviturismo crece y más turistas extranjeros llegan a Colombia. Pero por ahora, son las comunidades locales las que están al mando de esta industria, lo cual trae beneficios para la gente, la economía local y la vida silvestre. Ellos esperan que se mantenga de tal forma.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-none\"><strong>Londoño, conocida como Doña Dora, no soñaba con gestionar una finca para el avistamiento de aves ni recibir turistas en su jardín.</strong> En los años noventa se mudó a esta zona, en las afueras de Cali, para escapar de la violencia cerca de su hogar en los Llanos tropicales. Esta historia no es poco común. El conflicto de varias décadas entre grupos armados y el gobierno nacional ha desplazado a <a href=\"https://story.internal-displacement.org/colombia-urban/index.html\">más de 5 millones</a> de personas en todo el país.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_04.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"A woman sitting on a small brick wall with a green and purple painted bird mural behind her.

Ella limpiaba casas y vendía empanadas al costado de la carretera. Su esposo tenía trabajos ocasionales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Un día fue al dentista y su vida cambió.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Su dentista, un hombre llamado Gilberto Collazos Bolaños, era un fanático de las aves, y sabía que el bosque alrededor de su hogar estaba lleno de vida aviar. Así que le dio un consejo: pon un poco de fruta en una mesa afuera, y espera. La fruta atraerá a los pájaros, Doña Dora recuerda, los pájaros atraerán a los turistas, y los turistas traerán dinero.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ella siguió su consejo. Y llegaron los pájaros. Primero fueron mirlos azules, tángaras doradas y coloridos jilgueros llamados eufonías. Luego llegaron especies más raras, como tángaras de garganta rojiza y tucanes barbudos. Los tucanes barbudos son las estrellas indiscutibles del espectáculo. Hallados solo en los bosques montañosos del oeste de Colombia y Ecuador, tienen un plumaje brillante — una mezcla de gris claro, rojo, amarillo y negro — y un <a href=\"https://ebird.org/species/toubar1/L4375590\">canto que suena un poco como el croar de una rana.&nbsp;</a>Como predijo el dentista, los observadores de aves eventualmente llegaron también, en su mayoría de boca en boca. Y en 2015 Colombia albergó su primera BirdFair anual, un importante festival de avistamiento de aves. Una de las <a href=\"https://colombiabirdfair.com/salidas-de-pajareo/\">excursiones oficiales</a> del evento fue una visita a la casa de Doña Dora. Eso la puso en el mapa, me contó.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_05.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\" Un cabezón tucán, una de las especies de aves más raras del mundo, suele frecuentar el jardín trasero de Doña Dora.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/JuanitaEscobar_22_c528f7.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Doña Dora posa junto a un mural pintado por su hijo Elber Sánchez Londoño.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Siempre hemos amado&nbsp;la naturaleza y los árboles,” dijo Doña Dora quien llevaba un pañuelo en la cabeza y vestía algo parecido a una bata blanca de laboratorio. “Pero no teníamos una visión de lo que tenemos ahora, del avistamiento de aves.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hoy en día su casa es considerada uno de los destinos más importantes para el aviturismo en el país, y algunos visitantes la han denominado \"el mejor jardín trasero&nbsp; para el avistamiento de aves en el mundo.\" Es este negocio el que ahora sostiene a su familia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Los turistas extranjeros pagan alrededor de $9 (USD) para ver aves en su propiedad ($13 si traen cámara). Una habitación para dos personas cuesta unos $50 por noche, pero no incluye el café ni las empanadas caseras. En temporada alta, de septiembre a marzo, la finca recibe más de 100 turistas al mes, según su hijo Elber Sánchez Londoño, quien ayuda a gestionar el negocio.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_09_0c545a.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Una tángara nuquidorada visita el comedero en casa de Doña Dora para probar un trozo de banana.\" title=\"Una tángara nuquidorada visita el comedero en casa de Doña Dora para probar un trozo de banana.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Una tángara nuquidorada visita el comedero en casa de Doña Dora para probar un trozo de banana.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Esa mañana en su jardín avisté aves. Pero también observé a los avistadores de aves avistar aves. Honestamente, encontré esta actividad tan fascinante como la propia observación.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_07.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"two people in a forest looking through binoculars toward the sky\" title=\"two people in a forest looking through binoculars toward the sky\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Natalia Ocampo-Peñuela y José Luna Solarte, un guía local de avistamiento de aves, buscan aves en un bosque a unas dos horas al norte de Cali.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">¿Qué es lo que hace que algunas personas se obsesionen tanto con las aves? Una explicación es que se las puede encontrar casi en cualquier parte. Eso hace que el avistamiento sea fácil de practicar, sin importar dónde vivas. La observación de aves también puede conectarte con una comunidad. Tiende a reunir a personas con intereses similares, tanto en persona como a través de plataformas como eBird e iNaturalist, donde se pueden compartir los avistamientos. Además, es gratuita y se realiza al aire libre, una de las razones por las que ganó popularidad durante la pandemia de Covid-19, cuando la gente evitaba los espacios cerrados y concurridos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Es como una adicción,” me dijo Ocampo-Peñuela, quien se identifica como observadora de aves. “Ves estas aves, su belleza, y te llena de hormonas de felicidad. Luego quieres hacerlo más.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Esa mañana conocí a varios turistas en la finca de Doña Dora. La mayoría llevaban cámaras con lentes largos. “Esto es increíble,” dijo Santiago Ferro, un visitante de Toronto quien creció en Bogotá. Le pregunté cómo comparaba este lugar con el avistamiento de aves en América del Norte y él solo se rió.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-none\"><strong>Los observadores de aves se sienten atraídos por la cantidad de especies que tiene Colombia, muchas de las cuales no se encuentran en ningún otro lugar.</strong> Sin embargo, el auge del aviturismo tiene mucho más que ver con la seguridad en el país.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hasta hace poco, el conflicto entre el gobierno y varios grupos armados sembraba violencia en toda Colombia. Al centro de este conflicto que comenzó a mediados del siglo XX estaba la distribución de la riqueza. El grupo más grande, las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), luchaba contra el gobierno y los grupos paramilitares de derecha para llevar más recursos a las zonas rurales empobrecidas de Colombia. La violencia dejó más de <a href=\"https://conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13031-023-00561-6\">200.000 muertos,</a> la mayoría civiles.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_08.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"Varios comederos para colibríes cuelgan de las vigas de un restaurante al noroeste de Cali.

Aquí, un colibrí rumbito pechiblanco se acerca a tomar un sorbo de agua azucarada.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">En 2016, después de años de negociaciones tensas, el gobierno y las FARC firmaron un acuerdo de paz. En términos sencillos, el acuerdo requería que las FARC entregaran sus armas, dejaran de luchar y abandonaran el narcotráfico que ayudaba a financiar el conflicto. A cambio, se les ofreció poder político y una promesa de grandes inversiones en las zonas rurales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A pesar de que la violencia persiste en algunas regiones, especialmente cerca de las fronteras, y de que el Departamento de Estado de EE. UU. <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Colombia.html\">recomienda</a> reconsiderar los viajes a Colombia, se mantiene una frágil tregua. El acuerdo de paz ha hecho que el país sea mucho más seguro, tanto para los locales como para los extranjeros. Y esto a su vez ha abierto la puerta al crecimiento del turismo para el avistamiento de aves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">En 2017, Ocampo-Peñuela publicó un estudio que mostraba que el avistamiento de aves, el cual se mide a través de la actividad en eBird, ya estaba en expansión en áreas que antes se consideraban peligrosas, como Putumayo, un departamento al sur de Colombia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Investigaciones más recientes que aún no se publican de Ocampo-Peñuela, han descubierto que esta actividad se disparó en Colombia después de 2016 a pesar de sufrir una caída durante la pandemia. (Una gran parte de los usuarios de eBird provienen de EE. UU., por lo que los datos de la plataforma tienden a reflejar las tendencias de avistamiento en América del Norte).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"El acuerdo de paz de 2016 impulsó el aviturismo en Colombia. \" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HHs1O/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"546\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">El gobierno colombiano no realiza un seguimiento del avistamiento, aunque señala que el turismo en general está en aumento. El año pasado, un récord de 6,1 millones de extranjeros visitaron Colombia, un aumento del 30% en comparación con 2022. La mayoría de ellos buscaban experiencias en la naturaleza, según ProColombia, una agencia gubernamental que promueve al país. El turismo también ha aumentado este año en comparación con 2023, según la misma agencia. Y desde 2021, el número de alojamientos ecológicos, incluyendo los destinados al avistamiento de aves, casi ha triplicado, informó la agencia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">En lugares clave por su biodiversidad, como Colombia, el crecimiento económico a menudo viene a expensas de los ecosistemas. La creciente industria ganadera<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/10/19/23403330/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-cattle-laundering\"> destruye los bosques tropicales</a>. Un auge en la minería filtra toxinas en los ríos y en el suelo. En comparación, la creciente industria del aviturismo parece algo digno de celebración.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_10.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.366492146597,100,39.267015706806\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Jhonathan Estiven Bedoya Betancourth, uno de los guías de avistamiento de aves, o “intérpretes,” en la Laguna de Sonso.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">El turismo no solo está financiando destinos de avistamiento de aves como el de Doña Dora, sino que está generando demanda de guías locales. Esto ha creado empleos para los colombianos que tienen un conocimiento profundo de sus ecosistemas circundantes, independientemente de su educación formal. El conocimiento generacional de las aves locales y de dónde encontrarlas — conocido en algunos círculos académicos como conocimiento ecológico tradicional — es cada vez más valioso aquí, incluso en un sentido estrictamente económico. El ecoturismo de avistamiento de aves le da valor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A la mañana siguiente, viajé a un lugar llamado Laguna de Sonso, un humedal al norte de Cali. Es un pequeño hábitat natural en medio de un mar de plantaciones de caña de azúcar, un cultivo muy extendido en el Valle del Cauca. Cuando llegué, una garza cocoi, una gran ave gris y blanca con un pico largo y afilado, estaba hurgando en el agua y generando ondas en el lago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">El humedal es un sueño para los observadores de aves. Más de 300 especies de aves viven o pasan por la Laguna de Sonso, incluidos gigantes como el águila pescadora y aves peculiares como el bienparado común, un ave con una inquietante boca ancha.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Es también el lugar donde jóvenes de las comunidades cercanas aprenden a convertirse en guías o intérpretes, como se llaman a sí mismos. “Nosotros nos llamamos intérpretes porque somos una comunidad que ha tenido una formación empírica,” dijo el guía local Jhonathan Estiven Bedoya Betancourth, lo que significa que han aprendido a través de la observación y la experiencia. “No tenemos, digamos, la formación de un guía turístico profesional.” (Un par de organizaciones comunitarias en Laguna de Sonso ofrecen talleres y mentoría para la formación de guías de aves.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bedoya, de 24 años, dice que ha guiado tours para el avistamiento de aves desde sus 14 años. “Interpretamos todo lo que tiene este hermoso territorio,” dijo Bedoya, quien llevaba un par de binoculares colgados del cuello.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_11.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"A woman with bright red hair sits on a fallen tree within a forest next to water\" title=\"A woman with bright red hair sits on a fallen tree within a forest next to water\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Daniela Gómez, otra guía de observación de aves, se sienta junto a un pequeño lago en la Laguna de Sonso.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_21.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Una garza cocoi se posa sobre un tronco sobresaliente de la Laguna de Sonso.\" title=\"Una garza cocoi se posa sobre un tronco sobresaliente de la Laguna de Sonso.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Una garza cocoi se posa sobre un tronco sobresaliente de la Laguna de Sonso.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bedoya Betancourth comenzó a guiar porque ama las aves y es bueno para ello. Dijo que puede imitar los cantos de alrededor de 30 especies. (Obviamente, le pedí que lo demostrara e impresionantemente imitó el canto repetitivo de un ave acuática llamada cotara chiricote). Pero también fue una forma de ayudar a su familia, agregó. Gana alrededor de $35 (USD) por cada tour, sin incluir la propina, y realiza varios tours al mes. Complementa sus ingresos fabricando tallados en madera para vender a turistas y locales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Para mí, y para el grupo de intérpretes, el avistamiento de aves es una de las actividades económicas que ha logrado mantener a la comunidad a flote,” dijo María Omaira Rendón Rayo, líder comunitaria en Laguna de Sonso.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">La economía de las aves da a las personas una razón para quedarse en la comunidad, dijo, y ofrece una alternativa a oficios que podrían atraer la violencia, como el cultivo y venta de drogas. Al capacitar a los jóvenes, la laguna y sus organizaciones comunitarias también están ayudando a construir una ética de conservación que perdurará por décadas.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_13.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"María Omaira Rendón Rayo, líder de la comunidad alrededor de la Laguna de Sonso, dice que el aviturismo ha ayudado a conservar el humedal y a apoyar a las familias de la región.\" title=\"María Omaira Rendón Rayo, líder de la comunidad alrededor de la Laguna de Sonso, dice que el aviturismo ha ayudado a conservar el humedal y a apoyar a las familias de la región.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"María Omaira Rendón Rayo, líder de la comunidad alrededor de la Laguna de Sonso, dice que el aviturismo ha ayudado a conservar el humedal y a apoyar a las familias de la región.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Si estás recibiendo ingresos económicos de una actividad como la conservación, entonces deseas conservar más,” dijo Rendón Rayo, quien trabaja con una organización local llamada Asociación de Productores Agropecuarios del Porvenir, la cual ayuda a regenerar bosques mediante la plantación de árboles y capacita a guías para el avistamiento de aves en la Laguna de Sonso. “Quieres ayudar a plantar más árboles. Quieres ayudar a mantener limpia la laguna.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-none\"><strong>El turismo de naturaleza no es una fuerza inequívocamente positiva.</strong> De hecho, con frecuencia causa daño al medio ambiente, como<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320724003549?\"> lo han documentado </a>investigadores como Ralf Buckley. Los turistas han descuidadamente introducido <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/galapagos-species-are-threatened-by-the-very-tourists-who-flock-to-see-them-86392\">especies invasoras </a>en lugares como las Islas Galápagos; los buceadores y quienes esnorquelean han dañado los arrecifes de coral, incluso la<a href=\"https://www.rrrc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Technical-Report-46.pdf\"> Gran Barrera de Coral</a>, y los hoteles a menudo se construyen sobre hábitats naturales.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Existe también un problema de explotación, ya que en muchos casos las empresas turísticas son de propiedad extranjera y restringen los beneficios que podrían llegar a las comunidades locales que dependen en gran parte de estas actividades. Cuando un destino se ve invadido por turistas adinerados, los precios de necesidades básicas como <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738321001420\">la vivienda</a> y la alimentación tienden a aumentar, volviéndose insostenible para los locales.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_14.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Un toche enjalmado reposa sobre una rama en La Florida, un sitio de observación de aves cerca de Cali.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_15.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Gran parte de las áreas rurales colombianas están cubiertas por tierras de cultivo.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hasta ahora el turismo de avistamiento de aves en Colombia ha logrado evitar muchos de los riesgos asociados con la explotación desmedida de los recursos naturales. Según Ocampo-Peñuela, este tipo de turismo tiene ciertos \"límites.\" Por ejemplo, la observación de aves no funciona bien con grupos grandes, ya que asustan a las aves y dificultan la tarea de avistar ejemplares lejanos. Los grupos pequeños, en cambio, tienen un menor impacto ambiental. Uno de los alojamientos que visité limita el número de turistas a 10. Otro aseguró que, en ocasiones, incluso rechazan visitantes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Además, encontrar especies raras y endémicas, las que más atraen a los observadores de aves, suele requerir el conocimiento local. Este factor contribuye a que los beneficios económicos se queden dentro de las comunidades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sin embargo, el principal \"límite\" es que el turismo de observación de aves no funciona si no es sostenible. Incluso si se colocan frutas, las aves no llegarán si no tienen hábitats con bosques o humedales. La observación de aves no es como ir al zoológico, donde siempre se pueden ver animales. Es un interés económico para la industria del turismo ornitológico asegurar que los ecosistemas permanezcan saludables.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Uno no puede hacer este negocio sin conservar,” señala Javier Rubio, quien dirige otro destino de avistamiento de aves en su propiedad llamada La Florida, al noroeste de Cali. “Si no conservas, pones en riesgo tu futuro como negocio. Si empiezas a talar árboles y dañar el bosque, [las aves] se quedarán sin comida, que es la razón por la que están aquí.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Doña Dora comenta que uno de sus objetivos es ganar suficiente dinero para que su hijo Elber pueda comprar terrenos forestales alrededor de su casa. Él quiere conservarlos, me dijo. “Esa es la idea a futuro, si el presupuesto nos lo permite,” confirmó Elber, “asegurarnos de que las aves sigan en un buen ecosistema.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_16.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Michael Medina, un joven guía de avistamiento de aves en la Laguna de Sonso, dice que puede ganar hasta $70 en un buen día guiando tours de observación de aves.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_17.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Un carpintero bellotero es observado en La Florida.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">La industria aún es joven, por lo que todo su impacto ambiental aún no se ha determinado. Las personas dedicadas al crecimiento del aviturismo afirman que es fundamental que los colombianos, especialmente aquellos en las zonas rurales y ricas en biodiversidad, definan cómo debe ser el futuro de esta industria. “Es necesario y oportuno que los colombianos definamos qué tipo de aviturismo queremos”, señaló Carlos Mario Wagner, fundador y director de Colombia BirdFair y uno de los ornitólogos más conocidos del país.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">El avistamiento de aves no debería enfocarse solo en los extranjeros, dijo, sino también en los locales. “Algo que me alegra muchísimo es que los colombianos están contratando guías”, me contó Wagner. Según él, el avistamiento de aves ha brindado a los colombianos la oportunidad de reconectarse con su tierra tras el acuerdo de paz. Les inculca un sentido de orgullo por una versión de Colombia conocida por su naturaleza, no por la violencia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">La industria del avistamiento de aves, aunque está creciendo, nunca será gigantesca, según Ocampo-Peñuela. Está en expansión a nivel global — creciendo más rápido que otras formas de ecoturismo, según ha descubierto — pero probablemente se mantendrá en una escala de nicho, limitada por el pequeño número de personas dispuestas a viajar a lugares rurales para observar aves, a menudo muy temprano por la mañana. “Tienes que tener la personalidad adecuada,” me dijo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Por lo tanto, no es que el avistamiento de aves por sí solo vaya a resolver los problemas de Colombia y sacar a la clase rural de la pobreza.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A pesar de ello, lo que ofrece es algo increíblemente especial: No solo dinero para las comunidades locales, profesiones alternativas, e incentivos reales para salvar los bosques, sino también algo que es más difícil de cuantificar.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_20.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"A man holding binoculars stands on a wooden platform with greenery surrounding\" title=\"A man holding binoculars stands on a wooden platform with greenery surrounding\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Javier Rubio, un ex abogado penanalista, convirtió su propiedad cerca de Cali, conocida como La Florida, en un destino de observación de aves.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_19.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Vista de La Florida.\" title=\"Vista de La Florida.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Vista de La Florida.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">En una tarde lluviosa de octubre visité a Rubio en La Florida. Al igual que Doña Dora, Rubio tiene un comedero casero para aves en su jardín construido con ramas. Atrae a una variedad diferente de visitantes alados. Aquí, la estrella era la tángara multicolor, una especie colorida que solo se encuentra en los bosques montañosos de Colombia. Mi favorito, sin embargo, fue el tucancito culirrojo, esencialmente un mini tucán. Es de un verde brillante con un pico de color óxido que parece demasiado grande para su cuerpo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mientras tomaba mi cuarta taza de café negro, Rubio me contó que fue abogado penalista durante casi tres décadas antes de incursionar en el negocio del aviturismo. Hace unos años invitó a unos amigos a su casa para hacer avistamiento de aves. Vieron el tángara multicolor y le dijeron que su propiedad — que colinda con un bosque tropical — tenía un enorme potencial para convertirse en un destino para dicha actividad.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Deseoso de llevar una vida más relajada, Rubio, de 56 años, dejó su trabajo como abogado y comenzó a construir un negocio turístico.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Me siento supremamente bien haciendo esto,\" admitió Rubio. “Muchas veces me siento como dándole felicidad a la gente. Casi unánimemente, las personas que vienen dicen: ‘Esto es un paraíso. Se siente tranquilidad.’ Cuando empiezas a salir, a pajarear, empiezas a sentir atracción no solamente por las aves, sino por el ambiente tranquilo de la naturaleza.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/JuanitaEscobar_18.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Una tángara multicolor visita La Florida para comer algo de fruta.\" title=\"Una tángara multicolor visita La Florida para comer algo de fruta.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Una tángara multicolor visita La Florida para comer algo de fruta.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Este es un punto que casi todos los observadores de aves con los que hablé señalaron: el hecho de preocuparse por las aves es una puerta de entrada para preocuparse por la naturaleza, para ver su verdadero valor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Es un proceso gradual,” me dijo Rubio mientras nos sentábamos en una terraza cubierta mientras llovía, observando a una tángara multicolor dando saltitos entre las ramas a pocos metros de nosotros. “Primero las contemplas, luego empiezas a comprenderlas, y luego comienzas a conservar. Ese es el camino que recorre el que adquiere este hábito de avistar aves\".</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

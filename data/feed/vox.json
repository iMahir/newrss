The interview on Spaces, X’s platform for live audio conversations, covered everything from illegal immigration to union busting. At one point, Trump and Musk underscored the need for an American leader who would inspire fear in other countries. Over the course of two hours, the richest man in the world and the former president of the United States reminded us that they share some striking similarities — giant egos, a love of attention and social media, yet at the same time a sense of victimhood. (Vice President Kamala Harris might love Venn diagrams, but she’d have to hate this intersection.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Trump had been banned following the events of January 6, and reinstated when Musk took over, he only returned to the platform in text for yesterday’s conversation. Both Musk and Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1822827074299584955\">promoted</a> the interview as a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112949391274078319\" rel=\"nofollow\">marquee</a> entertainment <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1823073478481965199\">event</a>, with Musk promising that it would be “unscripted with no limits on subject matter, so should be highly entertaining!” Yet the two men gabbed mostly about the predictable topics: the US border, crime, and then still more about the border. The interview was yet another opportunity for Trump to spew insults and make false statements, with no pushback from his interviewer — not even when Trump told Musk, the CEO of an EV company, that he planned to “drill, baby, drill” in his second term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The livestream started nearly an hour late due to technical difficulties. Almost 20 minutes after it was set to begin, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1823152153445404990\">wrote</a> that there appeared to be a “massive DDOS attack on X.” (A DDoS attack intentionally disrupts a site by flooding it with traffic; it wouldn’t be accurate to call it a DDoS attack if a lot of people organically wanted to tune in.) Previous Spaces events on X have been rife with glitches, too — a live convo between Musk and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last May, in which DeSantis announced his presidential bid, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/24/tech/twitter-desantis-meltdown/index.html\">crashed</a> when over 500,000 people tried to listen in. Before the Trump interview, Musk said that X would be conducting stress tests to ensure the livestream could handle the traffic. Top livestreams on YouTube and Twitch have handled <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/will-smith-performance-helps-ibai-break-twitch-viewership-record-with-an-incredible-385-million-concurrent-viewers\">millions of concurrent viewers</a> before, and the most popular streamers on those platforms regularly enjoy <a href=\"https://twitchtracker.com/channels/viewership\">hundreds of thousands</a> of viewers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, Trump returned to Truth Social, the social media site that he has a majority stake in, to praise Musk and <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112955510502595799\" rel=\"nofollow\">lash out against the media</a> for reporting on the technical issues that delayed the livestream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I absolutely HATE the Fake News Media,” he wrote. “So bad for our Country!”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Trump and Musk’s rocky history</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and Musk haven’t always been on good terms. In the run-up to the presidential election in 2016, Musk said in a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/04/donald-trumps-character-reflects-poorly-on-united-states-says-elon-musk.html\">CNBC interview</a> that Trump was “not the right guy,” noting that he didn’t have the “sort of character that reflects well on the United States.” Still, once Trump was in office Musk initially fostered a friendly relationship with the president, even agreeing to join <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/827330589191704576\">two White House advisory councils</a>. He quickly <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/870369915894546432\">stepped down</a> after Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, at a rally in 2022, Trump claimed that Musk had told him he voted for him in 2016, calling the billionaire a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3551329-trump-elon-musk-another-bulls-artist/\">bullshit artist</a>.” Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/s-time-trump-sail-sunset-says-musk-rcna37798\">sniped back</a> that Trump should “sail into the sunset,” and in response Trump wrote on Truth Social that Musk had come to the Oval Office to ask for help “on all of his many subsidized projects,” and that he could have told Musk to <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108636743295734643\" rel=\"nofollow\">drop to his knees and beg</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A fact check on Trump and Musk on immigration</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One topic the two men continually returned to was immigration, and the insistence that there’s a scourge of crime committed by undocumented immigrants sweeping the nation. Trump said that over 20 million people have illegally crossed the US border under President Joe Biden, far outpacing <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/12/51-million-border-illegally-biden-fact-check/74595944007/\">estimates from experts</a>. He repeated the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-fact-check.html\">unsubstantiated claim</a> that many of them were coming from jails and mental institutions and called them “stone cold killers in many cases.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and Musk also agreed that migrant crime was “destroying” cities like New York and San Francisco. “They just let violent criminals out in New York,” said Musk. “The only one they’re going to prosecute is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations\">Donald Trump</a>,” the former president interjected. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/366622/violent-crime-dropping-pandemic-wave-2024\">violent crime in US cities</a> has plummeted in the first half of 2024.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that appears to be water under the bridge now. Musk officially <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1812256998588662068\">endorsed</a> Trump in July on the day of his attempted assassination, and is backing a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/inside-elon-musks-hands-on-push-to-win-800-000-voters-for-trump-0a7d55b3\">super PAC</a> aiming to get 800,000 Americans in swing states to vote for Trump. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3\">Wall Street Journal</a> recently reported that the two speak on the phone several times a month now to discuss topics such as “immigration, technology and science.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why the two see eye to eye</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the conversation wound down, Trump congratulated Musk on getting “60 to 70 million” listeners, appearing to mistake the number of passive views the event got on X with the number of people who had tuned in (a little over 1 million). Musk mused that the total number of views the interview would eventually get would be in the hundreds of millions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was a moment that summed up what the two men have in common — a tendency to self-aggrandize and <a href=\"https://x.com/jwhittenbergK5/status/1730035694507376811\">inflate their accomplishments</a>. They both have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/trump-christians-vote-ingraham.html\">a habit</a> of saying <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981928/elon-musk-ad-boycott-go-fuck-yourself-destroy-x\">incendiary</a> things, whether on camera or online, and have used social media to grow a fervent fan base around their cult of personality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has been mostly absent on X even after being reinstated in November 2022, posting primarily on Truth Social. He’s under an exclusivity clause that limits non-political posts he can make outside of Truth Social — but this interview appears to fall under an exemption because it’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/madelinehalpert/2022/05/16/trump-agrees-to-post-on-truth-social-before-any-other-sites-with-some-caveats/\">related to politics</a>. Yesterday, in the lead-up to the interview, Trump made multiple posts on X boosting his presidential campaign, pinning a campaign ad to the top of his profile.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Are you better off now than you were when I was president?<br><br>Our economy is shattered. Our border has been erased. We&#039;re a nation in decline.<br><br>Make the American Dream AFFORDABLE again. Make America SAFE again. Make America GREAT Again!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823034723867713700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote> \n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to August 12, Trump hadn’t posted on X in almost a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, though, Musk and Trump are also united by a sense of personal grievance and persecution. Trump complained that the Democrats had weaponized the legal system against him, referring to the many criminal investigations he’s under. “The Biden administration did something that’s never been done in this country, and that’s go after their political opponent — me — with this nonsense,” Trump said. A few days ago, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1822352993422901402\">posted a graphic</a> (the source of which is unclear) on X portraying himself and his political views as the side resisting oppression — much like Luke Skywalker in <em>Star Wars</em>, Katniss Everdeen in <em>The Hunger Games</em>, or Neo in <em>The Matrix</em>. “When it’s fiction you understand,” the picture reads. “You refuse to see it when it’s the reality you’re living in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk groused that people painted him as a “far-right guy, which is absurd because I’m, like, making electric vehicles,” he said. “I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama’s hand when he was president.” While Musk said he used to vote for Democrats, in 2022 he <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1526997132858822658?lang=en\">announced</a> he would start voting Republican because the Dems had become the party of “division &amp; hate.”<strong><em> </em></strong>In the past year he has repeated rhetoric echoing the white supremacist <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24111405/elon-musk-great-replacement-conspiracy-immigration-don-lemon\">“great replacement” theory</a>, which alleges that there’s a conspiracy to replace white people by bringing <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1770030227390914624\">undocumented immigrants</a> into the US. He has also consistently been dismissive of LGBTQ+ equality, showing <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1671370284102819841\">particular</a> contempt for <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1286869404874088448\">transgender</a> people. Musk’s daughter, who is trans, has criticized his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/musk-transgender-vivian-grimes/\">treatment of her gender identity</a> on Instagram’s Threads. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>A fact check on Trump and Musk on inflation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Turning to the economy, both men blamed excess government spending during the pandemic as the primary cause of inflation. Economists <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-caused-the-u-s-pandemic-era-inflation/\">generally attribute</a> recent US inflation to a mix of reasons — not just government spending, but also supply chain interruptions combined with a surge in consumer demand. The $2.2 trillion <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21196202/house-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">CARES Act</a>, one of the major Covid-19 stimulus packages, was signed into law by Trump.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There were plenty of strange asides that the two men touched on during the conversation on X, highlighting their shared chaos — such as when Musk brought up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/12/8/23498861/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnels-finished\">building tunnels</a> to “solve traffic.” Trump praised China’s high-speed rail system, but Musk was referring to tunnels for Tesla cars, like the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-02-26/elon-musk-las-vegas-loop-tunnel-has-construction-safety-issues\">Las Vegas Loop</a>. Both agreed that Harris was a “far left” politician, with Trump repeating <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/362062/biden-drop-out-republicans-accuse-democrats-coup\">his accusation</a> that Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race was a “coup” conducted by the Democratic Party. While on the subject of government overspending, Trump declared that he would shutter the Department of Education and “move education back to the states” during his second term. The former president also appeared to praise Musk for his <a href=\"https://time.com/6224380/elon-musk-twitter-open-letter/\">mass firing of disgruntled Twitter employees</a> in late 2022. “I won’t mention the name of the company,” he said, “but they go on strike and you say, ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone.’” After the X interview, the United Auto Workers filed <a href=\"https://uaw.org/uaw-files-federal-labor-charges-against-donald-trump-and-elon-musk-for-attempting-to-intimidate-and-threaten-workers/\">federal labor charges</a> with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing Trump and Musk of “illegal attempts to threaten and intimidate workers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the top of the interview, Musk said that he wanted to show what Trump was like outside of an adversarial interview, despite the fact that the former president is famous for holding <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-trump-rally/\">countless rallies</a> where he speaks without restraint. “It’s hard to catch a vibe about someone if you just don’t hear them talk in a normal way,” Musk claimed, adding that the event was aimed at “open-minded independent voters.” It remains to be seen how many voters were impressed by Trump’s and Musk’s vibes.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Although many countries outside of Africa rapidly contained an mpox pandemic that began <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/7/25/23277404/worldwide-monkeypox-outbreak-2022\">in 2022</a>, large outbreaks continued unabated in west and central Africa. And now, a deadlier strain is spreading across borders in Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease closely related to but much less severe than smallpox, and is suspected to originate in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html#:~:text=Monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered%20in,regions%20where%20mpox%20is%20endemic.\">African rodents and non-human primates</a>. Mpox <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html\">spreads</a> through close contact with an infected person, including from sexual and skin-to-skin-contact. Pregnant people can also pass the virus to their child during pregnancy and after birth. The most common <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/symptoms/index.html\">symptom</a> of mpox is a blister-like rash that typically lasts for two to four weeks. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle aches, cough, and sore throat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.\">For decades</a>, mpox caused sporadic cases and outbreaks in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and several other African countries.<strong> </strong>There are two <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/mpox#:~:text=Mpxv%20virus%20variants%20are%20referred,Clade%20IIa%20and%20Clade%20IIb.\">main strains</a> of mpox: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html\">clade I</a>, which causes more severe illness and has historically been confined to central Africa, and clade II, which has historically caused infections in west Africa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox\">May 2022</a>, countries outside of Africa suddenly started recording mpox cases which were caused by the clade II type. That July, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern. By May 2023, more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/response/2022/world-map.html\">100 countries</a> had recorded nearly 90,000 mpox cases and over <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/mpox\">150 deaths</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fortunately, public health agencies around the world acted quickly to improve disease surveillance efforts, increasing awareness among high-risk populations, particularly men who have sex with men, and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/monkeypox-response-in-europe\">encouraging</a> safe sex practices. In the US and Europe, where there were just over 30,000 and 25,000 mpox cases respectively between May 2022 and May 2023, officials also disseminated over a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a2.htm\">million</a> vaccine doses. Consequently, mpox transmission in most countries quickly dwindled. In <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox\">May 2023</a>, the World Health Organization lifted the emergency status. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, the mpox outbreaks, while not currently considered an international health emergency, are still ongoing, and countries around the world continue to report cases. In June 2024, there were 175 cases reported across North, Central, and South America; 100 cases were reported in Europe, and 11 cases were reported in Southeast Asian countries, according to a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true\">situation report</a> published by the World Health Organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as the global burden of mpox improves, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522\">outbreak</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa is worsening. Unlike in the rest of the world, the mpox strain causing infections in the DRC is the more severe <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true\">clade I type</a>. As of May 2024, there have been <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522\">7,851</a> mpox cases and 384 deaths reported in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the past two months, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153141\">four countries in east Africa</a> — Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda — have reported clade I mpox cases for the first time, spurring concerns that a deadlier mpox pandemic may be on the horizon. Other African countries are also facing resurging mpox outbreaks caused by the clade II virus. In May, there were a total of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true\">465</a> mpox cases documented across all African countries and in June there were 567, a 22 percent increase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The uptick in mpox cases has pushed Africa CDC to designate mpox what it calls a public health emergency of continental security. Africa CDC is the public health <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/\">agency</a> of the African Union, which represents 55 African states. It is the first time the agency has designated any outbreak a continental emergency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We declare today this public health emergency of continental security to mobilize our institutions, our collective will, and our resources to act swiftly and decisively,” said Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya in a press briefing Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But outbreak response efforts in the DRC and other African countries have once again been hamstrung by the same challenges health officials faced during previous outbreaks and pandemics, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22759707/covid-19-vaccine-gap-covax-rich-poor-countries-boosters\">including Covid</a>: a lack of global solidarity and an unwillingness to share life-saving resources. While vaccine doses were rapidly disseminated in the US and Europe in 2022, vaccines are only now starting to trickle into the DRC. But even so, only a couple hundred thousand vaccines will be available for a population of more than <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL\">100 million</a> people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Slowly, national governments and multinational organizations such as the African Union are working to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/24/24048361/mpox-covid-outbreak-africa-cdc-public-health\">improve</a> domestic public health infrastructure and technical capacity and to reduce dependency on donor countries. While Africa CDC’s unprecedented move to designate the mpox outbreaks a regional health emergency signals a continuation of these efforts, it is unclear if the designation will help spur the rapid influx of resources needed to respond to the mpox outbreaks.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Mpox origins and unknowns</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mpox was first discovered in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.\">1958</a> in a colony of monkeys in a research facility in Denmark, and the first case of mpox in a human — a nine-month old infant — was not documented until <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html\">1970</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Researchers and physicians could <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2480792/pdf/bullwho00192-0028.pdf\">not determine</a> exactly how the infant became infected; however, close contact with an infected monkey may have caused the infection. Small rodents, monkeys, and mammals <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html\">can pass</a> the virus on to humans but outbreaks typically take off when humans infect each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2005, additional mpox cases in humans were recorded in the DRC, and thousands of suspected cases have been reported every year since then. Since 2017, mpox has also caused frequent infections in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although mpox has been around for a long time, there are still many unknowns about how the virus spreads and why it suddenly spread around the world in 2022. What researchers do know is that the virus has been rapidly mutating in recent years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Interestingly and maybe worryingly, while most genetic mutations have no effect at all, some can cause viruses to become deadlier or more effective at spreading. When geneticists compared the 2022 mpox genome to a sample collected in 2017, they <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02456-8\">found</a> some <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/\">40</a> genetic <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01675-2#Sec4\">mutations</a> had occurred. Some researchers have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mpox-why-the-viruss-continued-rapid-mutation-since-the-2022-global-outbreak-remains-a-concern-228338\">suggested</a> that these mutations have improved how easily the virus can spread from person to person, but it seems that there is no firm <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/\">consensus</a> yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In September 2023, an entirely new mpox clade I variant, tentatively called clade IB, was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522\">discovered</a> in the DRC. The World Health Organization has not confirmed if the new variant causes more severe disease or can be spread more easily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rosamund Lewis, the mpox technical lead at the World Health Organization, posits that genetic mutations are not behind the sudden global surge of mpox. Instead, she suggests that the virus happened to start infecting new populations — sex workers and men who have sex with men — and that has in turn fueled wider transmission. Mpox is reminiscent of the origins of HIV, when <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234451/#:~:text=Approximately%20one%20century%20ago%20in,the%20AIDS%20pandemic%20in%20humans.\">chimpanzees</a> infected humans in southwestern Cameroon before taking firm <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-kinshasa-1920s-was-perfect-place-hiv-go-global-180952953/\">root</a> in the booming urban center — and among the large sex worker population — of Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sexual transmission among adults may only be one of the main drivers of mpox transmission. In the DRC, some <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/mpox-risk-assessment.html\">70 percent</a> of mpox cases recorded this year were among children who were likely exposed through close contact with infected animals or household members who were infected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the biggest risk factors for severe mpox infection and <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00273-8/fulltext\">death</a> is preexisting <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/hiv.html\">HIV infection</a>. Unfortunately, about <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids#:~:text=There%20are%2025.6%20million%20people%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%20the%20African%20region.&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20about%20380%2C000%20people,AIDS%20related%20illness%20in%202022.\">25.6 million</a> people in Africa have HIV, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363716/africa-hiv-aids-sub-saharan-progress\">more</a> than any other region in the world,<strong> </strong>meaning many African nations may experience deadlier outbreaks than other parts of the world. The dual burden of mpox and HIV was also a major factor that prompted the Africa CDC to declare the mpox outbreaks a continental emergency, Kaseya explained. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>There is an mpox vaccine shortage. Will emergency designations help?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is at least one vaccine — <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos\">Jynneos</a>, also called <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imvanex\">Imvanex</a> in Europe — that is effective against mpox. The US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-live-non-replicating-vaccine-prevent-smallpox-and-monkeypox\">approved </a>the vaccine for use against smallpox and mpox in 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the US and Europe started recording mpox cases in 2022, health officials quickly disseminated millions of doses of existing vaccines. For the first two years of the pandemic, however, no vaccines were available in the DRC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DRC, like most countries in Africa, <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/\">does not have</a> the infrastructure to produce its own vaccines nor can it afford to pay for millions of doses. (The mpox vaccine costs just under $100 per dose, according to Kaseya; GDP per capita in the <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CD\">DRC is just $649</a>.) Thus, these countries must rely on donations from the US, Europe, and other countries. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the Africa CDC started leading <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/\">efforts</a> to fill this crucial gap, but progress has been slow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the void, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries have been carrying on their outbreak responses without vaccines. It wasn’t until last month that the first shipments of Jynneos started arriving in the DRC. But the country received only 200,000 doses, according to Lewis, forcing personnel to cobble together a plan outlining how they will utilize such finite resources. Kaseya did not elaborate on how Africa CDC will aid in this process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Donor governments have been providing technical and financial support for mpox outbreak responses in Africa. Last week, the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, announced that it will surge <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-07-2024-united-states-announces-424-million-additional-assistance-democratic-republic-congo\">$10 million</a> in funds to support the mpox response in DRC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It remains unclear if Africa CDC’s designating mpox a continental emergency will have any impact on mpox vaccine availability. Still, the Africa CDC seems to be leading the way to direct domestic resources toward the mpox response. Earlier this month, the African Union released <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Emergency-Approval-of-10.4-Million-to-Africa-CDC-for-Mpox-Outbreak-Respons.pdf\">$10.4 million</a> in funds for the mpox response.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is a fight for all Africans and we will fight it together,” Kaseya said.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And the Biden administration’s attempts to rein in junk fees are a way for it to make the case that Democrats are addressing Americans’ concerns about high prices before the election. Limiting fees is popular on a bipartisan basis: a December <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2023/12/12/voters-support-initiatives-to-lower-drug-costs-ban-junk-fees-and-strengthen-supply-chains\">Data for Progress poll</a> found that 77 percent of voters — including 81 percent of Democrats, 78 percent of independents, and 72 percent of Republicans — said they supported legislation banning junk fees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Essentially in all of these practices, the companies are delaying services to you or, really, trying to make it so difficult for you to cancel the service that they get to hold on to your money longer and longer,” Tanden said. “And what that means is, ultimately, consumers, the American public, is losing out.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How the policy would work</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration’s proposals would prohibit companies from billing customers without their consent, failing to disclose cancellation policies, and making cancellation difficult by, for example, requiring customers to cancel in person or endure long holds on the phone with customer service. Companies that fail to comply with the rule could <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2023-0033-0001\">face civil penalties</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/01/if-your-company-received-ftc-notice-penalty-offenses-take-notice-action\">like those</a> the FTC has sought in recent cases <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/proposed-ftc-order-will-prohibit-telehealth-firm-cerebral-using-or-disclosing-sensitive-data\">related to advertising</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The FTC is currently reviewing public comments on its <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring\">proposed rule</a>, which would require companies to allow customers who sign up online for a service to also cancel that service online in no more steps than it took them to sign up. Companies would be allowed to make additional offers when a customer tries to cancel, but only if they first ask if a customer is open to hearing them. Companies would also have to provide reminders before subscriptions are automatically renewed if they are not for any physical good.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That rule could go into effect in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the FCC opened an inquiry Monday into pursuing a similar rule that would apply to the communications industry. If the FCC decides to do so, that rule might not go into effect before Biden’s term ends, though if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election, she would likely advance it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Biden’s subscription cancellation policy is part of a broader pro-consumer agenda</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to his latest move on subscriptions, Biden has pursued a still-pending <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees\">broad regulation</a> to combat junk fees overall, as well as regulations aimed at industry-specific junk fees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a rule to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2024/1/17/24042169/biden-overdraft-fee-banks-nsf-amount\">curb overdraft fees</a> incurred when consumers withdraw more than the available funds in their bank account — a move that might save customers about $3.5 billion a year overall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration’s efforts have hit some barriers, however. Airlines recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/major-airlines-sue-biden-administration-over-fee-disclosure-rule-2024-05-13/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20May%2013%20(Reuters),carriers%20and%20the%20Biden%20administration\">sued</a> the Biden administration over a new final rule that requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose upfront any fees associated with booking a plane ticket. And a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/credit-card-fee-limit-blocked.html\">temporarily blocked</a> a Biden administration rule that would limit fees on late credit card payments to $8 per month, which the CFPB said would cut costs for Americans by $10 billion a year. Bank and credit card company lobbyists, supported by <a href=\"https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/credit-debit-card-transaction-fees-congress-cfpb-payments-biden-chopra/709691/\">some Republican members of Congress,</a> had argued that the rule was unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though those lawsuits are meant to limit the administration, Biden has also used the courts in an aggressive antitrust pro-consumer strategy. His administration has filed a flurry of sweeping lawsuits against major companies, including four Big Tech companies, on the grounds that they are harming competition in their industries and, therefore, American consumers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration recently won a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/big-tech/365575/google-monopoly-search-case-biden-big-tech\">major ruling against Google</a> in which the judge found that the company’s search business constituted an illegal monopoly. Other antitrust lawsuits are pending against Google over its ads business, Meta over its acquisitions of Instagram and Whatsapp, Apple over its alleged anticompetitive practices in the smartphone market, and Amazon over its restrictions on third-party sellers that have served to keep prices higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration has also filed a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/4/16/24132509/ticketmaster-live-nation-lawsuit-swift-bad-bunny-beyonce-rodrigo\">seeking to break up Live Nation</a>, Ticketmaster’s parent company, accusing it of operating an illegal monopoly through anticompetitive behavior that has harmed everyone from consumers to concert venues to artists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The durability of Biden’s consumer protection initiative may depend in part on the November election. A Harris administration would likely uphold these policies and could continue to pursue these antitrust lawsuits and then some. But if former President Donald Trump wins the election, it’s probably a different story — the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/354668/biden-economy-antitrust-junk-fees-consumer-protection\">Trump administration didn’t make consumer protection a priority</a> in its first term, and has not made doing so in a second term central to its campaign.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Advocates touted its potential to treat mental illness, but MDMA research was long stymied by its status as an illicit drug with no medical use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This year, the FDA reviewed Lykos Therapeutics’s late-stage clinical trials, which paired MDMA with psychotherapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. But on Friday, what was expected to be a landmark moment for the use of psychedelics in medicine ended in a rejection from the agency. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Read more about the mystery of psychedelics</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult\">The biggest unknown in psychedelic therapy is not the psychedelics</a><br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\">Why psychedelics produce some of the most meaningful experiences in people’s lives</a><br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/15/24156372/psychedelics-chronic-pain-cluster-headache-medicine-lsd-psilocybin\">Psychedelics could treat some of the worst chronic pain in the world</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Have questions, comments, or ideas? </strong>Email me: haleema.shah@voxmedia.com. </p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was a far cry from what most observers expected when I began reporting on MDMA-assisted therapy at the beginning of the year. Clinicians and patients were (and remain) overwhelmingly supportive of researching psychedelics for psychiatric use. In the absence of novel treatments for PTSD, MDMA received surprising bipartisan support in Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs was instructed to prepare a rollout of the treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even before the FDA’s rejection, its advisers were concerned about research bias, trial misconduct, and data integrity. While the rejection does not fully quash hopes of the drug’s future in medicine, it will delay it. <a href=\"https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-08-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-Complete-Response-Letter-for-Midomafetamine-Capsules-for-PTSD\">Lykos Therapeutics announced</a> that the FDA requested an additional phase 3 trial to further study safety and efficacy of the treatment, something that the company CEO said would take several years to complete.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The delay is a critical blow to psychedelic advocates who expected that MDMA would finally find therapeutic use after four decades of advocacy. Here&#8217;s how they got MDMA this far — and what they&#8217;re planning next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The roots of therapeutic MDMA</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I began reporting on MDMA’s roots in therapy for Vox’s podcast <em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast\">Today, Explained</a>, </em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/13mTTBlwOkibgRgLgJnIZi?si=CM-pxT6lRmG1F1N9LFZUuQ\">I visited Shulgin Farm</a>, the Bay Area home of the late chemist Alexander “Sasha” Shulgin, who synthesized the drug in 1976. Though his lab — a converted tool shed — looked more like a Hollywood rendition of a meth lab than the sterile laboratories of my college chemistry class, it was historically significant, because Shulgin is said to have synthesized hundreds of psychoactive substances, some of which he tested on himself, including MDMA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shulgin would admit he found MDMA enjoyable, calling it a “low-calorie martini.” But he didn’t set out to design recreational drugs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m looking for tools that can be used for studying the mind,” and he believed his peers could then use those tools in neuroscience or psychology, he said in a 1996 interview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His wife, Ann Shulgin, who died in 2022 and is sometimes referred to as “a lay therapist,” was even more ardent about her view of&nbsp; psychedelics as “spiritual tools.” In the early 1980s, she and countercultural psychotherapists believed that MDMA, with its ability to flood people with feelings of love and empathy, could relieve clients of shame and allow them to process trauma or face challenging emotions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This chemical has already accomplished enough so that many psychiatrists who have used it, and are using it, have spoken of a possible need to substantially restructure the classical psychotherapeutic 50-minute hour concept,” Ann wrote in a letter to President Ronald Reagan, arguing for the drug’s legal use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That description bears striking resemblance to what some trial participants say today: An 18-week treatment regimen with MDMA and psychotherapy can relieve PTSD symptoms that years of therapy and SSRI prescriptions couldn’t. But MDMA’s development as a therapeutic drug was hindered by its reputation as a medically useless street drug.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>MDMA’s descent deeper into the underground</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite underground therapists’ belief in MDMA’s therapeutic potential in the early 1980s, the euphoric experiences the drug induced could not be contained for long. MDMA escaped the therapeutic space, was produced in clandestine labs, and found a home in nightclubs as “ecstasy” or “X.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it happened during a drug war that already banned psychedelics like LSD. By 1985, MDMA was quickly placed under <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/us/us-will-ban-ecstasy-a-hallucinogenic-drug.html\">emergency ban</a> after the DEA said it posed a public health risk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There was a lot of lurid press about MDMA,” Paul Daley, a friend of the Shulgins and chief science officer at the Alexander Shulgin Research Institute, told me. “Brain scans were showing ‘Oh, there are holes in people’s brains who are taking MDMA.’ Of course, it’s all hogwash.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most damning study of MDMA was in the early aughts, and suggested it caused Parkinson’s-like brain damage, but the study was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2003/09/ecstasy-study-botched-retracted/\">retracted after a major experimental error was discovered</a>. Evidence, however, supports that MDMA can cause rapid heart rate, cardiovascular events, and bad trips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As DARE programs and news reports warned of the dangers of ecstasy, a community of evangelists remained committed to bringing MDMA into respectability through medicine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>MDMA’s makeover and foray into medicine</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shortly after MDMA was banned, a friend of the Shulgins by the name of Rick Doblin sprung into action. With the goals of “mass mental health” and “spiritualized humanity,” Doblin founded the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), an organization he still leads, and is regarded as one of the most successful psychedelic advocates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To bring psychedelics back from the underground, it was necessary to, first off, have a patient population that the general public is sympathetic with and for which Big Pharma’s drugs are not really working,” Doblin said in a 2021 interview with self-help guru (and former presidential candidate) Marianne Williamson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sympathetic population he described are <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3HQLg8gtXUWZcM1BC5hYe8?si=de552c21ef3042ca\">military veterans</a>, who face high rates of PTSD and for whom first-line treatments are decades-old SSRIs that are partially effective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Doblin’s organization and pharmaceutical spinoff, Lykos Therapeutics, are responsible for the clinical trials that the FDA reviewed this month. But months before the agency announced its decision, the trial design was criticized for not meeting the gold standard of clinical trials, which is to be double-blinded. Participants were usually able to determine whether they received the drug or placebo because of MDMA’s obvious psychedelic effects. Moreover, some who received the drug <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/41FjzMR0uPIW7nMuLlP4f5?si=2bfc25de44b74500\">said they felt pressured to report positive results</a> because their participation was framed as “making history” and “part of a movement” to end psychedelic prohibition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Friday’s FDA decision is a blow to the decades-long efforts to medicalize MDMA, but psychedelics are now more mainstream than ever — they’re a subject of discussion at the VA, on wellness podcasts, and studied in academic institutions around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And in a statement, Doblin showed no signs of quitting his 40-year odyssey of mainstreaming psychedelics: “Our collective commitment to MDMA-assisted therapy remains unwavering.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Listen to all three episodes of <em>Today, Explained’s</em> series on the promise and precarity of MDMA below or <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/todayexplainedpod\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://link.chtbl.com/todayexplainedpod\">wherever you find podcasts</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP5927100160\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP7485344437\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9852302001\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Until things went sideways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, the FDA declined to approve the new treatment submitted by <a href=\"https://lykospbc.com/about-us/mental-health-trailblazers/\">Lykos Therapeutics</a>, an organization that develops innovations to “transform mental healthcare,” according to a <a href=\"https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-08-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-Complete-Response-Letter-for-Midomafetamine-Capsules-for-PTSD\">statement published by Lykos</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The FDA is requesting Lykos conduct an additional Phase 3 study, as the agency couldn’t approve the treatment “based on data submitted to date.” In addition, piling on the drama, the day after the FDA’s decision, the journal <em>Psychopharmacology</em> <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/11/mdma-ptsd-lykos-maps-retractions/\">retracted</a> three studies on MDMA therapy that had been organized by Lykos. The retraction letter cites ethical misconduct at a research site that was <a href=\"https://maps.org/2019/05/24/statement-public-announcement-of-ethical-violation-by-former-maps-sponsored-investigators/\">reported</a> to the FDA and in a public statement in 2019, but not to the journal in particular.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The decision will have far-reaching ripple effects. Some psychedelic advocates will have to put celebrations they’ve been planning for decades on pause; others will rejoice at dodging the bullet of Lykos’s spiritually inflected <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult\">therapy protocol</a> being the one that breaks the dam of psychedelic treatment. The millions of Americans suffering from PTSD will have to wait for a reformulated attempt at MDMA therapy to pass. And the broader momentum of the psychedelic revival will continue teetering on the edge of mainstream acceptance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, though, the decision amounts to more of a delay than a death blow to psychedelic therapy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The last-minute drama that derailed Lykos’s MDMA therapy, briefly explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lykos Therapeutics <a href=\"https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-02-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-FDA-Acceptance-and-Priority-Review-of-New-Drug-Application-for-MDMA-Assisted-Therapy-for-PTSD\">received</a> priority review from the FDA back in February, which <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review\">fast-tracked</a> the potential treatment for a decision within six months. Even the Biden administration was <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/07/26/mdma-psilocybin-fda-ptsd/\">anticipating</a> its approval. If accepted, Lykos’s application would have likely only gained approval for their <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c05520?ref=pdf\">proprietary formulation</a> of MDMA, not the illicit form of the drug that’s currently considered a <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling#:~:text=Schedule%20I%20drugs%2C%20substances%2C%20or,)%2C%20methaqualone%2C%20and%20peyote.\">Schedule I substance</a>. That means Lykos’s version of MDMA could have been used in prescribed treatment environments, but general MDMA, or “ecstasy,” would remain illegal outside of medical environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, even approval of a pharmaceutical product including MDMA would solidify the idea that MDMA — a drug that carries <a href=\"https://newyorklegaldefense.com/practice-areas/new-york-drug-crime-lawyers/ecstasy-charges/#:~:text=An%20arrest%20for%20possession%20of,offender%20could%20face%209%20years.\">federal penalties</a> of up to three years in jail and a $5,000 fine — can be a real medicine, challenging its designation as having “no currently accepted medical use” by the Drug Enforcement Administration. So FDA approval wouldn’t spell the end of the psychedelic prohibition that began in 1970, but it would provide ammunition for broader efforts to reschedule psychedelics and expand access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the optimism around approval began to sour in late March, when the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a nonprofit that evaluates evidence for health care interventions, published a <a href=\"https://icer.org/news-insights/press-releases/icer-releases-draft-evidence-report-on-treatment-for-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/\">report</a> that called Lykos’s clinical trial design into question. They also shared concerns about unreported adverse events and <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/19/mdma-for-ptsd-fda-concerned-lykos-clinical-trial-misconduct-claims/\">ethical misconduct</a> by therapists during treatment sessions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those concerns reached a crescendo during <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353752/mdma-fda-approval-hearing-lykos-blinding-misconduct-allegations\">an FDA advisory committee meeting</a> on June 4, where a panel of independent experts convened to review Lykos’s evidence and advise the FDA on its ultimate decision. During the nine-hour meeting, panelists expressed significant misgivings about the clinical trial designs, focusing on how difficult it is to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/06/psychedelics-mdma-ptsd-fda-placebo/678588/\">establish placebo controls</a> in psychedelic studies. By “blinding” people as to whether they received the active drug or an inactive placebo, they help prevent people’s expectations from biasing their response to treatment, isolating the effects of the drug. But&nbsp;people tend to know whether or not they’ve taken MDMA or magic mushrooms pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Concerns around failed placebo controls, or “functional unblinding,” <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/06/psychedelics-mdma-ptsd-fda-placebo/678588/\">are not unique</a> to psychedelic science. But the advisory committee felt these issues cast significant doubt across the positive findings. Beyond the concerns with study design, three members of <a href=\"https://www.psymposia.com/\">Psymposia</a>, a non-profit research and media organization that focuses on psychedelic science and harm reduction, went so far as to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult\">accuse Lykos of being a “therapy cult”</a> bent on furthering mystical and utopian goals. Ultimately, the advisory committee voted almost unanimously that there was insufficient evidence to support the treatment, and that the benefits do not outweigh the risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the criticisms, experts <a href=\"https://themicrodose.substack.com/p/the-psychedelics-world-reacts-to\">across the psychedelics world</a> felt that the functional unblinding issues that concerned the advisory committee had already been discussed in detail by the FDA and Lykos when they <a href=\"https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-06-13-Lykos-Therapeutics-Statement-on-FDA-Advisory-Committee-Meeting\">collaborated</a> on the Phase 3 trial design back in 2017. That included the FDA <a href=\"https://maps.org/news/media/press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials/\">signing off</a> on the methodology to handle placebo controls. The FDA typically follows advisory committee recommendations, but hopes remained that this time would be different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was not.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How to (almost) turn MDMA into a legal therapy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Classical psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD were made illegal by the <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/csa\">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) in 1970. MDMA was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/us/us-will-ban-ecstasy-a-hallucinogenic-drug.html\">added to the list</a> in 1985, shortly after it began <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/electronic-dance-music-s-love-affair-with-ecstasy-a-history/279815/\">spreading</a> across the electronic dance music scene. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/us/us-will-ban-ecstasy-a-hallucinogenic-drug.html\">felt</a> that MDMA abuse had become a nationwide problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Banning MDMA triggered Rick Doblin, a 32-year-old doing informal psychedelics research, to found <a href=\"https://maps.org/\">MAPS</a> in 1986, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. He figured that even though it could take decades, the surest way to undo psychedelic prohibition was through FDA approval.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">MAPS began as a non-profit, but <a href=\"https://maps.org/news/bulletin/a-wholly-public-benefit-model/\">launched</a> a separate for-profit arm in 2014, called the MAPS public benefit corporation. The corporation was dedicated to winning FDA approval for MDMA, and eventually, bringing it to market. In early 2024, the MAPS public benefit corporation <a href=\"https://psychedelicalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/amy-emerson-ceo-letter.pdf\">rebranded itself</a> as Lykos Therapeutics, largely because it was pretty awkward to have the original non-profit that still does drug decriminalization advocacy work share a name with a highly regulated for-profit pharmaceutical company focused only on medical treatments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two major aspects of Lykos’s submitted treatment plan —&nbsp;using MDMA rather than other psychedelics, and focusing on PTSD rather than other conditions —&nbsp;were calculated decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Read more about the mystery of psychedelics</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult\">The biggest unknown in psychedelic therapy is not the psychedelics</a><br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\">Why psychedelics produce some of the most meaningful experiences in people’s lives</a><br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/15/24156372/psychedelics-chronic-pain-cluster-headache-medicine-lsd-psilocybin\">Psychedelics could treat some of the worst chronic pain in the world</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Have questions, comments, or ideas? </strong>Email me: oshan.jarow@voxmedia.com. </p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, PTSD affects about <a href=\"https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp#:~:text=About%205%20out%20of%20every,some%20point%20in%20their%20life.\">13 million</a> Americans, or 5 percent of the US population.

But only about 60 percent of patients <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278188/\">respond to treatment</a> at all, and just 20 to 30 percent shake the disorder altogether. The current <a href=\"https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/txessentials/overview_therapy.asp\">gold-standard treatment</a> is trauma-focused psychotherapy, where dropout rates <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284816/\">are high</a>, and many patients still retain their symptoms <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2422548\">after treatment</a>. Veteran organizations like the Department of Veterans Affairs have been <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/05/20/va-veterans-mdma-ptsd/\">looking to MDMA therapy</a> to help treat PTSD and stem the growing <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2022/09/17/veterans-suicide-rate-may-be-double-federal-estimates-study-suggests/\">suicide crisis</a> among veterans, creating an opportunity for politicians across the aisle to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/07/14/ptsd-psychedelic-therapy-research-congress/\">work together</a> toward approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We had to choose which psychedelic and which patient population would be most likely to be successful from a political perspective,” Doblin <a href=\"https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2019/09/10/rick-doblin/\">told Boston Magazine</a> in 2019. “We don’t really do science; we do political science.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While MDMA does pose some physiological risks that classical psychedelics don’t, like <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/substance-use/mdma-effects-on-heart\">raising</a> heart rates and blood pressure, the actual subjective experience of being on MDMA is generally euphoric. MDMA helps release a slew of neurotransmitters, like serotonin (<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin\">dubbed</a> the “feel-good hormone”) and oxytocin (“<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone\">the love hormone</a>”). The rush of positive feelings has always made MDMA a popular club drug. But paired with psychotherapy, MDMA can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046795/\">boost tolerance</a> to traumatic memories by dialing down the mind’s tendency to avoid them, opening a window to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584617308655\">reconsolidate memories</a> that hold fear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, tripping on the “classical psychedelics” — psilocybin, LSD, DMT, or mescaline — runs a much wider spectrum of possible experiences. Varieties of euphoria are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451902224000843\">still common</a>. But slipping into a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0293349\">long</a> and <a href=\"https://bulletin.hds.harvard.edu/a-theological-reckoning-with-bad-trips/\">hellish nightmare</a>, like an existential thorn in your grip on the world that never dislodges, can happen too, even if only in rare cases. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23954347/psychedelics-bad-trips-ketamine-mdma-psilocybin-lsd-risks\">Bad trips</a> are comparatively less of a concern with MDMA, and therefore can pose less of a public health risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By itself, MDMA does not, however, guarantee a good time. Since it can kick up painful memories we normally avoid, MDMA is not immune to bad trips. That’s why Lykos insists on pairing MDMA with therapists who can help support people through difficult experiences, especially in vulnerable populations suffering from depression or PTSD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Having attending therapists is definitely a good harm-reduction strategy. But they can’t fully eliminate the risks, either. At least one participant in MAPS’s studies reported an increase in suicidal ideation after their treatment sessions, and <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/24/mdma-treatment-ptsd-fda-asked-to-probe-adverse-events/\">some controversy has erupted</a> around why that didn’t show up in the published results. And since MDMA can make people <a href=\"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/2/307\">more suggestible</a>, the safety and efficacy of the actual therapy protocols are <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2802941\">just as important</a> as the drug itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as the former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Thomas Insel, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/25/fda-mdma-ptsd-ruling-shows-need-for-psychotherapy-drug-combined-approval/\">recently wrote</a>, “the U.S. regulatory system is not optimized for mental health care,” precisely because we lack a federal agency charged with reviewing the safety and efficacy of psychological interventions, like MDMA’s companion therapy. So MAPS developed <a href=\"https://maps.org/mdma/mdma-resources/treatment-manual-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd/\">its own therapy protocol</a>, and held it constant throughout its trials to try and isolate the drug effects, which are technically the only part of this treatment the FDA actually regulates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">MAPS ran two Phase 3 clinical trials, each turning up pretty positive results. The <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3\">first trial</a>, published in 2021, found that MDMA therapy successfully treated 67 percent of participants, reducing their symptoms to the point where they no longer met the criteria for PTSD. In the placebo group, that number was 32 percent. The <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02565-4\">second trial</a>, published in 2023, found similar results: 71 percent from the treatment group no longer met PTSD criteria, compared to 48 percent from the placebo group. (Note, however, that even though people likely knew when they were in the placebo group, which just received drug-free psychotherapy, they hit impressive <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062599\">treatment rates</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the FDA declined to approve Lykos’s new drug application today, organizations developing similar treatments are <a href=\"https://psychedelicalpha.com/data/psychedelic-drug-development-tracker\">close behind.</a> And even among those who’ve advised against approving MDMA therapy, there’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353752/mdma-fda-approval-hearing-lykos-blinding-misconduct-allegations\">a sentiment</a> that it should <em>eventually</em> get approved. Just not yet, and not like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” said Kim Witczak, a consumer representative who voted against MDMA therapy during the advisory committee meeting. In an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240620-fda-advisors-voted-against-mdma-therapy-researchers-are-still-fighting-for-it\">email</a> to the BBC, she added: “The time to be cautious is now, not afterwards.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What happens next</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-08-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-Complete-Response-Letter-for-Midomafetamine-Capsules-for-PTSD\">press release</a> Friday, Lykos announced receipt of a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA, which includes details as to why the agency declined to approve the treatment. The letter isn’t available to the public, but Lykos states that the letter echoes many of the same concerns that were raised in the June 4 advisory meeting, and requests an additional Phase 3 clinical trial to study safety and efficacy. Lykos will request a meeting to ask the agency to reconsider, but if they don’t, another trial “would take several years,” the company writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The FDA request for another study is deeply disappointing, not just for all those who dedicated their lives to this pioneering effort, but principally for the millions of Americans with PTSD, along with their loved ones, who have not seen any new treatment options in over two decades,” said Amy Emerson, CEO of Lykos. “While conducting another Phase 3 study would take several years, we still maintain that many of the requests that had been previously discussed with the FDA and raised at the Advisory Committee meeting can be addressed with existing data, post-approval requirements or through reference to the scientific literature.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But then, the next day, the journal <em>Psychopharmacology</em> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-024-06665-y\">retracted</a> three studies on MDMA therapy funded by MAPS and organized by Lykos, citing protocol violations and unethical conduct during Phase 2 trials at a particular study site in Canada. A number of authors on the papers were affiliated with either MAPS or Lykos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the “MP4” study site in Vancouver, a therapist treating participants on MDMA during the trial <a href=\"https://qz.com/1809184/psychedelic-therapy-has-a-sexual-abuse-problem-3\">entered into a sexual relationship</a> with a participant after the dosing sessions had ended, but while still providing treatment. The participant later <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/11/mdma-ptsd-lykos-maps-retractions/\">sued the unlicensed therapist</a> for alleged sexual assault in civil court (the case was later <a href=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/23-court-dismissed.pdf?_gl=1*1dceqsv*_ga*MTg0ODAyMjY2NS4xNzIzNDk3MzY2*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyMzU1ODA5Mi4yLjEuMTcyMzU1OTQxOS42MC4wLjA.\">dismissed</a>). Shortly after the allegations went <a href=\"https://maps.org/2019/05/24/statement-public-announcement-of-ethical-violation-by-former-maps-sponsored-investigators/\">public</a>, MAPS <a href=\"https://maps.org/2019/05/24/statement-public-announcement-of-ethical-violation-by-former-maps-sponsored-investigators/\">submitted reports</a> about the incident to the FDA, cut ties with the therapist, and incorporated a new code of ethics that explicitly forbids sexual contact between patients and therapists in their training program.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The retractions don’t affect the Phase 3 trial results that Lykos’s submission to the FDA rested on. But they do contribute to rising skepticism around the strength of MAPS’s data and conduct. While MAPS reported the incident to the FDA in 2019, they didn’t report directly to <em>Psychopharmacology</em> that data gathered from the site of the incident was included in their papers. Some authors disagree with the retraction and feel a correction that gave updated results without including data from that particular site would have been appropriate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, while no new details about the incident that went public in 2019 have come to light, the timing of the retraction does add to a growing cloud of concerns around whether the internal <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-rick-doblin-fda-legalization-trials-2024-5\">culture of evangelism</a> at MAPS creates tension with high standards of scientific integrity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever happens next with Lykos,<strong> </strong>other companies are moving toward their own new drug applications. One of the <a href=\"https://psychedelicalpha.com/news/late-stage-psychedelic-trials-a-brief-review-of-the-two-most-mature-psychedelic-drug-development-programs\">most likely</a> next applicants, the biotech company Compass Pathways, is pairing psilocybin with “psychological support,” which looks like a more hands-off version of Lykos’s approach to therapy. Meanwhile, states can continue passing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/360200/how-to-buy-psychedelics-lsd-shrooms-stores\">a variety of legislations</a>, from decriminalization to legalizing supervised <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html\">adult use models</a>, like Oregon’s approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alongside state legislation, psychedelic research in academia will continue its expansion from medical applications, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\">consciousness science</a>, all the way out to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1082933/full\">humanities scholars</a>. Religious groups can continue seeking legal exemptions for their use of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/psychedelic-drugs-church-religion.html\">psychedelics as sacraments</a>. And the psychedelic underground will continue providing access (for both better and worse) to those who manage to find it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The decision will likely put a dent in the valuation of some psychedelic start-ups, and bring on a wave of skeptical press. But Lykos’s failure may actually increase the odds that subsequent psychedelic treatments pass the FDA approval process. Applicants now know where the FDA is going to focus, and how to strengthen their applications in response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05624268\">Compass Pathways</a> and the nonprofit <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06308653?term=NCT06308653&amp;ra=\">Usona Institute</a> have Phase 3 clinical trials — the last step before putting together a new drug application for FDA consideration&nbsp;— underway for psilocybin as a treatment for depression. And a <a href=\"https://psychedelicalpha.com/data/psychedelic-drug-development-tracker\">very long list</a> of organizations have Phase 2 trials ongoing for psychedelics ranging from LSD to 5-MeO-DMT (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/us/toad-venom-psychedelic.html\">found</a> in the poisonous secretions of a Sonoran Desert toad). More are on the horizon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the prospects for psychedelic therapy remain good, if a little frazzled. But at the same time, FDA approval of a pharmaceutical product that can exclusively be used in medical settings will not put an end to the psychedelic prohibition. At least, not in the way that many advocates have been hoping for decades.</p>\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9852302001\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Doblin founded MAPS in 1986, Lykos’s ancestor, the idea wasn’t just to eventually produce a new type of prescribable therapy. As journalist Anna Silman recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-rick-doblin-fda-legalization-trials-2024-5\">reported</a>, Doblin envisioned MAPS as a Trojan horse to rekindle the psychedelic renaissance that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/long-reads/optimism-hippies-sixties-history-hollywood-zen-a9156511.html\">crashed and burned</a> in the 1960s by routing it through the FDA. Once approved as a medicine, psychedelics could rise from the underground into mainstream acceptance, opening the door for expanded access outside of a doctor’s office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But some critics have long <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721486/ketamine-dmt-lsd-psychedelics-magic-mushrooms-legalization-recreation-psilocybin\">been wary of medicalization</a> as the best path toward an equitable psychedelic revival that ever escapes the medical ambit to make the most of their diverse potentials. Psychedelics —&nbsp;used responsibly — can contribute to our perennial <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\">search for meaning</a>, scientific <a href=\"https://centerforminds.org/\">innovation</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1082933/full\">expanding</a> our cultural imagination. But those aspects will be undermined if psychedelics get stuck as medicines, and medicines alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a true psychedelic renaissance to kick in, they need to be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. FDA approval is one strategy that could support that process, while treating people in significant need along the way. We’ll see if the next application gets enough escape velocity to not only clear FDA approval, but the medical establishment altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, August 13, 11:36 am:</strong> This story has been updated multiple times, most recently to include details of </em>Psychopharmacology<em>’s retraction of three MAPS-funded papers. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gPGxB2FqEc\">resurfaced comments</a> from Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance complaining that the government was being run by “childless cat ladies” who are unhappy they don’t have children drew widespread condemnation from <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jennifer-aniston-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies/\">across</a> the <a href=\"https://fox40.com/news/national-and-world-news/fox-news-host-challenges-jd-vance-on-childless-cat-lady-remarks/\">political spectrum</a>. Last year, the US Surgeon General <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">released an advisory</a> underscoring the seriousness of loneliness and isolation. While <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/350424/self-care-isolation-loneliness-epidemic\">long-term data on loneliness is lacking</a>, recent surveys have found <a href=\"https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look\">increases</a> in <a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/massive-meta-analysis-finds-loneliness-has-increased-in-emerging-adults-in-the-last-43-years/#google_vignette\">loneliness</a> that predate the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the answers to who loneliness afflicts — and the solutions to this complex social problem — are not nearly as straightforward as you might think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Loneliness is more than just isolation: It’s the subjective experience of craving more social interaction than you currently have. It isn’t binary, either, and no one is immune. Loneliness exists on a continuum, says <a href=\"https://julianneholtlunstad.byu.edu/julianne-holt-lunstad\">Julianne Holt-Lunstad</a>, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. Most people <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23744304/how-much-social-interaction-do-you-need-loneliness-burnout\">experience loneliness</a> at some point in their lives and labeling people as lonely can be stigmatizing. “It can make you feel bad about yourself, and then make you even less likely to want to socialize with others [out of] fear of rejection,” Holt-Lunstad says, “but it can also then influence how you perceive the world and social situations that can lead to a negative spiral.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chronic loneliness has severe negative physical and mental effects: Loneliness is just as much of a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316\">health risk factor</a> as smoking (one of Holt-Lunstad’s most publicized findings likened <a href=\"https://www.julianneholtlunstad.com/15-cigarettes\">lacking social connection to smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>) and alcohol consumption; it has <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.122.026493\">negative effects</a> on cardiovascular and brain health, and may be <a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-17435-4\">linked to</a> an increased risk of <a href=\"https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/loneliness-strongly-linked-depression-older-adults/\">depression</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rather than point to certain populations as explicitly lonely, understanding what increases someone’s risk for loneliness can help address it on a population level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No one is immune from loneliness</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Classic stereotypes of loneliness — like unmarried women or elderly people — fail to capture the myriad experiences contributing to loneliness. Life circumstances have a greater impact on loneliness than other demographic categories. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38687352/\">Studies</a> have <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fdev0000117\">found</a> levels of self-reported loneliness peak in early adulthood, fall in midlife, and rise again late in life. A 2024 American Psychiatric Association survey found that <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/new-apa-poll-one-in-three-americans-feels-lonely-e\">30 percent of Americans</a> aged 18 to 34 said they were lonely at least several times a week. The 2023 University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging found that <a href=\"https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/reports-more/report/trends-loneliness-among-older-adults-2018-2023\">37 percent of US adults</a> aged 50 to 80 reported a lack of companionship over the last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are substantial life changes during emerging adulthood and old age that account for higher levels of loneliness. As young adults graduate from college, move to new cities, begin their careers, and establish their lives, there is a natural culling of relationships, says <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/for-journalists/faculty-experts/expert/eileen-k-graham\">Eileen Graham</a>, an associate professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, who co-authored a recent study that found loneliness peaks in young adulthood and old age.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Most people experience loneliness at some point in their lives and labeling people as lonely can be stigmatizing</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Young adults are more likely to earn lower incomes; a 2023 Gallup poll also found those in households earning <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/473057/loneliness-subsides-pandemic-high.aspx\">less than $24,000 a year</a> said they were lonelier than those earning more. As these young people form adult friendships and romantic partnerships, get married, and start families, there are more opportunities for social contact. By retirement age, people’s social networks begin to wane again: children move out of the house, older adults lose touch with colleagues after they leave the workforce, chronic health conditions may limit one’s ability to leave the house, and loved ones die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02654075211059193\">Other research</a> has shown that infrequent contact with family, friends, and neighbors may lead to higher levels of loneliness in young adulthood and midlife. Having a local support network helped keep loneliness at bay for older adults.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although gender has perhaps gotten the most attention recently for its connection to loneliness, it’s not as straightforward an indicator as you might think when it comes to lack of social connection. In her study, Graham found women tend to report higher levels of loneliness than men. A 2021 Cigna and Morning Consult survey found that about the <a href=\"https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look\">same number of men and women</a> said they were lonely; a 2019 meta-analysis reported similar findings — that men and women report <a href=\"https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/135977571/EJP_Gender_Postprint_AAM.pdf\">equal levels of loneliness</a> throughout their lives. Following the pandemic, men experienced a greater dropoff in their friendship circles compared to women, with 15 percent reporting <a href=\"https://www.americansurveycenter.org/why-mens-social-circles-are-shrinking/\">having no close friends</a>, which may have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/18/health/male-loneliness-epidemic-wellness/index.html\">contributed to a narrative about a uniquely male loneliness crisis</a>. However, just because men may be physically isolated does not mean they are more lonely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, marital status is an imperfect predictor for a lack of satisfying social connections. While marriage has been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566023/\">linked with</a> a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10074686/\">lower risk of mortality</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19213848/\">married people can experience loneliness</a> when they do not receive emotional support from their spouse, a 2009 study found. Poor-quality romantic relationships can indeed be damaging to well-being, Holt-Lunstad says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Parenthood can also be an equally isolating stage of life. Nearly <a href=\"https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look\">two-thirds of parents and guardians</a> are considered lonely, compared to just over half of non-parents, according to the Cigna/Morning Consult survey. Single parents and mothers are more likely to be lonely, the survey found. <a href=\"https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/reports/loneliness-in-america\">Over half of mothers with young children</a> feel serious loneliness, per a 2021 Harvard report. However, the stage of the child’s life can impact parent loneliness. The newborn phase can be alienating for parents, while adult children may be a source of camaraderie and support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People who live alone do <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25663/social-isolation-and-loneliness-in-older-adults-opportunities-for-the\">tend to report</a> higher levels of loneliness, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr199.pdf\">research</a> shows. “But those same people are also tending to seek out other sources of social contact,” Graham says. “So just because you live alone, if you’re not married or you don’t have kids in the house, people often are looking to seek out social situations beyond what would be considered the traditional, baked-in sources of contact with other humans.” Alternatively, married people with kids and a rich social life are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/24006316/feeling-lonely-social-emotional-existential-loneliness-epidemic\">not immune to loneliness either</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Physical and mental health also contribute to feeling socially connected. Mental health conditions, like anxiety, substance abuse disorder, depression, and suicidal ideation <a href=\"https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1262-x\">have been</a> linked <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-019-01778-8\">to loneliness</a>. Regardless of age, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02654075211059193#bibr22-02654075211059193\">having a physical disability</a> is a risk factor for loneliness. “People who have a lot of functional limitations, making it difficult for them to get out of the house,” Graham says, “and people who have more chronic conditions, those also come with age, but we do find that all of those factors are related to being high in loneliness persistently.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Loneliness is a wake-up call, a signal to seek social interaction</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another major contributor to loneliness is social marginalization. The Cigna/Morning Consult poll found that 75 percent of Hispanic adults and 68 percent of Black adults <a href=\"https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look\">were considered lonely,</a> compared to 58 percent of the general adult population. Fewer Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults reported having a <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/mental-health/poll-finding/loneliness-and-social-support-networks-findings-from-the-kff-survey-of-racism-discrimination-and-health/#:~:text=The%20Prevalence%20of%20Loneliness&amp;text=Among%20adults%20of%20all%20ages,lonely%20in%20the%20past%20year.\">strong social support system</a> compared to white adults, per the 2023 KFF Racism, Discrimination and Health Survey. The survey also found that LGBT adults were about twice as likely to feel lonely compared to non-LGBT adults. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analysis found that over half of bisexual and transgender adults in 26 states <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7324a1.htm#contribAff\">reported feeling lonely</a>. “What the data suggests is that there is variability even among those classifications, in terms of sexual orientation and identity as well as race and ethnicity,” Holt-Lunstad says.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to address loneliness</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because loneliness can affect everyone, we shouldn’t look to eliminate the experience completely, Holt-Lunstad says. Loneliness is a wake-up call, a signal to seek social interaction. Without that alarm, we would wither in isolation. Paying attention to our social needs and identifying when we’re lacking in support and connection is the first step to addressing loneliness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once you recognize you’re feeling lonely, try to pinpoint <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/24006316/feeling-lonely-social-emotional-existential-loneliness-epidemic\">what form of social interaction you’re craving</a>: A heart-to-heart with a close friend? An evening mingling with acquaintances at a party? Maybe it’s just to observe strangers in a crowded bar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Research has found that people were happiest when they <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23744304/how-much-social-interaction-do-you-need-loneliness-burnout\">interacted with a variety of people</a>, from family members and best friends to coworkers and strangers. Make an effort to talk to as many different kinds of people as possible, Holt-Lunstad says. Other <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/28/1/zmac026/6825471\">research suggests </a>having a face-to-face, meaningful conversation with someone you love helps stave off loneliness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because everyone has different social needs — one person may need constant connection to not feel lonely while another is satisfied with a daily phone call with a friend — we need to support our loved ones whenever we can, Graham says. Whether it’s a neighbor who lives alone or a single parent, reach out to those who may be at highest risk for loneliness. “Knowing that there’s somebody there might be enough to mitigate any potential loneliness,” she says. “You have to know your people.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The bad news is that most experts think it’s a terrible idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The proposal in question is to abolish federal taxes on tips. Donald Trump originally <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/no-taxes-tips/678971/\">floated the idea</a> at a campaign rally in June, and it gained enough traction that “No tax on tips” signs started making regular appearances at Trump campaign events and the Republican National Convention. Now, even his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed the idea. “It is my promise to everyone here: When I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America, including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers,” she <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-supports-eliminating-federal-taxes-tips-rcna166124\">told a crowd</a> over the weekend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a series of social media posts, Trump accused Harris of stealing his idea, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112948746752564485\" rel=\"nofollow\">saying that</a> “she sounds more like Trump than Trump, copying almost everything.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the surface, exempting tips from being taxed might sound like a pro-worker proposal with populist appeal, potentially boosting take-home pay for service sector workers who rely on tips to make a living. But the policy doesn’t really hold up under any scrutiny. And that’s because at best, “no tax on tips” looks a lot less like a tax cut for low- and middle-income families, and a lot more like a subsidy for big businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m not at all saying that workers won’t get anything,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute. “But I think that a meaningful share of the [federal] expenditures on a tax exemption like this will go to the employers of tipped workers.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That might be why industry lobbyists have backed the proposal. “It’s not a surprise that the National Restaurant Association loves this,” Shierholz said, referring to <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/food/2022/02/national-restaurant-association-relief-revitalization-fund-pandemic-mcdonalds-subway-nra/\">the lobbying group that represents</a> many of the country’s major restaurant chains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At worst, the tax policy might even put a downward pressure on service sector wages by allowing employers to keep their workers’ baseline pay low because the tax cut could instead raise the workers’ take-home pay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think there is no question that it would” weigh wages down,&nbsp; Shierholz said. The only question, she says, is just how much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So while “no tax on tips” might make for a good sound bite or campaign slogan, it doesn’t necessarily translate to wise policymaking.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tipped workers don’t need a tax cut. They need a raise.</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem with tipped wages is not that they are taxed too heavily; it’s how little they tend to pay, and how much tipped workers have to rely on the kindness of strangers to make ends meet. In 2023, for example, the median annual wage for waiters was just below $32,000, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353031.htm\">according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/untipped-why-trumps-tax-cut-promise-would-hurt-many-service-workers\">as the Tax Policy Center put it</a>, eliminating income taxes on tips would do little, if anything, for many tipped workers whose earnings are so low that they are already exempt from paying federal income taxes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s very hard to dispute that the vast majority of moderate and low-wage workers are left out,” said Brendan Duke, senior director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress. “We know that <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/sen-ted-cruzs-no-tax-on-tips-act-does-little-for-low-and-moderate-wage-workers-but-opens-door-to-tax-abuse-by-wealthy/\">95 percent of low- and moderate-wage workers</a> don’t get tips, and only about a third of those tipped workers pay income taxes and would benefit from this.” (Duke was specifically talking about <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/sen-ted-cruzs-no-tax-on-tips-act-does-little-for-low-and-moderate-wage-workers-but-opens-door-to-tax-abuse-by-wealthy/\">Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s proposed legislation</a> on this issue.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the reason that tipped workers are paid so poorly is that the federal government only guarantees them a <a href=\"https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/flsa/002.htm?_ga=2.203883920.166662675.1723482644-1762443955.1723482644\">subminimum wage of $2.13 per hour</a>. If along with tips, a worker’s earnings are still below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, then employers have to make up the difference. (Many states and municipalities have wage requirements above the federal minimum, but those <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped\">also often include carve-outs</a> with lower hourly minimums for tipped workers.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why a handful of states have <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/donald-trump-proposal-no-tax-tips/\">abolished the subminimum wage</a> for tipped workers altogether. Because by allowing employers to pay tipped workers less, businesses essentially pass their payroll burden directly onto their customers. And while most Americans are used to paying tips, those who don’t — or those who at least threaten to not tip — create a hostile environment for workers and make it harder for employees to make a fair wage. Some <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/a/case-against-tipping\">studies have also shown</a> that tipped wages encourage workers to discriminate against people of color, providing them with worse service because of racist stereotypes about who is more likely to leave a generous tip.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Eliminating taxes on tips is a handout for businesses, not workers</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the biggest concerns about doing away with federal taxes on tips is that it would discourage businesses from offering more competitive wages. That’s because if workers’ take-home pay increases because of a tax cut, employers wouldn’t need to provide tipped workers a higher base-line wage. In effect, it’s a tax cut that might mostly subsidize businesses’ payroll costs, not workers’ cost of living.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It will reduce employers’ needs to raise wages,” Shierholz, of the Economic Policy Institute, said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also the fact that creating a tax carveout for tipped employees could create a major loophole for employers looking to pay people less. Some sectors, for example, can simply become part of the tipped economy, making more of their workers rely on tips rather than a minimum wage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The policy would “incentivize employers to have more workers be in tipped occupations,” Shierholz said. “[Employers] could reduce the base wages they pay their workers under the guise of doing something for the workers. They could say, ‘We’re making you tipped because you won’t have to pay taxes’ and then in the fine print, it’s like, ‘Oh also, you’re going to be making $2.13 an hour in base wages.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why pursuing other policies, like abolishing the subminimum wage, would do much more to increase workers’ pay than eliminating taxes on tips would. The poverty rate for tipped workers in states without a subminimum wage, for example, <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/ending-tipped-minimum-wage-will-reduce-poverty-inequality/\">is lower than that in states</a> with a subminimum wage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you really want to help tipped workers, there are other ways that are far, far better,” Shierholz said, adding that federal dollars would be better directed toward programs like the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Tax Credit, which would be much better at targeting workers who need it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So if politicians are looking to tout a pro-worker agenda, they should point to policies that can actually raise people’s wages, as Harris did by also endorsing raising the minimum wage. Otherwise, they might just be pushing for yet another tax cut for the rich. After all, that might be why <a href=\"https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-colleagues-introduce-no-tax-on-tips-act\">major business lobbying groups</a> have endorsed “no tax on tips” — to avoid actually raising workers’ wages.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

JD Vance boards his airplane on August 1, 2024 in Sierra Vista, Arizona. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you look at what the right’s rising leaders are saying, it’s clear that conservatives have become increasingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/363543/pronatalism-vance-birth-rates-population-decline-fertility\">obsessed with the fate of the American family</a>. From Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance assailing “<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/dear-j-d-vance-childless-cat-ladies-are-people-too.html\">childless cat ladies</a>” to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-elon-musk-population-collapse-baby-push/#:~:text=In%202022%20he%20tweeted%20that,a%20bang%20or%20a%20whimper%3F\">Elon Musk fretting about a birth rate apocalypse</a>, there is a deep and abiding sense that the family is in dire need of defense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recently, a loose group of conservatives has emerged with a solution: that the family can be defended by boldly reasserting the importance of old-school gender roles. The movement tells men to be strong and women to have babies without overtly insisting that women must submit to their husbands or stay at home. It’s an effort to revive an older model of gender relations without the explicitly sexist baggage (though it often resurfaces in a more subtle form).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I call this loose movement “neopatriarchy,” and have come to believe that it is at the root of both some of the modern right’s biggest ideas and its most interesting internal conflicts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Concerns about the family’s health are hardly new on the right. Speaking in 1977, <a href=\"https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-little-platoon-we-belong-to-in-society-november-1977/\">influential conservative writer Russell Kirk</a> claimed that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/497850292\">a nearly enacted universal daycare bill</a> threatened to disintegrate the family and substitute the state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We would be foolish to ignore a drift in what we call ‘the West’ toward the supplanting of the family by the Universal Orphanage,” Kirk said, warning that the daycare bill specifically “would have encouraged even affluent mothers to consign their little children to the baby-bin and spend their days at bridge-clubs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kirk’s fears reflected the central conservative preoccupation of the time: the threat from communism and the ever-growing powers of the modern state. It was “compulsory collectivism,” for Kirk, that threatened to tear familial bonds apart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Modern neopatriarchy begins from the opposite fear; the concern is not communist collectivism, but liberal individualism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The neopatriarchs believe we live in an age where people prioritize self-actualization and fulfillment above all else. Young adults, they argue, live in extended adolescence, lost in some combination of video games, drugs, and casual sex; as they age, raw hedonism is replaced by single-minded foci on money and career. According to neopatriarchs, this liberal social model fails men and women alike, funneling them toward a spiritually empty existence that all but guarantees disappointment and depression, and it fails society by discouraging the production of children who are quite literally required if the country is to have a future. (Immigration, needless to say, is not seen as an acceptable solution.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The solution, for neopatriarchs, is to return to the past. Men need to rediscover the old John Wayne vision of masculinity, making traditional male gender markers (including acting as fatherly provider) into defining aspects of their identity. The state should play a role in encouraging this reversion, primarily by changing policy to cultivate “masculine” virtues and incentivizing marriage and child-rearing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his recent book <em>Manhood</em>, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/05/18/manhood-josh-hawley-review/\">urges men</a> to embrace strength and stoicism as routes for self-improvement, calling on them to take on the roles of “warrior” and “builder” in their everyday lives. The psychologist Jordan Peterson has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jordan-peterson-is-on-a-crusade-to-toughen-up-young-men-its-landed-him-on-our-cultural-divide/2018/05/02/c5bafe48-31d6-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html\">long dispensed similar advice</a>, helping turn him into a conservative guru. In his forthcoming book <em>Dawn’s Early Light</em>, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts argues that <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/kevin-roberts/forthcoming-book-heritage-president-rails-against-birth-control-ivf-abortion\">contraceptive technologies</a> “break the most basic functioning elements of civilization” by liberating individuals to have consequence-free sex out of wedlock. Vance, who wrote the forward to Roberts’s book, has mused about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/08/04/no-fault-divorce-jd-vance-women/\">eliminating no-fault divorce</a> for similar neopatriarchal reasons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neopatriarchy can be distinguished from straight-up patriarchy primarily through its treatment of women. Unlike some Christian fundamentalists or <a href=\"https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2023/02/what-is-the-longhouse\">alt-right scribblers</a>, neopatriarchs do not assert that women are <em>obligated</em> to be homemakers as a result of divine commandment or natural law. All they insist on explicitly is that women have lots of children, and that choosing to focus primarily on raising said children is <em>no worse</em> than having a career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s obvious why liberals and leftists would have problems taking this seriously. If Americans are supposed to be having more kids, and American men are supposed to be more traditionally masculine, then who’s supposed to be doing the work of raising all of these kids? The answer, of course, is wives (as it’s certainly not immigrants). Neopatrarichy may not explicitly call for a reversal of the feminist revolution, but that’s basically what it’s going for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, neopatriarchal writing rarely floats the idea that more men should be homemakers&nbsp;— and <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/are-stay-at-home-mothers-really-miserable\">often suggests</a> that women are <a href=\"https://x.com/BradWilcoxIFS/status/1673843339471233024\">happier at home</a>. The choice to work is theoretically left up to women, but the traditional option is at the very least suggested. The neopatriarchal vision for women is thus most clearly expressed through popular “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/us/tradwife-1950s-nostalgia-tiktok-cec/index.html\">tradwife</a>” and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23960702/big-family-ballerina-farm-hannah-neeleman-dougherty-dozen-instagram-tiktok-influencers\">big-family</a> TikTok influencers: women who became social media evangelists for a family-first lifestyle, occasionally giving up formal careers in order to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s not just feminists who have problems with neopatriarchy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a class of conservatives, mostly men, who despise the left primarily because it tells them what to do: that it’s offensive to ogle women or use male pronouns for a transgender woman. This group, famously termed “<a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/964006/rise-barstool-conservatives\">Barstool conservatives</a>” after the bro-y Barstool Sports website, enjoys partying and casual sex&nbsp;— and resents people telling them to knock it off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This has led to some real skepticism about neopatriarchal ideas. When Vance’s comments calling for non-parents to pay a higher tax rate came to light, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy called Vance a “<a href=\"https://x.com/stoolpresidente/status/1816933121884856689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1816933121884856689%7Ctwgr%5Eee54b39f9b04128b26d92126a1259d3808bd4af8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fpolitics%2Fjd-vance-slaps-back-at-dave-portnoy-after-barstool-founder-says-trumps-vp-sounds-like-a-moron%2F\">moron</a>” in a post on Twitter/X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You want me to pay more taxes to take care of other people’s kids? We sure this dude is a Republican?” Portnoy asked. “If you can’t afford a big family don’t have a ton of kids.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Republicans out of the White House, these divisions have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/10/24024341/calendargate-conservative-civil-war\">largely</a> been confined to posting wars. But should Trump retake the presidency, his administration would likely include prominent neopatriarchical voices —&nbsp;including Vance himself. That would launch a high-stakes national debate over an issue some may have thought settled: whether the state should favor families with traditional gender roles.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The FBI is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-it-is-investigating-hack-trump-campaign-blamed-iran-2024-08-12/\">reportedly looking into the matter</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s what we know for sure: <a href=\"https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/5bc57431-a7a9-49ad-944d-b93b7d35d0fc.pdf\">In a report released last Friday, Microsoft</a> claimed it caught a group with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) using a “compromised email account” to try to gain access to the system of a “high-ranking official of a presidential campaign.” The company did not name the presidential campaign and did not elaborate on whether the attempt was successful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/10/trump-campaign-hack-00173503\">Politico</a> published a report that detailed documents it received from a mysterious AOL email address from someone going by the name Robert. The materials seemed to be from the Trump campaign, and included a draft of what appeared to be the vetting profiles of potential vice presidential pick Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and the campaign’s actual pick, Ohio <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">Sen. JD Vance</a>. Sunday, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/us/politics/trump-campaign-hacking-iran.html\">New York Times said</a> it had received what appeared to be the same documents, from a person claiming to also be the Politico source.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shortly after Politico published its Saturday piece, the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/10/trump-campaign-hack-00173503\">gave Politico a statement</a> claiming “foreign sources hostile to the United States” stole the documents from them; the statement went on to suggest that Iran was behind the outreach to Politico. Former President Donald Trump then made that suggestion explicit Saturday night, writing on <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112941157610530127\" rel=\"nofollow\">Truth Social</a>, “We were just informed by Microsoft Corporation that one of our many websites was hacked by the Iranian Government &#8211; Never a nice thing to do!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Monday, the FBI announced it is investigating Trump’s claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A great deal of uncertainty remains around the supposed hack, and foreign efforts to meddle in the 2024 elections. But here are some other key things to know.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What do we know about Iranian hackers and the Trump campaign?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the Trump campaign is explicitly stating that it was the target of an Iranian attack, Microsoft has yet to be so blunt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the Microsoft report, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has been operating a wide-scale hacking campaign involving at least four groups — Cotton Sandstorm, Lemon Sandstorm, Mint Sandstorm, and Peach Sandstorm — over the past few election cycles. Microsoft says its <a href=\"https://www.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/624967260377296#:~:text=The%20Microsoft%20Threat%20Analysis%20Center,Microsoft%20and%20its%20customers%20globally.\">Microsoft Threat Analysis Center</a>, a department tasked with protecting both the company and its user base from cybercrimes, noticed that someone “sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Spear phishing is when a hacker or hacking group tries to gain access to a specific individual or organization’s digital space by placing a malicious link in a message, that when the recipient clicks through, can install malware on a machine that allows hackers access to information it contains. Microsoft said in a <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/08/08/iran-targeting-2024-us-election/\">blog post</a> that it has “notified those targeted” in the spear phishing attempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the MTAC report isn’t explicit about the success of Mint Sandstorm’s spear phishing attempt, it does outline other ways the IRGC appears to be planning to influence the election, including by setting up fake news sites that contain polarizing content about the Israel-Hamas conflict and LGBTQ rights, as well as the presidential candidates themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Iran is behind the phishing attempt, and if the country did share documents with US journalists, that could suggest an effort to sway voters away from Trump. The former president has claimed his Iranian policy to be better, and harsher, than that of Democrats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His first administration did practice “maximum pressure” on the Islamic Republic. And he ordered the assassination of IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020, which was both a practical and ideological blow to Iran. Soleimani was a revered figure in the country and a central force behind external groups affiliated with the regime, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also nixed a 2015 nuclear deal which would have, among other things, eased sanctions in return for greater international oversight over and the winding down of Iran’s nuclear weapons development program.

Chiles, who won gold with the US team in Paris, placed third in the floor event finals on August 5 — what feels like eons ago in Olympic time. But this past Saturday, on the eve of the final day of the Games, the International Olympic Committee asked Chiles to give back her bronze, giving it to runner-up Romanian Ana Barbosu.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Olympic officials asking an athlete to give their medal back is an uncommon occurrence, but what makes Chiles’s case even more bizarre is that it’s largely the judges’ fault. Chiles was initially underscored, then scored properly, and then told nearly a week later that her correct score shouldn’t count because her coaches didn’t catch the error within one minute. That’s the simple reason why her medal is now being taken away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This kerfuffle isn’t going to do any favors for the credibility of gymnastics, a sport that’s already scored subjectively. The fact that Team USA is appealing the decision will only draw out this negative press. Unfortunately for Chiles, she’s now caught in a crossfire that’s become much nastier and uglier as this bronze medal saga unfolds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The current status of Jordan Chiles’s bronze medal</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s one thing to understand about Chiles’s bronze medal saga, it’s that it has barely anything to do with the level of gymnastics Chiles or her competitors performed at the floor event finals last week. Chiles’s powerful tumbling passes, landings, and leaps on the apparatus are all secondary to the technicalities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the event finals for floor, Chiles was originally given a score of 13.666. Team USA and Chiles’s coach, Cecile Landi, filed an inquiry with a judging panel arguing that they had incorrectly scored the routine and didn’t give Chiles credit for a split leap called a “<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymnastics/comments/1el9o6t/someone_explain_to_this_amateur_a_gogean_v_tour/\">tour jete full</a>.” The judges reviewed and agreed with that inquiry, and upped <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAvrnZdw1sE\">Chiles’s score to 13.766</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 13.766 was high enough to get Chiles a bronze, pushing Romanians Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea off the podium (both gymnasts scored 13.700, but Barbosu won the tiebreaker).&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2164952116.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Jordan Chiles during the women’s floor exercise final on August 5. | Daniela Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Daniela Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Romanian team fielded multiple inquiries, including one about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40767718/romania-appeals-sabrina-maneca-voinea-floor-exercise-score\">Maneca-Voinea’s score</a>, the major dispute that triggered this medal debacle is about the<a href=\"https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Media_Release_ParisOG_15-16.pdf\"> timing of Team USA’s scoring inquiry</a>. The official rules state that Landi’s inquiry of Chiles’s score had to be filed within one minute of her score. Romania argued that Landi made the inquiry one minute and four seconds after getting Chiles’s score. Those four seconds, Romania argued, put the US over the time limit and should have nullified Chiles’s new score.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in Romania’s favor. <a href=\"https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?urlNews=4268100\">Officially and as of this moment</a>, Barbosu’s score of 13.700 is credited as the third-place bronze medal finish and Chiles’s score has been pushed back down to 13.666. To reflect the ruling, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ordered Chiles to return her bronze medal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In response to the IOC’s ruling, Team USA announced that it had submitted additional evidence to the CAS that the inquiry was filed within the time limit — not once, but twice. “The time-stamped, video evidence submitted by USA Gymnastics Sunday evening shows Landi first stated her request to file an inquiry at the inquiry table 47 seconds after the score was posted, followed by a second statement 55 seconds after the score was originally posted,” the federation <a href=\"https://x.com/USAGym/status/1822724122951991331\">said in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Monday, USA Gymnastics said in a statement that it was notified by the CAS that its “rules do not allow for an arbitral award to be reconsidered even when conclusive new evidence is presented.” USA Gymnastics said it would continue to pursue additional avenues for an award for Chiles. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The latest on Jordan Chiles: “USA Gymnastics was notified by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Monday that their rules do not allow for an arbitral award to be reconsidered even when conclusive new evidence is presented.” <a href=\"https://t.co/xa8noSiraz\">pic.twitter.com/xa8noSiraz</a></p>&mdash; philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1823103007598223634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s worth remembering that the fundamental flaw in Chiles’s score is a judge’s error, an error that judges admitted to. Chiles’s correct score is Chiles’s correct score. Gymnastics isn’t track and field and scores aren’t determined by clock, but there are set criteria — including the execution of included moves — that need to be evaluated in a final score. Arguing that it took four seconds too long to fix an error that the judges themselves actually introduced feels more at home in some kind of retail customer service death spiral than an allegedly prestigious Olympic sport where judges and official timekeepers should be able to follow the predetermined protocol.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">People can’t stop being racist toward Jordan Chiles&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This mess, of course, doesn’t happen in a bubble.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, this medal kerfuffle undoes an Olympic milestone: Chiles, her teammate Simone Biles, and Brazil’s Rebecca Andrade were the first all-Black podium in the games’ history. While that was a triumph for many and seen as <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gymnast-jordan-chiles-talks-bronze-medal-all-black-podium\">growth for the sport</a>, it’s not exactly a coincidence that <a href=\"https://x.com/daily_romania/status/1822300075273367600\">racists</a> and far-right personalities have latched onto the story of the rescinded bronze.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like many sports, gymnastics itself has a thorny history of racism and treatment of Black athletes. It wasn’t too long ago that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22575301/simone-biles-olympics-scoring-explained-gymnastics-yurchenko-double-pike\">Biles faced racist attacks</a>, ranging from belittling her skills to coded talk about how the multiple gold medal winner made the sport less elegant with her power. Black female <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8189679/serena-williams-indian-wells-racism\">athletes like Serena Williams</a> have also faced similar discrimination in their sports.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The aforementioned right-wing personalities and racists<strong> </strong>are now peddling narratives about how the Olympics cheated white gymnasts out of medals, or saying that Black athletes like Chiles are cheaters themselves. Pundit Matt Walsh <a href=\"https://x.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1821369204827709948\">called</a> the 2024 games “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNzMU7CH3k\">the DEI Olympics</a>.” It didn’t take long for those sentiments to metastasize into disgusting behavior, as racists began personally attacking Chiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid the medal returning saga, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jordan-chiles-olympics-social-media-b2594527.html\">Jordan said</a> she was taking a break from social media. Chiles’s mom Gina posted on Twitter that her daughter was receiving racist attacks:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The racist disgusting comments are still happening in 2024. I&#039;m tired of people who say it no longer exists. My daughter is a highly decorated Olympian with the biggest heart and a level of sportsmanship that is unmatched&#8230;and she&#039;s being called disgusting things.</p>&mdash; Gina Chiles (@gina_chiles) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gina_chiles/status/1822021561928364090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 9, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Seeing Chiles receive these attacks and have to shut down her public accounts is just depressingly bleak. Medal or no medal, Chiles’s Olympics — a once-in-a-lifetime experience, twice if you’re as fit and skilled as Chiles — will be marred by the racism and bigotry she faced following the judges’ mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All Jordan Chiles did was compete, and she did so under the impression that she would be judged fairly. The people running Olympic gymnastics didn’t allow her that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, August 12, 2024, at 5:20 pm ET:</strong> This story was published on August 12 and has been updated with news that the CAS will not be entertaining Team USA’s appeal.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

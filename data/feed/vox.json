Taylor Swift in concert at the Eras tour in London, August 15, 2024. | Kate Green/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taylor Swift, always noted for her flair for dramatic timing, finally endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race Tuesday night.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moments after the first debate between Harris and former President Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/\">Swift posted her endorsement to Instagram</a>, with a picture of herself posing with her now almost-equally famous cat. Meanwhile, Harris walked off the stage at her post-debate party with Swift’s feminist anthem “The Man” blaring. The entire endorsement was a carefully choreographed move coming after nearly a year of speculation, disappointment, and paranoia from political onlookers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” Swift wrote, urging her followers to do their own research and make their own choices. She signed off with what appeared to be a jab at VP nominee Sen. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/364369/trump-kamala-not-black-indian-vance-childless-cat-ladies\">JD Vance’s infamous “cat lady”</a> sound bite: “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the post, Swift unambiguously states that she’s voting for Harris and her running mate Gov. Tim Walz because of their support for such feminist issues as “LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body.” At the same time, she makes space for potentially millions of fans who might not feel the same way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most,” Swift writes. “As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her endorsement drew jubilation among some quarters, as well as vitriol in others. Elon Musk had perhaps the most bizarre and off-putting response. “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life,” <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1833728804579111268\">Musk wrote on X</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Onlookers have been breathlessly speculating about whether and when Swift will weigh in on this election all year. In January, after Swift began her much-publicized <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/25/23889682/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-date-nfl-chiefs-game\">romance with NFL star Travis Kelce</a>, conservatives theorized that Swift was a deep-state psyop. The idea was that her relationship with Kelce was a ploy to juice her popularity so that her eventual endorsement of Joe Biden, then the Democratic nominee, would be all the more impactful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same month, the New York Times reported that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/29/us/politics/biden-trump-election-taylor-swift.html\">the Biden campaign was actively courting Swift’s endorsement</a>, and that she was their “biggest and most influential” target. “Fund-raising appeals from Ms. Swift could be worth millions of dollars for Mr. Biden,” the Times noted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, predictably, was incensed at the very idea. “There&#8217;s no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/11/1230747538/donald-trump-taylor-swift-biden-endorsement-disloyal\">he posted on Truth Social in February</a>, apparently referring to his role in signing the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/11/17965690/music-modernization-act-copyright-law-licensing-streaming\">Music Modernization Act</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Reading the tea leaves of a possible Swift endorsement became a fever-pitched and chaotic guessing game in the months following</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Harris became the Democratic nominee in July, she received <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/kamala-harris-celebrity-endorsements-cardi-b-charli-xcx-barbra-streisand-1235065132/\">a slew of celebrity endorsements</a> from the likes of Charli XCX, Megan Thee Stallion, and Cardi B. Even Beyoncé gave Harris permission to use her song “Freedom” in campaign ads, a de facto endorsement from one of the most powerfully elusive figures in pop culture. Reading the tea leaves of a possible Swift endorsement became a fever-pitched and chaotic guessing game in the months following.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In August, rumors flew over one of Swift’s Instagram posts, in which Swift was pictured on stage at one of her concerts next to the silhouette of a strong-shouldered woman. To some observers, it looked as though <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-silhouette-instagram-endorse-walz-election-1235968005/\">Swift had photoshopped Harris’s</a> shadow into the frame as an easter egg to let the sharp-eyed know her endorsement would be forthcoming. She hadn’t: The woman was one of her backup dancers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some Swift fans cautioned patience. On the occasions when Swift has made political endorsements in the past, she’s usually done so relatively late in the race. In 2016, she didn’t endorse at all. In 2018, she got politically involved for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/07/taylor-swift-endorses-democrats-bredesen-cooper-in-instagram-post.html\">endorsing Democrats</a> Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper for Congress on October 7, two days before the voter registration deadline in Tennessee. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/taylor-swift-endorses-joe-biden-president-n1242483\">Swift similarly endorsed Joe Biden on October 7</a>. Expecting an endorsement in August, her fans said, was too early for her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, as the months wore on, there was a growing outcry among some of her fans. Trump shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/24/trump-taylor-swift-deepfakes-ai\">a series of AI-generated images</a> falsely claiming Swift had endorsed him, but Swift said nothing. Her new friend Brittany Mahomes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/369543/brittany-mahomes-likes-trump-instagram\">went public with her support</a> of Trump, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniesoteriou/taylor-swift-embrace-trump-supporter-brittany-mahomes\">but Swift publicly embraced her</a> at the highly photographed US Open shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_qsMcbyHeT/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_qsMcbyHeT/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_qsMcbyHeT/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by ExtraTV (@extratv)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fervor with which people have speculated about what Swift would do is striking, considering that celebrity political endorsements appear to be a mixed bag with relatively narrow effects. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/365865/celebrity-endorsements-kamala-harris-megan-thee-stallion\">As Li Zhou has reported for Vox</a>, celebrities can be good at getting people to pay attention to a race, or at heightening excitement about a candidate that people are already interested in, but they’re not necessarily good at changing people’s minds across party lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You might be more likely to tune into the DNC if you think <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/368466/dnc-beyonce-taylor-swift-rumors-reports\">Swift or Beyoncé is going to show up</a>, but there’s little evidence that their presence could turn you from an undecided voter into a committed Harris supporter. At best, celebrity endorsements might convince some otherwise unenthusiastic people at the margins to turn out and vote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At worst, there’s some evidence that the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/election-celebrities-trump-clinton-endorsements-beyonce-springsteen-david-jackson-bowling-green/507383/\">plethora of celebrity endorsements for Hillary Clinton</a> in 2016 hurt her rather than helped her, strengthening the sense that she was a candidate for the liberal elite. That’s the reason Swift said she <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/8/20791816/taylor-swift-hillary-clinton-2016-endorsement-vogue-september-issue\">decided not to endorse Clinton</a>. “​Unfortunately in the 2016 election you had a political opponent who was weaponizing the idea of the celebrity endorsement,” <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019\">Swift told Vogue in 2019</a>. “He was going around saying, <em>I’m a man of the people. I’m for you. I care about you.</em> I just knew I wasn’t going to help.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift’s previous political actions have generally followed the pattern you would expect from the data: good for overall political engagement, less good for any one political candidate. She’s great at getting people to register to vote. Last year, a single Instagram story from her led to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/09/22/1201183160/taylor-swift-instagram-voter-registration\">23 percent increase in voter registration</a>. In 2018, a similar Instagram post <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/10/17957190/taylor-swift-voter-registration-october-spike\">led to 65,000 new registrations </a>in 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift seems to know her strength here. Tuesday’s Instagram post endorsing Harris included a reminder to her fans to make sure they’re registered to vote, and an Instagram story linked fans to vote.gov.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, even after Swift’s endorsement, <a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/07/taylor-swift-bredesen-endorsement-tennessee-senate-race-political-post/1918440002/\">Phil Bredesen handily lost his 2018 campaign</a> for the Senate in Tennessee. Swift may have moved the needle for him, but not enough to get a Democratic senator elected in a red state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 2024 presidential election is projected to be much closer. “Biden’s electoral vote majority was a function of fewer than 50,000 votes in three states four years ago,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/12/is-taylor-swift-finally-big-enough-affect-election/\">pointed out the Washington Post in August</a>. “Getting a small segment of the massive Taylor Swift fan base to vote that otherwise wouldn’t? Hard to dismiss the idea that it could tip the balance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, given the mixed track record, it’s fair to ask why people are so worked up about Swift’s political endorsements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are basically two factors at play behind this fascination. The first is her image. The second is her stature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift has played with pop feminism through much of her career. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-and-the-bran_b_11101662\">In 2014 she declared that she identified as a feminist</a> and positioned her <em>1989</em> tour, girl squad and all, as a feminist act. When she was mocked at the Golden Globes, <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/taylor-swift-golden-globes-tina-fey-joke-career-1851152564\">she declared the jokes anti-feminist</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/3/21/21189239/taylor-swift-kanye-west-famous-leaked-phone-call-kanye-west-is-over-party\">After her public downfall in 2016</a>, Swift rehabilitated her image in part by leaning into politics. Her 2020 documentary <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/28/21095321/miss-americana-taylor-swift-documentary-interview-lana-wilson-netflix-sundance\"><em>Miss Americana</em></a> features a scene in which Swift weeps while begging her father and management team to get on board with her endorsing Democrats for Congress. “I need to be on the right side of history!” she cries. Shortly after that encounter, she released her song “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/27/21155844/taylor-swift-the-man-video\">The Man</a>,” in which she argues that she comes in for public criticism because of her gender.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That led many of Swift’s fans to expect her to walk the walk. The price of starting so many sentences with “As a woman in this industry,” they argue, is that you also have to say something when the known <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/23696250/e-jean-carroll-trump-trial-sexual-misconduct-rape-allegations\">sexual abuser</a> who ended <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is running for president against a woman who’s campaigning <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/368489/kamala-harris-dnc-speech-takeaways-analysis\">on a platform of reproductive rights</a>. Swift’s continued silence, even after Trump used AI to speak for her, had those fans worried.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>With this new endorsement, Swift can assure her fans she’s still got her feminist cred, even as she’s phrased it carefully to give her more Trump-leaning fans room for plausible deniability</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Given … how much mileage Swift got in the past out of her decision to speak out on politics, the idea that she will remain silent would seem to make her past speaking out, at a more convenient moment, appear cynical,” <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/opinion/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-1236138123/\">wrote Daniel D’Addario for Variety earlier this week</a>. “It’d be regrettable if her engagement with the world of politics were just another of her eras, and one from which she were willing to move on.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With this new endorsement, Swift can assure her fans she’s still got her feminist cred, even as she’s phrased it carefully to give her more Trump-leaning fans room for plausible deniability. She’s successfully beaten back charges of hypocrisy and bandwagon feminism, and her star can continue to shine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bigger reason so many are so concerned with Swift’s endorsement, however, is her singular&nbsp;stature in the pop culture landscape. Taylor Swift has been a huge star for years, but with the success of the Eras tour, she’s ascended to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23905279/taylor-swift-eras-concert-film-image-analysis\">a new level of superstardom and cultural saturation</a>. Political onlookers seem to think Swift has become so powerful that there’s a chance her say-so might actually swing the needle in a meaningful direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swift probably won’t change the minds of many people, because no celebrity can do that. But celebrities are good at activating voters on the margins, and Swift’s reach is broad enough at this point that her impact there could make a real difference come November.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just the possibility that she might seems to be threatening to some on the right: see Musk’s response offering to “give [Swift] a child.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s ostensibly responding to Swift calling herself a “childless cat lady.” But there’s a crude implied threat in his offer, too: <em>let me knock you up so you stop talking</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an election cycle <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/366601/the-rights-plan-to-fix-america-patriarchy-2-0\">laced with misogynistic rhetoric</a>, Swift’s cautious, carefully phrased endorsement was enough to make her a target of threats from one of the richest men in the world. Musk’s post is a tell that even Swift’s most measured political speech can be a threat to a political movement arrayed against women having control of their bodies and voices — and Swift’s voice is much louder than most. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, September 12, 10:45 am: </strong>This story, originally published September 11, incorrectly dated a Washington Post article; it was from August 2024</em>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s a question I’ve gotten in many forms since I started this newsletter, from the reader who asked if kids are still learning “Ring Around the Rosie” to the dad who wondered if it’s possible to give kids independence in a sometimes unsafe world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such concerns aren’t unwarranted. Research shows that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23759898/kids-children-parenting-play-anxiety-mental-health\">kids’ unstructured playtime</a> has declined significantly since the 1980s, as fears of kidnapping, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23496462/crisis-american-roads-pedestrian-traffic-deaths-safety\">traffic accidents</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/07/health/guns-death-us-children-teens-dg/index.html\">violence</a> have made parents more wary about letting their kids play outside on their own. Studies in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8037806/\">US, UK, and Europe</a> have found a decrease in children’s outdoor play in recent decades, along with an <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/kids-screen-time-rose-during-the-pandemic-and-stayed-high-thats-a-problem/2023/02\">increase in screen time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s true that smartphones and tablets have, at least to some degree, replaced physical games with digital ones. As any parent of a young child can tell you, “technology has changed the way kids play,” Ruslan Slutsky, an education professor at the University of Toledo who studies play, told me. On the one hand, kids can now play video games with people all around the world. On the other, “there’s been a big disappearance in general neighborhood play,” Slutsky said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Growing up in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, in the 1950s, University of Delaware<strong> </strong>education professor Roberta Golinkoff used to play outside for hours on end, with no adult supervision in sight and technology no more advanced than an old rubber ball. “That rubber ball can play a thousand games,” says Golinkoff, who has studied children’s play for decades. “Childhood is so different now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Replacing physical play with phones and iPads can be bad for kids’ gross motor skills and social development, including their ability to read faces, Slutsky said. Free, unstructured play is also necessary for developing cognitive abilities such as self-control, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23759898/kids-children-parenting-play-anxiety-mental-health\">experts say</a>. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/31/1209763238/how-lack-of-independent-play-is-impacting-childrens-mental-health\">Some even believe</a> that the rise in anxiety and depression among young people in recent years can be linked to decreased play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, I’ve also heard from experts, parents, and kids alike that kids do still play, and that the creativity that has turned rubber balls into hot potatoes and shot puts and cannon fire since time immemorial is alive and well in children today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But they need help from adults to make their neighborhoods safe for playing — and to give them the time for unstructured fun.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why play is different now</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids’ play started to change in the 1980s, many experts say, after <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23759898/kids-children-parenting-play-anxiety-mental-health\">a series of high-profile kidnapping cases</a>, including the disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz. These cases didn’t actually represent a spike in stranger kidnappings, which remain relatively rare today. But headlines about children snatched off the streets — alongside a short-lived but impactful campaign that placed some of their photos on <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2017/09/04/missing-kids-milk-carton-campaign-outcome/627165001/\">the backs of milk cartons</a> — struck fear in the hearts of American parents, who started keeping their kids indoors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, parents and educators became concerned about kids’ academic performance, as <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-education-in-the-1980s-a-concern-for-quality/1990/01\">a number of studies</a> showed American students lagging behind their counterparts around the world. School years began to get longer, making summer break shorter. Recess, too, began to dwindle, with school districts in Atlanta, Chicago, and elsewhere <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/recess-is-good-for-kids-why-dont-more-states-require-it/\">eliminating it entirely</a> in hopes of boosting test scores. Kids in the 1990s and 2000s simply had less free time to play than their elders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then came the smartphone. iPhones and iPads have taken a lot of blame for <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/\">ruining American childhood</a>, and in some cases, the evidence is weak — there’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24105235/phones-kids-schools-ban-yondr-pouch-smartphones\">no research</a>, for example, definitively showing that social media hurts kids’ mental health. But phones and tablets have crowded out some more analog forms of fun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In our research, we found that kids were spending a lot less time outside,” Slutsky said. “They were spending a lot less time in traditional forms of play because they were playing with devices.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How kids play today</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Play on devices isn’t all bad. Children can use them to learn more about special interests, such as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23641271/beginners-guide-bird-watching-birding\">birding</a>, Golinkoff said. (As a longtime birder, I can attest to the value of <a href=\"https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/\">Merlin</a>.) Meanwhile, one Norwegian researcher (and former preschool teacher) <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-03-kids-screen-creative.html\">has found</a> that young children can continue online play in the real world — using Minecraft concepts to play with blocks, for example — and take small risks in online environments that mirror the kind of unpredictable play that experts say is crucial for development. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/chso.12756\">Some research</a> also shows that children’s play was resilient during the pandemic, with kids enjoying drawing and other activities that were available to them — purchases of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/01/coronavirus-social-distancing-outdoor-toys-bounce-houses-sales-jump/2927397001/\">outdoor toys</a> like trampolines and bounce houses also rose during this time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite larger shifts in kids’ free time and independence, they also retain their ingenuity, as well as their willingness to play the kind of active games that would be recognizable to their elders. “I have a three-year-old boy who seems to have learned about tag, hide and seek, and even ring around the rosie with almost no input from us parents,” one reader wrote to me. “I’m still not sure he gets the rules of any of them, but all three practices are alive and well here in Kansas.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(My 2-year-old also likes to play “Ring Around the Rosie,” though he does not understand dizziness and sometimes walks into walls afterward.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Flower, age 8, told me that she recently invented a game called “steamroller.”&nbsp; “Somebody lays down and rolls around,” she said, and then other players “try to dodge the person rolling. It’s really fun.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She and her friends at school also enjoy a game they call “tag off the ground” — players are&nbsp;safe from tagging as long as their feet don’t touch the playground. Her 4-year-old sister likes to play “Crocodile”: She’s a crocodile and chases Flower around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“She likes games where she gets to be some sort of predatory animal,” their mom said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Flower lives in rural Wales, so she has more access to outdoor space than many American kids. At the same time, debates about kids’ <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/203/education-committee/news/201715/stronger-guidance-and-controls-needed-to-protect-children-from-screen-time-education-committee-finds/\">screen time</a> and <a href=\"https://playgroundresearch.org/why-kids-arent-playing-outside-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/\">outdoor play</a> are raging in the UK as well as in the US. And what struck me most about our video call was actually a toy she showed me. A simple <a href=\"https://www.claires.com/pusheen--6-waffle-soft-toy-878085.html?lang=en\">stuffed animal</a>, in Flower’s hands it could transform into many different objects. “It can be a top, or it can be an accordion,” she said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What kids need from adults</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like Golinkoff with her rubber ball, kids are still using their creativity to bend and shape the world around them. However, today, they may need a little help to make that world safe for their play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If we want kids to be outside playing, we need to have spaces for them to do that,” Slutsky said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means spaces where kids feel safe, and adults feel comfortable giving their kids freedom to roam. Such spaces have declined in recent decades, for very real reasons, experts say. While kidnappings may not be on the rise, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24139147/suvs-trucks-popularity-federal-policy-pollution\">cars today are much bigger</a> and heavier than in the past, making them more dangerous to pedestrians — especially children, who are shorter and smaller, said Robert Schneider, a professor of urban planning at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who studies pedestrian safety. Many parents understandably fear that streets aren’t safe for their kids.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some kids also have to contend with fears of police brutality or racist violence when they play outside. Black moms of sons, in particular, have told researchers of “a baseline of concern every time their child walked out the door,” J. Richelle Joe, an associate professor of counselor education at the University of Central Florida, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23759898/kids-children-parenting-play-anxiety-mental-health\">told me</a> last year. Kids of color and children from low-income families are also less likely than wealthier white kids to have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/nyregion/nyc-parks-access-governors-island.html\">access to green spaces</a> for outdoor playtime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Traffic calming measures like curb extensions and medians, along with lower speed limits and pedestrian-only streets, can go a long way in making neighborhoods safer for outdoor play, Schneider said. Cities like San Francisco and Boston have had some success improving street safety with their <a href=\"https://visionzeronetwork.org/resources/vision-zero-communities/\">Vision Zero plans</a>, he said, and in New York City, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/nyregion/streets-wars-open-streets-for-schools.html\">71 streets will be closed</a> this year for schoolchildren to play during recess. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, the nonprofit Trust for Public Land has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/17/1182556371/schools-parks-healthy-cities-kids\">worked with schoolkids</a> to renovate playgrounds into inviting community parks in areas with less access to outdoor space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids also need the time to play outside. To that end, <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/health/2024/01/30/for-the-first-time-california-law-will-protect-students-right-to-recess\">California</a> and <a href=\"https://komonews.com/news/helping-kids-in-crisis/new-state-law-mandates-k-5-recess-for-physical-and-mental-health-benefits-kids-children-outdoor-physical-activity-floor-hockey-grand-ridge-elementary-school-in-northeast-washington-king-county-doctor-issaquah-hospital-youth-pandemic-learning-loss-problem\">Washington</a> recently passed laws mandating 30 minutes of daily recess for elementary school students, and such laws are <a href=\"https://kidsneedrecess.com/statelaws/\">under consideration</a> in other states, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re not going to go back to the days before smartphones. For one thing, Slutsky notes, kids play with their devices because they’re fun. We can, however, foster an environment where children can come together offline. We just have to create safe, inviting spaces, and then get out of kids’ way so they can do what they do best.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Golinkoff put it: “Let the kids play.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Many universities have yet to release their data, however, so a more clear picture may emerge throughout the fall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most dramatic change was at MIT, which saw an 8 percentage point dropoff in Black and African American enrollment, down from 13 percent enrollment on <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/composite-profile/\">average in the four years prior</a>, and a 6 percentage point boost in Asian American enrollment, up from 41 percent. <a href=\"https://source.washu.edu/2024/08/embargoed-washu-admits-more-limited-income-first-generation-students-share-of-black-students-decreases/\">Washington University in St. Louis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/09/tufts-sees-drop-in-racial-diversity-for-class-of-2028-after-affirmative-action-ban#:~:text=White%20students%2C%20who%20represented%2046.8,up%20from%20an%20earlier%2010.5%25.\">Tufts University</a> also saw a significant decline in Black and African American enrollment, which sank by 4 and almost 3 percentage points at each school, respectively. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yale University saw <a href=\"https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2024/09/04/in-first-yale-class-since-the-end-of-affirmative-action-black-and-latine-enrollment-share-remains-stable-while-asian-american-decreases/\">no change in enrollment</a> among Black and African American students, but it reported a 6 percentage point decline among Asian Americans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And at schools such as the <a href=\"https://news.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/2024-08/fall-2024-new-students.html\">University of Virginia</a>, <a href=\"https://ira.virginia.edu/university-data-home/undergraduate-admissions\">demographic changes</a> in enrollment were fairly negligible across demographic groups, moving no more than a few percentage points in either direction.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/ufX4F-the-supreme-court-s-affirmative-action-decision-has-had-a-mixed-impact-on-enrollment-so-far-4.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.480555829958,100,51.038888340084\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicole Narea/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that data should be taken with a grain of salt; with only a few dozen schools reporting on their enrollments, many of them selective private institutions, “we still can’t definitively speak to how racially diverse this first post-affirmative action class will be,” Michaele Turnage Young, senior counsel and comanager of the Equal Protection Initiative at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But so far, there isn’t much good news in the data for students of color. And many schools have yet to implement race-neutral policies aimed at fostering diversity in their classes, which would comply with the Supreme Court’s decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t see many steps forward. I see more steps backward,” said Wil Del Pilar, the senior vice president of Ed Trust, a think tank focusing on racial and economic barriers in American education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s driving disparate outcomes post-affirmative action?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts in higher education policy have predicted since 2023 that the Supreme Court’s decision would hurt diversity on college campuses, starting with incoming first-years in 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court’s 6-3 decision found that race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race and other factors. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the way those universities’ admissions offices considered race was not narrowly tailored enough to meet the standard required by the Constitution, but he left open the possibility that race could still be considered in the context of essays describing an applicant’s personal experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts have based their predictions about the impact of the ruling in part on what happened in the 1990s and mid-2000s, when states including California, Michigan, and Washington banned affirmative action at public universities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What we saw overwhelmingly at selective public institutions was significant decreases in the number of Black students enrolled, and most of those institutions, especially the most selective, never recovered,” Del Pilar said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Preliminary 2024 enrollment figures suggest that at least some selective schools have seen similar declines in enrollment among students of color. According to Del Pilar, that’s because they largely haven’t overhauled what they value in admissions. “All we did was take one factor out without really adjusting for the other factors that continue to disadvantage students of color,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the results vary, sometimes widely, by institution. At this point, it’s hard to say exactly what’s driving the differences in outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some universities have tried to mitigate the impact of the end of affirmative action with race-neutral policies aimed at bolstering diversity. For example, Duke University <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2023/06/28/duke-expands-aid-affirmative-action-decision-looms#:~:text=Duke%27s%20Affordable%20Action%20Plan,it%20to%20affirmative%20action%27s%20fate.\">unveiled a new program</a> in 2023 to waive tuition for lower-income North and South Carolinians. UVA followed in December, waiving tuition for <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2023/12/12/uva-expands-tuition-waiver-program-state-residents\">lower-income in-state admits</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That may be part of the reason those schools didn’t see dramatic fluctuations in the makeup of their incoming classes. Duke even <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/traditional-age/2024/09/06/early-look-racial-diversity-post-affirmative-action\">increased</a> the combined share of Black and Hispanic enrollment by one percentage point in its incoming class for 2024 compared to 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even predating the Supreme Court’s decision, many schools had also given applicants the option to write a “diversity statement” explaining how their background, including their race, may have impacted their life experiences. Schools may come to rely more heavily on diversity statements as part of a holistic admissions process going forward, though it’s not clear that they’re doing so just yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think that a lot of schools are certainly going to avail themselves of that option and utilize that experience,” Bryan J. Cook, director of higher education policy at the Center on Education Data and Policy at the Urban Institute, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court’s decision didn’t just impact admissions deliberations but potentially also who’s applying where. After California banned affirmative action at public universities in 1996, Cook said, more students of color with the academic qualifications to apply to Berkeley or UCLA chose instead to apply to less selective California institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision has had a similar impact on where students choose to apply, selective institutions may have to work harder to recruit diverse applicants. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Based on what we&#8217;ve seen thus far and the speculation after the ruling last summer, we would probably see more of an impact in the highly selective institutions in terms of what the makeup of the fall cohort looks like,” Cook said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some colleges — for instance, those participating in a <a href=\"https://www.myhighered.mn.gov/blog/direct-admissions-minnesota-shows-all-students-they-are-college-material\">pilot program launched in 2023 by the state of Minnesota</a> — have tried to address the recruitment problem by increasing their direct admissions, in which students who meet certain academic criteria are automatically granted admission. But that’s not happening at the most selective colleges, where admission rates are often in the single digits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They continue to operate the way they’ve always operated,” Del Pilar said. “Unless institutions really begin to change where they’re recruiting, how they’re recruiting, who they’re talking to, their availability of need-based aid, we’re not going to see a ton of advances in enrolling a more diverse class.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

After Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrat-eric-swalwell-slams-viral-trump-cat-and-duck-memes-what-in-the-hell-is-this/articleshow/113242075.cms\">condemned the fearmongering</a>, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) shared one of these images to taunt him:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just gonna leave this here … <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericswalwell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ericswalwell</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nDTqN0IZ6Y\">pic.twitter.com/nDTqN0IZ6Y</a></p>&mdash; Nancy Mace (@NancyMace) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NancyMace/status/1833580283377160665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance has since <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833505359513661762\">admitted he had no proof</a> of Haitian pet slaughter in Springfield, saying “It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.” Yet he nonetheless urged his allies to keep pushing the claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Don’t let the crybabies in the media dissuade you, fellow patriots. Keep the cat memes flowing,” <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833506757534175484\">he tweeted</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This juxtaposition, between the old-school racism of the allegation and the relish with which the falsehood spread, reminded me of a political phenomenon from the recent past: the ascendant <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/15/16144070/psychology-alt-right-unite-the-right\">alt-right</a> circa 2016. The alt-right’s online legions rose to prominence alongside Donald Trump, trolling his enemies with death threats and “ironic” Nazi memes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It even briefly attempted to move into real-world politics by staging real-life rallies, most infamously in Charlottesville in 2017. The negative attention and legal fallout following Charlottesville proved to be its undoing as an organized political force. Today, there are no major alt-right institutions, and the term “alt-right” itself has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/11/20882005/accelerationism-white-supremacy-christchurch\">largely fallen out of favor on the extreme right</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet the way in which people like Vance and Mace have aped their style, the enjoyment they take in spreading hate through a sheen of “just joking” plausible deniability, show the movement’s enduring influence.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They’re all alt-right</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The alt-right grew out of a collision between two internet subcultures: intellectualized racism, represented by the namesake <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161115015510/https://alternativeright.com/\">web publication Alternative Right,</a> and the culture of trolling and shock humor on message boards like 4chan. Alternative Right founder Richard Spencer and his ilk <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/11/4/20947833/richard-spencer-white-nationalism-audio-milo-alt-right\">dreamt of a white American ethnostate</a>; the “channers” loved to share shocking material for the pure joy of transgression.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Making Nazi jokes was itself a joke [on 4chan], a way to keep away outsiders,” the journalist Elle Reeve writes in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Black-Pill-Witnessed-Internet-American/dp/1982198885\"><em>Black Pill</em>,</a> her recent history of the internet fringe. “Over time, new people came to the site and interpreted those jokes as sincere, and eventually the group became the thing they’d once satirized, a herd of brainwashed swastika-posting sheep.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This “herd” adopted Trump as their cause celebre in the 2016 cycle, correctly seeing his rise as a moment where the boundaries of what was possible in American politics were wide open. And it worked: Reeve’s book, as well as a mountain of contemporary reporting, shows that the lines between the Trump movement and the alt-right became quite porous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One small but telling example: In July 2016, the Trump campaign released a graphic that referred to Hillary Clinton as “the most corrupt candidate ever” — while slapping a Star of David atop a pile of money right next to her face. While the Trump campaign claimed it was a “sheriff’s star,” reporters quickly sussed out <a href=\"https://www.mic.com/articles/147711/donald-trump-s-star-of-david-hillary-clinton-meme-was-created-by-white-supremacists#.N3y46XGyi\">the graphic was created by antisemitic alt-righters on 8chan</a>, an even more extreme 4chan offshoot. Trump’s team was literally disseminating alt-right propaganda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/11/20882005/accelerationism-white-supremacy-christchurch\">organized alt-right fell apart after Charlottesville</a>, with Spencer and others <a href=\"https://apnews.com/national-national-general-news-regional-us-e3a71832e9c9efccfb81f576c1db631c\">facing financial ruin from lawsuits</a>, its style of gleeful “just kidding” racism and neo-Nazi imagery remained — simply folded into the argot of the online right.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-830696202.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.2614393258775,100,81.477121348245\" alt=\"A crowd of young white men are yelling and holding tiki torches.\" title=\"A crowd of young white men are yelling and holding tiki torches.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Alt-right supporters, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists gather before a 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, rally, marching with tiki torches through the University of Virginia campus. | Zach D Roberts/NurPhoto via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Zach D Roberts/NurPhoto via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, for example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s primary campaign for president got in trouble for pushing a video that contained <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/07/25/desantis-campaign-video-nazi-symbol-sonnenrad\">an obscure neo-Nazi symbol called the sonnenrad</a>. It’s the sort of thing you’d only know about if you spent time in the right’s online circles, where this kind of edging-toward-fascism is considered fun and even cool (as long you maintain <em>just enough</em> plausible deniability to keep your job).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The origin story of the Haitian dogs and cats meme appears to be remarkably similar. Two reporters, <a href=\"https://x.com/ZaidJilani/status/1833573103684759621\">Zaid Jilani</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/kate_ross_/status/1833724964345684253\">Kate Ross</a>, traced the panic about Haitians in Springfield back to an August march staged by the nearby neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe. One of its leaders, Drake Berentz, <a href=\"https://daytonjewishobserver.org/2024/08/springfield-mayor-ejects-blood-tribe-member-for-sounding-threatening-at-aug-27-city-commission-meeting/\">spoke at an August 27 city commission</a> meeting to warn that “crime and savagery will only increase with every Haitian you bring in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s not just that the preoccupations of the extreme are making their way into the mainstream. It’s their style, the spreading of memes in ecstatic indifference to truth, that is so distinctively alt-right — yet now so normalized in the Trump movement as to be almost banal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One X user <a href=\"https://x.com/AllezLesBoulez/status/1833560127275688199\">perceptively compared</a> the Haitians-eating-dogs meme to Jean-Paul Sartre’s analysis of “bad faith” in mid-century antisemitic rhetoric. The philosopher wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m familiar with this quote. It made the rounds among media types in 2016, as a description of both the way that Trump and his alt-right fans use language to spread bigotry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That it applies to much of the GOP today shows that we’re still living in a political moment the alt-right helped create.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "There’s something eerily familiar in Donald Trump’s and JD Vance’s lies about Haitians eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio.

It’s right there in the name.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s more than that. The company emerged from Andrew Carnegie’s Pittsburgh-area steel mills, which produced <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/All_the_Money_in_the_World/MQ4KnsyVQh8C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA17&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=carnegie\">one of the largest fortunes</a> and were the site of <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/about/history/labor-history-events/1892-homestead-strike\">one of the bloodiest and most brutal industrial strikes</a> in US history. Its formation in 1901 was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Big_Steel/ixYEjoykrhYC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA17&amp;printsec=frontcover\">orchestrated by J.P. Morgan</a>, who blended Carnegie Steel Company with several smaller concerns in one of the first large-scale corporate mergers the country had ever seen. At its wartime peak in 1943, the firm <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181012210047/http://old.post-gazette.com/businessnews/20010225ussteel2.asp\">employed over 340,000 people</a>. When the organized crime figure Meyer Lansky reputedly claimed in 1962 that the mafia was “bigger than US Steel,” he was making quite a brag.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, that wouldn’t be much of a brag. As of the end of last year, the company had <a href=\"https://investors.ussteel.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001163302-24-000009/0001163302-24-000009.pdf#page=10\">fewer than 22,000 employees</a>. In terms of employee headcount, the <a href=\"https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/annual-irs-filing-shows#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20people%20employed,it%20filed%20on%20May%2015\">University of Pittsburgh</a> is bigger than US Steel. It’s no longer even the largest American steel company (it’s <a href=\"https://worldsteel.org/data/top-producers/\">third</a>). And that’s not much competition — the US as a whole produces <a href=\"https://worldsteel.org/media/press-releases/2024/december-2023-crude-steel-production-and-2023-global-totals\">only 5 percent of the world’s steel</a>, compared to nearly half in 1950.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So in the face of increasingly tough competition both domestic and foreign, US Steel started to look for a buyer. Late last year it found one in <a href=\"https://www.nipponsteel.com/common/secure/en/ir/library/pdf/20231218_100.pdf\">Nippon Steel</a>, the largest steel manufacturer in Japan, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/japans-nippon-steel-plans-acquire-us-steel-7-bln-nikkei-2023-12-18/\">offered $14.9 billion</a> for the company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In many ways, it seemed like a natural fit. The world’s current leading steel producer, by a <a href=\"https://worldsteel.org/data/world-steel-in-figures-2024\">wide margin</a>, is China, and just as a US-Japan alliance is the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24047940/china-us-war-taiwan-japan-key-role-explained\">linchpin of efforts</a> to contain China militarily, a US-Japan corporate merger could be a linchpin of efforts to contain China’s efforts to dominate the steel market. Letting a military rival control the production of such a crucial material (and such an important one for defense applications like warships and warplanes) comes with clear risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Except the deal now looks unlikely to go through. President Joe Biden, who came out in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-steel-nippon-kishida-merger-purchase-201b3d5719bcf77067cb81d181442afb\">opposition to the deal</a> in March, will reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/04/biden-prepares-reject-us-steel-deal/\">announce soon</a> he is blocking the acquisition on national security grounds. It’s in his power — the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (<a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10177\">CFIUS</a>, an interagency council controlled by Biden&#8217;s cabinet and other appointees) can veto mergers and acquisitions it deems dangerous to national security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While CFIUS would need at least a fig leaf of a national security reason to act, security is not necessarily the reason why Biden wants to block a sale to Nippon Steel. His administration’s diplomats have reportedly told Japanese officials they need to kill the merger so <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/04/biden-prepares-reject-us-steel-deal/#:~:text=The%20president%20first,the%20Democratic%20ticket.\">Democrats win Pennsylvania</a> this November. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/kamala-harris-to-oppose-u-s-steel-takeover-bid-859ec0c1?mod=article_inline\">Kamala Harris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/31/trump-us-steel-sale-00138910\">Donald Trump</a> have both signaled opposition to the acquisition. US Steel is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/u-s-steel-warns-of-plant-closings-if-sale-collapses-4ef45756?mod=hp_lead_pos4\">threatening to shut down multiple mills</a> should the deal not go through, which could put thousands out of work, but the presidential candidates and <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/news/2024/09/fetterman-casey-blast-us-steel-warning-that-blocked-sale-could-trigger-closings-company-move.html\">Pennsylvania elected officials</a> (who represent one of the plants likely to go) are holding firm against the deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/11/union-blocks-nippon-steel-us-steel/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/11/union-blocks-nippon-steel-us-steel/\">reporting</a> from the Washington Post, executives from Nippon Steel and US Steel were set to meet Wednesday with representatives from CFIUS in an effort to save the deal, but its chances look increasingly slim. Why? Some of it surely is the symbolism of “US Steel” being sold to “Nippon Steel,” which if included as a plot point in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gung_Ho_(film)\">late ’80s</a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Sun_(film)\">early ’90s</a> movie about the unstoppable economic rise of Japan, would come across as a little too on the nose. Unsurprisingly, Trump, whose form of nationalism has a distinct 1980s vintage, explains his opposition as motivated by a <a href=\"https://triblive.com/news/politics-election/trump-pledged-to-block-u-s-steel-merger-with-nippon-but-his-inner-circle-is-pushing-for-the-deal/\">desire not to sell out to “Japan.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the bigger reason politicians are lining up against the deal is the United Steelworkers union (USW), which includes most of US Steel’s workforce among its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48bdd98a-59aa-4515-afeb-42b435a4f99a\">60,000 steelmaking members</a> and <a href=\"https://m.usw.org/union/mission/industries/metals/resources/bargaining-with-uss/greedy-reckless-uss-leadership-hits-new-lows\">strongly opposes it</a>. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) candidly states he’ll <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2024/09/08/fetterman-us-steel-nippon-biden-harris-trump-shapiro-steelworkers/stories/202409080151\">oppose the deal</a> as long as the union does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At a time when a mere <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/union2_01232024.htm\">6 percent of private sector workers are unionized</a>, it’s an impressive flex of union strength. But it demands some further explanation. If the steelworkers are the biggest factor pushing against a deal, why are they so opposed?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The minimill revolution and what it means for the steelworkers’ union</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To understand the union’s perspective, you have to know a little bit about how steel manufacturing works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The traditional model, pioneered in plants like Carnegie’s in the late 19th century and still existing in a far more technologically advanced form today, is what’s called an <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/integrated-steel-plant\">“integrated” steel plant</a>. The full process of steel production takes place in these facilities, going from raw iron mined from the earth to finished steel fit to use to make cars and household appliances and all the other steel mainstays of our lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Integrated mills start with iron ore and melt it into liquid pig iron in a blast furnace; the pig iron is then blasted with oxygen in a “basic oxygen furnace” to reduce its carbon content and make it a low-carbon steel; the steel is then poured into a mold and cooled into a solid; finally, it’s rolled into a finished product, like sheet or plate metal or beams for buildings or railway rails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Integrated mills require a huge amount of energy to melt raw iron ore and to run the machines that transform it into steel and cast and roll it into useful form. The <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/eb0c8ec1-3665-4959-97d0-187ceca189a8/Iron_and_Steel_Technology_Roadmap.pdf#page=30\">International Energy Agency estimates</a> that a metric ton of steel produced this way requires 15 gigajoules of energy. (For comparison, the average American household uses <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/electricity-use-in-homes.php\">10,500 kilowatt hours</a>, or about 38 gigajoules, of electricity each year.) This energy comes from burning purified coal, or “coke.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like any other form of coal power, this is pretty bad from an emissions standpoint. Globally, iron and steel account for <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/iron-and-steel-technology-roadmap#:~:text=The%20iron%20and%20steel%20sector%20directly%20accounts%20for%202.6%20gigatonnes%20of%20carbon%20dioxide%20(Gt%C2%A0CO2)%20emissions%20annually%2C%207%25%20of%20the%20global%20total%20from%20the%20energy%20system%20and%20more%20than%20the%20emissions%20from%20all%20road%20freight\">about 7 percent of CO2 emissions</a>. But integrated mills also employ huge numbers of people. The current largest mill in the US, the Gary Works in Gary, Indiana, owned by US Steel, employed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/business/economy/gary-indiana-economy.html\">over 30,000 people</a> at its peak; after decades of decline and labor-saving technical improvements, it still has over 3,700 workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the 1960s, an <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11663-008-9216-9#Sec3\">alternative form of steel production</a> began to emerge: so-called “minimills” using “electric arc furnaces” (EAFs). As the name suggests, these furnaces are powered by running current through electrodes, rather than by burning coal onsite as at integrated mills. The electricity needs to be plentiful and reliable, but because it’s just electricity, it can come from sources cleaner than coal, like natural gas or nuclear or <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/electric-arc-furnaces-the-technology-poised-to-make-british-steelmaking-more-sustainable-214756\">even (with sufficient reliability) renewables</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">EAFs mostly recycle existing scrap steel, and when they do they require much less power per tonne than blast furnaces (<a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/eb0c8ec1-3665-4959-97d0-187ceca189a8/Iron_and_Steel_Technology_Roadmap.pdf#page=29\">only about 2 gigajoules</a>, compared to 15 for the blast furnace route). They can also produce steel from iron ore that’s undergone a process called “direct reduction,” which normally uses natural gas and is thus cleaner than coal-based blast furnaces. Because direct reduction can also use pure hydrogen instead of natural gas, it’s a promising path for <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/us-pledges-up-to-1b-for-two-pioneering-green-steel-projects\">“green steel”</a> with no carbon footprint at all. Currently, though, this is the <a href=\"https://leading.business.columbia.edu/climate/steel/decarbonizing-steel/overview\">costliest</a> and most energy-intensive way to make steel (at least <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/eb0c8ec1-3665-4959-97d0-187ceca189a8/Iron_and_Steel_Technology_Roadmap.pdf#page=30\">18 gigajoules per tonne</a> when using natural gas).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The term “minimill,” often used for facilities built around EAFs, should give you some clue as to the relative labor requirements of this kind of steel production. Minimills require fewer workers. The economists <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130090\">Allan Collard-Wexler and Jan De Loecker</a> have found that the emergence of EAF-focused minimills was the principal driver of a massive increase in productivity for the US steel industry from 1962 to 2005. Over that period, output per worker grew fivefold: that is, a worker in 2005 could produce as much steel as five workers in 1962.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not unrelatedly, steel employment fell by three-quarters over this period. About 81 percent of the surge in productivity, they estimate, was directly due either to minimills themselves being more productive, or to them driving the least-productive integrated steel mills out of business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One can hardly blame the United Steelworkers union for being skeptical of minimills, given how the spread of the business model has decimated its membership. The problem is not just that minimills require fewer workers, but that they tend to be located in southern, anti-union states, with non-union labor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a total of eight operational <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-03/iis-ria-final-2024-03.pdf#page=30\">integrated steel mills</a> in the US, all owned by US Steel or Cleveland-Cliffs; three are in Indiana, two in Ohio, one in Michigan, and one in Pennsylvania. The eighth, in Granite City, Illinois, <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/business/biden-may-block-u-s-steel-sale-to-nippon-steel-questions-remain-for-granite-city/article_447b3646-6bd0-11ef-97c3-b70b8302063b.html\">idled its blast furnaces indefinitely</a> late last year, though it continues to roll and finish steel slabs produced elsewhere. All eight of these facilities are unionized, six by the United Steelworkers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By comparison, there are <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-03/iis-ria-final-2024-03.pdf#page=30\">88 electric arc furnace facilities</a> in the US. While it’s hard to know what share are unionized, most are not; only about <a href=\"https://unionstats.com/ind/htm/ind_2023.htm\">23 percent</a> of iron and steelworkers in the US overall are covered by a union contract, down from <a href=\"https://unionstats.com/ind/htm/ind_1983.htm\">over half in 1983</a>. Given that almost all workers in integrated mills are covered, it’s reasonable to surmise that the large majority of minimill workers aren’t in a union, making steel a majority non-union industry overall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are always exceptions, like a <a href=\"https://m.usw.org/news/media-center/releases/2019/usw-welcomes-u-s-steel-plan-to-restart-eaf-construction\">US Steel electric arc furnace facility in Alabama</a> where workers are USW members, but for the most part, big integrated mills mean union power, and minimills with electric arc furnaces mean union decline. Nucor, the largest steel company in the US with <a href=\"https://nucor.com/news-release/nucor-reports-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-122919#:~:text=approximately%2025%2C205%2C000%20tons\">over 25 million tons</a> sold last year to <a href=\"https://investors.ussteel.com/news-events/news-releases/detail/663/united-states-steel-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and#:~:text=3%2C369-,15%2C507,-14%2C942\">US Steel’s 15.5 million</a>, both pioneered minimills and is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/business/economy/steel-nucor-trump-policy.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20union%20at%20Nucor%2C%20not%20in%20this%20anti%2Dunion%20state%20or%20any%20other%20where%20the%20Charlotte%2Dbased%20manufacturer%20has%20a%20plant.\">famously non-union</a>. Even US Steel, long a center of union strength, acquired an Arkansas <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-06/u-s-steel-jobs-shift-to-arkansas-away-from-pittsburgh?sref=qYiz2hd0\">non-union electric arc furnace mill in 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Nippon looks like a threat</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How does this tie into the Nippon Steel bid? Essentially, the steelworkers see Nippon as threatening to move US Steel toward minimill-type production and away from the conventional blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace integrated mills where the union is strongest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a <a href=\"https://m.usw.org/union/mission/industries/metals/resources/bargaining-with-uss/nippons-public-relations-machine-continues-to-sidestep-pressing-concerns\">letter to members</a>, the union’s leadership expressed a worry that Nippon would “continue the [US Steel]&nbsp; business plan of running away from basic steelmaking—instead prioritizing Big River and Big River II.” “Basic steelmaking” here means integrated steel mills; Big River is the name of the Arkansas electric arc furnace plant that US Steel bought, and Big River II is a <a href=\"https://www.localmemphis.com/article/money/us-steel-mill-east-arkansas-economic-impact/522-7eb9a294-1a0f-4b38-8e04-5b984acd4af1\">major expansion planned for it</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s <a href=\"https://prosperousamerica.org/why-the-nippon-steel-deal-has-steel-workers-in-a-panic/\">some evidence</a> that’s the case. Nippon has closed a few integrated mills in Japan in recent years and has proposed closing more. When the acquisition was announced, Nippon executive Takahiro Mori told investors he planned to continue the Big River II expansion and US Steel&#8217;s plans for it, which include moving production from northern union-represented mills down to the non-union workforce in Arkansas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The reality is that there are certain crucial products that simply cannot be made without blast furnaces, including those used in automotive, energy, and national security applications,” the <a href=\"https://m.usw.org/union/mission/industries/metals/resources/bargaining-with-uss/usw-solidarity-will-determine-the-future-of-u-s-steel-not-sellout-executives-or-foreign-managers\">union insists</a>. They have a point. We can’t run the world economy on recycled scrap metal alone, and advanced high-strength steel (AHSS), needed for car manufacturing among other uses, <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2019/05/f62/AHSS_bandwidth_study_2017.pdf#23\">tends to be made with blast furnaces</a>, not electric arc furnaces, in part because scrap of high enough quality to make AHSS is rare. EAFs running on iron produced through direct reduction, not blast furnaces, <a href=\"https://www.pubaffairsbruxelles.eu/opinion-analysis/can-the-cars-we-buy-drive-green-steel-production/\">may be able to make inroads here</a>, but right now we need blast furnaces for cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are other union concerns as well. The acquisition was announced without giving the union prior notice, which it claims <a href=\"https://m.usw.org/union/mission/industries/metals/resources/bargaining-with-uss/usw-solidarity-will-determine-the-future-of-u-s-steel-not-sellout-executives-or-foreign-managers\">violates the collective bargaining agreement</a> reached between the union and US Steel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moreover, the union has another buyer in mind: Cleveland Cliffs, the No. 2 steel company in the US and the only other operator of traditional integrated mills. The company <a href=\"https://m.usw.org/union/mission/industries/metals/resources/bargaining-with-uss/facts-not-fiction-update-on-proposed-sale-of-u-s-steel\">committed to the union</a> that no union member would lose their job upon acquisition, and would continue to operate blast furnaces. Once again, the USW position emphasizes keeping traditional mills, with large union workforces, going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, Cleveland Cliffs only <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-steel-pittsburgh-cleveland-03b75f6025b336f7826980085dc2f796\">offered $7.3 billion</a>, about half of Nippon’s $14.9 billion, for US Steel. It reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/cleveland-cliffs-argued-its-us-steel-bid-was-worth-more-than-nippon-steels-2024-01-24/\">offered much more than that privately</a> in response to the Nippon bid, but even then it didn’t match the Nippon offer. A Cleveland Cliffs purchase also raises major antitrust issues that would presumably bother the unusually <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/30/heres-how-biden-may-cement-his-antitrust-legacy-in-2024-00132756\">antitrust-focused Biden administration</a>. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the US auto manufacturers&#8217; lobby, <a href=\"https://www.autosinnovate.org/association-update/Alliance%20for%20Automotive%20Innovation%20Letter%20to%20NEC%20on%20U.S.%20Steel%20-%20March%202024.pdf\">wrote to policymakers to express concern</a> over one firm controlling 100 percent of US blast furnaces, and 65 to 90 percent of the steel used in vehicle manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Industry press coverage of Cliffs notes quite candidly their strategy of trying to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/inside-cleveland-cliffs-bid-keep-us-blast-furnaces-smelting-2023-09-05/\">dominate blast furnace production so they can charge a higher price</a>. In other contexts, that’s a kind of monopoly-oriented strategy that Biden appointees like Federal Trade Commission chair <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/05/14/lina-khan-antitrust-ftc/\">Lina Khan</a> or Department of Justice antitrust chief <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/technology/jonathan-kanter-apple-antitrust.html\">Jonathan Kanter</a> would normally object to.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biden’s steel dilemma</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration has prided itself on supporting US-based manufacturing and unions, so it’s perhaps no surprise that it would throw in with the United Steelworkers. Then again, plenty of other concerns that the administration has would presumably prioritize a push in favor of the Nippon purchase. There’s the needs of Japanese allies, for one thing, and the desire to counter <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-08-17/china-s-steel-oversupply-threatens-to-destabilize-global-market?sref=qYiz2hd0\">China’s “oversupply” of cheap steel</a>. Japan is not the US, but it’s certainly not China, and strengthening an ally’s industrial firm makes sense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s the environment. Some environmental groups have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/us/politics/nippon-us-steel-biden.html\">criticized the deal</a> on the grounds that Nippon is committed to keeping high-emissions blast furnaces running — precisely the opposite conclusion of the steelworkers’ union. If the steelworkers are right, that’s probably good news for Nippon and US Steel’s carbon footprint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As it stands, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel\">electric arc furnaces are far cleaner</a> than blast furnace/basic oxygen steel production. Columbia researchers Zhiyuan Fan and Julio Friedmann describe blast furnace production as <a href=\"https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/low-carbon-production-iron-steel-technology-options-economic-assessment-and-policy/\">“particularly stubborn to any decarbonization technology</a>”; electric arc furnace production from direct reduced iron or scrap metal is much more promising. Fan and Friedmann estimate that using green hydrogen in blast furnaces can reduce carbon emissions by perhaps 20 percent, but not much beyond that. <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-pathway-to-industrial-decarbonization/\">Carbon capture at blast furnaces</a> can further reduce emissions but remains imperfect and will likely never reach zero carbon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/\">defended high tariffs</a> on Chinese steel (currently at least 50 percent, combining two different <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20China's%20unfair,protect%20American%20workers%20and%20businesses.\">25 percent</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/07/10/a-proclamation-on-adjusting-imports-of-steel-into-the-united-states-7/\">tariffs</a>) in part on the grounds that it’s emissions-intensive. But a major reason Chinese steel is so dirty is it’s made in coal-fired blast furnaces, at mills not dissimilar from those the United Steelworkers are fighting so hard to defend. And it, too, is moving toward more <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3269981/china-marks-turning-point-after-limiting-approvals-coal-based-iron-and-steel-projects\">efficient electric arc furnaces</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this points to a deep tension that neither Biden nor the rest of the Democratic Party seems likely to resolve anytime soon. The form of steel production that the United Steelworkers prizes and seeks passionately to preserve is likely not compatible with deep decarbonization. And the Democratic coalition cares deeply about decarbonizing the economy. In the current battle, the administration and party are siding with the union, but it’s not clear that the alliance can last indefinitely.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

She’s just the latest American to be killed by the Israeli military&nbsp;with no clear consequences from the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US options for ensuring accountability are somewhat limited. When an ally like Israel kills an American, the US can apply diplomatic pressure, attempt to involve American law enforcement, or alter military and trade relations. So far, the US appears to be focused on the first option, with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/biden-israeli-killing-of-american-activist/index.html\">President Joe Biden</a> calling for “full accountability” for Eygi’s death and calling it “a tragic error.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden also told reporters Tuesday that the results of a preliminary Israeli investigation indicate that Eygi was killed by a bullet that had ricocheted off the ground and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/10/israel-idf-operations-blinken-response-american-death/\">was intended for another person that the IDF called “the key instigator”</a> of the protest, which it referred to as a “violent riot.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Soldiers were reportedly using tear gas, stun grenades, and live ammunition against the demonstrators, who were part of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a Palestinian-led group working to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land using nonviolent means. ISM contradicted the Israeli military’s assessment in a <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/2024/09/ism-response-to-israeli-army-statement-on-the-murder-of-aysenur-eygi/\">Tuesday statement</a>, saying that the ostensible target was too far from Eygi for her to have been hit either directly or indirectly, and accusing the Israeli military of other inconsistencies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/11/american-activist-aysenur-eygi-killed-idf-west-bank/?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wp_news_alert_revere&amp;location=alert\">Washington Post</a> published an investigation Wednesday that also disputes the IDF’s account. According to the Post’s analysis, Eygi was shot and killed half an hour after the most intense part of the protests, and after the demonstration had moved away from where Eygi was standing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eygi’s family put out a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_yMDSFvbB1/?img_index=1\">statement</a> Wednesday pushing back on Biden’s claim that Eygi’s killing was an accident. “This is not only insensitive and false, it is complicity in the Israeli military’s agenda to take Palestinian land and whitewash the killing of an American,” in what the statement refers to as “a targeted attack.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>This is not the first time a US citizen has been killed by the Israeli army</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eygi is the third US citizen to be killed in the West Bank since Israel began its war on Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attacks in southern Israel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first was 17-year-old Tawfiq Ajaq (also known as Tawfic Abdel Jabbar), originally from outside New Orleans. Ajaq and his family had moved to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-west-bank-palestinian-shooting-653747686b24a3f5a8d6fa87961079f9\">the family’s ancestral village</a> in the West Bank so they could connect with their Palestinian heritage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ajaq was reportedly killed by an off-duty police officer in January while <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/american-teen-shooting-death-west-bank-violence-1783ff3a7fa5f65f5b792372fd093445\">driving in a pickup truck</a> with a friend. (Accounts of the circumstances of the teen’s death differ; relatives initially said he was barbecuing in a field with a friend.) Israeli police claimed that a gun was fired at people “purportedly engaged in rock-throwing activities” on a highway near the village. Three people —&nbsp;the police officer, a soldier, and a civilian —&nbsp;were at the scene according to the report, but it’s not clear which one shot and killed Ajaq.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another American-born teenager, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-america-teenagers-west-bank-killing-33e35fb8e9a9a3641b32ad59b1e50379\">Mohammad Khdour</a>, was killed the following month in similar circumstances, which prompted questioning of the two boys’ families by the State Department, according to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-america-teenagers-west-bank-killing-33e35fb8e9a9a3641b32ad59b1e\">Associated Press</a>; it is not clear who killed him or whether Israel has investigated his killing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israeli police promised an investigation into Ajaq’s shooting, but the status and results of that investigation aren’t clear. Vox reached out to the Israel Police and COGAT, the Israeli military agency that is responsible for administration in the occupied territories, regarding the status of that investigation, but did not receive a response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/5/11/23067365/shireen-abu-akleh-palestinian-journalist-killed-israel\">Shireen Abu Akleh</a>, a Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist, was also killed by the Israeli military in 2022 while doing her job and clearly identified as a member of the press. (Israel has killed <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2024/09/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/#:~:text=116%20journalists%20and%20media%20workers%20were%20confirmed%20killed%3A%20111%20Palestinian,35%20journalists%20were%20reported%20injured.\">more than 100 journalists in Gaza</a> since it launched its operation there in October.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Initially, Israel blamed her death on Palestinian militants, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/shireen-abu-akleh-death/\">extensive media reporting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/on-the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh/\">evidence pointed to an Israeli soldier</a>. The Israeli military eventually admitted responsibility for killing her, and the FBI reportedly launched an investigation into her killing. Thus far, <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2024/05/cpj-calls-on-fbi-to-release-timeline-for-conclusion-of-shireen-abu-akleh-investigation/\">that investigation hasn’t resulted in any charges</a>. Vox reached out to the FBI for an update on the investigation but did not receive a response by press time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Israeli killing of US civilians goes back at least to 2003, when American activist Rachel Corrie was crushed to death in Gaza by an Israeli soldier driving an armored Caterpillar-brand bulldozer as she laid down to prevent it from moving to destroy Palestinian houses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, legislators in the House of Representatives put forward a resolution calling for a US-led independent investigation into Corrie’s killing, but it was never brought to a vote. Corrie’s family attempted to pursue the case in the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/17/israel-dangerous-ruling-rachel-corrie-case\">Israeli justice system</a> and <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/our-cases/corrie-et-al-v-caterpillar\">even tried to sue Caterpillar</a>, but more than 20 years later, no charges have been brought in relation to her death.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All told, there are at least 10 US citizens who have been killed by Israelis — most by Israeli police or military — in the past 20 years, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/03/middleeast/world-central-kitchen-workers-gaza-israel-strike-intl/index.html\">an aid worker with World Central Kitchen</a> who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In every case where there’s an American killed or it’s a high-profile killing, the Israeli authorities [say], ‘Okay, we&#8217;ll investigate,’ and then that buys them time … weeks or months later, once the pressure and heat is off, they basically just whitewash the whole thing and nobody’s held accountable,” Brad Parker, associate director of policy at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These American deaths come in addition to <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena-israelpalestine/246-stemming-israeli-settler-violence\">settler violence and military raids in the West Bank</a>, which have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/palestine/369736/west-bank-violence-jenin-raid-settler-idf-israel-gaza-hamas\">killed at least 660 Palestinians there since October 7</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Gaza, at least 40,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, but that number is likely much higher; a recent article in the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext\"><em>Lancet</em> medical journal puts that number as high as 186,000</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We see the double standards that are involved when an Israeli American dual citizen is killed in a horrific way. There’s a humanizing response and the demand for justice from the United States, as there should be to any atrocity committed against a US citizen abroad,” Josh Ruebner, the policy director at IMEU, told Vox. “But why is there this double standard when it comes to American citizens who are murdered by Israel? Why is Israel exceptionalized in this way?”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What can the US do about Americans killed by Israel?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two avenues the US can pursue when it comes to seeking recompense for Americans killed by Israel: the diplomatic route and the legal route.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So far, US leaders have favored the former with respect to Eygi’s killing. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, for instance, offered a pointed statement about Eygi’s killing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It has to change,” Blinken said of Israeli military action in the West Bank. “And we’ll be making that clear to the senior-most members of the Israeli government.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are some legal avenues to pursue justice the US could take as well, Brian Finucane, US policy director at the International Crisis Group, told Vox, including demanding US officials be allowed to participate in a full and impartial investigation into the killing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One way that the US responds is that sometimes they will send the FBI in a supporting role for local law enforcement to help investigate serious crimes against Americans,” he said. “Where the Department of Justice may have jurisdiction, the FBI may also investigate,” provided the other country gives permission for it to operate. Though Israel has reportedly <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2024/05/cpj-calls-on-fbi-to-release-timeline-for-conclusion-of-shireen-abu-akleh-investigation/\">granted this permission in the past</a>, it’s unclear whether the country will do so this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration’s statements suggest it will look to Israel to investigate Eygi’s killing; however, “there are a lot of reasons to be deeply skeptical of Israel&#8217;s investigation of this killing, not just because of Shireen and the killing of other Americans, but the much more regular violence in the West Bank, for which there is little or no accountability,” Finucane said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration could invoke the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24011316/us-aid-israel-biden-human-rights-leahy-law\">Leahy Law</a>, which prohibits US weapons transfers to military units that commit gross violations of human rights. That, however, appears unlikely: The law hasn’t been meaningfully applied to Israel, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240857410/how-do-leahy-laws-apply-to-u-s-support-for-israel\">despite pressure to do so</a>, including from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/05/20/israel-leahy-human-rights-aid/\">former Sen. Patrick Leahy</a>, after whom the law is named.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The State Department reportedly recommended several IDF and Israeli police units for <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/israel-gaza-blinken-leahy-sanctions-human-rights-violations\">sanctioning under the Leahy Law,</a> but so far that has not materialized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s just zero appetite to implement existing laws in any meaningful way, and that includes arms export control acts and Leahy Laws,” Parker said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Sen. Patty Murray, both of Washington, <a href=\"https://jayapal.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Aysenur-Ezgi-Eygi-Letter.pdf\">sent a letter to Blinken and Biden</a> Wednesday asking whether the US would request a formal investigation into Eygi’s killing and what other steps the administration would take to ensure accountability for her death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

According to a statement <a href=\"https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1833701654098481396\">from US Central Command</a> (CENTCOM), in less than 24 hours they had “destroyed five Iranian-backed Houthi uncrewed aerial vehicles and two missile systems in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">CENTCOM posted that statement shortly after Vice President Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542\">declared on a debate stage</a> in Philadelphia that “as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.” The remark echoed President Joe Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/24/remarks-by-president-biden-in-statement-to-the-american-people/\">claim</a> when he withdrew from the race this summer to be “the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has been <a href=\"https://x.com/CBSNews/status/1833736864764678563\">dinged by fact-checkers</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/michaelgwaltz/status/1833696874546581830\">criticized by Republicans</a> for her debate statement. There is, after all, the ongoing US mission to counter Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-navy-yemen-houthis-israel-war-7a9997f9d84ac669fae69ecf819913fb\">described recently</a> by one former Navy commander as “the most sustained combat that the U.S. Navy has seen since World War II.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the US <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/world/middleeast/us-iraq-combat-mission.html\">formally ended its combat mission</a> in Iraq in 2021, some 2,400 troops remain in the country to “advise, assist and enable” Iraqi forces fighting the remnants of ISIS, a campaign that began in 2014. Even if it’s not officially a “combat mission,” these troops still take part in raids targeting ISIS, including one just two weeks ago in which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/31/us-troops-wounded-isis-raid-iraq/\">seven Americans were injured</a>. Meanwhile, around 800 US troops are still in Syria, mainly assisting local allied armed groups fighting ISIS. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This isn’t safe work: Since Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and the start of the war in Gaza, US troops in the region have been the target of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24074393/deterrence-united-states-middle-east-iran-russia-military-drone\">dozens of attacks</a> by Iran-backed militias, including one in January that <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3659809/3-us-service-members-killed-others-injured-in-jordan-following-drone-attack/\">killed three US service members</a> at a base in Jordan. The US has also carried out strikes targeting suspected terrorists in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/al-qaida-ayman-zawahri-united-states-government-military-technology-yemen-860d86430603dc36ea786e72e09438c1\">Yemen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/35436/federal-government-of-somalia-africom-target-al-shabaab\">Somalia</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But none of this is “war,” according to the US government. A Department of Defense official, speaking on background, told Vox, “An aspect of military service includes serving in locations where hostile actions may occur. Those locations are <a href=\"https://www.military.com/benefits/military-pay/special-pay/combat-zone-tax-exclusions.html\">designated by executive order</a> and/or the secretary of defense. However, it’s important to note that just because a service member is in one of these locations does not mean they are engaged in war. The US is not currently engaged in a war and does not have troops fighting in active war zones anywhere in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris does appear to have carefully chosen her wording — “active duty in a combat zone in any war zone” — though this may not be a particularly meaningful distinction for troops facing an incoming drone attack. One could also get further in the weeds and point out that the US hasn’t formally declared a war since World War II, and that US troops in Iraq and Syria are still operating under legal authorizations <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11930\">passed in the wake of 9/11</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond the legal hair-splitting, Harris made the comment in the context of a defense of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, and it is true that under Biden, the US military posture overseas has significantly shrunk from what it was under the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">(Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/\">has falsely claimed </a>in the past that his presidency was the first in 72 years that “didn’t have any wars,” despite the fact that he oversaw four years of combat in Afghanistan as well as major military escalations in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia. At least 65 US troops died in hostile action under Trump’s presidency.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">After the forever wars</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the so-called forever wars aren’t completely over, they’re certainly being fought at a much, much lower level. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the number of US troops involved in counter-terrorist missions can be measured in the hundreds rather than the thousands or tens of thousands. The number of those troops who are killed every year is in the single digits. The number of drone strikes and special forces raids carried out by US forces around the world is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/352855/war-on-terror-biden-isis-al-qaeda\">down dramatically</a> as well. US political and military leaders have shifted their focus, to a significant degree, to “great power competition” with countries like Russia and China. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For most Americans, this shift away from the post-9/11 era is welcome. But some critics warn there’s a danger of complacency in accepting that a certain level of combat — call it war or not — will just continue indefinitely. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The lighter footprint and the smaller number of casualties makes it easier for the administration to downplay these conflicts’ significance and keep them out of the public eye,” <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/brian-finucane\">Brian Finucane</a>, a former State Department legal adviser now with the International Crisis Group, told Vox. “It lets them off the hook from actually having to explain why US forces are in harm’s way, or why they’re bombing the Houthis, or what the plan is to bring an end to this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden and Harris can fairly claim to have presided over the end of an era of warfare that began with the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Afghanistan as well as the beginning of a new one in which US forces in the Middle East are engaged in a much lower but still significant level of combat with terrorist groups and state-backed militias, more or less indefinitely and with little public debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Admittedly, though, that’s not as pithy a debate line.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Any political actor trying to reach undecideds must therefore mind the knowledge gap that lies between themselves and their audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And that is one thing that Donald Trump utterly failed to do at the debate in Philadelphia. For this reason, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/370942/harris-trump-debate-who-won-bait-kamala-donald\">among others</a>, Vice President Kamala Harris was likely the chief beneficiary of her first oratorical showdown with the Republican nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first indication that Trump may have allowed himself to become “too online” for the normie debate watcher came before the event had even begun. When the former president’s plane touched down in Philadelphia, the far-right internet personality Laura Loomer was among the VIPs <a href=\"https://x.com/JuddLegum/status/1833648215440162957\">who emerged from its hull</a> (if you recognize that name, no presidential candidate should waste time trying to appeal to you).<strong> </strong>Loomer has voiced <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/us/politics/trump-laura-loomer.html\">the opinion</a> that “there’s a difference between white nationalism and white supremacy. Right? And a lot of liberals and left-wing globalist Marxist Jews don’t understand that.” It is theoretically possible that a person with that perspective might be a good sounding board for a politician hoping to reach moderate moms in the Milwaukee suburbs, but that does not seem likely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any case, once on stage, Trump routinely betrayed signs of being the kind of man who knows who Loomer and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/story-trumps-explosive-dinner-ye-nick-fuentes-rcna59010\">Nick Fuentes</a> are and who can probably recite Fox News’s primetime lineup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Early in the debate, Trump sought to illustrate the horrors that the Biden-era upsurge in asylum seekers brought to America’s shores. Polls suggest swing voters <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx\">share</a> Trump’s general concern with immigration levels, and there were surely countless ways that he could have articulated the restrictionist argument that they would have found coherent and sensible. Here is what he chose to say instead:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what’s happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lot of towns don’t want to talk — not going to be Aurora or Springfield. A lot of towns don&#8217;t want to talk about it because they’re so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating — they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For any American who is not immersed in right-wing social media, these remarks were surely disorienting. Trump invoked “Aurora” or “Springfield” without any explanation, as though these places were synonymous with well-known disasters (rather than <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/aurora-tda-gang-apartment-trump-rcna170477\">obscure</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370760/jd-vance-racist-cat-eating-haitian-immigrants\">right-wing</a> conspiracy theories). And his answer only got more puzzling from there, as he declared that “the people that came in” are eating “the dogs” and “the cats.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here, Trump was referring to a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370760/jd-vance-racist-cat-eating-haitian-immigrants\">baseless, racist allegation</a> — promulgated chiefly by his running mate — that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are kidnapping and consuming their neighbors’ pets. His reference was plain to all of us fallen souls who, by dint of our social media addictions, were forced to scroll through the most <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/185742/ted-cruz-reminder-migrants-pets-conspiracy\">hateful AI-generated images of cats</a> ever conceived earlier this week. But to anyone else, he sounded like a Fox News superfan who’d accidentally ingested some of his grandson’s LSD.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP6550203594\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">For swing voters, many of Trump’s ravings sounded like a summary of the sixth season of a show they’d never watched&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other moments, Trump’s attack lines were less wildly detached from reality but still lacked sufficient exposition for those hearing them for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In trying to spotlight the left-wing stances that Harris embraced during her 2020 primary campaign, Trump declared, “she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here, Trump was referring to the fact that, in a questionnaire from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/kfile-harris-pledged-support-in-2019-to-cut-ice-funding-and-provide-transgender-surgery-to-detained-migrants/index.html\">the ACLU in 2019,</a> Harris had answered “yes” when asked if she would use “executive authority to ensure that transgender and non-binary people who rely on the state for medical care — including those in prison and immigration detention — will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump is probably right to smell a potential advantage in attacking Harris for favoring taxpayer-funded medical treatments for undocumented immigrants. But he did not walk viewers through exactly what Harris had endorsed and its implications. Instead, he chose to summarize her position in shorthand while needlessly distorting it, suggesting that she wanted to “do transgender operations on illegal aliens” (rather than <em>provide</em> such care to them), as though the vice president had intended to impose gender transition on detained immigrants against their will. The effect was to make Trump’s attack sound more baseless than it actually was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elsewhere, Trump’s references were plausibly too highbrow; he repeatedly declared Harris a “Marxist,” a term that might not have much resonance for non-college-educated voters who weren’t fully sentient during the Cold War. He also referred to “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22881709/nord-stream-2-russia-ukraine-germany-united-states-cruz\">the Nord Stream 2 pipeline</a>” without immediate elaboration and touted <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump\">Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</a>’s praise, an endorsement that may carry weight with the extremely online right but means nothing to most ordinary voters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps the single most telling illustration of Trump’s failure to comprehend the distinction between his Truth Social following and swing voters, though, was when he referred to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot as “J6” — an abbreviation that few who have never been subject to a microblogging platform’s character limit would have any reason to use or even recognize.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this said, it is certainly true that I am no more the relevant audience for Tuesday’s debate than Laura Loomer superfans are. Whatever our political leanings, those of us who read the New York Times each morning or watch Fox News every night — and scroll X all hours in between — live in a different universe than the people whose fickle allegiances will decide November’s election. <em>We</em> know what references to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/363230/jd-vance-couch-sex-hillbilly-elegy-rumor-false\">JD Vance’s “couch”</a> are supposed to convey. <em>They</em> know what it’s like to have healthy and fulfilling hobbies. We are not the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I’m not relying on mere intuition when claiming that Harris won last night’s contest. The available <a href=\"https://x.com/mkraju/status/1833718682435870989\">viewer polls</a> and swing-voter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/presidential-debate-voter-poll/\">focus groups available</a> indicate the Democrat routed her rival, as <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/who-will-win-the-debate-according-to-polls?tid=1726026982797\">do the betting markets</a>. If that consensus holds, Trump’s inability to speak to voters who aren’t like me — which is to say, those who don’t immediately know what “J6” refers to — will be one reason for his failed debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

On Monday morning, Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833148904864465117\">posted</a> on X the false claim that “reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” In the same tweet, he claimed that “Haitian illegal immigrants” are “causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The claim has caught fire among the GOP and has now made it all the way to the party’s leader. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the record, there is no evidence that any Haitian immigrant ate a cat in Springfield, Ohio, or anywhere else in the United States, for that matter. But the lack of factual evidence hasn’t stopped the GOP from pushing the nativist narrative, which seems designed to play off bigotry and suspicion against the mostly Black population of Haitian immigrants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More than 300,000 previously unauthorized migrants from Haiti <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/g-s1-7061/migrants-haiti-tps-immigration-parole\">received temporary protected status in June</a>, which means these Haitian immigrants are now — despite Vance’s Monday suggestion otherwise — legally present in the United States. Still, Trump and other Republicans’ attacks on these immigrants come at a moment when more <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris\">Americans have grown skeptical of immigration</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shortly after President Joe Biden took office, the United States experienced a surge of migrants at its southern border — much of it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality\">fueled by unrest</a> in several Caribbean and Latin American nations following the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans used this wave of migration to attack Biden’s border policies, and to claim there was a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality\">crisis at the border</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/9/26/23875580/new-york-city-migrant-crisis-influx-eric-adams\">busing efforts</a> by Republican leaders in border states sent large groups of migrants to cities and towns across the country, putting many Americans face to face with migrants <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24063986/cities-migrant-crisis-border-overwhelmed-shelters\">for the first time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this comes amid a competitive 2024 presidential race, where both candidates have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370958/harris-trump-debate-winners-losers\">rushed to frame themselves as tough on immigration</a>. Trump has long <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris\">campaigned on restricting immigration</a>, while Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/369177/democrats-kamala-harris-truce-immigration-progressive-border-security\">touted a strict border security bill</a> that she supports — and which Trump pushed his fellow Republicans to kill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These factors — perhaps most of all the rise in anti-immigrant sentiment — probably explain why a sitting senator felt it was wise to share a meme claiming that if Americans don’t vote for former President Donald Trump, immigrants will eat your cats, and why a former president repeated the vile claim during a national debate.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where the hell did the false claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets come from?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea that Haitians are roaming the streets kidnapping pets seems to have emerged from Vance’s state of Ohio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Springfield’s Police Division said on Monday that there have been <a href=\"https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/springfield-police-say-no-reports-of-pets-stolen-after-viral-social-media-post/3WSIZQNHQVE4NP4TS5BVHBB2PY/\">no reports</a> of any pets being stolen or eaten in that city. However, there apparently was an incident in Canton, Ohio — a nearly three-hour drive from Springfield — where a woman was charged with cruelty to animals for allegedly killing and eating a cat. But there’s no evidence that this woman is an immigrant or of Haitian descent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite that lack of evidence, the woman appears to have been identified as of Haitian descent in <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/how-did-fake-news-about-haitian-migrants-eating-cats-spread-from-a-malaysian-propagandist-to-jd-vance/\">far-right tweets</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent days, the completely unsubstantiated slur against Haitian immigrants began to spread outside of far-right spaces after several prominent right-wing figures credulously tweeted it out. On Sunday, provocateur Charlie Kirk <a href=\"https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1832883283199471676\">tweeted the claim</a>, including a screenshot from a pseudonymous Facebook post suggesting that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are butchering and eating dogs. Shortly thereafter, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1832968811890237947\">billionaire Elon Musk</a> chimed in to claim that “people’s pet cats are being eaten.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By Monday morning, the claim had spread to Vance — before being picked up by other prominent elected Republicans, official Republican Party accounts, and Trump himself.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Republicans want nativist sentiment to be front and center in this election</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance has long sought to stoke anti-Haitian sentiment in Springfield, a small Ohio city that recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/springfield-ohio-school-bus-crash-haiti-immigrants.html\">attracted as many as 20,000 Haitians</a> seeking jobs in newly opened factories and warehouses. Tensions grew between the new immigrants and some of the city’s more longtime residents after a Haitian immigrant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a fatal bus crash in 2023. Vance has claimed that the city is “overwhelmed” by the new residents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, skepticism of immigration <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris\">spiked nationally</a> in recent years as the amount of migration at the southern border grew.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/temp.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.137387245316,100,51.725225509367\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicole Narea/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So it’s not surprising that many prominent members of the Republican Party, a party that frequently <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/rnc-trump-rachel-morin-family-speech-1926639\">flags isolated crimes committed by immigrants</a> to fuel nativist sentiment, latched onto an unfounded internet rumor about Haitians and cats as “proof” that immigrants present a problem (that Republicans can fix).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, none of this context changes the fact that Republicans at the pinnacle of the party, including sitting US senators and even the party’s two nationwide candidates, see no downside to spreading racist, completely unfounded rumors based on random social media posts spread by far-right trolls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, September 11, 10:30 am:</strong> This story was originally published on September 9 and has been updated to include Donald Trump’s remarks during the presidential debate.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But Harvey Mansfield should be an exception.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He is, in some ways, the godfather of the Trumpist right’s current approach to gender and masculinity — an increasingly open celebration of the virtues of traditional gender norms that I’ve termed “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/366601/the-rights-plan-to-fix-america-patriarchy-2-0\">neopatriarchy</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mansfield began teaching at Harvard in 1962 and stayed there until his retirement last year. During that 61-year tenure at America’s most famous college, he became a conservative institution unto himself: a beachhead in enemy-occupied territory, an Ivy Leaguer who has been mentor to some of the movement’s leading lights. His former graduate students include Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), leading pro-Trump intellectual <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22278065/donald-trump-conservative-politics-charles-kesler\">Charles Kesler</a>, and the famous Never Trump writer Bill Kristol.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mansfield, an erudite Tocqueville scholar, disdains Trump — describing him <a href=\"https://www.persuasion.community/p/mansfield\">as a demagogue and a vulgarian</a>. Yet in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/7/12/harvey-mansfield-retires/\">a recent interview</a>, Mansfield said he voted for said vulgarian in 2020 “with many misgivings” (Mansfield adds that he “crossed [Trump] off my list entirely” after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But he has offered striking praise of Trump in one area: gender. Trump, he <a href=\"https://contemporarythinkers.org/harvey-mansfield/commentary/manhood-age-trump/\">said in one interview</a>, was “really the first American politician” to win office via “a display of manliness and an attack on political correctness.” He beat Hillary Clinton, per Mansfield, because American elections are “tests of manliness” — and “it’s difficult for a woman to do that in a graceful way, and to maintain her femininity.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Manliness, </em></strong><strong>explained</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Masculinity is one of Mansfield’s enduring interests. In 2006, he published a book — <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Manliness/NsIU55H6_DUC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">titled <em>Manliness</em></a> — that attacked modern feminism’s ideal of a “gender-neutral society,” calling for a return to a world where men and women were understood to have different skills and aptitudes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mansfield’s book begins with a well-known contradiction: While everyone in public life claims to believe that men and women are equal, reality is anything but. Men continue to dominate in high-status professions and leadership roles; women continue to do the lion’s share of home labor despite their entry into the workforce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Mansfield, this inequality reflects the enduring and vital influence of “manliness.” Manliness, in his account, is a kind of self-reliant commanding decisiveness — a willingness to blaze a risky path and lead others along it. While women can be manly — Mansfield cites Margaret Thatcher as an example — they generally are not. For Mansfield, “common sense” stereotypes about men and women are mostly true and validated by the evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Women still rather like housework, changing diapers, and manly men. The capacities and inclinations of the sexes do not differ exactly or universally, but they do seem to differ,” he writes. “These differences are, one could say, all the more impressive now that they are no longer supported, indeed now that they are denied or opposed, by society’s ruling conventions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The persistence of manliness among men helps explain, in large part, why the “gender-neutral society” is failing to produce equality in the workplace or at home. Given that men are men and women are women, Mansfield argues, it cannot help but fail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Men reject and resist the expectation that they should abandon their manliness,” he argues. “They do not so much mind sharing their traditional opportunities with whoever can exploit them, and they have shown newfound respect for women who can. But they draw the line at doing what women have left behind.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Mansfield and the Trumpian moment</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I used to think that Mansfield’s writing on manliness was idiosyncratic: an older professor’s way of lashing out at a changing world. But the Trump era has proved Mansfield’s work to be far more than that. His writings represent an unusually coherent formulation of a value system deeply embedded in modern conservatism, one that has found its voice in the past several years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ask any conservative about what defines their worldview, and one of the first things they’ll tell you is that they stand for eternal truths against passing fads. Liberals, they believe, have an unjustified faith in the plasticity of human nature —&nbsp;which for conservatives is a fixed and unchangeable thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of those enduring facts, they believe, is binary gender difference. Men are generally one way and women are generally another; this, for conservatives, is an eternal truth about humanity that liberals deny at their peril.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are many different ways of making this argument, ranging from the science of sex difference to an appeal to scripture. Mansfield himself appeals to history, writing that “the tradition of different roles for the two sexes is impressively long — long enough to comprise all societies except advanced liberal democracies today.” Different kinds of conservatives may make the argument differently, but the general sentiment remains consistent across the movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many modern conservatives can be a bit squeamish about the implications of these views. They don’t want to come across as sexist, after all. So they talk quite a bit about the differences between men and women without drawing conclusions about the implications of these ideas for who deserves to wield political power and rule households.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is what’s behind the rise of the “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/366601/the-rights-plan-to-fix-america-patriarchy-2-0\">neopatriarchy</a>” movement: the call from leaders like JD Vance and Josh Hawley for America to rediscover the lost virtues of a patriarchal society <em>without</em> explicitly calling for women to depart the workforce and return to the home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mansfield, by contrast, is open about what he’s attacking: the very idea of a “gender-neutral society.” And with this openness comes an arch self-awareness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Certainly I am sexist,”&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/9/9/harvey-mansfield-political-polarization/\">Mansfield told</a> the Harvard Crimson in 2022. “I say that plainly.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

A <a href=\"http://worldwildlife.org/livingplanetreport\">new report</a> by two of the world’s leading environmental groups reveals that the average size of wildlife populations worldwide has shrunk dramatically, by what the report calls a “catastrophic” 73 percent in the last 50 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Living Planet Report, published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), found that creatures living in rivers and lakes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/amazon-river-dolphin\">Amazon river dolphin</a>, have experienced the most severe declines. Populations of these freshwater species have declined by an average of 85 percent, according to the Living Planet Index (LPI), a tool for measuring wildlife populations on which the report is based. Across the animal kingdom, meanwhile, wildlife populations are vanishing fastest in Latin America and the Caribbean — part of the globe that’s home to a tremendous diversity of life. The research does not include invertebrates such as insects and snails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Losing wild animals isn’t good for anyone. Bats eat insect pests and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/370002/bats-link-babies-death-study-white-nose-syndrome\">lower the use of pesticides</a>, yet many of them are imperiled. Parrotfish, which have declined in some regions, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/375178/parrotfish-algae-coral-reef-climate-change\">can improve the health of coral reefs</a> that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/366763/bonaire-coral-reef-caribbean-climate-change\">safeguard coastal communities</a>. All kinds of birds and mammals help pollinate plants and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22877262/seeds-plants-animals-climate-migration\">spread seeds</a> throughout the forest, sustaining forests and the rainfall they generate; many of them are vanishing, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is not just about wildlife,” Daudi Sumba, WWF International’s chief conservation officer, said on a press call Monday unveiling the report. “It’s about the essential ecosystems that sustain human life.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/LPI-screenshot.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.7625964082644,100,82.474807183471\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new report is an alarming status check on the state of our planet, and the headline numbers it reveals will likely be cited in countless news and government reports. The Living Planet Index is one of the key metrics used to track global progress in efforts to conserve the environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But … is it accurate?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coming up with simple figures to describe the state of the world’s wildlife is inherently difficult, but more than half a dozen scientists told me that the methods used to calculate the index may cause it to overstate wildlife declines, and perhaps significantly so. Some even called it misleading. One researcher voiced concerns that if leading environmental groups exaggerate wildlife declines, it could ultimately erode trust among the public, making action on a very real crisis that much harder to achieve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While there’s no question that biodiversity is in decline, growing criticism of WWF’s estimation casts doubt on the scale of loss —&nbsp;or at least on science’s ability to accurately measure it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Scientists have poked holes in WWF’s key figure</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before digging into the report, it’s important to reiterate: There is indeed a crisis of biodiversity loss. This is unequivocal. Coral reefs are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change\">overheating</a> and dying en masse. North America has lost some <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1313\">3 billion birds</a>.<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me/371434/insect-apocalypse-bees-decline-loss\"> Insects are indeed vanishing</a>. The rate of extinction is <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/decline-and-extinction/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20extinction%20rate%20is,are%20being%20degraded%20or%20lost.\">accelerating</a>. In Hawaii, which has been called the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/12/14/23990382/extinction-capital-hawaii-endangered-species-act\">extinction capital of the world</a>, entire species of birds — and all the cultural heritage they carry — are blinking out as I write this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new WWF report underscores this frightening trend. We are living in a time of profound biodiversity loss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Calculating a single figure to encompass all of this loss isn’t easy. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and counting animals year after year is difficult and time-consuming. “Generating a single estimate for all species in all locations is extremely challenging,” said <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/laura-melissa-guzman/\">Laura Melissa Guzman</a>, a quantitative biologist at the University of Southern California. “I don’t think we have reached consensus as a scientific community of what is the best way to do that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">WWF’s approach relies on something called the Living Planet Index, which is produced by ZSL. It measures the average change in animal populations worldwide since 1970. To come up with the global LPI, scientists first calculate how individual populations of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish have changed, as I <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2022/10/12/23399105/biodiversity-loss-wwf-living-planet-index\">wrote in 2022</a>, when WWF published its previous installment. A population of, say, 1,000 manatees that has lost 500 has decreased by 50 percent. The same is true for a population of 10 that has lost just five. Then they average up all of those changes, be they increases or decreases, to produce one number. That means the index is an average of changes in population sizes, not the average of the number of creatures lost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is confusing. In the past, many media stories <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2022/10/12/23399105/biodiversity-loss-wwf-living-planet-index\">misinterpreted figures</a> from the index and reported that Earth lost more than two-thirds of its wildlife in the last 50 years. That’s wrong. The headline number —&nbsp;two-thirds, or in the case of the new report, 73 percent —&nbsp;refers to the average decline of thousands of different animal populations, not the total number of animals.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-453767238-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.834813777373,100,78.330372445255\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Populations of Chinstrap Penguins in Antarctica have declined, on average, by over 60 percent since 1980, according to the new report. | Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But a more fundamental issue than bad headlines is that the index — the basis of the new report — is not calculated correctly, according to a team of researchers at the Center for Theoretical Study in the Czech Republic, a joint institution of Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, they published <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49070-x\">a paper</a> in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em> that pointed out what they considered mathematical flaws in the LPI. Those flaws, the authors claim, bias the index and cause it to exaggerate the decline of wildlife.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The study takes issue with a number of things, including the math used to calculate the index and how ZSL handles poor-quality population data. That lower quality data includes population trends —&nbsp;ups and downs in the number of animals —&nbsp;based on counts from only a few points in time. For a <a href=\"https://communities.springernature.com/posts/the-living-planet-index-is-not-a-reliable-measure-of-population-changes\">variety of complicated reasons</a>, the authors say, ZSL’s choices in how to calculate the index bias the data toward declines. In reality, declines and increases are more balanced, they say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One example relates to sampling errors, cases when scientists don’t accurately report the number of animals in a wildlife population, perhaps because they’re hard to spot. If the population is small to begin with, accidentally counting fewer animals has a more dramatic, negative effect on the population trend than accidentally counting more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m really convinced that the decline of vertebrate populations is not as serious as the LPI says,” David Storch, a study coauthor and researcher at the Center for Theoretical Study, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several scientists who were not involved in the <em>Nature Communications</em> study told Vox that the concerns the article raises are valid and that biases embedded in the calculation may indeed exaggerate wildlife declines. <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/rodolfo-dirzo\">Rodolfo Dirzo</a>, a biodiversity researcher at Stanford University who reviewed the new report, said that while the scale of wildlife population declines is extreme, it’s likely smaller than what the WWF report suggests due to how the LPI was calculated. (Disclosure: Dirzo was one of my advisers in graduate school.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Given the broad adoption of the LPI in global biodiversity policy arena, the kind of comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the LPI that Tószögyová and colleagues performed is long overdue,” <a href=\"https://www.natureserve.org/whos-who/staff/292\">Bruce Young</a>, chief scientist at NatureServe, a nonprofit wildlife data organization, said in an email. “I was always nervous about the certainty with which the LPI authors presented their results.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although an early version of the <em>Nature Communications</em> study was available in 2023, WWF did not tweak how the LPI is calculated in response to the paper. Storch believes there’s an incentive to keep the index as is. It’s not so much a scientific tool, he said, but a tool to raise awareness of the biodiversity crisis — and raise money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I see these indices more as a communication tool,” said Rahel Sollmann, a quantitative ecologist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife in Berlin, who was not involved in the new report or the <em>Nature Communications</em> study. “I wouldn’t put too much trust into its actual numerical value.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/freshwater-screenshot.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.880051767751,100,78.239896464498\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The Living Planet Index for freshwater animals including fish. | WWF/ZSL\" data-portal-copyright=\"WWF/ZSL\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I posed these criticisms to WWF and scientists at ZSL. <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/about-zsl/our-people/dr-robin-freeman\">Robin Freeman</a>, a scientist at ZSL who was involved in the LPI analysis, said he doesn’t agree that biases overestimate the measure of wildlife declines.&nbsp;Changing the way ZSL calculates the index to remove what some researchers see as statistical biases would have consequences of its own, he said. Freeman <a href=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2887653/v1\">argues</a> that removing less detailed or more error-prone data from the calculation — much of which is from poorer regions in the tropics where there’s less research — could fail to capture the full picture of wildlife declines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Louse McRae, another ZSL scientist who also works on the index, added that it’s also possible that the LPI actually underestimates the scale of declines. That’s because the index tends to include more population data from birds and mammals, well-studied groups that are typically declining less than, say, reptiles and amphibians, she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We do an awful lot of work to test the datasets, test the impact of outliers and extreme shifts in population,” <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/about-zsl/our-people/andrew-terry\">Andrew Terry</a>, ZSL’s director of conservation and policy, said in a Monday press briefing. Speaking about the index, he said ZSL remains “confident in its robustness.” (ZSL also published a <a href=\"https://www.livingplanetindex.org/documents/LPR2024_Technical_Supplement.pdf\">technical document</a> alongside the new report that details its testing.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A spokesperson for WWF, Amy Fallah, said the main purpose of the Living Planet Report “is to raise awareness about the scale of environmental challenges facing our planet and drive urgent action that prioritizes nature in global decision-making.” That’s why the group published it ahead of COP16, a major UN biodiversity conference, where environmental leaders will meet to hash out plans for conserving nature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The LPR’s central aim has always been to inform and influence policy decisions that put nature at the heart of solutions to the challenges our planet faces,” Fallah said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>We know wildlife is declining. Does it matter if it’s exaggerated?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes and no. If the leading research and advocacy groups, such as WWF, are seen to overstate the problem, the public could lose the sense of urgency and may be less likely to lend support for what is a very real problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s a real risk to overstating the magnitude of the biodiversity crisis,” Young of NatureServe told me. “The public could get the impression that the conservation community is prone to exaggeration and therefore calls for action to reduce wildlife loss could go unanswered.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Young also mentioned that the “<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01285-z\">extinction denier</a>” community — comprising people who deny that we’re living through a sixth mass extinction fueled by humans — feeds off examples, real or not, that show that wildlife is doing better than we thought. That makes it ever more important for measures of biodiversity loss to capture examples of successful conservation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then again, we’re just talking about shades of decline — whether the biodiversity crisis is really, really bad, or really, really, <em>really </em>bad. Regardless of how precise the LPI is, it portrays a trend of profound nature loss that no serious scientist disputes. “The report has been useful in bringing attention to the fact that there is a significant decline in populations of many species of vertebrates,” Dirzo said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-549037541.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7813932477765,100,80.437213504447\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The number of hawskbill sea turtles in northeastern Australia has fallen precipitously in recent decades. | Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the figure ultimately serves as a communication tool, it’s an effective one, judging by how widely the LPI is reported and cited. “Our goal is to use it as a tool for raising awareness about the dual crises of nature loss and climate change and urging the public and private sector to take action,” Fallah said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And to be clear: Communication really matters. The decline of wildlife remains a somewhat fringe issue with <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/publications/2023/public-views-climate-change-biodiversity-loss.pdf\">low public awareness</a>, even compared to other environmental concerns like climate change. This in itself is alarming, considering the sheer scale of the problem and how it impacts us all. We are talking about the ongoing collapse of ecosystems with immeasurable spiritual and cultural worth that provide human communities with clean water, healthy food, and other basic needs. They are irreplaceable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If WWF’s new report — and the LPI index — can help communicate the problem, that ultimately seems useful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It shows us that we’re still not doing enough,” said <a href=\"https://www.ecolabunam.com/gceballos\">Gerardo Ceballos</a>, an ecologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). “The most important thing to understand is that unless we can save biodiversity there’s no way we can save humanity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People have accused me and other people of being alarmists,” Ceballos told me. “We are alarmists because we are alarmed.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The brothers were convicted in 1996 of murdering their wealthy parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, seven years earlier in a gruesome double homicide, when Lyle was 21 and Erik just 18. Their trials unfolded amid a tabloid media frenzy that emphasized the brothers’ presumed greed and sociopathy while mocking the decades of emotional and sexual abuse they claim to have experienced at the hands of their father. Despite overwhelming witness testimony presented in their first trials that they were telling the truth about their abuse, they were each ultimately sentenced to life without parole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/374720/menendez-brothers-abuse-claims-real-monsters-netflix-drama\">Netflix’s recent Ryan Murphy docudrama, <em>Monsters</em></a>, takes a frank look at the brothers’ allegations of abuse, but it doesn’t do them any favors either, buying into the possibility that the pair made the whole thing up for sympathy and even implying an unfounded incestuous relationship between them. So it makes sense that in order to balance out those rather jarring claims, Netflix also recently launched a documentary film, simply titled <em>The Menendez Brothers</em>, that backs the abuse claims with an impressive number of first- and secondhand sources — including the brothers themselves, who appear via recorded phone calls from prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several members of the Menendez family appear on the documentary with stories of the abuse the brothers suffered from their father, including Joan Vander Molen, Kitty Menendez’s sister, and Diane Vander Molen, a cousin of Lyle and Erik.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Diane spent most of her summers growing up with the Menendez family and has never deviated from <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/lyle-erik-menendezs-cousin-testified-sexual-abuse-speaks/story?id=44420173\">the story she testified to</a> at the brothers’ first trials — that Lyle had told her about their father’s sexual abuse when he was just 8 years old. Her testimony also implicated Kitty Menendez, who, she alleged, knew about Lyle’s claims and either disbelieved them or chose to ignore them. After that, the brothers have said the alleged abuse went on for years after that, with the brothers claiming that their father’s sexual abuse of Erik continued into Erik’s adulthood, with Lyle learning that his brother was still being abused just days before the murders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Multiple Menendez family members recalled several chilling stories of abuse, but one about a trust fall gone wrong in Lyle’s childhood, the first story Diane Vander Molen relates in the documentary, seems particularly revealing as a glimpse into the lives the brothers lived.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One time Jose put Lyle on a kitchen counter and prompted Lyle to jump off, and he was going to catch him. As Lyle did so, Jose backed off and let him fall to the ground, telling him that you can never trust anybody.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taken as an isolated example, we might consider this an anecdote of a cruel prank played on an innocent child. But in the context of everything we know about Jose Menendez and his children, it becomes much more significant. It’s a simple but revealing look at a man whose behavior seemed to be a textbook example of <a href=\"https://endcoercivecontrolusa.com/blog/what_is_coercive_control\">coercive control</a> — a long-term behavior pattern in which a family member carries out an ongoing strategy of manipulation and emotional abuse against his partner and/or his children. This was just one example of a lifetime of alleged psychological torture. It’s anguishing to think what such an environment would do to two young boys forced to play these kinds of mind games by a parent whom they loved and trusted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coercive control <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22758030/gabby-petito-domestic-intimate-partner-violence-prevention\">often accompanies</a> other dysfunctional behaviors, including domestic violence and sexual abuse. Although the term was first coined in 1982, it wasn’t popularized as a concept until the late aughts (via an <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/coercive-control-how-men-entrap-women-personal-life\">influential book</a> on the subject) and still has yet to be fully or widely understood by the general public. More and more states are beginning to incorporate coercive control into their civil procedures and guidelines for understanding domestic violence, but as of 2024 only a handful of states, including <a href=\"https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/legal/USA-coercive-control-laws\">Hawaii</a> and <a href=\"https://msmagazine.com/2024/06/20/massachusetts-coercive-control/\">Massachusetts</a>, actually prosecute coercive control as a criminal offense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While most people recognize that strategic manipulation is a key factor in situations involving long-term domestic abuse, the justice system lacks sentencing guidelines that incorporate that understanding, including where juvenile and young offenders are concerned. In the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, the court failed even to accept that prolonged abuse could be a defense to murder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lyle and Erik were initially each tried separately in 1993; both trials, in which the defense relied heavily on testimony supporting their abuse claims, resulted in hung juries. The next trial began in October 1995, just eight days after the O.J. Simpson acquittal<strong> </strong>— the timing of which, the documentary implies, may have increased a public thirst for vengeance against wealthy defendants. For this trial, which saw them being tried together, the judge rejected what he called the “abuse excuse” and thus disallowed nearly all of the expert and personal testimony corroborating the brothers’ claims.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The jurors in that trial, according to one juror who appears in the documentary, were also dissuaded from considering manslaughter as an option, which could have dramatically reduced their sentences. Given the overwhelming number of witnesses who back their claims of an abusive household of coercive control and the increased understanding we have of how long-term abuse can affect children, it’s generally understood — and their defense attorneys have <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/menendez-bros-attorney-speaks-out-case-amid-appeal\">argued</a> — that their trials would have gone much differently today. The law increasingly <a href=\"https://bwjp.org/site-resources/evidence-of-battering-and-the-defense-of-duress/\">recognizes</a> coercive control and prolonged abuse as supporting a defense of diminished capacity, which can <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/diminished_capacity\">frequently result</a> in a conviction on a lesser degree of a crime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fortunately, the brothers have a shot at a reprieve: a recently rediscovered <a href=\"https://lamag.com/news/letter-calls-into-question-menendez-brothers-murder-conviction-attorneys-say\">letter</a> purportedly written by Erik Menendez eight months before the murders in which he details his ongoing sexual abuse by Jose has been used as the basis for a motion to vacate the brothers’ convictions. A recent story in <a href=\"https://people.com/menendez-brothers-will-they-go-free-people-cover-story-8724654\">People magazine</a> notes that the Los Angeles district attorney’s office will give the court a formal recommendation on the motion on November 26. That means the nightmare for the Menendez brothers could finally end.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

After Hurricane Helene dumped two feet of rain on western North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/01/asheville-climate-haven-flooding-hurricane/\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/climate-catastrophe-comes-to-asheville-north-carolina\">major</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/nx-s1-5137024/climate-haven-hurricane-helene-asheville\">media</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/climate/asheville-flooding-history-helene/index.html\">outlets</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/hurricane-helene-asheville-climate-change-nowhere-safe\">marveled</a> at how Asheville, which had been celebrated as a climate haven, had been devastated <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/climate/hurricane-helene-climate-change.html\">by a climate-related disaster</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some in the media later reported accurately that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/climate/asheville-climate-change-flood.html\">climate havens don’t actually exist</a>. But that still raises the question: Where did this climate haven concept even come from?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well before humans began putting billions of tons of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, entire populations would migrate toward better conditions in search of a place with milder weather or more fertile soil or the absence of drought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because of its speed and scale, however, human-caused climate change is especially extreme, and everywhere will be impacted by some degree of risk. There is no completely safe haven.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which is part of how we ended up talking about the idea of climate havens. It’s wishful thinking. At least that’s what several experts told me after <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina\">Helene laid a path of destruction across the Southeast</a> and as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/376323/hurricane-milton-category-5-tampa-florida\">Hurricane Milton barreled toward Florida</a>. As the impacts of climate change became more real and apparent, the media as well as local leaders started looking for a better story to tell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People are desperate for optimism,” said <a href=\"https://architecture.tulane.edu/people/jesse-m-keenan\">Jesse Keenan</a>, director of the Center on Climate Change and Urbanism at Tulane University, who described the concept of climate havens as a fiction. “It gives people hope.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Keenan actually blames himself for helping to popularize the term. For a concept that feels so widespread now, it’s surprisingly hard to find much mention of climate havens in the media before 2018. That was when the Guardian quoted Keenan in a piece about where you should move <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/climate-change-where-to-move-us-avoid-floods-hurricanes\">to save yourself from climate change</a> that used the phrase “safe havens.” Buffalo, New York, and Duluth, Minnesota, were Keenan’s suggestions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The concept gained more traction a few months later, when Mayor Byron W. Brown referred to Buffalo as a “<a href=\"https://www.buffalony.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=342\">climate refuge</a>” in his 2019 state of the city address, followed by outlets like <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/the-consequences-of-being-a-climate-refuge-city?sref=qYiz2hd0\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"https://qz.com/1895263/how-cities-can-prepare-to-support-climate-migrants\">Quartz</a> referring to Buffalo as a climate haven. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/climate/climate-migration-duluth.html\">did a whole spread on “climate-proof Duluth,”</a> a slogan Keenan wrote as part of an economic development package commissioned by the city. He told me it was just a joke that got pulled out of context.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to know how responsible one professor with a knack for marketing was for the mainstreaming of the climate haven concept. But it’s easy to see why local governments would latch onto it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Census Bureau estimates that as climate change warms the planet over the next several decades, 100 million <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-12/america-after-climate-change-mapped?sref=qYiz2hd0\">will migrate into and around the </a>US. Increased flood risk <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43493-8\">may have already pushed several million people</a> out of coastal and low-lying areas across the US, as wildfires <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50630-4\">start to raise questions about migration</a> in the West.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Inland cities, namely those along the Rust Belt that have been losing population for years, see an opportunity to pull those people in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The idea of a climate refuge itself is kind of an escapist fantasy,” said <a href=\"https://mcharg.upenn.edu/people/billy-fleming\">Billy Fleming</a>, director of the McHarg Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “To the extent that a climate refuge even exists, it&#8217;s not a particularly physical or geophysical phenomenon. It&#8217;s social and economic.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fleming added that, for these would-be climate havens, attracting new residents is a means to pull in more tax revenue and create wealth for the community. “It&#8217;s about keeping the real estate machine churning,” he added, “which is the thing that pays for everything else in the city.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2175688575.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A shirtless man carries a plank of wood, surrounded by muddy ground and debris.\" title=\"A shirtless man carries a plank of wood, surrounded by muddy ground and debris.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A volunteer starts to rebuild in Black Mountain, North Carolina, just days after Hurricane Helene dissipated. | Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The real estate industry has taken notice. Quite coincidentally, as Hurricane Helene was bearing down on the Southeast last week, Zillow announced a new feature <a href=\"https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2024/Zillow-introduces-First-Streets-comprehensive-climate-risk-data-on-for-sale-listings-across-the-US/default.aspx\">that displays climate risk scores</a> on listing pages alongside interactive maps and insurance requirements. Now, you can look up an address and see, on a scale of one to 10, the risk of flooding, extreme temperatures, and wildfires for that property, based on data provided by <a href=\"https://firststreet.org/research-library/national-risk-reports\">the climate risk modeling firm First Street</a>. Redfin, a Zillow competitor, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/02/13/redfin-air-quality-home-listings/\">launched its own climate risk index</a> using First Street data earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new climate risk scores on Zillow and Redfin can’t tell you with any certainty whether you’ll be affected by a natural disaster if you move into any given house. But this is a tool that can help guide decisions about how you might want to insure your property and think about its long-term value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s almost fitting that Zillow and Redfin, platforms designed to help people find the perfect home, are doing the work to show that climate risk is not binary. There are no homes completely free of risk for the same reasons that there’s no such thing as a perfect climate haven.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Climate risk is a complicated equation that complicates the already difficult and complex calculus of buying a home. Better access to data about risk can help, and a bit more transparency about the insurance aspect of homeownership is especially useful, as the industry <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/377094/hurricane-milton-helene-home-insurance-flooding-damage\">struggles to adapt to our warming world</a> and the disasters that come with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As we start to see insurance costs increase, all that starts to impact that affordability question,” <a href=\"https://www.zillowgroup.com/people/skylar-olsen/\">Skylar Olsen</a>, Zillow’s chief economist, told me. “It&#8217;ll help the housing market move towards a much healthier place, where buyers and sellers understand these risks and then have options to meet them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, knowledge of risk isn’t keeping people from moving <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/30/climate/americans-moving-hurricane-wildfire-risk.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb\">to disaster-prone parts of the country</a> right now. People move to new parts of the country for countless different reasons, including the area’s natural beauty, job prospects, and affordable housing. Those are <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-dynamics/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2022.886545/full\">a few of the reasons</a> why high-risk counties across the country <a href=\"https://econofact.org/are-americans-moving-to-locations-with-higher-climate-risk\">are growing faster than low-risk counties</a>, even in the face of future climate catastrophes, which are both unpredictable and inevitable. It’s almost unfathomable to know how to prepare ourselves properly for the worst-case scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The scale of these events that we&#8217;re seeing are so beyond what humans have ever seen,” said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pdx.edu/profile/vivek-shandas\">Vivek Shandas</a>, an urban planning professor at Portland State University. “No matter what we think might be a manageable level of preparedness and infrastructure, we&#8217;re still going to see cracks, and we&#8217;re still going to see breakages.”<br>That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23872640/coastal-climate-ocean-rising-miami-florida-building\">build sea walls</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/366765/megafires-climate-indigenous-controlled-burns\">find new ways to fight wildfires</a>. In a sense, we have the opportunity to create our own climate havens by making cities more resilient to the risks they face. We can be optimistic about that future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story was also published in the Vox Technology newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here</a></em></strong><em>&nbsp;so you don’t miss the next one!</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Oklahoma</em></a> is currently before the Supreme Court — and it is one of the most muddled death penalty cases the Court has faced in a while. Exactly how the justices untangle it will decide whether a man lives or dies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Richard Glossip is on death row after being convicted of an Oklahoma murder 20 years ago. Now, however, the state’s Republican attorney general says that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">his trial was unconstitutional and his conviction must be tossed out</a>. The state plans to retry Glossip if his conviction is vacated, but a ruling in Glossip’s favor will get him off death row for now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Attorney General Gentner Drummond has struggled to find a legal forum that will actually take the assertion that his trial was unconstitutional seriously. Oklahoma’s highest criminal court refused to accept Drummond’s arguments and kept Glossip on death row. The state parole board, meanwhile, split 2-2 on whether to grant clemency to Glossip, in part because one member of the board had to recuse himself because his wife was the lead prosecutor against Glossip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wednesday morning’s oral argument in <em>Glossip</em> only added more confusion to the mix. The two justices who typically take the most hardline positions against criminal defendants, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, appeared determined to toss the case out completely, without ever actually considering whether Glossip’s constitutional rights were violated. They likely have an ally in Chief Justice John Roberts, who seemed to doubt whether any possible constitutional violation in this case actually mattered enough to change the outcome of Glossip’s trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Justice Neil Gorsuch, who often votes with the Court’s most hardline members <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf\">in death penalty cases</a>, is recused from the case for reasons the Court did not disclose. That’s actually bad news for Glossip because he must assemble five affirmative votes to toss out his conviction in order to prevail, and the loss of even a skeptical justice is one less potential vote for him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All three of the Court’s Democrats, meanwhile, appeared sympathetic to Glossip’s arguments, and spent much of the case batting down Alito’s proposals to dismiss the case on procedural grounds — though Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson showed some openness to forming an alliance with Thomas to send the case back down to the state courts in order to gather additional evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That leaves Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, conservative Republicans who asked some questions that appeared sympathetic to Glossip, as the wild cards in this case. It is possible that they could provide the fourth and fifth vote to save Glossip’s life, but far from certain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The alleged constitutional violation that is before the Court — that prosecutors withheld evidence that a key witness has a serious mental illness, and failed to correct this witness when he lied on the stand — is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">fairly marginal</a>. It turns on four words in handwritten notes by prosecutor Connie Smothermon that were not turned over to Glossip’s lawyers until January 2023. The state agrees with Glossip’s legal team that these four words reveal a sufficiently serious constitutional violation to justify giving him a new trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while this narrow legal issue, which is the only issue before the Supreme Court, is the kind of legal question that reasonable judges could disagree upon, Smothermon’s notes are only one piece of a wide range of evidence suggesting that Glossip’s criminal conviction is unconstitutional: Oklahoma conducted two independent investigations, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">both of which concluded that Glossip’s trial was fundamentally flawed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among other things, those investigations found that Justin Sneed — the man who actually committed the murder at issue here — was pressured by police to implicate Glossip in the crime. They also show that police and the prosecution lost or destroyed evidence that could potentially exonerate Glossip. And they show that police inexplicably did not question potentially important witnesses or search obvious places for evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, however, Glossip’s life likely turns upon whether Kavanaugh and Barrett are moved by the procedural arguments pressed by the Court’s right flank, or by the arguments pressed by both Glossip and the state: That four words in Smothermon’s notes reveal a serious constitutional violation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Smothermon’s notes matter so much</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, prosecutors turned over a box of evidence for the first time to Glossip’s legal team. This box included handwritten notes from Smothermon, which included two significant questions. In the corner of the notes, Smothermon <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">wrote the words “on lithium?” and “Dr. Trumpet?”</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/glossip-note-supreme-court.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.3762739654562,100,89.247452069088\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An excerpt from a prosecutor’s handwritten notes regarding Sneed and the Glossip case. Glossip v. Oklahoma brief.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both the state and Glossip’s legal team quickly discovered that these somewhat cryptic notes were quite significant. As the state <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7466/308265/20240423202240962_2024-4-23%20Final%20OK%20AG%20Glossip%20merits%20brief.pdf\">told the justices in its brief</a>, when Sneed was incarcerated in the Oklahoma County jail, that “jail had just one working psychiatrist in 1997 when Sneed was held there: Dr. Larry Trombka.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both Glossip and the state agree that the “Dr. Trumpet” referenced by Smothermon must have been a reference to Dr. Trombka, who was “the only possible treating psychiatrist and the only medical professional at the jail qualified to prescribe lithium.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The state had also previously withheld Sneed’s medical records from Glossip’s lawyers, and these records “confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a treatment of lithium at the county jail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this matters because Sneed was the key witness against Glossip at his trial. He was the only witness who implicated Glossip in the murder, and he did so on the theory that Glossip, who managed a motel where Sneed worked, hired Glossip to kill the motel’s owner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Dr. Trombka later said that Sneed’s mental illness could have triggered a “manic episode” that would have made him “more paranoid or potentially violent.” Trombka added that Sneed’s condition was “exacerbated by illicit drug use, such as methamphetamine.” So, if Glossip’s defense lawyers had known about Sneed’s medical diagnosis, they could have argued that Sneed committed the murder because he experienced a serious mental health event, and not because he was coaxed into doing so by Glossip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During Glossip’s trial, moreover, Sneed did testify that he was given lithium at the jail, but he suggested that he was prescribed it by accident and that he “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7466/308265/20240423202240962_2024-4-23%20Final%20OK%20AG%20Glossip%20merits%20brief.pdf\">never seen no psychiatrist or anything</a>.” Thus, Smothermon’s notes do not simply suggest that Sneed lied on the stand — a fact that would have diminished his credibility with the jury — they also suggest that Smothermon knew Sneed was lying and failed to correct him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The failure to turn over Smothermon’s notes sooner, and Smothermon’s failure to correct Sneed’s testimony potentially violate the Constitution in two ways. In <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/83/\"><em>Brady v. Maryland</em></a> (1963), the Supreme Court held that prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense that is “favorable to an accused” if that evidence “is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/360/264/\"><em>Napue v. Illinois</em></a> (1959), the Court held that “a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.” This rule applies even “when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.” So, by failing to correct Sneed’s false testimony that he never saw a psychiatrist, Smothermon potentially violated <em>Napue</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, the significance of Smothermon’s notes and her alleged violation of <em>Napue</em> appeared to divide the justices. Roberts was particularly skeptical of their relevance, pointing out early in the argument that the defense counsel knew that Sneed had been prescribed lithium, so why does it matter if defense lawyers had also known that this drug, which is used primarily to treat mental health disorders, was also prescribed by a psychiatrist?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Significantly, however, Kavanaugh appeared to break with Roberts on this question. “I’m having some trouble,” he told Christopher Michel, a Court-appointed lawyer tasked with defending Glossip’s conviction because the state would not, with the idea that the jury would be unmoved if they learned that Sneed lied on the stand “when the whole case depended on his credibility.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kavanaugh also said that Sneed’s mental health diagnosis creates “all sorts of avenues for questioning his credibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So Kavanaugh, at least, appears open to the argument that Smothermon violated <em>Napue </em>or <em>Brady</em>. But it is still unclear whether five justices agree with this argument. And it is also unclear how they will approach a procedural issue that could doom Glossip’s case.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The procedural problem in the <em>Glossip</em> case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Oklahoma law, like most states and the federal government, places strict limits on anyone’s ability to challenge their conviction once that conviction is finalized and all of the defendant’s appeals are exhausted. Among other things, Oklahoma forbids someone like Glossip from making more than one post-conviction attack on that conviction unless the issues raised in a later proceeding <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/glossip-v-state-2\">could not have been raised earlier</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These barriers, moreover, are augmented by an Oklahoma state law that required Glossip to present any new evidence he discovered <a href=\"http://okcca.net/rules/rule-9.7/\">within 60 days of discovering it</a>. So Glossip’s lawyers could not take their time, gather all the evidence they needed to make the best case for their client, and then present it to the courts all at once. They had to present this evidence piecemeal or lose the ability to raise it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a result, the case currently before the Supreme Court is Glossip’s fifth legal proceeding challenging his conviction after it was finalized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before this fifth proceeding reached the justices, moreover, Oklahoma’s highest criminal court rejected his <em>Brady </em>and <em>Napue</em> arguments, in part because, the court claimed, Oklahoma’s laws limiting his ability to repeatedly challenge his conviction prevented him from raising those arguments. If the Oklahoma court is right about this point, that precludes the Supreme Court from hearing the case, because the US Supreme Court typically <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/4/23481063/supreme-court-moore-harper-independent-state-legislature-doctrine-elections\">cannot overrule a state’s highest court on a question of state law</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, most of Wednesday’s argument focused on this threshold question — does Oklahoma’s own law prevent Glossip from even raising his <em>Napue</em> and <em>Brady</em> arguments? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that Oklahoma’s attorney general is on Glossip’s side in this case plays an enormous role in the debate over this threshold question. Were Glossip alone in seeking relief, he would probably be doomed. But several justices argued that Drummond has an absolute right to waive the procedural rules that would otherwise prevent Glossip from raising his <em>Brady</em> and <em>Napue</em> claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, one of the justices who seemed to agree that Drummond has waived those procedural rules is Barrett, who noted at one point that it is very unusual for a court not to accept such a waiver. Similarly, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that there are “100 years of history” where no Oklahoma court refused to honor a similar waiver, suggesting that the state court that heard Glossip’s case made up a one-time-only rule to prevent him from challenging his conviction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, while at least four justices seemed convinced that the state court should have honored Drummond’s decision to waive the procedural bars to Glossip’s case, it is unclear whether there are five. Kavanaugh, the most likely fifth vote for Glossip, played his cards especially close to his chest, often framing his questions about whether Smothermon violated <em>Napue </em>or <em>Brady </em>with caveats like “if you get past all the procedural bars.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the bottom line is that Glossip could prevail, but he’s got a tough road. Assuming that all three of the Democratic justices are on his side, he needs to win over Barrett — who seemed to be with him on the procedural question but who was largely quiet on the merits of his case — while also winning over Kavanaugh, who seemed to be with Glossip on the merits but silent on the procedural question.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Over <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/helene-death-toll-rises-to-at-least-232-across-6-states/1700671\">230 people were killed</a> because of the storm, and that number is likely to go up as the search for missing people continues. Entire homes, streets, and towns across the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida have been torn apart. Plans for rebuilding are bound to be a slow struggle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Florida is primed to face disaster once again — before it’s even had a fair chance at recovering from the last one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Wednesday night, Hurricane Milton, currently a Category 4 storm, will make landfall on Florida’s west coast. While forecasters say it’s likely to weaken a bit before reaching Florida, government officials are <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/evacuation-orders/\">ordering millions of people in over a dozen counties</a> to evacuate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die,” <a href=\"https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1843459098148327850\">said</a> Tampa Mayor Jane Castor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tampa Bay area, in particular, is in serious trouble. The land is prone to flooding and storm surges caused by hurricane season. Most recently, Hurricane Helene caused <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2024/10/07/helene-just-flooded-tampa-bay-heres-how-much-worse-miltons-surge-could-be/\">record storm surges</a> for the city.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But now, this region may be right in Milton’s path. The last time a hurricane <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/11/18485563/hurricane-florida-climate-change-tampa\">hit the area</a> directly was 1921 — it demolished homes and killed eight people. Back then, Tampa Bay was home to 65,000 people. Today, the population is 3.1 million. While the exact location of where Milton will make landfall is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-milton-florida-10-09-24#cm21s2s9200003b6n41gytj3q\">still uncertain</a>, even on the day of its arrival, it’s clear that there is much, much more to lose this time around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The back-to-back phenomena between Hurricanes Helene and Milton spells out disaster for communities in Florida that <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-milton-helene-debris-florida/\">just barely started to rebuild and recover</a> from Helene’s damage. As Hurricane Milton imminently approaches, coastal residents and their local governments are scrambling to move the heaps of debris off the streets, which can become dangerous projectiles if swept up by the coming storm, which is currently forecasted to make landfall as a Category 4. (Hurricane Katrina, for example, made landfall as a Category 3). Some towns are still getting back up on their feet from when <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/366041/climate-hurricane-debby-drenches-the-southeast\">Hurricane Debby</a>, a large Category 1 storm that wreaked havoc by continuously dumping heavy rain over parts of Florida and flooded towns, hit back in August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Florida is no stranger to extreme weather, or even weather disasters happening one after the other. But all of the above context makes this situation feel terrifyingly different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You could call it unprecedented, because you can take a similar meteorological setup, a similar tropical magnitude hurricane in a similar physical environment, but with more people and infrastructure — that is not something we have necessarily seen in the more recent, modern time,” says <a href=\"https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/about/people/emily-powell\">Emily Powell</a>, the assistant state climatologist for the <a href=\"https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/\">Florida Climate Center</a> and program manager of the <a href=\"https://flbrace.org/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://flbrace.org/\">Florida Building Resilience Against Climate Effects</a> (BRACE) Program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I spoke in depth with Powell to better understand the gravity of the situation and how communities are confronting this uniquely destructive moment for the millions of people in Milton’s path.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I know you&#8217;re based in Florida, it&#8217;s where you do your work. How are you feeling as Milton is getting closer to making landfall?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Milton is projected to cause more destruction, more storm surge, higher storm surge levels, potentially higher rainfall rates in places along the west Gulf Coast of Florida. These are places along the coast that will see really high, high levels of storm surge that we have not seen in those places in a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene brought storm surges of between 6 and 7 feet roughly, in the west central parts of Florida. And we&#8217;re projecting to see upwards of 15 feet in some places, and so much higher levels of storm surge. I think we&#8217;ve seen people being very responsive so far to this threat. People are evacuating. It sounds like there&#8217;s been a lot of congestion in traffic, which means people are listening and heeding warnings, which is good news and I hope that that continues to happen today. We have more time to prepare, and I think people are getting sandbags, getting their places secured, and hopefully finding safer places to ride the storm out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Florida just got through Hurricane Helene barely a week and a half ago, and some communities are still recovering from Hurricane Debby&#8217;s impact two months ago. Now, the state is bracing for Hurricane Milton&#8217;s arrival. What is it like on the ground right now for people in Milton&#8217;s path, in this sort of in-between moment?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was down in Steinhatchee end of last week, and so Steinhatchee had a direct hit from Helene, and that was their third storm in 13 months in that particular part of the coast, and in Steinhatchee, Keaton Beach, and Cedar Key, and then places further south that are projected to see a direct hit from Milton,<strong> </strong>people are very much still in response and recovery. In Steinhatchee — and this looked very similar last year after Hurricane Idalia — if you drive up and down the streets, you see piles and piles of debris, trash, the insides of people&#8217;s homes on the curb, some places, and so all that is still in the process of being cleaned up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What we&#8217;re seeing right now is sort of emergency preparations to remove and clean up and dispose of all that debris, get it out of the streets where that could become a hazard as the storm approaches and makes landfall. In addition to that, some people were still without power. I think Steinhatchee actually was at roughly 85 percent power restoration. I think where power can be restored, it has been restored following Helene, but there might be instances where a particular home or building cannot receive power because of damages to that particular structure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, we&#8217;re just having to hit pause and shift gears to prepare for this next landfalling hurricane, and then more recovery and cleanup.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How did Milton take shape so quickly after Helene?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This season, in addition to the last Atlantic hurricane season, the waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, as well as in the main development region of the tropical Atlantic Ocean basin, have been incredibly warm, much warmer than normal. And in some places, record warm, and so that is one factor that contributed to a really aggressive hurricane season forecast this year is the record warm water temperatures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So here in the Gulf, about this time in the hurricane season, we tend to see more development in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, as opposed to out in the tropical Atlantic basin. So it&#8217;s not very uncommon to see a lot of activity in this part of the basin at this time of year. Because the waters have been so warm, storms like Milton have been able to spin up really, really quickly. When we have other conditions conducive to that, developments like low vertical wind shear, we see explosive intensification as we did with Milton. It has just been in an environment in the western Gulf of Mexico that has been very conducive to this very rapid intensification.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These back-to-back storms are not necessarily uncommon. We&#8217;ve seen that in many other seasons, like 2020, we&#8217;ve seen places get hit again and again, it has to do with the atmospheric patterns that are also in play that are helping to steer the storms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What do these two storms happening back to back underscore and say about the types of disasters we&#8217;re going to see in a world impacted by climate change?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve seen this happen before. It&#8217;s not unprecedented, but it does speak to the fact that no one is really immune or safe to these storms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have seen a lot of studies show that there&#8217;s been a trend toward more rapid intensification with tropical cyclones, and so when we do get storms like tropical storms or hurricanes, we do see that the ability for them to rapidly intensify is increasing, and so that is certainly something that we&#8217;ll continue to see moving forward. People have to be prepared for these larger, more destructive hurricanes, unfortunately.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How are institutions in the area, such as local organizations and state agencies, preparing and helping communities that are in the path of Milton?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think emergency responses and preparations are getting better and more efficient at warning people ahead of time, getting those evacuation orders well in advance to give people the time to actually heed the warning and evacuate. So for example, we saw roadways starting to pile up and with traffic yesterday, two days before landfall, which is really great that people can get out that soon and get to safety and not have to worry about leaving at the last minute, you know, when roadways are going to be gridlocked. We are really good about asking for help from neighboring communities to&nbsp;come in and be in place before a hurricane makes landfall, so that they can be there to respond immediately once the conditions are safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing that we&#8217;ve looked at, through a program I work on that&#8217;s focused more on climate and health, is special needs sheltering and how that works during evacuations. One of the things we found is not all the special needs registries are up to date, so not knowing who all needs special accommodations during evacuations and where they&#8217;re located. Local health departments can prepare more for understanding where their most vulnerable populations are, making sure their special needs registries are up to date, and getting those ready so that when storms like this do come, they know where those people are, and they can send help where they need to get people to evacuation shelters. So this is all stuff that has to happen before a hurricane is approaching land and making landfall. It&#8217;s a challenge and a need that&#8217;s been identified, and so we&#8217;re starting to address it.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are communities in Florida who have been hit by extreme weather events multiple times in the course of a year. From your perspective, is there a breaking point for how many times a population can deal with these extreme weather disasters, and what might that breaking point look like?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s a good question for each individual as well as each community to think about for themselves. At some point, you have to sort of weigh your own individual risk tolerance and understand what you&#8217;re willing to deal with and what you&#8217;re not. Some people are more risk averse than others. Some are more risk tolerant. So I think for us as communities, and for us individually, that&#8217;s just something we have to each ask ourselves and then take steps to increase our preparedness and just ensure that we&#8217;re as prepared as we can be for these types of storms.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is there any advice or resources that you have for Florida residents to best protect themselves who are in the path of Hurricane Milton?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The best, most credible resource is going to be the <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a>. Their website has the latest updates on the storm&#8217;s track, the storm&#8217;s intensity, the impacts, the hazards maps that they produce with the National Weather Service, your local National Weather Service office. Those are going to be the best sources of information on the storm itself. And then, of course, your local weather forecast office and your local Emergency Management Office for evacuation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Hundreds of thousands of Americans have come home to a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/350705/your-home-insurance-company-dumped-you-now-what\">breakup letter from their private insurers</a>, canceling their coverage. Others can’t find any company that will protect their home, leaving expensive, <a href=\"https://www.wwno.org/coastal-desk/2024-07-15/louisianas-business-friendly-climate-response-canceled-home-insurance-plans\">state-run insurers of last resort</a> as their only option. Some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23746045/state-farm-california-climate-change-insurance-wildfire-florida-flood\">private insurance companies</a> have entirely pulled out of states like California, Florida, and Louisiana.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), a federal program that provides flood coverage to <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11049\">4.7 million policyholders</a>, is more than <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN10784\">$20 billion in debt to the US Treasury</a> accruing $1.7 million in interest daily. In September, <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/rules-legislation/congressional-reauthorization\">Congress reauthorized the program</a> for a few months. The next funding deadline is December 20, 2024. If authorization lapses, the NFIP would stop selling and renewing flood insurance for millions of people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurers like State Farm <a href=\"https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-general-insurance-company-california-new-business-update/\">point to several factors behind these trends</a>. Inflation has made rebuilding houses much more expensive and prices for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22686124/climate-change-insurance-flood-wildfire-hurricane-risk\">reinsurance</a> — insurance for insurance companies — have shot up. Insurers are also bearing more catastrophic risks as more people and property take root in high-risk areas like flood zones and neighborhoods that are more wildfire-prone, so that when a blaze ignites or a storm passes over, the losses are greater. And because of climate change, many types of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous\">natural disasters are packing more of a punch</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The turmoil in the insurance industry has major implications for the economy and for politics. Most banks will not offer a mortgage without homeowners insurance, and letting a policy lapse can lead to foreclosure. In the wake of a hurricane or wildfire, insurance payouts are critical for rebuilding lost homes or relocating to somewhere safer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurance is also where the risks of tomorrow manifest today, and with rising average temperatures, many buildings will face bigger threats. That means homeowners will have to pay more for insurance, go without, or move to a place with lower rates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, that leaves a trio of unpleasant options. Insurers can raise their rates in line with the risks they face, pricing more people out of coverage and leaving them to fend for themselves. Regulators can limit rate hikes and enforce coverage minimums, which can drive private insurers into bankruptcy or out of the market altogether. Or the government can subsidize or offer its own coverage, which would leave taxpayers holding the bag for mounting losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite all of this, insurers themselves are actually doing quite well. The US property and casualty insurers <a href=\"https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2023%20Annual%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20Insurance%20Industries%20Analysis%20Report.pdf\">netted $823 billion in premiums</a> last year, posting record profits in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23969523/climate-change-cop28-paris-1-5-c-uae-2023-record-warm\">hottest year on record</a> with <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters\">dozens of extreme weather disasters</a> with tolls in the billions of dollars. Insurers have already <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/insurance/us-p-c-insurance-poised-for-2024-profit-recovery-post-strong-1q-results-21-06-2024\">posted even higher profits this year</a>, and the sector is poised to do <a href=\"https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/sigma-research/Insurance-Monitoring/us-property-casualty-outlook-june-2024.html\">better in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So it’s a great time to be selling insurance, but not to buy it. Insurers have shown they can thrive even in a warmer world with more costly disasters; the challenge is getting their products to the people who need them. Doing so will require changes to how states regulate insurance, how companies model catastrophes, and new insurance products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But insurance is ultimately about risk, and over the long term, there’s no substitute for reducing the overall risks stemming from climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP5811016810\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How insurance works, and how it stops working</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like most businesses, a simple calculation lies at the core of the insurance sector: A company has to make more money in premiums than it pays out in damages, but figuring out where to set premiums and how much damage to expect gets extraordinarily complicated. The most common form of property insurance is <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indemnity_insurance.asp\">indemnity</a>, which grants a payout based on the amount of damage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The formula for the losses that an insurer can expect has three key components. The first is the hazard, such as the probability of a severe storm occurring. The next is exposure, which is the value of the insured property in the path of danger. And the third is vulnerability, or how well a property can stand up to a given extreme weather scenario — whether it readily floods, burns, collapses, or survives the disaster intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurers then have to distribute these costs across their customers. Companies are competing with one another, so they can’t set their rates too high, and in many states, they face further limits on their pricing and minimum coverage requirements. There’s a whole <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm\">subfield of mathematics</a> dedicated to this practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurers themselves cover their risks with reinsurers. When a major earthquake, hurricane, or wildfire demands more payouts than a company can afford at once, insurers can file a claim with their reinsurer, which in turn is balancing disaster threats among insurance companies all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you can balance these risks properly, insurance can be a lucrative line of business, as we’ve seen over the past year. But if they tip too far in any direction, it can lead to a financial collapse. After <a href=\"https://axaxl.com/fast-fast-forward/articles/remembering-hurricane-andrews-lessons-30-years-later\">Hurricane Andrew</a> rammed into the tip of Florida at Category 5 strength in 1992, causing $25 billion in insured losses (1992 dollars), at least 16 insurance companies became insolvent.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-842979178.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7570938182872,100,80.485812363426\" alt=\"A man drawing on a clip board. \" title=\"A man drawing on a clip board. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A State Farm catastrophe claims adjuster draws a sketch while surveying a home affected by Hurricane Harvey in Rockport, Texas. | Eddie Seal/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\" Eddie Seal/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The storm was a <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-features/2022/05/16/667461.htm\">major turning point for the insurance sector</a>. It showed that the old formulas for calculating risk underestimated how much destruction could end up on an insurer&#8217;s books. After the waters receded, companies began to adopt <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/resources/about-catastrophe-modeling/\">catastrophe models</a>, computer programs that use the physical traits of extreme weather events in a given area to estimate how much an insurer might have to pay out. This raised rates for many homeowners, but also led insurers to <a href=\"https://www.rms.com/blog/2022/08/24/30-years-on-from-hurricane-andrew-managing-a-storm-of-floridas-own-making\">advocate for stronger building codes</a> and defensive infrastructure like sea walls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now even catastrophe models are starting to show their weaknesses. These simulations are typically built on historical severe weather patterns, but because average temperatures are rising, the past is no longer prologue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Integrating climate change into catastrophe models and then into insurance premiums is its own technical challenge. Scientists are still trying to suss out exactly how much warming is in store given that the biggest factor is how aggressively the world will act to limit greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even within physical models of the Earth, there is still a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374253/climate-chamge-model-warming-ipcc-record-heat\">wide range of uncertainty</a> in how these gasses will alter weather. Insurers then have to gauge just how bad of a disaster they have to plan for, by what time frame, and then how to distribute those costs to policyholders in the present.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, the number of people is increasing in areas that are vulnerable to disasters worsened by climate change. Roughly <a href=\"https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/economics-and-demographics.html\">40 percent of the US</a> lives in a coastal county, for example, and in states like Florida, the waterfront has experienced some of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23372996/hurricane-ian-tampa-florida-miami-storm-surge-flood\">highest levels of population growth</a>. Just how many more people will build bungalows, condos, and office parks in places likely to burn or flood will shape payouts in the future — and thus premiums today. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reinsurance companies have been bracing for climate change for decades</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Incorporating climate change into their business may be a more recent development for retail insurers, but reinsurance companies have long kept tabs on warming. While the fundamentals of risk management are similar, reinsurance companies and retail insurance firms operate under different constraints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Frontline insurance companies tend to focus on specific regions and operate under local regulations, while the reinsurance business spans the globe in a freewheeling market. That gives reinsurers a more diverse risk portfolio and more flexibility in managing it, but they also must examine these risks on a global scale over decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, has studied climate change for 50 years, and their chief climate scientist, Ernst Rauch, has been working on this since for more than half of that time. While climate change is altering the risks on their balance sheets, Rauch said understanding the fundamental physics behind it has helped the company game out what to expect and adjust accordingly. With climate science, what was once a blank, uncertain view of the future is now coming into focus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We feel very well prepared to cope with the challenges of climate change,” Rauch said. “And with this understanding we want to not only continue with this business, but depending on the terms and conditions, also grow our business model.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This knowledge also lays a course for reducing the financial and physical threats from warming, for companies and for policymakers. Looking at the three-pronged formula for insurance risk — hazard, exposure, and vulnerability — climate change mainly comes into play with the hazard component since rising average temperatures increase the chances of weather events causing more destruction. That provides the impetus for halting the rise in greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2176489369.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.735459053117,100,78.529081893765\" alt=\"Couple looking at remains of burned down cabin.\" title=\"Couple looking at remains of burned down cabin.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Katie and Regis Saalfeld at the remains of their cabin in Holy Jim Canyon on Thursday, October 3, 2024.

For a house built decades ago, simply buying the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPS081\">lumber</a>, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU3241223241222\">shingles</a>, and <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU32733273\">concrete</a> for repairs after a storm is much more expensive now than it was when that house was built. Residential reconstruction costs have <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/4a3257/siteassets/media/underwriting-v/resources/360value-quarterly/360value-q3-2024.pdf\">risen almost 5 percent </a>in just the past year. Add to that the higher cost of labor and rising property values, which makes losses more expensive, and insurance costs go up independent of climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reducing vulnerability to disasters is one of the most immediate things people can do to keep threats in check. “This is where we as consumers, as policyholders, have the biggest influence on the risk,” Rauch said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tactics like preventing flooding by <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/habitat-restoration-projects-offer-protection-flooding\">restoring natural watersheds</a> and <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2023/11/valuing-prescribed-fire\">controlled burns</a> to reduce the odds of a deadly wildfire can blunt the impact of a disaster. Adapting to climate perils like sea level rise with tactics like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/miami-fl-seawall-hurricanes.html\">seawalls</a> or using <a href=\"https://emilms.fema.gov/IS320/WM0103020text.htm\">fire-resistant building materials</a> in wildfire-prone forests can allow properties to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5100886/lahaina-wildfire-maui-building-defensible-space\">endure a catastrophe</a>. But to drive down insurance premiums with these measures, insurers have to first recognize and reward the homeowners and property managers that undertake them, and they don’t always do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The computer models that insurers use to decide whether to renew or write insurance for homes and condominiums don&#8217;t always account for those investments in mitigation by homeowners,” said <a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/about/people/dave-jones-2/\">Dave Jones</a>, who runs the Climate Risk Initiative at the University of California Berkeley and served as California’s insurance commissioner from 2011 until 2018.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reinsurance companies also connect the impacts of disasters around the world. Their international portfolios allow them to withstand billions of dollars in insured losses. But that also means that a gargantuan disaster can create financial burdens even for people far removed from the destruction. If a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-typhoon-krathon-rain-e4acaaf0fbf22779c1f0124ee2f2712b\">massive typhoon hits Taiwan</a> and causes extensive insured losses, reinsurers may have to raise their premiums for retail insurers, who would then raise their prices for policies in Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Climate change isn’t the biggest factor behind the recent insurance premium spikes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many insurance companies say climate change is a key driver of long-term risk. Right now though, only 1 percent of the overall annual increase in insured losses seen so far is due to actual changes in the climate, according to <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/resources/campaigns/modeling-insured-catastrophe-losses-a-global-perspective-for-2024/\">Verisk</a>, a risk analytics firm. The larger force to date is growing exposure due to inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Verisk’s <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/company/about/leadership/rob-newbold/\">Rob Newbold</a>, who studies extreme events, noted that many of the disasters that insurers are worried about do stem from the climate, but they’re already built into insurance rates (or they should be). And the specific role of rising average temperatures exacerbating these catastrophes so far hasn’t shown up in a big way in the data. The trend right now seems to be “ordinary” extreme weather falling on more expensive homes and businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don&#8217;t want to try to suggest that climate change isn&#8217;t happening. The climate is changing. But climate itself has been a factor in insurance losses forever,” Newbold said. “We’re seeing this overall level of insured losses [rising], but from our perspective, the industry should not be surprised by this because the tools exist to quantify that risk.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2175073374.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.6701117381746,100,90.659776523651\" alt=\"Aerial view of truck driving down a flooded road.\" title=\"Aerial view of truck driving down a flooded road.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A vehicle drives through flood waters after Hurricane Helene hit the area as it passed offshore on September 27, 2024, in Crystal River, Florida. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to inflation, there are other local factors that have driven up the costs of insurance in some states. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23746045/state-farm-california-climate-change-insurance-wildfire-florida-flood\">major insurance firms like State Farm and Allstate</a> announced they would not sign new property insurance policies in California because the losses they were facing from perils like wildfires were too much to bear at the rates they were allowed to charge (State Farm and Allstate did not respond to requests for comment). Other insurers <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/350705/your-home-insurance-company-dumped-you-now-what\">dropped thousands of Californians</a> from their existing policies. Similarly, <a href=\"https://weartv.com/news/local/floridas-home-insurance-crisis-worsens-as-companies-exit-leaving-citizens-overloaded\">Florida has also seen private insurers leave the state</a> and drop customers in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/people/jerry-theodorou/\">Jerry Theodorou</a>, who leads insurance research at the R Street Institute, a free market think tank, noted that insurers in California face regulations that limit their ability to increase rates and for a long time blocked them from using forward-looking catastrophe models to set their prices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“California was a special case largely for regulatory reasons,” Theodorou said. “The main driver of the high premiums in Florida was plaintiff attorney firms run amok.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Florida is home to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">6.5 percent of the US population</a> but accounts for 79 percent of all <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/press-release/triple-i-extreme-fraud-and-litigation-causing-floridas-homeowners-insurance-markets-demise-062322\">homeowners insurance lawsuits</a>. The state has also become a <a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2024/09/02/florida-homeowners-need-to-be-careful-about-persistent-roofing-scams-cfo-says/\">hot spot for roofing scams</a> where roofing companies would seek out homes after a disaster to offer a cheap roof replacement and then turn around and bill insurance companies for much more expensive work. When insurance companies balk, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/roofing-scams-florida-property-insurance-hurricane-rcna29649\">the roofers sue</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So while climate change is increasing hazards over the long term, right now policy choices, economic trends, and market forces are driving most of the disruption in property insurance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is the future insurable?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That depends on who you ask.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">States have begun to take steps to lure insurance companies back. The Golden State is <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release011-2024.cfm\">beginning to allow insurers to incorporate catastrophe models</a> that anticipate the future while the Sunshine State just implemented a new <a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/florida-insurance-market-on-the-mend/\">law to limit insurance lawsuits</a>. States are also <a href=\"https://mysafeflhome.com/\">updating building codes and offering insurance discounts</a> for people who do things like upgrade their windows, use fire-resistant materials, and strengthen the frame of their homes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The tools are there,” Theodorou said. “They need to be deployed more.” He added that a <a href=\"https://www.reinsurancene.ws/proposed-legislation-could-reshape-catastrophe-reinsurance-landscape-in-us-goldman-sachs/\">government-run reinsurance company</a> as some legislators have proposed would only <a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/another-government-run-insurance-scheme-is-last-thing-the-nation-needs/\">entrench the current flaws of the insurance market</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And some insurers are responding. Earlier this year, Allstate said it would <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/making-it-in-the-bay/allstate-raise-california-home-insurance-rates/3637913/\">come back to California</a> under one condition: It gets to raise home insurance rates by an average of 34 percent.&nbsp;In North Carolina, insurers are asking state regulators to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-home-insurance-hearing-helene-96549139712a6c35fd0cb6e69b755d5d\">raise rates by an average of 42 percent</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite these challenges, the insurance industry is still profitable, <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/property-casualty-insurance\">investors continue to demonstrate an appetite for risk</a>, and insurance requirements to get a home loan haven’t changed, so it’s not going to fade away anytime soon. At the right price, there is theoretically an insurance policy that can cover even the most precarious home. “Technically everything could be insurable for the right amount of protection and the right amount of mitigation,” Newbold said. “There&#8217;s no such property you can&#8217;t put coverage on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s no guarantee that anyone would be able to buy such a policy. Some insurers offer alternatives and complements to conventional indemnity insurance. <a href=\"https://www.munichre.com/en/solutions/for-industry-clients/parametric-solutions.html\">Parametric insurance</a>, which pays a fixed amount based on the strength of a disaster rather than the extent of the damage, is one approach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jones echoed that a government-run insurer wouldn’t solve the underlying disruption in the insurance sector and agreed that inflation and greater exposure are the major factors driving price hikes right now. “However, none of those two factors would matter near as much if there weren’t more severe and frequent weather events due to climate change,” Jones said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He added that even though Florida fulfilled much of the insurance industry’s wishlist, such as protection from lawsuits and state-funded reinsurance, companies like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/insurance-florida-business-desantis-a6c3a8e6127ecbf270099e87238ed47e\">Farmers Insurance are still exiting the state</a>. “Florida may well be proof that we&#8217;re not going to rate our way out of this problem,” Jones said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also important to remember that insured losses are only the starting point for grappling with a disaster. According to Munich Re, <a href=\"https://www.munichre.com/en/risks/natural-disasters.html\">more than half of natural disaster losses</a> were not insured. Many of the people facing the greatest dangers from weather extremes are also the least equipped to deal with them and most likely to suffer in the aftermath. The dollar values don’t convey the entire social cost of a calamity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without halting greenhouse gas emissions, these problems are only going to get harder. According to Jones, the rising risks from unchecked warming is going to make it practically impossible for insurers to stay in the game over the long term. “Insurers are not magicians; they can&#8217;t wave a wand and make the risk go away,” Jones said. “Ultimately, it all goes back to the climate crisis.” </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Insured losses from natural disasters around the world in the first half of the year have already topped $60 billion, 54 percent higher than the 10-year average. Three-quarters of insured losses were due to severe thunderstorms, flooding, and forest fires. More recent calamities like Hurricane Helene will push the toll this year much higher.

As Africa struggles with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/24/24048361/mpox-covid-outbreak-africa-cdc-public-health\">compounding public health challenges</a>, this one presents a rare chance to test new vaccines that could save lives across the continent in the future.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first patient infected with the virus in the country died on September 8, the World Health Organization (WHO) said at a press conference Thursday. As of October 8, a total of <a href=\"https://x.com/RwandaHealth/status/1843359969313468874\">56 cases and 12 deaths</a> have been reported, making it one of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/index.html\">largest</a> Marburg outbreaks in history. Although most infections are among health care workers from two hospitals in Kigali, the capital of the East African country, seven of Rwanda’s 30 districts have seen cases. It is the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537\">first</a> time the virus has been known to cause infections in Rwanda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.\">indicated</a> the outbreak is highly likely to spread to neighboring countries, but the risk of further global spread is low. Typically, humans become infected when they come into contact with a Marburg-carrying Egyptian <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">fruit bat</a>, a species found across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of western Asia. Once a person has the virus, though, it can then spread to others through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces and materials, like clothing or bedding. This mode of transmission means that Marburg virus will not spread as easily as, say, Covid-19 or other respiratory diseases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Already, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537\">one person</a> who came into contact with an infected patient in Rwanda has traveled to Belgium, underscoring the possibility of isolated overseas cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, Marburg virus disease is fatal in about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.\">50 percent</a> of patients, but in some previous outbreaks, the mortality rate has exceeded 80 percent.

Between 1967 and 2008, the US, Germany, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands have reported Marburg disease among travelers returning from Uganda.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To date, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for Marburg virus disease, but there are <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-candidate-vaccines-and-treatments-marburg-disease#:~:text=Vaccine%20candidates-,At%20least%2028%20vaccine%20candidates%20against%20Marburg%20virus%20are%20at,availability%20for%20deployment%20in%20trials.\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-candidate-vaccines-and-treatments-marburg-disease#:~:text=Vaccine%20candidates-,At%20least%2028%20vaccine%20candidates%20against%20Marburg%20virus%20are%20at,availability%20for%20deployment%20in%20trials.\">at least 28 vaccines in various stages</a> of development, <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true\">four</a> of which have been prioritized by the WHO. All four have been <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true\">effective</a> in studies involving animals. A small, early-stage clinical <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract\">trial</a> in humans had promising results; however, study participants who received the Marburg vaccine were not exposed to the virus to test how protective the shot was. Two other <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">vaccines</a> for Ebola virus could also be effective against Marburg virus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Immediately after the first Marburg cases were reported, Rwandan health officials and the World Health Organization started coordinating with a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010805\">consortium</a> of researchers and vaccine manufacturers to hold clinical trials for these vaccines. This week, the first doses reached the country, and health care workers have started receiving the vaccine. If the trials are successful, then scientists will finally have tools to swiftly quell and even prevent future Marburg crises.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What’s Rwanda’s vaccine plan?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of the four Marburg vaccines that researchers have been developing, the cAd3-Marburg vaccine developed by the National <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/\">Institute</a> of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) had progressed further in clinical trials before the current outbreak began. Last year, the NIAID tested the vaccine for safety in humans for the first time in a phase 1 clinical <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract\">trial</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Forty healthy adults received one of two different doses of the vaccine and were monitored for adverse reactions and to see if their immune systems produced antibodies, an indication that the vaccine would be effective if the individuals were exposed to the virus. The vaccine was deemed safe, and 95 percent of the participants had developed antibodies four weeks after receiving it. But the participants were never exposed to the virus, so the vaccine’s practical effectiveness<strong> </strong>— as in how well it prevented severe disease and death — was not evaluated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.sabin.org/\">Sabin Vaccine Institute</a> started a <a href=\"https://www.sabin.org/resources/sabin-vaccine-institute-begins-phase-2-clinical-trial-for-marburg-vaccine-in-uganda/\">phase 2</a> clinical <a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05817422?cond=Marburg%20Virus%20Disease&amp;term=Sabin&amp;rank=1\">trial</a> for the NIAID vaccine in Uganda and Kenya. Healthy adults will randomly be assigned to receive the vaccine or a placebo shot and then will again be monitored for adverse responses and antibody responses. Like in previous studies, participants will not be exposed to the Marburg virus during this trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is typical of early stage clinical <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/timeline\">trials</a>. Phase 1 and Phase 2 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/how-developed-approved.html\">trials</a> focus primarily on evaluating the safety of a new vaccine or drug and making sure that the vaccine triggers the immune system. (A vaccine’s ability to trigger the immune system does not equate exactly to being able to prevent severe illness or death.) During these trials, the vaccine or drug is given only to healthy people, usually adults, in controlled clinical environments. Normally, during these early trials, study participants are not exposed to the pathogen that the vaccine or treatment protects against. That doesn’t happen until Phase 3 trials when thousands of volunteers randomly receive either the vaccine or treatment being tested or a placebo and then leave the clinic to live their normal lives. Researchers follow the study participants to see if there is a difference in disease severity or other outcomes between the two groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Testing vaccines for Marburg virus disease presents a particular challenge because the disease usually pops up unexpectedly and quickly ignites into a deadly outbreak. Like with Ebola, researchers can try to roll out a trial in the middle of an outbreak. That is exactly what public health officials and vaccine manufacturers are doing right now amid the emergency situation in Rwanda.<br><br>On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.sabin.org/resources/sabin-vaccine-institute-delivers-marburg-vaccines-to-combat-outbreak-in-rwanda/\">700 vaccine doses</a> arrived in Rwanda. So far, health care workers in Rwanda — who make up the majority of infections and have historically been at high risk of Marburg infection&nbsp;— have started receiving the vaccine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Researchers and health officials have been preparing for this. Earlier this year, scientists from the WHO and 17 countries at risk for Marburg virus outbreaks developed <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/02/20/default-calendar/building-research-readiness-for-a-future-filovirus-outbreak-workshop-february-20-22-2024-uganda\">protocols</a> to test both <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/consultation-rdb/vx-discussion_martha-nason_who-filovirus-workshop-key-analyses-and-endpoints.pdf?sfvrsn=fccf158_3\">vaccines</a> and treatments during an outbreak. The protocols described a ring vaccination strategy where contacts of infected people are vaccinated. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists may also test a treatment that uses antibodies, proteins made by the immune system to kill viruses and other pathogens, against the virus. One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5719873/\">study</a> found that treating animals such as guinea pigs and monkeys with these antibodies after they were infected with Marburg virus prevented serious illness and death. Medical workers successfully treated patients with antibody <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00552-2/fulltext\">cocktails</a> during previous Ebola virus outbreaks. There will also be a trial for the antiviral drug <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=DChcSEwiozJ6Rtv-IAxXPMggFHRlsD94YABAAGgJtZA&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsJO4BhDoARIsADDv4vA-YPOlHiytg0cmx2RoveTtgD5c1Iu-3VxKlTWFLw0ASZ-KEyCJx3AaAmgWEALw_wcB&amp;ei=InsFZ6CqKuKX5OMPwsHA2AQ&amp;sig=AOD64_1C_SP3SXf9e8MRNuDgQ_OfEcX_aA&amp;q&amp;sqi=2&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwigw5iRtv-IAxXiC3kGHcIgEEsQ0Qx6BAgkEAE\">Remdesivir,</a> which was used during the Covid-19 pandemic, said Sabin Nsanzimana, the minister of health in Rwanda, during a <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/news-item/weekly-special-press-briefing-on-the-mpox-outbreak-and-other-health-emergencies-in-africa-2/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://africacdc.org/news-item/weekly-special-press-briefing-on-the-mpox-outbreak-and-other-health-emergencies-in-africa-2/\">press conference</a> last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The WHO’s ethics committee had already approved protocols to test vaccines and the antibody treatment before the outbreak began, a spokesperson told Vox. Last week, a Rwandan ethics committee approved a phase 2<strong> </strong>trial protocol for the Marburg vaccine. Because of the deadly threat the virus poses to health care workers, all study participants will receive the vaccine. No one will receive a placebo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One other potential hurdle remains. Before the outbreak, there were fewer than <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true\">2,000</a> total vaccine doses available. In April 2023, the Sabin Vaccine Institute had produced about 850 of those doses. Oxford University, which is developing another Marburg vaccine, had about 1,000 doses. Larger-scale production could be needed, especially if the outbreak becomes more widespread. However, the Sabin Vaccine Institute has already produced another thousand doses which will arrive in Rwanda later this week, a spokesperson for the Sabin Vaccine Institute told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Marburg outbreak has ignited amid a surging mpox outbreak in the region, which the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern\">declared</a> an international health emergency in August. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, which neighbors Rwanda, is the <a href=\"https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/\">epicenter</a> of the mpox outbreak. (The DRC has not yet recorded any Marburg cases.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fortunately, Rwanda has one of the <a href=\"https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/rwandas-health-care-success-holds-lessons-others\">strongest</a> public health systems in Africa and has only reported a handful of mpox cases. An estimated <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10926934/\">90 percent</a> of the population have health insurance, much higher than most of its neighbors. Rwanda also has a strong infectious disease surveillance <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/lessons-rwanda-building-systems-protect-against-infectious-diseases-and-biothreats\">system</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424001800\">history</a> of successfully containing outbreaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes it an ideal setting for testing a Marburg vaccine during the current outbreak. That local and international scientists have been able to coordinate trials so quickly is <a href=\"https://x.com/Craig_A_Spencer/status/1843049604394389660\">unprecedented</a> and marks a huge milestone in outbreak response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 9, 10:37 am:</strong> This story was originally published on October 4 and has been updated to include the number of deaths so far, information about the newly initiated trial in Rwanda, and how this trial differs from a traditional clinical setting.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

I&#8217;d much rather receive texts or emails about policy ideas, what the candidate would do if they won, or maybe even what they&#8217;re doing with the money they&#8217;re receiving. Am I the only one that is frustrated by candidates only seeming to care about money when talking to their would-be constituents?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just you: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/technology/political-text-messages-pelosi-trump.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/technology/political-text-messages-pelosi-trump.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">A lot of people</a> don’t like being repeatedly asked for money, even if they agree with the cause their donation would support. But as frustrating as the deluge of requests for campaign donations over text and email may be, there is a reason behind these fundraising tactics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, as you noted, campaigns desperately need the money. It’s become incredibly expensive to run a successful campaign, especially when challenging an incumbent. That money may make a difference in helping introduce a candidate and their positions to the electorate.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/explain-it-to-me-newsletter-sign-up\">Explain It to Me newsletter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newsletter is part of Vox’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me\">Explain It to Me</a>. Each week, we tackle a question from our audience and deliver a digestible explainer from one of our journalists. Have a question you want us to answer? Ask us <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/ask-vox\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the other thing is: Asking people for money — even in hyperbolic ways — works. Research suggests that people are much more <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272709000668#:~:text=The%20results%20confirm%20the%20hypothesis,solicited%20and%20the%20contribution%20amount\">likely to give</a> to charities when they’re asked to do so. Recent history suggests the same is true of political campaigns. Vice President Kamala Harris has been aggressive in soliciting donations; she brought in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/16/harris-campaign-elevates-independent-super-pacs-others-before-final-push/\">$615 million</a> in the first six weeks after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Her campaign has not yet announced its fundraising haul for September, but she is expected to continue to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/02/trump-fundraising-september-2024-00182263\">outpace Trump</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not to say that candidates don’t try to engage with their constituents on the issues, sometimes even within their communications asking for donations. A candidate’s approach to messaging comes down to individual style. But when an election is tight, and the odds are against a candidate, money matters a lot — and candidates may choose to prioritize fundraising pleas over other types of communication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>So, just how expensive is it to run a campaign? And how did we end up with such costly elections?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Texas, where I’m based, the Senate campaign between Democrat Colin Allred and Republican incumbent Ted Cruz has been incredibly costly already. Allred spent <a href=\"https://x.com/AdImpact_Pol/status/1836878484574007800\">$37 million</a> on aired ads as of mid-September, almost three times what Cruz, the incumbent, had spent at that point. That spending has been largely powered by small donors, with an <a href=\"https://colinallred.com/news/momentum-to-beat-ted-cruz-builds-as-allred-raises-1-million-in-24-hours-and-public-polls-show-tied-race/\">average donation amount of about $35</a>. National Democrats think <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/texas/\">there’s a chance that Allred can win</a>, but he will likely have to spend even more to do so in what is still a red state, despite the fact that Cruz has <a href=\"https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/ted-cruz-job-approval-trend-0\">consistently low approval ratings</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The high cost of running is partially a function of the fact that Texas is a large state with a population of 30 million people, 254 counties, and 20 different media markets. The money Allred is raising has to support not just ads but also campaign staffers and volunteer efforts, including organizing events, rallies, data-sharing, phone banks, block walking, voter registration, and other get-out-the-vote efforts across the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But high spending is also a result of the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained\"><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em></a>. That decision allowed corporations and outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections, often via super PACs — a kind of fundraising vehicle — that operate independently of campaigns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since <em>Citizens United</em>, spending on elections up and down the ballot has gone way up: In 2008, the last presidential election before the decision, spending on congressional campaigns <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/4413959-citizens-united-anniversary-kicks-off-expensive-start-to-2024-election/\">totaled about $3 billion</a>, adjusted for inflation; in 2020, also a presidential election year, it totaled $10 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Research suggests that challengers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/upshot/a-campaign-dollars-power-is-more-valuable-to-a-challenger.html\">benefit more from campaign spending</a> than incumbents, and that for any candidate, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/18/1245495936/do-early-campaign-ads-really-make-a-diffence-in-the-presidential-election\">early spending is more effective than late spending</a> — which may partly motivate campaigns’ sense of urgency when they solicit donations from voters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Incumbents don’t benefit as much from campaign spending because voters often already know who they are and what they stand for. Usually, there isn’t much room to change voters’ minds about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, the kinds of ardent partisans who often receive requests to donate may appreciate efforts to try — like through engagement on policy — but generally, the focus on voter outreach during elections is about keeping money flowing and wooing more persuadable voters.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Does bombarding people with fundraising appeals actually work?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If digital advertising firms weren’t successful in soliciting donations by asking repeatedly, they wouldn’t do it. That said, there’s a growing divide in Democratic circles about the best way to go about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While fundraising requests focused on urgency are a tried and true method, some Democrats are beginning to ask if it might be better to, as you suggested, bring in a little more policy talk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of late, some firms have been criticized for overly aggressive fundraising tactics. The Democratic firm <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/24/mothership-strategies-democratic-fundraising-00128548\">Mothership Strategies</a>, for instance, had a big presence in the 2022 midterms and became infamous for sensationalist fundraising campaigns falsely claiming that Republicans were forcing Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to resign and that voter donations could help “DESTROY Trump’s extremist Supreme Court.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those tactics generated a lot of money — but they also earned blowback. Democratic candidates had largely cut ties with the firm by April 2023. Jake Lipsett, a founder of the firm, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/24/mothership-strategies-democratic-fundraising-00128548\">defended the firm’s strategies to Politico</a> later that year, saying that they were able to generate a lot of money and that it was “beneficial for the Democratic Party and the progressive movement because it’s having such a large impact on races across the board.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you bombard people with spam emails and texts, if you lie to them and say that there are fake octuple donor matches, if you send them emails and say the sky is falling, that works,” said Zack Malitz, a Democratic consultant who worked on Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 Senate campaign in Texas. “You can scare people into giving money that way. But it does long-term damage to the credibility of Democrats.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is there a better way to fundraise?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hector Sigala, the cofounder of Middle Seat, another Democratic digital ad firm, said that there’s a better way to go about communicating with donors and asking for their support, financial and otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That can involve describing a candidate’s positions and being honest with voters about the role their donations play. Some, but not all, candidates are already doing this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sigala’s firm sent out an email from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) that explicitly acknowledged the “scare tactics” some politicians engage in to get voters to donate and said that’s not what her campaign is about: “Instead of guilt tripping you for not donating enough, we want our emails to provide value to you. We try to send out informative, educational content.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The firm also ran an email campaign for Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) in which he explained the significance of his tattoos, linking the artwork to Fetterman’s policy positions: They included the dates on which people were killed, some via gun violence, in the city of Braddock while he served as mayor. He outlined how he helped address violence as mayor and said he would similarly fight for “every Pennsylvanian” — with the help of grassroots donors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These kinds of communications can deliver <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/john-fetterman-fundraising-2022-20220712.html\">record-breaking fundraising numbers</a>, Sigala said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We&#8217;re treating our supporters like smart people [who] really give a damn about what we&#8217;re talking about,” he said. “It just works a lot better than ‘midnight deadlines,’ fake matches, and ‘the sky is falling.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, if my inbox and texts are any indication, Sigala’s firm remains the exception.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story was featured in the Explain It to Me newsletter.

Men can also divorce and remarry, or divorce and remarry and divorce again, over and over, as many times as their hearts desire. According to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/marriages-and-divorces.html\">Census Bureau</a>, roughly 33 percent of straight men who have ever been married have also been divorced,<strong> </strong>and the older a man gets, the more likely it is he will have been divorced at some point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story first appeared in The Highlight.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/support-now\">Support our journalism</a> today for early access to our <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight\">digital magazine</a> every month—plus other great member benefits.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that’s not what people mean when they call a man the most divorced.<strong> </strong>In describing men this way, wordsmiths have crafted a critical spectrum to reflect their <a href=\"https://x.com/gerrycanavan/status/1560969959991398400\">dismay</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/BETTYDR4PER/status/1830364444993442222\">concern</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/adamgreeney/status/1654461375291244546\">disgust</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/hunteryharris/status/1389340944374317060\">chagrin</a>, and often <a href=\"https://x.com/mattxiv/status/1602718142446305280\">sexual aversion</a> at a specific hypermasculinity shared by high-profile <a href=\"https://x.com/TomatoGrandpa/status/1589821619987697664\">divorced guys</a>. Journalist and critic Hunter Harris has a recurring bit about “<a href=\"https://hunterharris.substack.com/p/the-most-divorced-man-in-the-world\">the most divorced</a>” men, naming Kanye West, <a href=\"https://x.com/RightWingCope/status/1778378068706365592\">Elon Musk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a19483751/ben-affleck-phoenix-back-tattoo-real/\">Ben Affleck</a>, <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/joe-jonas-divorced-dad-outfits/\">Joe Jonas,</a> and Jeff Bezos as examples. It’s a distinction that’s<strong> </strong>not about the number of times a man’s marriages have dissolved but rather the severity of his resulting aura and how he presents himself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An example: Musk is divorced, but he is <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1597165510595989504?lang=en\">the most divorced</a> when he’s posting a picture of guns, cans of caffeine-free Diet Coke, and a small reprint of George Washington crossing the Delaware River on his nightstand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While behavior varies, the aesthetic of the most divorced man remains remarkably consistent, and that is tight, sometimes shiny, clothes and a starter pack of flashy accessories.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The derision this look receives raises an important question: If the most divorced man is to be avoided, then why do certain men, especially famous ones, continue to dress&nbsp;so divorced? Why is the most divorced guy aesthetic so popular, even when the most divorced guy persona is not?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a man and why is he so divorced?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be clear, it’s not that all divorced men wear a certain set of clothes; it’s that some newly single straight guys dress and accessorize in a way that eroticizes a violently loveless persona. Usually it involves <a href=\"https://x.com/kylietcheung/status/1820526558622396879\">leather</a>, a lot of black, and a snug fit. Just as important are the add-ons: aviators, a bracelet or other jewelry like an expensive watch, <a href=\"https://x.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/1005461184764669952\">cigars</a> and a fancy lighter, and less appreciated trimmings like <a href=\"https://x.com/neoliberal_dad/status/1178126018588098561\">guns</a> and cryptocurrency. It’s as though these men may be asked to shoot something and then light it on fire, all in a designer T-shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s about the kind of middle-aged guy that’s hitting the club in a certain kind of jacket, in a certain kind of shirt and certain kind of jeans and shoes, and he just kind of looks like a guy who’s trying to appeal to a 22-year-old,” said <a href=\"https://x.com/dieworkwear?\">Derek Guy</a>. Guy, the founder of <a href=\"https://dieworkwear.com/\">Die, Workwear!</a>, has also become a celebrity on X for his expertise in menswear. “And it’s not just like, going to Target, for example. They’re going to a little bit more of an upscale store, but at the same time, they’re probably buying into trends that are 10 to 20 years old, and they haven’t kept up with how trends and things have moved.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ben Affleck debuts faux-hawk haircut as managers reportedly work on divorce <a href=\"https://t.co/6xjgKYKVt3\">https://t.co/6xjgKYKVt3</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vXvTgWxb82\">pic.twitter.com/vXvTgWxb82</a></p>&mdash; Page Six (@PageSix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PageSix/status/1820517395946946746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 5, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Guy explained that these fits are even more glaring now that actual young people are wearing oversized or baggier clothing. But his example isn’t that far off from divorced dudes from previous generations trying to look younger — nor is it that far off from what’d we previously label as midlife-crisis chic (leather jackets, hair dye and/or a toupee, a convertible).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All these strong aesthetic choices mean that the most divorced men don’t actually have to be divorced at all. What’s key here is a mood, a feeling, a state of existence that most of us want no part of. Being able to clock it from a distance — from a phone screen, preferably — becomes a shared relief. The beauty of the most divorced guy archetype is that he is rarely, if ever, in the same room as us but, at the same time, is ubiquitous, like a boogeyman who loves Las Vegas nightlife.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While we’re likely pulling these ideas from what we see in the media of very rich and powerful celebrities like Musk, <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/jeff-bezos-new-years-eve-miami-style\">Bezos</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/kylietcheung/status/1820526558622396879\">Affleck</a>, who have access to stylists and social media managers —&nbsp;Guy encourages us to think about the way we project meaning onto fashion, and onto the men, famous or regular, wearing these clothes. On one level, a man dressing in uber-divorced men’s garb may be clinging to an expression of masculinity. But the people making this judgment have also created a narrative in their heads about what kind of person he is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Guy worries that as this spreads to regular guys who want to experiment in their fashion, divorced or not, it ends up having a chilling effect. “I’m careful with the term”— divorced guy — “because I always want to make it easier for guys to get into what I consider a hobby,” Guy said. “And using the term can make guys worried [about fashion] and just puts another obstacle, another fear, on the road to them finding something that I think can be very fulfilling.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The delineation is in the intent and awareness. As Guy points out, some guys buy a Rolex because they want you to think certain things about them, their power, their wealth, their manhood; other guys just really like watches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With this in mind, it seems that what unifies the divorced guy style is that they wear their masculinity as a shield. They want you to think they’re too manly to be contained, which they illustrate with choices everyone knows no woman had a hand in. What they might not have done, however, is reconcile the husband they used to be with the man they’re becoming now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why don’t men simply not dress divorced?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Few people knowingly pick out a visually unpleasant outfit because they think it’s horrible. Deliberately doing that would be clown behavior. There’s some disconnect there, a gulf between what one person thinks looks good and what marks them to others as an insidious archetype. That disconnect might be reflecting something deeper. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s one thing that I am really aware of is that there are so many resources out there for divorced women and women going through divorce. And I don’t think there’s the same kind of support for men,” said Alexandra Solomon, a psychologist specializing in relationships. She explained that because of this support, women have a better understanding of what life post-divorce looks like, whereas men — billionaires and non-billionaires alike — don’t have that same kind of clarity and backing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There really is a dearth of community support and conversation about how to help men transition out of marriage in a way that honors the profound shift in identity that occurs when you come out of a divorce.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But how does that loss and confusion turn into purchasing a horrific shirt? Does a lack of resources compel a man to post pictures of beers and guns for clout? Are men just aesthetically violent sleeper agents waiting for activation, and is that trigger divorce?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are myriad steps between a split and buying an outfit to reflect said split. Solomon explained that what lives between — or, crucially, fails to — is a psychological term called “<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-01707-011?doi=1\">self-concept clarity</a>.” Essentially, this is how human beings frame our own identity and how well we think we know ourselves. She said studies have shown that when people go through emotional breakups, their sense of self shatters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We don’t need to laugh at them and we don’t need to pity them,” Solomon said of men who make bold fashion choices following a breakup. “But we could be curious about what it is they’re displaying. Reclamation? Transition? A new identity? We’re all generally clunky about all those things.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ego death coupled with a lack of emotional support may be why certain men seek out the divorced guy aesthetic. Hypermasculine clothes and other external markers help them self-identify or graft an idea of what they perceive being a single man to be onto who they already are. Divorced guy aesthetic is, often, an impression of a single man — a caricature of another caricature, but absent irony or self-awareness. And maybe it’s all in an attempt to show the world they’re doing okay.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-1929775263.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.539471531414,100,34.921056937173\" alt=\"Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez emerging from a car holding hands.

There’s a sense that they belong to an aggressively on-the-prowl bachelor. It is true that people should dress in ways they find empowering, and a leather cuff is not in and of itself an unwanted sexual overture. But it’s hard to ignore the carnal hope that seems implicit to its wearer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the most divorced guy vibe is so adjacent to to tenets of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/23813985/christine-emba-masculinity-the-gray-area\">toxic masculinity</a> — aggression, violence, sexism, compulsory heterosexuality — the yuck it elicits feels similar too. There’s something desperately insecure about holding on to outdated masculine norms. Expressing our ick reflects our own changing ideas about how men should act and present themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We always should investigate our <em>ew</em>. Our <em>ew</em> says as much about us, just as much as it says about the other person,” Solomon said. “Our<em> ew</em>s are always worthy of our investigation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That knee-jerk, shudder reaction is a problem when divorced guys seemingly need all the empathy they can get. Community, especially among men who have regained their self-conception after a split and those still in process, might well be the answer. After all, being divorced isn’t the worst thing — unless it’s from reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

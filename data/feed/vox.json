Not only does he want this tax hike, which would raise <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/biden-and-trump-tariffs-august-2024/t24-0052-enact-60-percent-tariff-imported\">about $291 billion</a> or 1 percent of <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-second-quarter-2024-advance-estimate#:~:text=Current%E2%80%91dollar%20GDP%20increased%205.2,a%20level%20of%20%2428.63%20trillion.\">GDP</a> when fully implemented, but he says he’ll do it unilaterally. “I don’t need Congress, but they’ll approve it,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-threatens-to-impose-risky-tariff-scheme_n_66f1f822e4b02f84278bd8f1\">declared at a September 23 rally</a>. “I’ll have the right to impose them myself if they don’t.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is a rather enormous policy change for a president to undertake unilaterally, and one of dubious legality. For comparison, the hike Trump is considering is <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/52939-hr1628amendment.pdf#page=17\">over twice as large</a> as the tax increases used to fund Obamacare. (And make no mistake — tariffs are tax increases.) Experts like former World Trade Organization (WTO) deputy director-general <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/trump-ii-tariffs-who-said-he-could-do\">Alan Wm. Wolff</a> have argued that no law passed by Congress gives the president the power to levy across-the-board tariffs along the lines Trump proposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even so, Congress has given the executive branch a remarkable amount of flexibility to set tariffs. This is a mistake. Members of Congress, whether or not they support Trump’s tariff plans, should be able to agree on this much: As the Constitution lays out in the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/751\">taxing clause</a>, it’s Congress’s job to set taxing and spending policy for the United States. It’s been that way for the US’s whole history, it’s the traditional role of legislatures in all democratic countries, and putting this power instead in the president’s hands cuts the people’s representatives out of the process of determining how they are taxed — a concept that goes back to before the American Revolution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Congress has in the past given up its power to tax in the case of trade to the president and the cabinet, it should reverse that trend. One way to do so is to pass a bill like <a href=\"https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-celebrates-constitution-day/\">Sen. Rand Paul’s No Taxation Without Representation Act</a> to ensure that any changes in tariffs are subject to a congressional vote before taking effect.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The president’s tariff powers, explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The presidential power to impose tariffs does not originate from a simple bill or program; rather, it slowly accreted over time, with a particular expansion over the past decade as the Trump administration rediscovered authorities in old laws that enabled it to wage a trade war with China and protect the steel industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10667\">Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962</a>, for instance, gives the president the right to levy tariffs upon the secretary of commerce’s recommendation without asking Congress. This was the authority Trump used to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/3/8/17096510/trump-tariffs-nafta-steel-aluminum\">slap tariffs on steel and aluminum back in 2018</a>, tariffs which <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/tax/library/pwc-biden-administration-adjusts-tariffs-on-mexican-steel-imports.html\">Biden recently expanded slightly</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11346\">Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974</a> gives a similar power to impose tariffs based on unfair trade practices by foreign nations on the advice of the Office of the US Trade Representative. Trump used this power to impose <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10708.pdf\">sweeping tariffs against China</a>. Biden has made liberal use of this power, too, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/\">expanding tariffs</a> on steel, batteries, solar cells, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit\">electric vehicles from China</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there’s <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/us_safeguard.htm\">Section 201</a> of that same 1974 law, which allows tariffs against imports that “seriously injured or threatened … serious injury” to domestic companies. Trump and Biden have used this to <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-biden-tariffs/\">justify tariffs on washing machines and solar cells</a> from most countries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if Trump couldn’t implement a full 10 percent tariff on all imports with his executive powers — because the previous authorities apply only to specific industries or specific countries — he could make a lot of progress toward that goal. His 60 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, for instance, may very well be possible because it’s narrowly targeted at one nation. He and Biden have proven that the president can, without Congress, raise taxes on imports very significantly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I happen to think most of both Trump and Biden’s tariffs were wrongheaded and that Trump’s plan for more sweeping tariffs amounts to a <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/biden-and-trump-tariffs-august-2024/t24-0050-enact-60-percent-tariff-imports-china\">significant tax increase on the poor and middle class</a> that would <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/can-trump-replace-income-taxes-tariffs#:~:text=THE%20DOLLAR%E2%80%99S%20EXCHANGE%20RATE%20WOULD%20RISE%2C%20HURTING%20US%20EXPORTS\">hurt US exports</a>, invite retaliation from other countries, harm America’s international reputation, and <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf\">fail to create</a> any <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32082/w32082.pdf\">jobs for people</a> who need them. (Vice President Kamala Harris has <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/read-transcript-kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-rcna172771\">attacked the Trump tariff plan as a “sales tax”</a> but hasn’t disavowed Biden’s tariff policies.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, you don’t have to agree with me on the merits of the tariffs to agree with a narrower point about the process: This shouldn’t be the president’s decision. Congress is the branch of government invested with the power to tax and spend, and these trade laws have narrowed its power to the benefit of the executive in a way that is difficult to justify. The Social Security Administration is not allowed to set Social Security taxes, nor is the Department of Health and Human Services allowed to set Medicare taxes, but the Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative are explicitly authorized to recommend tariffs that take effect upon the president’s approval. Why is trade the exception?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One possible rationale might be that tariffs are a tool of foreign policy, which is traditionally an area where the executive has more autonomy. But even in that context, the tariff powers are extraordinary. Congressional authority is necessary to approve treaties and declare war; the War Powers Resolution means that armed conflict short of declared war needs congressional approval, too, as does funding conflict. Allowing a tariff increase without any congressional vote at all is a much greater deferral of authority.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are more specific, partisan reasons why Republicans and Democrats should be concerned about the presidential tariff power. For the past half-century, the GOP has been mostly a free-market, anti-tax party, which should naturally lead to skepticism of taxes and especially of unilateral presidential powers to levy taxes. As outgoing Senate Minority Leader <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4897112-mcconnell-tariffs-trump-trade/\">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) put it recently, “I’m not a fan of tariffs. They raise the prices for American consumers. I’m more of a free-trade kind of Republican that remembers how many jobs are created by the exports that we engage in.” The large number of Republicans still holding to that worldview should support curbing the presidential power to levy tariffs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats, even those sympathetic to tariffs and skeptical of free trade, should be wary of consigning a whole area of policymaking to Trump’s whims should he win the election. He demonstrated in his first term that he was very willing to use the tariff powers, more willing than any recent president, and his second term should, if anything, see him use them more promiscuously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Presidential authority on tariffs also opens the door to corruption. Importers are allowed to petition the Commerce Department for specific waivers from tariffs, an allowance corporations <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/trumps-tariffs-mean-big-opportunities\">unsurprisingly use to extract special favors</a>. Apple, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/apple-watch-tariffs.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/apple-watch-tariffs.html\">got exemptions from anti-China tariffs</a> for iPhones and Apple Watches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given what we know about Donald Trump and his <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-sold-his-dc-hotel-gop-spending-disappeared/\">clientelist</a>, <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trumps-latest-business-endeavor-is-an-invitation-for-even-more-corruption/\">favor-trading</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/trump-second-term-mafia-state/676128/\">mode of politics</a>, is that really a kind of power he should have? Is it a power Democrats will trust him to use in a non-corrupt manner? Or should Congress have the ability to curtail tariffs and limit opportunities for abuse?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Congress needs to act sooner rather than later</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some presidential powers, like the power to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22238571/trump-pardons-bannon-broidy-corruption\">pardon</a> <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-shadow-of-marc-rich\">political allies</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">immunity from prosecution</a>, stem from the Constitution or the Supreme Court’s interpretation of it. But the tariff powers stem from statutes passed by Congress, and they can be rescinded by further acts of Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There were some proposals during the Trump years to require congressional approval for section 232 tariffs, most notably the <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/1/warner-introduces-legislation-to-restore-national-security-tariff-authority-to-congress\">Trade Authority Act</a> introduced to the Senate by Mark Warner (D-VA) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). That bill has been kept alive in the most recent Congress by <a href=\"https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5966#:~:text=The%20Congressional%20Trade%20Authority%20Act%20would%20reinstate%20the%20role%20of,for%20alleged%20national%20security%20reasons.\">Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Don Beyer (D-VA)</a>. But Gallagher has since resigned from Congress, and Toomey retired in 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More to the point, section 232 is only one of the sources of authority the president can use for tariffs. Sections 201 and 301 of the 1974 Trade Act would remain and could be used to raise taxes unilaterally. The Supreme Court could, in theory, strike down tariffs that overstep congressionally delegated authority, but historically, the courts have deferred to the executive on trade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only bill I know of that would tackle the full suite of laws authorizing presidential tariffs is the <a href=\"https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-celebrates-constitution-day/\">No Taxation Without Representation Act</a> from Rand Paul. As Paul put it in a statement upon introducing the bill: “Unchecked executive actions enacting tariffs tax our citizens, threaten our economy, raise prices for everyday goods, and erode the system of checks and balances that our founders so carefully crafted.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I find myself agreeing with Paul on very few issues, but he’s dead right on this one: Taxation is a congressional authority, and that should apply to tariffs as much as anything else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To me it’s sensible policy,” Wolff, the former WTO executive and veteran US trade negotiator, told me. He might add carve-outs to give the executive flexibility in emergency cases (like when another nation levies a tariff against us first, or as part of a sanctions regime against a state like Russia or Iran), but broadly, the principle that Congress should authorize tax increases makes sense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re essentially out of time for Congress to act before its <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/2024_schedule.htm\">preelection October recess</a>, and action may be harder in November and December when we know who the next president will be, and their copartisans may be less willing to support actions to constrain their powers. But the battle will only get harder once a new president takes office and starts proposing tariffs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The time to act is this year, before that happens and while Congress has an opportunity to reassert its taxing power. The alternative could mean hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of tax increases issued unilaterally by the president, with Congress unable to stop it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As a licensed clinical psychologist, she was seeing around 40 clients a week and spending hours in the car commuting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s a pressure that you feel as an American, and in LA, I certainly felt like I needed to work as much as possible, either to make my rent or buy Whole Foods, and so my quality of life really suffered there,” Mascardo, 42,  said<em>. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So Mascardo made a radical change in search of an easier lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She kept seeing Portugal on lists of great places to live as a “digital nomad,” a fairly recent term for a person who can work remotely from various locations rather than a fixed location. Since 2007, the European country offered would-be nomads a visa that allowed them to live there so long as they were earning money while working for a company from a non-EU nation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mascardo fit the bill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She decided to move to Lisbon in 2018. At first, Mascardo said, it was hard to stop being a “workaholic.” She continued seeing more than 35 clients a week remotely but eventually pared down to around 25 clients per week, a move she could make because Lisbon is so affordable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She gave up the car, too. “Most of my friends live within a 15-minute walk of my house, or I can take an Uber that costs 10 euros to the other side of town, a maximum of 30 minutes by car,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Portugal felt peaceful, too. Mascardo and other digital nomads we spoke with in Portugal cited the prevalence of gun violence in the United States as one factor for leaving. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s crazy to live in a place where every day I don’t wake up and read about a mass shooting,” Mascardo said. “That whole part of my brain that was experiencing trauma in the USA isn’t dealing with that anymore.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/4A2A0867.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.75214828329,100,78.49570343342\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"People in Lisbon, Portugal, await the city&#039;s tram; Therese Mascardo was able to give up her car to live in the European city after moving there from Los Angeles in 2018. \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pandemic turned work in America upside down: Lots of companies went fully remote, which meant knowledge workers in particular had more freedom than ever before to choose where to live without changing jobs, just as Mascardo did. Four years later, however, many companies have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/16/amazon-return-to-office-five-days-week/\">called workers back into the office</a> at least some of the time, some for the whole workweek. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which means some workers are living the digital nomad dream while others are back to long commutes and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/05/sad-desk-salad-sweetgreen/678408/\">$15 desk salads</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We wanted to know what these two extremes reveal about how we think about work and how we balance work and life, so a team from Vox’s <em>Today, Explained </em>podcast went to Portugal. We also visited an American city where the five-day, in-office workweek never went away: Miami. We&#8217;ll get to Miami tomorrow, but today, we’re exploring how Portugal turned itself into a haven for remote workers and saw mixed results.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"Leaving America for work-life balance by Today, Explained\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP4194629794\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How Portugal drew nomads and breathed life into its cities</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thousands of digital nomads from all over the world have moved to Portugal, many after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Though nomads by their nature are hard to track, some estimates show there are about <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-digital-nomads-bubble-gentrification/\">16,000 living in Lisbon alone</a>, the bulk from the US. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, a few years after Mascardo arrived, Portugal began offering a new type of visa as an incentive for digital nomads. The D8 visa allows non-EU/EEA citizens with remote jobs to live and work in the country for up to one year, with a path to permanent residency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even before that, Portugal was an attractive place for digital nomads to hang out. After the Great Recession obliterated economic growth in the country, the government set up <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/pt/Documents/tax/NHR/Flyer_RNH2022_General_digital.pdf\">a generous tax structure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/23762537/golden-passports-wealthy-explained\">relatively easy visa requirements</a> for certain kinds of foreigners (a.k.a. those with money). The idea was to attract not just people with cash to spend but entrepreneurs and knowledge workers to juice a torpid economy. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/4A2A0858_359875.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.75214828329,100,78.49570343342\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Graffiti in Lisbon, a city that has, according to some estimates, more than 16,000 &quot;digital nomads&quot; working for foreign companies while living in Portugal on a special visa. | Victoria Chamberlin/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Victoria Chamberlin/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It worked, said <a href=\"https://cefup.fep.up.pt/researcher/luis-miguel-da-costa-monteiro-de-carvalho/\">Luís Carvalho</a>, a professor of economics at the University of Porto in Porto, Portugal. Just look at his own city. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Twenty years ago, the city was declining very fast. You saw a lot of criminality. Buildings were falling apart,”  said Carvalho. One of the oldest city centers in Europe, Porto was usually known for Port wine, not laptop warriors. When foreign workers started showing up, so did a new energy. New skills, higher incomes, entrepreneurialism. Tourism, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The urge to travel and visit a new country is baked into digital nomadism, so it’s not surprising that coworking and coliving spaces have popped up there. We accidentally stayed in one in Porto, where we stumbled on a place called <a href=\"https://www.outsite.co/locations/porto-mouco\">Outsite Muoco</a> that looked like a regular hotel. It’s actually a chain of rooms and apartments with locations all over the world catering to longer-term stays and “using the remote work revolution to <a href=\"https://www.outsite.co/about\">define</a> a new way of life.” The property in Porto had several coworking spaces, sleek Scandinavian design, and even a library to listen to vinyl records. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We met 25-year-old Gia Lee in the vinyl library while a British punk band played a concert in the basement. She never pictured herself jet-setting around the world while working, but Lee graduated from college right into the pandemic and the worst job market since the Great Recession. “There were no jobs at all in 2020. I was planning to go into a normal ad agency and corporate trajectory but Covid threw a wrench into the situation, and we kind of had to adapt and figure out how to do our own thing,” Lee said<em>.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That meant bouncing right into fully remote work. Lee and two friends founded a marketing agency called <a href=\"https://www.ninetyeightla.com/\">NinetyEight</a> that provides brands with insights into the minds of Gen Z. It just made sense to Lee to continue keeping the company fully remote because it’s less expensive and provides more freedom to move around. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Portugal also experienced the downside to attracting well-off workers</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pandemic gave lots of laptop workers like Lee tons of time to consider their living situations and jump the pond, but all this self-actualization had some negative effects for the Portuguese.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Foreign workers, often flush with cash, drove up housing costs. Carvalho and a team estimate an 8.5 percent increase in prices due to foreign workers. That’s been infuriating to a lot of Portuguese people, who are now facing some of the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QPTR628BIS\">highest housing costs </a>and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Living_conditions_in_Europe_-_income_distribution_and_income_inequality\">lowest median income</a> in Western Europe.

Most of the men and women on the Court so recently showed such astoundingly poor judgment, in a case that could lead the United States down the grim road to dictatorship, that it’s far from clear why anyone would trust them to judge a beauty contest — much less to sit on the nation’s highest Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That case, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf\"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>, was an infidelity. Six justices, despite swearing an oath to “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/453#:~:text=Each%20justice%20or%20judge%20of,that%20I%20will%20faithfully%20and\">administer justice without respect to persons</a>,” ruled that Donald Trump, the leader of their political party, was allowed to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">use his official powers to commit crimes while in office</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They did so, moreover, just days after President Joe Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">disastrous June debate performance</a> seemed to ensure that Trump would return to the White House in a walk. And those justices did not simply immunize Trump from prosecution for many of his past crimes, they provided a roadmap for how he can abuse and consolidate power if he does again become president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among other things, <em>Trump</em> held that a former president may not be prosecuted for any order they give the Justice Department, including orders that are given “for an improper purpose.” The Supreme Court, in other words, said that nothing could happen to Trump if he won in November, then promptly ordered <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon\">the FBI to round up all of his political opponents</a> and have them arrested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite this partisan decision, these uniquely unsuited men and women remain the most powerful people in the country. The United States has no mechanism to remove a justice for recklessness, or for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/359206/supreme-court-incompetent-abortion-trump-immunity\">sheer incompetence</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the moment, at least, this upcoming term appears less busy than the previous one, which featured not only the <em>Trump</em> immunity decisions, but also one of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab\">most consequential power grabs by the Supreme Court</a> in many years. Bear in mind, however, that the character of a term can change quickly. At this time last year, the Court had <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/23845702/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-term-cfpb-guns-voting-chevron\">not yet gotten its hands on the Trump immunity case</a>. And, in a potentially nightmarish scenario for American democracy, these justices could be called upon to settle a presidential election this November.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, while the current term may be less eventful than the previous one, it’s unlikely to be sleepy. The Court will weigh into the fraught issue of transgender rights in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/\"><em>United States v. Skrmetti</em></a>, the first such case to reach the justices since GOP-led states enacted a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/22977970/anti-trans-legislation-texas-idaho\">wave of anti-trans legislation</a> after Trump left office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice, specifically guns and porn, also stands out on the Court’s upcoming docket. In <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/garland-v-vanderstok-2/\"><em>Garland v. VanDerStok</em></a>, the same Republican justices who recently voted to legalize a device that effectively <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/3/23943399/supreme-court-automatic-weapons-bump-stocks-gun-policy\">converts an ordinary semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun</a>, will decide whether to allow virtually untraceable guns to be sold without a background check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/free-speech-coalition-inc-v-paxton/\"><em>Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton</em></a>, the Court will reconsider several key First Amendment cases that established that the government may not prevent adults from accessing sexual material online, even if the government does so to try to prevent children from seeing this material.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-oklahoma-3/\"><em>Glossip v. Oklahoma</em></a>, meanwhile, presents the odd question of whether the state of Oklahoma <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/22/24046857/supreme-court-death-penalty-richard-glossip-oklahoma\">must execute a man that it very much does not want to kill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there’s <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/food-and-drug-administration-v-wages-and-white-lion-investments-llc/\"><em>FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments</em></a>, a meritless case brought by tobacco companies that are upset that the FDA didn’t approve their flavored nicotine vapes. The case is interesting largely because the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment\">far-right</a> United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided to cast its lot with these companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, the Fifth Circuit is a reminder that there are some things even this Supreme Court is unwilling to do. Last term, the justices reversed a Fifth Circuit decision that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/24158216/supreme-court-cfpb-clarence-thomas-community-financial\">could have triggered a second Great Depression</a>, as well as some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/357111/supreme-court-murthy-missouri-fifth-circuit-jawboning-first-amendment\">unusually partisan</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment\">free speech cases</a> handed down by the Fifth. And these cases are part of a long series of Supreme Court rulings reining in the Fifth Circuit’s worst excesses. <em>White Lion</em> will give us a window into whether the justices will continue to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given recent events, we probably can’t expect the justices to show much moderation or judgment in their upcoming decisions. But we can, at least, hope that they do not descend even further into partisanship.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trans rights return to the docket, in <em>United States v. Skrmetti</em></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In May of 2021, Arkansas became the <a href=\"https://www.bakerdonelson.com/history-and-future-of-the-nations-first-ban-on-gender-affirming-care#:~:text=Arkansas%20was%20the%20first%20state,serve%20as%20important%20future%20precedent.\">first state to ban gender-affirming care</a> for transgender patients under the age of 18. Since then, such laws have become ubiquitous in states controlled by the Republican Party — according to the Human Rights Campaign, <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/attacks-on-gender-affirming-care-by-state-map\">26 states</a> now have laws imposing some restrictions on health care for trans youth, although some of these laws are stricter than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tennessee law at issue in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/\"><em>United States v. Skrmetti</em></a>, which the justices will likely hear this winter, is <a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-103-prohibitions#:~:text=Section%2068%2D33%2D103%20%2D%20Prohibitions%20(a)%20(,identify%20with%2C%20or%20live%20as%2C\">among the strictest in the country</a>. It does not simply ban treatments that alter a transgender youth’s body to align it with the patient’s gender identity, it also bans treatments such as puberty blockers, which seek to delay permanent changes to that patient’s body until the patient is older.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These laws raise difficult constitutional questions. On the one hand, the government typically has the power to regulate the practice of medicine, and to ban drugs and procedures it deems harmful. This is why, for example, states can ban heroin even if it is prescribed by a doctor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, the political context of these laws — the fact that they are all of recent vintage, are supported almost exclusively by Republican lawmakers, and are part of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/2023/8/25/23844263/republican-debate-national-abortion-ban-trans-care-covid\">broad attack on transgender rights</a> by Republican politicians — suggests that these laws may not be motivated by a sincere desire to protect anyone from a harmful medical procedure, and are actually rooted in unconstitutional animus against transgender people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Skrmetti</em> asks whether Tennessee’s strict ban on transgender health care <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/\">violates the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause</a>, a provision that protects against laws motivated by such animus against a vulnerable minority group. Under this provision, the Court has long held that any law that targets a group that has experienced a “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24150243/supreme-court-transgender-health-care\">history of purposeful unequal treatment</a>” which “frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society,” should be viewed with extraordinary skepticism by courts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, however, a Supreme Court dominated by conservative Republicans is unlikely to rule that all anti-trans laws are constitutionally suspect, and it’s notable that <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323551/20240827210326240_23-477tsUnitedStates.pdf\">neither the United States</a> <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323499/20240827143014850_No.%2023-477%20Brief%20for%20Respondents%20ISO%20Petitioner.pdf\">nor the ACLU</a>, which represents parties challenging the Tennessee law, devote much of their brief to this argument.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, they focus primarily on an argument that two of the Court’s Republicans, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch, embraced in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf\"><em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em></a> (2020).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Bostock</em> asked whether a federal ban on “sex” discrimination in employment prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. A majority of the Court concluded that it does, even if you assume that the word “sex” refers exclusively to a person’s sex assigned at birth, and not to their gender identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court reasoned that, if a male employee is allowed to date women, to dress in traditionally masculine clothing, or to otherwise present as a man, then a female employee must be allowed to do these same things. Otherwise, the employer is treating men differently than women, and that’s illegal sex discrimination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, both the Justice Department and the ACLU argue that Tennessee’s strict trans health ban violates <em>Bostock</em> because it treats patients of one sex differently than patients of the other sex. A patient assigned male at birth, for example, is allowed to be treated with testosterone if their doctor prescribes it, but a patient assigned female at birth is not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This argument, however, has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/10/23789633/supreme-court-lgbtq-lw-skrmetti-transgender-health-care-jeffrey-sutton-sixth-circuit\">not won many fans among Republican lower court judges</a>. And the Supreme Court recently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/367636/supreme-court-lgbtq-abandon-bostock-louisiana-education-title-ix\">signaled that it may be moving away from <em>Bostock</em></a>. So the parties challenging this Tennessee law probably face an uphill climb in this very conservative Court.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Garland v. VanDerStok</em>, the “ghost guns” case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Federal law requires gun buyers to submit to a criminal background check before they can purchase a new firearm. It also requires guns to have a serial number that allows law enforcement to track them. In <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/garland-v-vanderstok-2/\"><em>Garland v. VanDerStok</em></a>, however, the Court could potentially create a loophole that would make it trivially easy to evade these two laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These federal laws apply to “any weapon &#8230; which will or is designed to or <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921\">may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive</a>.” It also applies to “the frame or receiver of any such weapon,” the skeletal part of a firearm that houses other components, such as the barrel or trigger mechanism. Thus, if someone purchases a series of gun parts to assemble at home, they should still face a background check when they buy the gun’s frame or receiver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>VanDerStok</em> involves “ghost guns,” guns that are sold dismantled, in ready-to-assemble kits. To evade the background check and serial number laws, the kit’s frame or receiver is often sold in a partially incomplete state. Some kits allow a gun buyer to build a working firearm after drilling a single hole in the kit’s frame. Others merely require the user to sand off a small plastic rail. According to the Justice Department, it is often a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/24/24138227/supreme-court-ghost-guns-background-checks-criminals-serial-numbers\">trifling task to complete these guns</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The right-wing Fifth Circuit held that these ghost guns were immune from the background check and serial number laws. Frames that are missing a small hole, a panel of three Trump judges concluded, are “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/vanderstok-v-garland-2\">not yet frames or receivers</a>.” The Fifth Circuit also claimed that ghost guns do not count as a weapon that “may readily be converted” into a working gun because this phrase “cannot be read to include any objects that could, if manufacture is completed, become functional at some ill-defined point in the future” — even if only a trivial amount of work would be necessary to make the gun function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s likely that a majority of the justices will disagree with the Fifth Circuit, although the vote in <em>VanDerStok</em> is likely to be quite tight. The Court has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/24/24138227/supreme-court-ghost-guns-background-checks-criminals-serial-numbers\">already heard this case twice</a> on its “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/8/11/21356913/supreme-court-shadow-docket-jail-asylum-covid-immigrants-sonia-sotomayor-barnes-ahlman\">shadow docket</a>” — a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices handle on an expedited basis — and a majority of the justices voted twice to apply the background check and serial number laws to ghost guns, albeit only on a temporary basis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the first of those two decisions was decided on a 5-4 vote, with Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett crossing over to vote with the Court’s three Democrats. So there appears to be significant support on the Court for the idea that criminals should be allowed to buy guns without submitting to a background check.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton</em>: Do adults have a right to look at porn?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the mid-to-late 1990s, as the internet was starting to become widely available to American consumers, Congress passed a pair of laws intended to prevent minors from accessing pornography online. Both laws were eventually blocked by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/844/\"><em>Reno v. ACLU</em></a><em> </em>(1997) and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5352124576782659763&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Ashcroft v. ACLU</em></a> (2004).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Reno</em> and <em>Ascroft</em> established, in <em>Reno</em>’s words, that a law seeking to “deny minors access to potentially harmful speech” must not suppress “a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.” That is, the First Amendment does not permit the government to cut off adults’ access to sexual material in order to prevent young people from seeing it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/free-speech-coalition-inc-v-paxton/\"><em>Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton</em></a> involves a Texas law that is very similar to the ones blocked in <em>Reno</em> and <em>Ashcroft</em>. Under this law, websites that devote “more than one-third” of their content to “<a href=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.129B.htm\">sexual material harmful to minors</a>” must require their users to prove they are over 18 before they can access any of that material — such as by transmitting a copy of their photo ID to the website owner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Texas is one of eight states with similar laws — these sorts of age-gated restrictions are also in place in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Needless to say, most people who view pornography online do not want to send a record of their identity, which might be leaked or stolen, to the pornographic website. And many of the major online porn sites have simply blocked access to their content in the states with Texas-style laws. Someone who tries to access the website Pornhub in these states, for example, will be greeted by a video of a fully clothed woman criticizing their state’s law and urging them to contact their state legislator.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/temp_788290.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.848071473174,100,46.303857053653\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A screenshot from Pornhub, taken after I accessed that website in Virginia.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Fifth Circuit, being the Fifth Circuit, nonetheless upheld the Texas law. The two Fifth Circuit judges who ruled in Texas’s favor claimed that they were not bound by <em>Ashcroft</em> because the Supreme Court’s decision “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/free-speech-coal-v-paxton-1\">contains startling omissions</a>,” meaning that the Court did not discuss a legal argument that these two lower court judges find persuasive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not how constitutional litigation is supposed to work. Once the Supreme Court announces a legal rule, lower court judges are not free to ignore it just because they think of a new critique of the Court’s decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, both these two Fifth Circuit judges and the eight state legislatures that enacted similar bans appear to be betting that a newly constituted Supreme Court, dominated by very conservative Republicans, will overrule <em>Reno</em> and <em>Ashcroft</em> and allow states to restrict adults from seeing entirely legal sexual content.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Oklahoma have to execute a man against its will? The tragic case of <em>Glossip v. Oklahoma</em>.</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Richard Glossip, a motel manager, was convicted of murdering the owner of that motel in 2004 and received a death sentence; he’s awaiting execution. Glossip did not actually commit the murder himself, but the prosecution’s theory was that Glossip hired Justin Sneed, a maintenance man at the motel, to kill the victim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since then, the murder case against Glossip has fallen apart. In 2022, a committee of Oklahoma state lawmakers commissioned a law firm to investigate whether the conviction was reliable. The firm’s 343-page report is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/3/23708045/supreme-court-richard-glossip-execution-gentner-drummond-stay-oklahoma\">scathing</a>, concluding that a combination of lost and destroyed evidence, a “deficient police investigation,” distortion of evidence by the prosecution, and “a cascade of errors and missed opportunities by defense attorneys” all “fundamentally call into question the fairness of the proceedings and the ultimate reliability of the guilty verdict against Glossip for murder.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A separate investigation, conducted by a former district attorney at the request of Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, concluded that “Glossip was <a href=\"https://www.oag.ok.gov/sites/g/files/gmc766/f/documents/2023/glossip_report_4.3.2023_redacted.pdf\">deprived of a fair trial</a> in which the State can have confidence in the process <em>and</em> result.” Drummond, a Republican, is now <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7466/308265/20240423202240962_2024-4-23%20Final%20OK%20AG%20Glossip%20merits%20brief.pdf\">asking the Supreme Court to toss out Glossip’s conviction</a> and order a new trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reason why this unusual move is necessary is that Oklahoma’s own courts have refused to grant similar relief to Glossip, despite the weight of evidence against his conviction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One explanation for this refusal is that Oklahoma requires someone who has already been convicted of a crime to bring most challenges to that conviction <a href=\"http://okcca.net/rules/rule-9.7/\">within 60 days of discovering any new evidence</a> that undercuts the conviction. So, as new evidence has trickled out that benefits Glossip, his lawyers have been forced to submit that evidence to the courts on a piecemeal basis, and those courts have looked at new pieces of evidence in isolation, rather than seeing the cumulative picture detailed in the legislature’s and the attorney general’s investigations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newest piece of evidence, which is now before the Supreme Court, is that prosecutors hid the fact that Sneed, a key witness against Glossip at his trial, was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/3/23708045/supreme-court-richard-glossip-execution-gentner-drummond-stay-oklahoma\">treated by a psychiatrist for a serious mental illness</a> that made Sneed prone to violent outbursts and paranoia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It remains to be seen whether Glossip’s lawyers, even with Drummond as their unlikely ally, can persuade this chaotic Supreme Court to order a new trial.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments</em>: the flavored vape epidemic</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Flavored nicotine vapes are supposed to be illegal in the United States. A federal law requires the FDA to approve any “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-21-food-and-drugs/chapter-9-federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act/subchapter-ix-tobacco-products/section-387j-application-for-review-of-certain-tobacco-products\">new tobacco product</a>” sold in the US. And, while the FDA has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, it has not approved fruit-flavored, bubblegum-flavored, or any of the other many arrays of flavored nicotine vapes that tend to appeal to young people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practice, however, the ban on flavored vapes has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/12/1187354558/flavored-vapes-are-supposed-to-be-illegal-but-theyre-still-widely-available\">not been particularly effective</a>. Much like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2022/10/11/23391609/new-york-marijuana-laws-legalization-bodega-weed-truck\">proliferation of illegal weed shops</a> in cities where marijuana is legal but is also supposed to be highly regulated, shops selling illegal flavored vapes are common in the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, courts are supposed to apply the law as written, and the law governing FDA approval of nicotine vapes is pretty clear. The FDA is <a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-21-food-and-drugs/chapter-9-federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act/subchapter-ix-tobacco-products/section-387j-application-for-review-of-certain-tobacco-products\">required to deny any application</a> to approve a new tobacco product unless the manufacturer of that product can show “that permitting such tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.” FDA makes this determination by weighing the likelihood that approving a new product will lead existing smokers to quit against the likelihood that approving the new product will cause new users to become addicted to nicotine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Accordingly, the FDA has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, on the theory that vaping is safer than smoking so it is better if existing smokers switch to vaping. But it has not approved any flavored vapes, on the theory that these products are so appealing to young users that they will cause many new people to become addicted to nicotine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then the Fifth Circuit decided to get involved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/wages-white-lion-invs-v-food-drug-admin-2\"><em>Wages &amp; White Lion Investments v. FDA</em></a>, the right-wing court essentially ordered the FDA to rerun its approval process for flavored vapes, claiming that the FDA illegally changed the process it used to evaluate these products midstream. It didn’t. While Judge Andy Oldham’s majority opinion in <em>White Lion</em> is very long, he rests his case primarily on blockquotes from FDA documents that do not say what Oldham claims that they say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Oldham, a Trump appointee and former clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, has a history of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/19/23361050/supreme-court-texas-twitter-facebook-youtube-social-media-fifth-circuit-netchoice-paxton\">reading the law in implausible ways to benefit right-wing causes</a>, and he’s often reversed by the Supreme Court. So it’s likely that even this panel of justices will cast a skeptical eye on his <em>White Lion</em> opinion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, if nothing else, <em>White Lion</em> is a reminder that, no matter how bad the Supreme Court gets, it can always get worse. If Trump wins in November, he could potentially replace several sitting justices with judges like Oldham, who make many of the justices responsible for the <em>Trump </em>immunity decision seem like sensible moderates eager to preserve the stability of US democracy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "It’s hard not to feel a sense of dread as the Supreme Court justices return to Washington for their new term, which, by law, begins on the first Monday in October.

With hundreds of candidates vying for office and abortion rights on the ballot in <a href=\"https://time.com/7018665/abortion-ballot-measures-2024/\">10 states</a>, advocates have been busy raising money to spend through November. In June, the ACLU pledged more than <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-launches-2024-election-push-to-protect-abortion-and-voting-rights\">$25 million</a> to protect abortion rights; this was followed by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/planned-parenthood-spending-45-million-2024-election-a6b9252fec64d1e051816ea173dab32f\">$40 million weeks later</a> from Planned Parenthood, then another <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/24/abortion-rights-advocates-launch-100-million-campaign-00164528\">$100 million</a> from a new coalition of national groups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even as money flows toward protecting abortion rights, the financial burden of accessing abortion services has grown more severe, as bans force people to travel further and delay procedures until they are riskier and more expensive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This strain is overwhelming the nation’s 100 <a href=\"https://abortionfunds.org/\">abortion funds</a>, which are mostly volunteer-led organizations that help people end unwanted pregnancies by paying for their abortions as well as practical support like travel costs —&nbsp;and the tab for this kind of aid quickly adds up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though cheaper methods to safely end a pregnancy <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/12/27/24015092/abortion-pills-mifepristone-roe-reproductive-misoprostol\">have emerged over the past two years</a>, many abortion seekers lack knowledge of these new, more affordable options. Funds and clinics also don’t always provide clear guidance on alternatives, driven by a mix of <a href=\"https://www.plancpills.org/documentary\">financial and legal self-interest</a>, as well as a belief that in-person abortion care should be prioritized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What we’re seeing is patients are very comfortable embracing telemedicine as an option, but people within our movement have not been as flexible,” said Julie Kay, the co-founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theactgroup.org/#:~:text=The%20Abortion%20Coalition%20for%20Telemedicine,abortion%20in%20all%2050%20states.\">Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine</a>, which formed in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This past year, abortion funds say they’re <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/abortion-funds-running-out-money-dobbs_n_667486b4e4b043a634bd9cd2\">fighting for their lives</a>, unable to raise enough money to meet demand. A few are fundraising with <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/186128/abortion-fund-money-dobbs-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new state-level partners</a>, but increasingly, funds have had to tell callers they’ve run out of resources, leaving people to scramble for other options or carry unwanted pregnancies to term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In general, all the money flowing to the 2024 election in the name of reproductive rights feels very siloed from their work paying for abortions, said Alisha Dingus, the development director at the <a href=\"https://dcabortionfund.org/\">DC Abortion Fund</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is an alarming disconnect between abortion funds … and large national organizations that are advocating for access,” a group of over 30 funds wrote collectively <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/abortion-funds-movement-crisis/\">in the Nation</a> in early August. “The national organizations … fundraise endlessly, siphon support from institutional funders and grassroots donors, capitalize on the <em>Dobbs</em> rage donations, and funnel that money into campaign bank accounts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another challenge is messaging. Abortion funds have always positioned themselves as more radical and unapologetic when it comes to abortion care, priding themselves on avoiding stigmatizing language, whether that’s by using gender-neutral terms or elevating stories of people ending unwanted pregnancies for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/opinion/abortions-necessary-sympathy.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">no traumatic, exceptional reason</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But given the increasingly desperate funding environment, these activists are being forced now to reconsider how they appeal to a public <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/05/13/broad-public-support-for-legal-abortion-persists-2-years-after-dobbs/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=24-05-13%20Abortion%20GEN%20DISTRO&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=13991&amp;lea=3375400&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=a0DQm000001nkFdMAI\">that is broadly supportive</a> of reproductive rights but is still more moderate on abortion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In my experience on ballot campaigns, abortion funds have been incredibly challenging as partners in states that weren&#8217;t blue,” one leader involved with multiple post-<em>Roe </em>ballot measures, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told Vox. “If you&#8217;re only communicating in very extreme messaging about abortion access, you&#8217;re not broadening your base of donors, you&#8217;re just talking to the 12 people who already agree with you. A lot of people who would love to donate to funds and probably don&#8217;t understand the need are turned off before they even get in the door by the language and behavior.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These kinds of criticisms vex Dingus, who wrestles with whether abortion funds should be more “acceptable and digestible” to the public, as she put it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I came from a more traditional philanthropy space where you had to make sure you never hurt anyone’s feelings or made anyone angry because you might lose a dollar,” she said. “Abortion funds I&#8217;ve always found to be more liberated spaces where we can speak truth to power and push for change and not have to worry about one funder here or one funder there. But we are also seeing the reality of people not getting the care they need, people are going to be forced to give birth, so I think it’s tough.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tensions are rising within the movement as disagreements over a scarce resource — money — intensify. These battles among leaders<em> </em>reflect practical and ideological divisions about the future of abortion access and underscore the messy, unsettled questions that loom over activists more than two years after Americans lost their national right to end a pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The 2024 election is dominating abortion-related donations</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to donations this year, it’s mostly going to one place.<br><br>Despite earlier concern that abortion rights ballot measures would struggle to raise enough money, organizers say those fears have mostly not been realized, and tens of millions of dollars are flowing into the state contests as the election draws near.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These contests are “expensive and high-impact,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a national progressive group. “We are very grateful that organizations and in-state donors are seeing the opportunity with state ballot measures and are investing the resources that are needed to win.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One newer member of the abortion rights political ecosystem is the House Majority PAC’s <a href=\"https://www.thehousemajoritypac.com/news/memo-hmp-launches-100-million-reproductive-freedom-accountability-fund\">Reproductive Freedom Accountability Fund</a>, a $100 million investment to mobilize voters in swing districts sympathetic to abortion rights. “In 2022, 42 percent of our ads mentioned abortion, and I think it will be that much again if not higher,” said C.J. Warnke, a spokesperson for the congressional PAC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, making sense of the amount of abortion-rights money flowing into political campaigns can be difficult.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some lower-profile elections, <a href=\"https://azmirror.com/2024/09/18/campaigns-battle-over-the-fate-of-2-az-supreme-court-justices-who-ushered-in-the-1864-abortion-ban/\">like two high court contests</a> in Arizona, have struggled to raise money, despite their importance for reproductive rights. And in June Planned Parenthood, one of the largest abortion rights advocacy groups,&nbsp; announced it would be spending $40 million during the 2024 cycle, less than the group spent <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-health-congress-71871318f3c725a7df0bbe183e6c84be\">in either of</a> the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/planned-parenthood-to-spend-45-million-in-2020-elections.html\">previous two</a> election cycles. Their announcement came shortly after it announced it would also need to <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2024/08/13/following-national-funding-cuts-july-was-pure-hell-for-abortion-funds/\">reduce its subsidies</a> for abortion care through its Justice Fund program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Planned Parenthood says it can spend less simply because other organizations are spending more and because candidates themselves are more emboldened on reproductive rights. But elections are more expensive now and there are more political contests to fund than during the midterms, so the explanation is puzzling.&nbsp; (The group also declined to share details of its Justice Fund or to direct patient assistance broadly, citing “<a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2024/08/13/following-national-funding-cuts-july-was-pure-hell-for-abortion-funds/\">disclosure policy</a>” restrictions.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In some ways, this is likely to be the last big year for spending on abortion rights ballot measures, simply because there aren’t many additional states that allow for such citizen initiatives. “It’s not an either-or” on funding, said Ashley All, who led the communications strategy for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23273455/kansas-abortion-roe-dobbs-ballot-initiative-constitutional-amendment\">winning Kansas abortion rights ballot measure</a> in 2022<em>. </em>“We have to do these ballot campaigns because if we don’t then people will lose access to care.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, while national activists and fundraisers are spinning things in a more positive light, emphasizing that more money will be available to fund direct services soon, many local abortion fund leaders are skeptical things will really improve financially when election season ends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to Lexis Dotson-Dufault, executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.abortionfundofohio.org/\">Abortion Fund of Ohio</a>, no new donors contributed to the organization following the passage of Issue 1, the abortion rights ballot measure that prevailed in Ohio last year by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/07/us/elections/results-ohio-issue-1-abortion-rights.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=RaceLink\">a 13-point margin</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have seen nothing but an increase in need and we got no new funders from Issue 1,” she told Vox. “In 2022, we saw about 1,200 folks, in 2023 we saw about 4,500, and this year so far between February and August we’ve seen almost 4,000 people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dingus, of the DC Abortion Fund, said election season has made their financial challenges more difficult. “It’s tough to see, not just the ballot measures but the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/364410/kamala-harris-white-people-zooms-race-intersectionality-crenshaw\">Zooms for Harris</a> that raised millions of dollars in 30 minutes,” she said. “It can be really demoralizing to see that and then look at our budgets and know we continually have to cut back and maybe will have to get rid of staff.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cheryl Wolf, an organizer with <a href=\"https://www.cascadesabortionsupport.org/\">Cascades Abortion Support Collective</a> in Portland, Oregon, said it’s been hard to convince the public that donating to small local funds over large political campaigns is a more reliable way to ensure their money directly supports abortion care.<br><br>“When they make their donations to national organizations, so much of it goes to overhead, salary, campaigning, advertising,” she told Vox. “Rather than directly into the hands of abortion seekers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This pressure has all been <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/abortion-funds-running-out-money-dobbs_n_667486b4e4b043a634bd9cd2\">exacerbated by recent national funding cuts</a>; since July, the National Abortion Federation, along with Planned Parenthood, announced they’d only be able to subsidize up to 30 percent of abortion costs, down from their previous cap of 50 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wolf described these cuts from the National Abortion Federation as “detrimental,” particularly because most of the collective’s money comes from small one-time or monthly donations from individuals. “We are definitely not raising enough,” she added, noting they bring in about $500 every month and spend about $9,000. “We’re definitely looking at running out of money in the next couple months if we don’t have some kind of miracle.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As travel costs rise, some abortion rights leaders say the movement has been too focused on elevating travel for those living in states with bans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kay, of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, formed her more critical perspective while working in Ireland when abortion was criminalized. “The Irish solution to abortion bans was travel, but not everyone has the privilege or means to travel,” she said. “It’s alienating, stigmatizing, and expensive.” Prioritizing travel today, Kay thinks, reflects a movement that hasn’t “pivoted to the reality of what we&#8217;re living in now” with more options and more restrictions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A difference of philosophy — and why it matters</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the abortion rights movement, leaders are grappling with how best to engage voters and donors while also debating how much compromise is acceptable in the pursuit of broader support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, when Ohio activists were pushing for an abortion rights ballot measure, leaders with the Abortion Fund of Ohio were frustrated by compromises these ballot measure activists were willing to make. “I’m not really ever into hearing things about trimester limits or viability standards, or hearing language that’s very trauma-focused,” said Dotson-Dufault. “Something I say is a lot of the reason you feel the need to use that type of language is because we haven’t been doing the deep community destigmatization work.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other states, abortion fund staff and volunteers are experiencing similar discomfort. In South Dakota, a local abortion fund has publicly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24078960/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-measure-dobbs\">criticized the abortion rights ballot measure</a> citizens will be voting on this November, even as the red state has a near-total abortion ban. Other funds are wrestling with messaging choices.<strong> </strong>“A lot of campaigns like <a href=\"https://floridiansprotectingfreedom.com/about/\">Yes on 4</a> [the Florida abortion rights ballot measure] use gendered language, while we always use ‘pregnant people’ or ‘people who are pregnant,’” said Bree Wallace, the director of case management at the <a href=\"https://tbafund.com/\">Tampa Bay Abortion Fund</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I asked Brittany Fonteno, the president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, how her organization balances their more bold, progressive rhetoric with their recent funding cuts to local affiliates, she said it comes down to “investing time and energy in educating people, and helping them to evolve their own perspective.” Fonteno then cited her own journey growing up in a more conservative and religious environment, and her path to abandoning abortion stigma. “It took time for me to evolve and become someone who is not pro-choice but pro-abortion, pro-reproductive freedom,” she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet rejection of terms like “pro-choice” from activists like Fonteno stands in sharp contrast to how <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/03/1102872199/gallup-poll-pro-choice-roe-v-wade-supreme-court\">most Americans who support reproductive rights</a> feel about it. Election pollsters have also found that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/7/13/23204957/roe-wade-abortion-dobbs-persuasion-midterms\">some of the most effective</a> abortion rights-related messages with voters are the same ones that activists argue are too gendered, stigmatizing, and patronizing (like that the decision to end a pregnancy should be “between a woman and her doctor” or that “victims of rape and incest would be forced to give birth.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2022, under pressure from activists, the House Pro-Choice Caucus <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahnferris/status/1524792388677402626\">circulated new talking points</a> that warned “choice” is “harmful language” for reproductive rights, and should be replaced with the “helpful” alternative of “decision.” This generated some ridicule, but other aides and leaders were upset that activists would seek to ditch the well-known and popular “pro-choice” label at such a high-visibility moment, and without real survey research to support it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are no simple answers to the movement&#8217;s future direction, though progressive activists rightly note that <a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/May-2-Release-FINAL.pdf\">public opinion</a> is <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NPR_PBS-News-Hour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_0426_202304211458.pdf\">increasingly</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-legalized-abortion-grows-since-dobbs-ruling-wsj-poll-shows-11662210020\">shifting in favor</a> of abortion rights. Some activists are wary about prematurely abandoning the long-held goal of restoring accessible in-person clinic care nationwide, while others worry that leaders&#8217; refusal to adapt to new realities will come at the expense of pregnant people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wallace, of the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, said that after <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade </em>was overturned, her fund received 755,000 individual donations, but by 2023, that number fell to 272,000. “People are donating more toward the election and Yes on 4 right now, and we all want Yes on 4 to pass, but people don’t understand that even if it does, people still don’t have money for abortion, people still don’t have ways of traveling to their appointments,” she said. “Next year is going to be all about holding people to account.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Opponents argued it was a dangerous and arrogant step that will “<a href=\"https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-opposition-california-senate-bill-1047\">stifle innovation</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, SB 1047 — California state Sen. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/361562/california-ai-bill-scott-wiener-sb-1047\">Scott Wiener’s proposal</a> to regulate advanced AI models offered by companies doing business in the state — is now kaput, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/californias-gavin-newsom-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill-d526f621?mod=hp_lead_pos4\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/californias-gavin-newsom-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill-d526f621?mod=hp_lead_pos4\">vetoed</a> by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The proposal had garnered wide support in the legislature, passing the California State Assembly by a <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047\">margin of 48 to 16</a> in August. Back in May, it passed the Senate by 32 to 1. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bill, which would hold AI companies liable for catastrophic harms their “frontier” models may cause, was backed by a wide array of AI safety groups, as well as luminaries in the field like <a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-landmark-ai-bill-passes-assembly\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/yoshua-bengio-californias-ai-safety-bill-will-protect-consumers-innovation-tech/\">Yoshua Bengio</a>, and <a href=\"https://safesecureai.org/experts\">Stuart Russell</a>, who have warned of the technology’s potential to pose massive, even existential dangers to humankind. It got a surprise last-minute endorsement from <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1828205685386936567\">Elon Musk</a>, who among his other ventures runs the AI firm <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/27/24165619/elon-musk-xai-startup-6-billion-funding\">xAI</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lined up against SB 1047 was nearly all of the tech industry, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225648/openai-letter-california-ai-safety-bill-sb-1047\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://static.politico.com/e0/fd/e56dfaad40b39f29dd1dfa1164da/sb-1047-letter-6-25-24.pdf\">Facebook</a>, the powerful investors <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91175604/big-tech-lobbyists-ai-safety-bill-gavin-newsom\">Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz</a>, and some <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E2yDGXryPhhlwS4OdkzMpNeaG5r6_Jxa/view\">academic researchers</a> who fear it threatens <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/2/24058484/open-source-artificial-intelligence-ai-risk-meta-llama-2-chatgpt-openai-deepfake\">open source</a> AI models. Anthropic, another AI heavyweight, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364384/its-practically-impossible-to-run-a-big-ai-company-ethically\">lobbied to water down the bill</a>. After many of its proposed amendments were adopted in August, the company said the bill’s <a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/6a3b14a98a781a6b69b9a3c5b65da26a44ecddc6.pdf\">“benefits likely outweigh its costs.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the industry backlash, the bill seemed to be popular with Californians. In a poll designed by supporters and a leading opponent of the bill (meant to ensure that the poll questions were worded fairly), <a href=\"https://theaipi.org/voters-support-sb1047-in-collaborative-poll/\">Californians backed the legislation by 54 percent to 28</a> after hearing arguments from both sides. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The wide, bipartisan margins by which the bill passed the Assembly and Senate, and the public’s general support (when not asked in a biased way), might make Newsom’s veto seem surprising. But it’s not so simple. Andreessen Horowitz, the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/about/\">$43 billion venture capital giant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91175604/big-tech-lobbyists-ai-safety-bill-gavin-newsom\">hired Newsom&#8217;s close friend and Democratic operative Jason Kinney to lobby</a> against the bill, and a number of powerful Democrats, including <a href=\"https://democrats-science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-08-15%20to%20Gov%20Newsom_SB1047.pdf\">eight members of the US House</a> from California and former Speaker <a href=\"https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-opposition-california-senate-bill-1047\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, urged a veto, echoing <a href=\"https://x.com/GarrisonLovely/status/1824236448310022453\">talking points from the tech industry</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was the faction that eventually won out, keeping California — the center of the AI industry — from becoming the first state to establish robust AI liability rules. Oddly, Newsom <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SB-1047-Veto-Message.pdf\">justified</a> his veto by arguing that SB1047 did not go far <em>enough</em>. Because it focuses &#8220;only on the most expensive and large-scale models,&#8221; he worried that the bill &#8220;could give the public a false sense of security about controlling this fast-moving technology. Smaller, specialized models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models targeted by SB 1047.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newsom’s decision has sweeping implications not just for AI safety in California, but also in the US and potentially the world.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s inside SB 1047</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To have attracted all of this intense lobbying, one might think that SB 1047 was an aggressive, heavy-handed bill — but, especially after several rounds of revisions in the State Assembly, the actual law proposed to do fairly little. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It would have offered <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn\">whistleblower protections to tech workers</a>, along with a process for people who have confidential information about risky behavior at an AI lab to take their complaint to the state Attorney General without fear of prosecution. It would have also required AI companies that spend more than $100 million to train an AI model to develop safety plans. (The extraordinarily high ceiling for this requirement to kick in was meant to protect California’s startup industry, which objected that the compliance burden would be too high for small companies.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what about this bill would possibly prompt months of hysteria, intense lobbying from the California business community, and unprecedented intervention by California’s federal representatives? Part of the answer is that the bill used to be stronger. The initial version of the law was based the threshold for compliance on computing power, meaning that over time, more companies would have become subject to the law as computers continue to get cheaper (and more powerful). It would also have established a state agency called the “Frontier Models Division” to review safety plans; the industry objected to the perceived power grab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another part of the answer is that a lot of people were falsely told the bill does more. One prominent critic <a href=\"https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/californias-effort-to-strangle-ai\">inaccurately claimed</a> that AI developers could be guilty of a felony, regardless of whether they were involved in a harmful incident, when the bill only had provisions for criminal liability in the event that the developer <a href=\"https://safesecureai.org/responseletter\">knowingly lied under oath</a>. (Those provisions were subsequently removed anyway). <a href=\"https://lofgren.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/lofgren.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/8.7.24%20to%20Senator%20Wiener.pdf\">Congressional representative Zoe Lofgren of the science, space, and technology committee wrote a letter</a> in opposition falsely claiming that the bill requires adherence to guidance that doesn’t exist yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the standards do exist (<a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.800-1.ipd.pdf\">you can read them in full here</a>), and<em> </em>the bill did not require firms to adhere to them. It said only that “a developer shall consider industry best practices and applicable guidance” from the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Government Operations Agency, and other reputable organizations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of the discussion of SB 1047 unfortunately centered around straightforwardly incorrect claims like these, in many cases propounded by people who should have known better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">SB 1047 was premised on the idea that near-future AI systems might be extraordinarily powerful, that they accordingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment\">might be dangerous</a>, and that some oversight is required. That core proposition is extraordinarily <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment\">controversial</a> among AI researchers. Nothing exemplifies the split more than the three men frequently called the “godfathers of machine learning,” Turing Award winners Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun. Bengio — a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23924495/yoshua-bengio-scientific-director-mila-quebec-ai-institute-future-perfect-50-2023\">Future Perfect 2023 honoree</a> — and Hinton have both in the last few years become convinced that the technology they created may kill us all and argued for regulation and oversight. Hinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html\">stepped down</a> from Google in 2023 to speak openly about his fears. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">LeCun, who is chief AI scientist at Meta, took the opposite tack, declaring that such worries are nonsensical science fiction and that any regulation would strangle innovation. Where Bengio and Hinton find themselves supporting the bill, LeCun opposed it, especially the idea that AI companies should face liability if AI is used in a mass casualty event. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this sense, SB 1047 was the center of a symbolic tug-of-war: Does government take AI safety concerns seriously, or not? The actual text of the bill may have been limited, but to the extent that it suggested government was listening to the half of experts that think that AI might be extraordinarily dangerous, the implications were big. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s that sentiment that likely drove some of the fiercest lobbying against the bill by venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose firm a16z worked relentlessly to kill the bill, and some of the highly unusual outreach to federal legislators to demand they oppose a state bill. More mundane politics likely played a role, too: <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2024/08/19/ai-pelosi-house-seat-00174542\">Politico reported</a> that Pelosi opposed the bill because she’s trying to court tech VCs for her daughter, who is likely to run against Scott Wiener for a House of Representatives seat.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why SB 1047 is so important&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It might seem strange that legislation in just one US state had so many people wringing their hands. But remember: California is not just any state. It’s where several of the world’s leading AI companies are based.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And what happens there is especially important because, at the federal level, lawmakers have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/technology/ai-schumer-roadmap-congress.html\">dragging out</a> the process of regulating AI. Between Washington’s hesitation and the looming election, it’s falling to states to pass new laws. The California bill, if Newsom gives it the green light, would be one big piece of that puzzle, setting the direction for the US more broadly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rest of the world is watching, too. “Countries around the world are looking at these drafts for ideas that can influence their decisions on AI laws,” Victoria Espinel, the chief executive of the Business Software Alliance, a lobbying group representing major software companies, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/technology/california-ai-regulation.html\">told</a> the New York Times in June.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even China —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23621198/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-china-ai-safety-technology\">often invoked as the boogeyman in American conversations</a> about AI development (because “we don’t want to lose an arms race with China”) — is showing signs of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/china/2024/08/25/is-xi-jinping-an-ai-doomer\">caring about safety</a>, not just wanting to run ahead. Bills like SB 1047 could telegraph to others that Americans also care about safety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Frankly, it’s refreshing to see legislators wise up to the tech world’s favorite gambit:&nbsp;claiming that it can regulate itself. That claim may have held sway in the era of social media, but it’s become increasingly untenable.&nbsp;We need to regulate Big Tech. That means not just carrots, but sticks, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now that Newsom has killed the bill, he may face some sticks of his own. A poll from the pro-SB1047 <a href=\"https://theaipi.org/april-voters-prefer-ai-regulation-over-self-regulation-2-3-2/\">AI Policy Institute</a> finds that 60 percent of voters are prepared to blame him for future AI-related incidents if he vetoes SB 1047. In fact, they’d punish him at the ballot box if he runs for higher office: 40 percent of California voters say they would be less likely to vote for Newsom in a future presidential primary election if he vetoes the bill. <br></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Editor’s note, September 29, 5 PM ET: This story, originally published on August 31,</em></strong><em><strong> has been updated to reflect California Gov.

But while I like to point out problems, I also think that’s only half of my job. The other half is to ask, “Now what?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s what this newsletter will do. Some issues will dig into the specific ways that poverty punishes people across the country. Others will look at policies that either exacerbate or alleviate poverty. The overarching goal is to find tangible solutions to improve people’s lives. And so if you, like me, think that poverty is a problem that can be eradicated in the United States, then think of this newsletter as a way for us to envision what a realistic path toward that future could look like.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why so many Americans are poor</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">America has gone through many ups and downs since the civil rights era, but one thing has remained remarkably constant: In 1970, <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1971/demographics/p60-77.pdf\">12.6 percent of Americans</a> were considered poor; in 2023, that number was <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html#:~:text=Official%20Poverty%20Measure%3A,and%20Table%20A%2D1).\">11.1 percent</a> — or 36.8 million people. “To graph the share of Americans living in poverty over the past half-century amounts to drawing a line that resembles gently rolling hills,” the sociologist Matthew Desmond <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html\">wrote last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It might seem as though the persistence of poverty in the United States says something about how intractable the problem is. This is, after all, the richest country in the world. If America can’t rid itself of poverty, then who can? But it’s not that America <em>can’t </em>do it; it’s that it chooses not to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, there isn’t a single answer to why so many Americans continue to be stuck in poverty. It is true, for example, that the American welfare system is broken, consistently undermined, and, in some cases, set up to fail. Studies have shown that programs like <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/expanding-work-requirements-would-make-it-harder-for-people-to-meet\">work requirements don’t work</a>, and states have been <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/states-are-hoarding-52-billion-in-welfare-funds-even-as-the-need-for-aid-grows\">caught hoarding billions of dollars</a> worth of welfare funds instead of distributing them among the people they’re intended for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s also true that an extraordinary amount of money and effort go into establishing and administering antipoverty programs, and many of them do succeed. Social Security, for example, keeps <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-lifts-more-people-above-the-poverty-line-than-any-other\">more than 20 million people</a> above the poverty line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, America showed just how much of a choice poverty is: The short-lived pandemic-era child tax credit expansion cut child poverty by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/politics/child-tax-credit.html\">more than a third</a>. And the bolstered social safety net from Covid relief bills nearly halved child poverty in a single year — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/politics/child-tax-credit.html\">the sharpest drop on record</a>. Once those programs expired, however, the child poverty rate <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/10/child-poverty-rate-america-2023#\">bounced right back</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>One reason poverty is so stubborn</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, many homeowners in Lexington, Massachusetts came out to oppose zoning changes that would allow for more housing to be built in the wealthy Boston suburb. The people who needed the new housing were, understandably, not impressed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“How do you think it makes me feel when some people from a point of great privilege say that they don’t want the type of multifamily housing that I live in because it may look ugly or doesn’t fit the essence of this town?” one young resident, whose family relied on multifamily housing to be able to live in Lexington, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/14/opinion/lexington-town-meeting-zoning-reform/\">told the town legislature</a>. “Are we really setting the bar of entry to be a $1 million dollar house to join our community?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This situation is one answer to the question of what makes the problem of poverty so complicated: competing interests. The reality is that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/poverty-in-america-book-matthew-desmond-interview/674058/\">too many people benefit</a> from the existence of poverty. The economy already pits too many groups against each other, leaving many Americans afraid that they have too much to lose should we choose to build a more equitable society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homeowners are told that their homes are the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/369525/kamala-harris-housing-plan-corporate-landlords-homeownership\">key to building wealth</a>, so they reasonably want their property values to keep rising. For renters, on the other hand, any increase in housing costs is a loss. So while renters might want lawmakers to make room for more housing, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/14/opinion/lexington-town-meeting-zoning-reform/\">homeowners often resist</a> any change that could make their home prices stagnate.<br><br>This is one theme we’ll be exploring in Within Our Means — who stands to benefit and who stands to lose from the policies our lawmakers choose to pursue. We’ll also be looking at questions about fairness, political viability, and why antipoverty programs ought to be viewed as investments rather than handouts. And though we’ll often look at economic arguments, we also won’t shy away from arriving at morally driven conclusions. Sometimes, a program that helps the most vulnerable people is still worth paying for even if it doesn’t necessarily help the economy grow.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It doesn’t have to be this way</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even when divergent interests exist — like those between renters and homeowners — change is possible: Lexington <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/13/business/with-high-costs-little-new-housing-lexington-becomes-first-town-meet-ambitious-new-zoning-law/\">ended up approving</a> the necessary zoning changes to build more housing, and <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/boston-business-journal/brookline-oks-zoning-changes-aimed-at-increasing-multi-family-housing/3191287/#:~:text=Brookline%20is%20now%20one%20of,MBTA%20stations%20as%20of%20right.\">neighboring towns followed</a> its lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was not, by any means, an inevitable or easy outcome. For <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/the-second-and-third-battle-of-lexington\">many decades</a>, Lexington and its neighbors had been <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/17/opinion/brookline-housing-zoning-mbta-communities-harvard-street/\">symbols of liberal hypocrisy</a> — the kinds of places where you might see “Black Lives Matter” and “refugees are welcome” signs, but vehement opposition to any new housing project that would help desegregate the region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But one lesson out of Lexington is that sometimes people need a push. It wasn’t just that the town residents had a sudden change of heart — though some residents <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-massachusetts-town-leads-a-way-out-of-the-housing-crisis\">had clearly been troubled</a> by their own history. The state <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/09/mbta-communities-act-zoning-map\">had enacted a law</a> requiring jurisdictions served by public transit to authorize building more multifamily housing if they wanted to receive certain state funding. Whether the town ends up building the housing units that would make the suburb more affordable depends on whether residents put their money where their mouth is. But at least now, the door has been opened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the changes needed to eradicate poverty are small, unsexy bureaucratic adjustments, like local zoning reforms in Lexington and elsewhere. Others require an ambitious rethinking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The project of ending poverty will be costly, but it’s long been clear <a href=\"https://prospect.org/power/much-money-take-eliminate-poverty-america/\">that America can afford it</a>. If more than two-thirds of household wealth is <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/institute-for-economic-equity/the-state-of-us-wealth-inequality\">concentrated among the top 10 percent</a> while the bottom half of households own a mere 2.5 percent, then nobody should be living in squalor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Now there is nothing new about poverty,” <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/martin-luther-king-hungry-club-forum/552533/\">Martin Luther King, Jr. said nearly 60 years ago.</a> “What is new at this point though, is that we now have the resources, we now have the skills, we now have the techniques to get rid of poverty.

Climate change is real and terrifying, but even if it’s as bad as the worst predictions suggest, do we gain anything by resigning ourselves to that fate? What effect might our despair have on our ability to act in the present?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is our fatalism undercutting our capacity to tackle this problem?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On a recent episode of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\"><em>The Gray Area</em></a>, I invited Ayana Elizabeth Johnson on to talk about how we might collectively address climate change without falling into despair or getting mired in false hope. She’s a marine biologist, a co-founder of the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab, and the author of a new book called <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645855/what-if-we-get-it-right-by-ayana-elizabeth-johnson/\"><em>What If We Get it Right?</em></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a curated series of essays and poetry and conversations with a wide range of people who are all, in their own ways, trying to build a better future. And this is not a blindly optimistic book: The point <em>isn’t</em> that everything is fine. The point is that we have to act as though the future is a place we actually want to live in — not centuries into the distant future but now and in the decades to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to Johnson, there are already many concrete climate solutions. If we were motivated by a belief in a better tomorrow — not a worse one — we would implement more of those solutions (and find new ones).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, if you’re someone looking for inspiration, or reasons to feel hopeful — or, even better, for guidance on what to do and where to start — then this book, and this conversation with Johnson, is for you.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"What if we get climate change right? by The Gray Area with Sean Illing\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP1736669009\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;re a marine biologist, which I think is a standard top-five dream job for kids. Was that your gateway to environmentalism? Is that why you do this work? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Super common dream job — like many 5- to 10-year-olds are very into marine biology as a life path. But I was really just a kid who loved nature, which is honestly not very unique. How many kids like bugs and fireflies and shooting stars and octopuses and autumn leaves and all the rest of it? I was just like, “This all seems very cool.” That innate curiosity — that <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biophilia\">biophilia</a>, as E.O. Wilson calls it, the magnificent entomologist — is just part of who we are as humans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s normal to love the world. It&#8217;s less common to make that your job. But of course, once you fall in love with nature — whether it’s with one ecosystem or a few specific species — and you find out that it’s threatened, you&#8217;re like, “Wait a second, what are we doing about this? Is there a grown-up who&#8217;s already on top of this? Is this not sorted? Seems like we should protect forests and coral reefs and all the rest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My mom was cleaning out the closet and found these old school papers, and apparently I was writing the same essays since I was like 10 about nature being great and how we should protect it. So, it wasn&#8217;t always going to be the ocean. I wanted to become a park ranger at one point, an environmental lawyer at another. But the ocean seemed like it needed more advocates at the particular moment that I was thinking about graduate school. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You open your book by saying that any time you tell people that you do climate work, they invariably ask, and I&#8217;m quoting you — “how fucked are we?” Well, Ayana, how fucked are we? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We&#8217;re pretty fucked, but there&#8217;s a lot we could do to have a better possible future. And I think it&#8217;s important to always hold both of those things together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have already changed the climate. We are already seeing the intense heat waves and floods and droughts and wildfires and hurricanes. All of that is already supercharged by our changed climate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there&#8217;s still so much we can do. We basically have the solutions we need. We&#8217;re just being really slow at deploying them, at implementing them. We already know how to transition to renewable energy and stop spewing fossil fuels. We know how to protect and restore ecosystems that are absorbing all this carbon. We know how to green buildings, insulate buildings, shift to better public transit, improve our food system — the solutions are all right there. My book has a reality check chapter where I lay out all the bad news, but that&#8217;s three pages. And then the rest of the book asks, what are we going to do about it? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There&#8217;s no point anymore in talking about how to solve the problem of climate change, right? I mean, that ship has sailed. It&#8217;s all about adaptation now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah. I mean, the climate has already changed. There&#8217;s not a time machine back to before we put a completely mind-boggling amount of excess carbon into the atmosphere. Whether and how well we address the climate crisis determines the outcomes of life on Earth for all 8 million species and whether hundreds of millions of people live or die, and how well we all can live. So even though perfection is not an option, there&#8217;s such a wide range of possible futures, and we just need to make sure we get the best possible one. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is really about degrees of suffering and the consequences of specific choices we make — or won&#8217;t make, as it might be. The difference between temperature spikes of 2 and 4 degrees is the difference between lots of people living and dying. Right? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s easier for me to think about it in terms of the human body running a fever: the difference between you having a fever of 100 and 102 or 103 is a huge difference. And that&#8217;s the level of sensitivity to temperature that all species and ecosystems have. If we can prevent a half a degree of warming or a degree of warming, that actually makes a big difference. It&#8217;s worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People like to use different words to describe the project ahead of us — words like “sustainability” or “revolution.” You like to use the word “transformation.” Why is that a better way to frame this? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The two words that I pair together are “possibility” and “transformation.” There’s this wide spectrum of possible futures. I&#8217;m not an optimist. I&#8217;m not particularly hopeful given human history because we don&#8217;t have a great track record of addressing collectively major challenges that we face. There are some important exceptions to that, but the sense of possibility really drives me because the future is not yet written. Like, what if we just wrote a better one than the trajectory that we&#8217;re on? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How do we reshape and reimagine how we live on this planet and with each other? I can get excited about possibility and transformation — like, what kind of future do we want to create together?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Okay, you can’t see me right now but I&#8217;m wiggling — I’m wiggling my fingers, gesturing with like, possibility, excitement, sparkles. I just feel like we need to be asking more big questions of ourselves and each other in this moment. We&#8217;re at this inflection point in human history. We either get our shit together or we don&#8217;t. And obviously I would like us to at least try. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But you don&#8217;t like the word “sustainable,” right? You feel like that&#8217;s setting the bar too low? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s sort of just an <em>everywhere word</em>. It is useful — but it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of meaning. It&#8217;s very general. A useful analog I&#8217;ve heard is: If someone asked you how your marriage was going and you were like, “Eh, it&#8217;s sustainable,” I would probably say, “Well, okay, don&#8217;t want to trade lives with you.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, yes, I would say we should set a higher bar than sustainability, especially given that we&#8217;ve already degraded nature so much that I don&#8217;t want to just sustain what we have. I want to protect and restore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A beautiful question you pose in your book is: What if climate adaptation is beautiful? So, let’s talk about that. What if climate adaptation <em>is</em> beautiful? What then? Is it rainbows and sunshine? What are the kind of things we have to look forward to?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, I think we will always have rainbows and sunshine. That&#8217;s the good news. But imagine if we were just deliberate about building things that were aesthetically pleasing and durable and could be deconstructed and repurposed instead of demolishing things. Some cities and towns are now passing essentially deconstruction ordinances that say you have to take apart buildings instead of demolishing them, instead of just pulverizing everything and sending it to the landfill. You have to take it apart so the pieces can be reused like Legos, which seems obvious, almost like, “Why wouldn&#8217;t we always have been doing that?”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are so many choices that we&#8217;re currently making that shape our societal trajectory. Every day, we are building a piece of the future, something that will be here in 10 years or a century or more. So let&#8217;s just be really thoughtful about all that and make it nice. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Are you encouraged by the direction of the climate movement as it stands at the moment? What are your major concerns?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My primary concern is that we&#8217;re just not moving fast enough, given that we have basically all the solutions that we need to begin to make a difference. It&#8217;s just incredibly frustrating how politics are holding us back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I mean, in this country, there’s division between the two major parties about whether climate change exists and whether it&#8217;s something we should address, which is just so retrograde, I don&#8217;t even know where to start. And it&#8217;s especially frustrating because most Republican politicians are literally just pretending they don&#8217;t think it exists; they are fully aware that climate science is real, but it&#8217;s untenable politically for them to admit that. That&#8217;s a huge part of why we&#8217;re in this mess, as well as the fact that the fossil fuel lobby is ridiculously powerful in this country. And, you know, so many politicians are bought and paid for in one way or another, even though the fossil fuel industry doesn’t account for very many jobs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then you have the banking sector, which is funding all these fossil fuel corporations to continue expanding their extraction and infrastructure. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, 60 banks have provided 6.9 trillion in financing to fossil fuel companies. But the top four US banks alone, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, have provided almost $1.5 trillion to finance fossil fuel companies.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, yeah, if you have your money in any of those banks, I would encourage you to do something like move your retirement savings to a place that does not make the problem worse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What would be the difference between a Harris administration and another Trump administration? What are the stakes on the climate front?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The stakes are sky high. There are actually graphs projecting the difference in greenhouse gas emissions between the two.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s really remarkable because on one hand, you have Vice President Harris, who was the deciding vote in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest ever investment in climate solutions in world history. This Biden-Harris administration has created the American Climate Corps that has put tens of thousands of young people to work implementing climate solutions from reducing wildfire risk to installing solar panels to replanting wetlands. We have a loan program office in the Department of Energy that has hundreds of billions of dollars that they&#8217;re giving out to businesses that are figuring out this renewable energy transition. All of that could be completely wiped out, essentially on day one of a Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so on the other hand, you have in Trump a candidate who has offered to fossil fuel executives that if they donate $1 billion to his presidential campaign, he will basically do their bidding once he gets into the White House. That is how stark a difference this is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sean Illing</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s part of the book where you write — I&#8217;m quoting again— “Fuck hope. What&#8217;s the strategy?” Do you feel like we, meaning all of us collectively, have a clear, concrete strategy for creating a better future in the face of climate change? Or are we going to keep doing what we&#8217;ve been doing?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where I think media, Hollywood, music, art, culture makers broadly matter so much. I cannot literally show you what the future could look like. I can talk about it. I can write about it. I can interview people about it. I can, as I did for this book, commission art about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if it’s possible to go through our day-to-day and not encounter anything about climate, that’s a huge problem. Right now, climate coverage accounts for less than 1 percent of the minutes on major TV news stations; that’s actually gone down from recent years, so we&#8217;re going in the wrong direction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If this is not part of our day-to-day exposure, then it&#8217;s just always on the back burner. There&#8217;s always something more important. And we&#8217;re thinking about climate as something separate from our other concerns, whereas it&#8217;s actually just the context within which everything else right now is playing out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So there&#8217;s a chapter in the book called “I Dream of Climate RomComs,” where I interview producer Franklin Leonard, founder of The Blacklist out in Hollywood, and Adam McKay, filmmaker, writer, director, about the role of Hollywood in this. Because basically, to date, Hollywood has just shown us the apocalypse, the fire and brimstone, <em>The</em> <em>Day After Tomorrow</em> kind of stuff. And there are very few examples of not like utopian rose-colored glasses stuff, but like literally, what if we just used the solutions we had and projected that forward? What would that look like?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>To hear the rest of Illing’s conversation with Johnson, listen to our latest episode on </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area\">The Gray Area</a><em>, available wherever you get your podcasts.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

At least six people were killed in the strikes and more than 90 were injured, with the toll expected to rise. Israel had reportedly been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/why-israel-assassinate-nasrallah.html?smid=url-share\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/why-israel-assassinate-nasrallah.html?smid=url-share\">tracking</a> Nasrallah’s movements for months, and struck before he had the opportunity to escape.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nasrallah’s assassination marks a new point in the years-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.<strong> </strong>The intensity of the hostilities has waxed and waned over the years, hitting a relative low point before the war in Gaza broke out. The months since October 7, though, have brought a dangerous escalation in fighting that increasingly risks engulfing Hezbollah, Lebanon, and the broader region in all-out war. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the war in Gaza started. Hezbollah has vowed not to relent until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza, where more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-820486\">41,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. The hostilities have primarily taken the form of airstrikes and have deepened as ceasefire negotiations have stagnated, displacing more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html?smid=url-share\">more than 100,000 people</a> who face daily tit-for-tat attacks on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, the Gaza-based group behind the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have vowed to destroy Israel, have ties to Iran, and are considered terrorist organizations by many countries. While Israeli forces may have significantly weakened Hamas’s capabilities, however, it would likely be much more costly for Israel to go to war with Hezbollah, which is generally considered the most formidable militia group in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained\">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. It has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on\">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/\">digital espionage</a>. It also has the support of not just Iran’s autocratic regime, but also Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad after it helped him stay in power during the country’s ongoing civil war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, Israel has exposed some of Hezbollah’s weaknesses. Apparently infiltrating the group’s communications network, Israel reportedly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza\">planted explosives</a> in pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of Hezbollah, detonating them from afar and killing some of its members in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has also assassinated <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-13/hezbollah-israel-assassinations\">top Hezbollah commanders</a> over the course of the war in Gaza, and now has successfully killed its longtime leader.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Hezbollah said in a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah-killed-beirut-airstrikes/story?id=114310729\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah-killed-beirut-airstrikes/story?id=114310729\">statement</a> after Nasrallah’s death that it will “continue its jihad in confronting the enemy, supporting Gaza and Palestine, and defending Lebanon,” it’s far from clear what capabilities the group will have in the wake of the death of its leader and many of its top commanders. Nor is it<strong> </strong>clear that Hezbollah wants to be responsible for starting a regional war, especially after the group’s last war with Israel, in 2006, led to such heavy casualties. If anything can be learned from that war, it’s that conflict between Hezbollah and Israel would lead to much bloodshed on both sides as well as challenges for their international allies.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel and Hamas are at war.

But the groups did not elaborate further on their intentions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a delicate and possibly existential<strong> </strong>moment for Hezbollah, an organization whose primary goal is eliminating the state of Israel but that has also amassed significant political power in Lebanon that it is fearful of losing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They can take the whole region into a very hard war,” said <a href=\"https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/abedkan\">Abed Kanaaneh</a>, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University and author of <em>Understanding Hezbollah: The Hegemony of Resistance</em>. “But they have their own interests, and they need to sustain their popularity in Lebanon. So they have their own calculations to make.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hezbollah’s origins and ideology, briefly explained&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah was founded in Lebanon in 1982 by men inspired by former Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s radical brand of Shia theology. The organization was among many that resisted Israel’s invasion of Lebanon that year following an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to Britain orchestrated by Palestinian militants. Though the assassination was carried out by a rebel offshoot of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a militant group, Israel sought to eliminate all Palestinian militant groups operating from Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following bloody fighting that left <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/\">more than 17,000 dead</a>, Israel succeeded in driving out those militants through a US-brokered agreement in 1983, which brought an official end to the war and allowed the PLO to relocate to Tunisia. But Israel continued to occupy Lebanon, creating a militarized security zone in the south that it maintained until 2000 with the stated purpose of protecting Israelis from attacks by Lebanese militants. The occupation, however, “creat[ed] conditions for the establishment and proliferation of Hezbollah,” by angering and radicalizing the local Shia community, wrote Augustus Richard Norton in his book, <em>Hezbollah: A Short History.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25038542/AP860416032.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.396353296212,100,79.207293407577\" alt=\"In a black-and-white photo, a crowd of young men raise their fists and cheer; a few hold a large banner that reads: “Down with U.S.A,” while others hold a poster featuring the Hezbollah logo, the group’s name, with one of the letters raising up above the word to form a fist grasping a rifle.

When militant groups, including a fledgling Hezbollah, tried to drive out the Israeli forces, civilians were caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile,<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/iran\"> Iran</a> was nurturing Hezbollah, offering it training, funding, and weapons. The Iranian government saw Hezbollah as a vehicle to indirectly attack Israel, which it regarded as an<a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/2023/what-drives-israel-iran-hostility-how-might-it-be-resolved/\"> illegitimate state</a> and encapsulation of<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-long-history-of-iranian-distrust-of-the-west-4480\"> Western imperialism</a>, as well as a promising group that could<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/hezbollahs-record-war-politics\"> spread their ideas of Shia Islamic revolution</a> across the Middle East. The willingness of Hezbollah’s early leaders to<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah#:~:text=Hezbollah%20bills%20itself%20as%20a,allegiance%20to%20Iran's%20supreme%20leader.\"> pledge loyalty</a> to Iran’s then-leaders helped facilitate bonds as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah shares Iran’s Shia revolutionary ideology, and they both support Palestinians and oppose Israel. But there is disagreement among experts as to how much Iran is really calling the shots with Hezbollah. Some say Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy;<a href=\"https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/\"> Thanassis Cambanis</a>, director of Century International and author of <em>A Privilege to Die: Inside Hezbollah’s Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel</em>, said their relationship can be described as “very closely allied and ideologically aligned with a lot of shared interests,” but Hezbollah also has a “great deal of its own autonomy” and “shouldn’t be understood as a traditional proxy.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Iran has continued to fund Hezbollah over the years, and while it’s unclear exactly how much the organization has received, the US State Department estimates it at<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/\"> hundreds of millions of dollars</a> annually. Most of that goes to Hezbollah’s military wing, and that figure includes weapons supplied by Iran, including an arsenal of drones and rockets. But Hezbollah also has other revenue sources, both legal and illegal: through the Lebanese state, smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah laid out its ideology in a 1985 document addressed to the “Downtrodden in Lebanon and in the World.” It identified the United States and the Soviet Union as being among “the countries of the arrogant world” that inflict suffering on those less powerful, and explicitly rejected both the East and the West. It accused the US of using Israel as a “spearhead” against Muslims in Lebanon, and justified fighting the US, often by violent means, as an exercise of its “legitimate right to defend our Islam and the dignity of our nation.” It laid out a vision for Lebanon as an Iranian-style theocracy, though it emphasized the goal of Lebanese self-determination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And finally, it opposed any attempts to negotiate with Israel, seeking the country’s withdrawal from Lebanon as the first step toward “its final obliteration from existence and the liberation of venerable Jerusalem from the talons of occupation.” The document made clear Hezbollah saw (and still sees) Israel’s existence as a threat to Muslims throughout the region. In that sense, it found common ground with Sunni Muslim militant groups like Hamas, though Hamas’s reasons for wanting Israel destroyed were slightly different, focusing less on regional factors than on the establishment of an independent state in historical <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Palestine\">Palestine</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah has hewed closely to this agenda in the years since, even as it has evolved from a guerrilla group to a more professionalized resistance organization, political party, and provider of social services in Lebanon. It did, however, temper its Islamist rhetoric somewhat in<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-hezbollah/hezbollah-cuts-islamist-rhetoric-in-new-manifesto-idUSTRE5AT3VK20091130\"> an updated 2009 manifesto</a>, noting that making diverse Lebanon into a state that follows Islamic law is an unrealistic goal and affirming a commitment to “the achievement of true democracy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At present, Hezbollah has some<a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10703\"> 20,000 estimated active members</a> and is popular among the Shia, who represent about a third of the Lebanese population. The most heavily armed non-state actor in the world, Hezbollah has a<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-10-23/ty-article-magazine/150-000-rockets-and-missiles-the-weapons-israel-would-encounter-in-a-war-with-hezbollah/0000018b-573d-d2b2-addf-777df6210000\"> large arsenal</a> of long-range missiles that can reach well within Israel’s borders, as well as a comprehensive air defense system and commando force. It has refused to give up its arms despite<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20091111-hezbollah-warns-new-government-avoid-arms-issue\"> repeated</a> domestic and international calls for disarmament, arguing that it<a href=\"https://mepc.org/journal/rethinking-hezbollahs-disarmament\"> needs its weapons</a> so long as Israel continues to occupy what it claims is Lebanese territory in the Golan Heights (territory that Israel annexed in a move that has been recognized only by the US and no other country).</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25038534/GettyImages_1752453305.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Young men, many bearded, all in fatigues and red headbands with white Arabic writing, march in a military formation, carrying Hezbollah and Lebanese flags.

But Nasrallah was also a charismatic leader and orator who bolstered Hezbollah’s legitimacy through a sophisticated communication strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They are cosmopolitan and seasoned professionals, even in pursuit of problematic goals,” said Cambanis<em>.</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Hezbollah a militant group, a political party, or both?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Many other countries and organizations have followed suit, though some, including the<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/european-union\"> European Union</a>, distinguish between Hezbollah’s political and militant arms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some argue that’s a distinction without a difference. Unlike Hamas — in which the political and military leadership are separate and operate out of different locations — Hezbollah is a “very centrally controlled, unified organization,” Cambanis said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Their political leaders all have a military background,” he said. “Their resistance structure, to use their term, necessitates the armed struggle and the political struggle being inextricable.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah became associated with terrorism in the 1980s, during a time when it rejected the notion of participating in Lebanese politics. It viewed the political system, which was designed to split power between the country’s largest religious groups based on their size at the end of France’s dominion, as irredeemably corrupt and unfair. So Hezbollah dedicated itself to pursuing the objective of replacing the secular government with an Islamist one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its first step was ridding Lebanon of the foreign influences it believed to be the source of political strife: France and the US. Both countries had deployed peacekeeping forces to Lebanon amid the 1982 Israeli invasion and outbreak of civil war. From the US perspective, the most devastating <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/terrorism\">terrorist attack</a> was a 1983 suicide bombing on its military barracks in Beirut, an event that killed more than 300 American and French troops and Lebanese civilians. The Americans blamed Hezbollah for the attack and pulled all of their forces from the country. There was also the June 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 to Beirut, in which militants who later escaped without being captured killed a passenger and threatened to kill more unless Israel released hundreds of Lebanese prisoners. (Hezbollah denies involvement in either incident.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25038471/GettyImages_185605322.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.587156773255,100,78.82568645349\" alt=\"The arm of a dusty red digger stretches across the frame as men in Red Crescent T-shirts and marines half in their uniforms, half in civilian clothes sort through a massive pile of concrete and metal.

In one such incident, known as the Iran-Contra affair, then-US President Ronald Reagan traded weapons to Iran, which was then subject to an arms embargo, for the release of hostages held by Hezbollah. Hezbollah also kidnapped Israeli soldiers, conducted cross-border raids on the Israeli border, and fired rockets and missiles into Israel, again with the goal of ending Israel’s occupation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those tactics continued through the 1990s, even as Hezbollah changed its strategy and decided to enter politics. Hezbollah members were elected to the Lebanese Parliament for the first time in 1992, following the end of the 15-year Lebanese civil war that had seen various religious and secular subgroups clash. It was then that Lebanese leaders associated with Hezbollah came to recognize the “need to come to a modus vivendi with the state rather than remain outside the political system and judge it as abhorrent in strictly Islamic terms,” Norton wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Interestingly, Hezbollah built its political following on non-religious themes, which Norton identifies as “battling economic exploitation and underdevelopment, inequities in the political system, personal freedom and opportunity, and, of course, security.” But it wasn’t until after 2000, when Israel finally withdrew from the security zone it had established in southern Lebanon, that Hezbollah really gained popularity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though Israeli leaders insisted that their withdrawal from Lebanon was a unilateral political decision,<a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/twenty-years-after-the-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-hezbollah-faces-host-of-challenges/\"> many Lebanese credited Hezbollah</a> with driving out the army by stepping up its attacks. That — along with Hezbollah’s investment in schools, clinics, youth programs, and other social services — drove up the organization’s profile in Lebanon. It went on to progressively gain seats in Parliament over the years and to run a coalition government alongside its sometimes political rival Amal, which also draws its power from Lebanon’s Shia community. In the most recent Lebanese elections in 2022, Hezbollah won 13 of 128 seats, though the party and its allies lost their majority.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Hezbollah’s emergence as a political force didn’t mean that the group abandoned its violent tactics, at times undermining its authority as a resistance group. For instance, the United Nations found that four Hezbollah members were responsible for the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a car bombing that also killed 21 bystanders. And in 2006, the organization killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border raid. It failed to anticipate the disproportionate Israeli response and the ensuing war, which claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis. Neither side won; a UN-brokered ceasefire ended the conflict after a little over a month.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25038522/AP06071604915.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.611063838307,100,72.777872323386\" alt=\"Smoke still rises from a flattened building that surrounds a silver van, its remaining windows thoroughly coated with grime.

The organization has solidified Shia support by being effective in local government and supporting social services but has often struggled to expand its sphere of influence. Lebanon is a fractured society, with different religious and secular groups jockeying for power, and Hezbollah is hated by those who oppose its worldview, with little room for a middle ground.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They are successful at winning very deep loyalty from their supporters,” Cambanis said. “And they’re successful at being able to violently coerce and intimidate their opponents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52750dd3e4b08c252c723404/t/618dbc443f3402756b4b3f35/1636678726963/Lebanon+2021+FINAL.pdf\"> 2021 Zogby/NC State University poll</a>, 52 percent of Lebanese said they did not think Hezbollah promotes stability, though significant majorities of Shia, Druze, and Christians — all groups with leaders who’ve partnered with Hezbollah in the past — said that it did. The question is whether these cracks in Hezbollah’s support can be contained as the organization faces the prospect of an all-out war with Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Lebanese are okay with the limited war that Hezbollah is [waging] against Israel right now, but if it will become total war or much deeper war, I can say that Hezbollah’s support will drop off,” Kanaaneh said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s next for Hezbollah?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah has been reluctant to engage Israel in open combat since the devastating 2006 war, but the situation in Gaza appears to have changed that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah has “built their own narrative and public image of being part of the resistance axis” around the Palestinian cause, Kanaaneh said. While it was previously reluctant to declare war against Israel in part because of the suffering it would inflict on Lebanon, the situation in Gaza has become dire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel has decimated Gaza as well as the ranks of Hezbollah’s Sunni ally in Hamas, its link to the broader Islamic world. The fighting has already had a destabilizing effect on life in Lebanon, with tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/lebanese-grapple-with-fear-rage-and-tough-choices-as-regional-war-looms\">living in fear</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah and Israel have <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah\">exchanged thousands of attacks</a>, mostly in the form of airstrikes concentrated on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel. Hezbollah has also deployed forces and fired anti-tank guided missiles at Israel from this border region in <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah\">violation of a United Nations resolution</a> passed after the 2006 war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel has responded with targeted assassinations of Hezbollah leaders. That notably included top Hezbollah commander <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-a-ghost-73e6db68?mod=hp_lead_pos7\">Fuad Shukr</a>, who was drawn onto the seventh floor of his building in Beirut after receiving a mysterious phone call and killed in a missile strike. The group <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-07-09/pagers-and-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-to-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance\">stopped using cellphones after his death</a>, but that move backfired when Israel reportedly targeted thousands of their pagers and walkie-talkies, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza\">hiding explosives inside and detonating them</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25038508/GettyImages_1756541191.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A dark haired girl, perhaps 13, dressed in red, smiles softly as she stands looking out of a window.

In 2006, Hezbollah was estimated to have 12,000 missiles; now, it is thought to have 10 times that. Its troops have far more experience, including in urban combat, than they did before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, the last few weeks have shown just how deeply Israel has penetrated Hezbollah, to the point of being able to locate and assassinate Nasrallah, as well as a number of other top leaders. Israel has signaled that it will not let up in its campaign against the militant group, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-lebanon-united-nations-12e02fd82f35a8438aa907ca6762bac0\">telling</a> the UN on Friday that it would continue the fight against Hezbollah and Hamas in Gaza until “total victory.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless of how any fighting turns out, “everybody will lose from this,” Kanaaneh said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, September 28, 9:30 am ET:</strong> This story, originally published on October 28, has been updated with news of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s death and additional details on the group’s activities throughout the Gaza war.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

From performances by Lenny Kravitz and Public Enemy to the <a href=\"https://graziamagazine.com/articles/mtv-vmas-2024-archive-looks-trend/\">archival red-carpet looks</a> worn by many attendees and host Megan Thee Stallion, the show’s homages were as central to the celebration as the current artists who were nominated. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The overall throwback vibe was supposedly in service of the awards show’s 40th anniversary. However, the ceremony didn’t look that different from last year’s VMAs, which featured <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgVg91leS60\">a tribute</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit\">now-disgraced Diddy</a> or other recent ceremonies honoring <a href=\"https://www.mtv.com/vma/video-clips/93bdy6/busta-rhymes-performs-a-medley-of-his-hits-with-spliff-star\">Busta Rhymes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mtv.com/vma/video-clips/zzho1x/red-hot-chili-peppers-black-summer-and-can-t-stop\">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lil-wayne-nicki-minaj-ll-cool-j-2023-mtv-vmas-hip-hop-tribute-watch-1234822465/\">LL Cool J</a>. This seems to be MTV’s playbook: force-feeding older viewers ’80s, ’90s, and 2000s nostalgia, especially now while they struggle to reel in the young people in the age of streaming and TikTok. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a brand that once represented the freshness of youth culture, it seems to be frozen in time. The cable network is at an interesting crossroads: Should it try to court an elusive Gen Z audience, or should it keep chasing the last generation that watched them? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since 2019, the network has been banking on reunion-style shows and all-star editions of iconic series like <em>Teen Mom</em>, <em>Jersey Shore</em>,<em> Catfish</em>,<em> </em>and, most recently, the former VH1 show <em>The Surreal Life. </em>If you’re younger than 30, there’s not much on their current schedule that would immediately draw you in, particularly when streamers — like Netflix and even Peacock — are making buzzier content for teenagers and young adults, with popular reality shows like <em>Love Is Blind, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/361755/love-island-usa-season-6-finale\"><em>Love Island USA</em></a>, and <em>The Traitors</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ultimate case study in MTV’s uncertain future is its <em>Road Rules</em> spinoff <em>The Challenge</em>. Now the longest-running show on the network, having started 26 years ago, the <em>Road Rules</em> competition series has successfully carried the legacy of MTV throughout structural changes and mergers, recently expanding with an <em>All-Star</em>s edition on Paramount+ and <em>The Challenge: USA</em> on CBS<em>, </em>and some international versions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, the present iteration of <em>The</em> <em>Challenge</em> hasn’t exactly maintained the spirit of MTV. Currently, the show is attempting to conjure memories of its golden age with <em>Battle of the Eras</em>, the 40th season of the show, but the program falls flat without the unvarnished edge of the past. What was once a compelling clash of personalities and amateur athletes is now just a generic sports competition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To watch <em>The Challenge</em> from its early days to where it is now is to see how MTV has lost its way as a brand. The series might seem like an invincible force in television, but it’s only as fun as the infrastructure around it. But what’s the value of MTV nostalgia without all the weirdness and unpredictability?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The Challenge represented the rowdy ethos of MTV.&nbsp; Now it’s something a lot safer.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Challenge</em> has undergone several transformations since it premiered in 1998. The show ultimately became a competition between cast members of MTV’s <em>Road Rules</em>, where a group of attractive strangers live in a traveling RV, and <em>Real World</em>, where exactly seven attractive strangers share a house. (In later seasons, they added cast members of the dating show <em>Are You The One?</em>). Typically set in an exotic location, contestants live in what is essentially a frat house while they compete in a series of physical and mental games. These assignments range from outrageous stunts — like transferring food to a fake chicken’s mouth while dressed in a chicken suit — to brutal elimination challenges, like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3DW_ZSSavc\">Hall Brawl</a> where players wrestle each other to reach the end of a narrow passage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over time, the production’s budget has increased, and the show has become more physically demanding and stunt-y as a result. Die-hard fans refer to it as “America’s fifth sport,” and some competitors even undergo intense training to prepare. However, the boozy fights, romantic drama, and rivalries that span the seasons have always been as important as the actual gameplay, so much so that the premise of several previous seasons (<em>Battle of the Exes</em>, <em>Rivals, </em>etc.) rests upon personal beef and alliances. <em>The Challenge</em> maintains and extends these years-long storylines by reusing many of its most notorious and messiest competitors, like Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, Chris “CT” Tamburello, Laurel Stucky, Cara Maria Sorbello, and Aneesa Ferreira.  </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-106009052.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.654292878952,100,78.691414242097\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The cast of &lt;em&gt;Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Fresh Meat&lt;/em&gt; at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. | Dimitrios Kambouris/WireImage\" data-portal-copyright=\"Dimitrios Kambouris/WireImage\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the fighting and debauchery adds an exciting layer to an already impressive athletic showcase, these moments of chaos have often been truly ugly, coming at the expense of women, people of color, and queer people. Particularly in earlier seasons, there’s an uncomfortable amount of <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/11/28/tv-star-susie-meister-my-reality-is-our-tragedy/\">misogynistic language</a>, hostility, and condescension toward female players. Black contestants have been met with similar microaggressions, if not <a href=\"https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/the-challenge-star-trishelle-s-racist-remark-aneesa-revisited\">blatant</a> <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/the-challenges-leroy-garrett-opens-up-about-camila-nakagawa-racist-outburst-mtv-apologizes/\">racism</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Producers tried to rectify this in 2020 when they hastily suspended <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-purging-of-dee-nguyen-and-mtvs-disturbing-history-of-reality-tv-racism\">contestant Dee Nguyen</a> for making an inappropriate joke on Twitter about the Black Lives Matter movement. They also made the controversial choice to edit her out of the rest of the season. This foreshadowed a more censored approach to the program, one that would completely change the feel of <em>The Challenge</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Efforts by the network to remedy a culture of poor behavior on <em>The Challenge</em> was well-meaning but ultimately over-corrective. For example, night-out scenes, where a fight might break out or cast members might hook up, are now used as opportunities for competitors to discuss game strategy. On podcasts dedicated to the show, cast members constantly complain about messier drama being left out of the show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You see a sort of progress happening in terms of the show not being as problematic as it was before,” says <em>Challenge</em> fan Kelli Williams, who co-hosts the podcast <em>Beyond the Blinds</em>. “But then there&#8217;s also the [newer] problem that it takes away from the drama of the show.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In response to BLM and changing ethical standards in reality TV, <em>The Challenge </em>has struggled to evolve while focusing on the aspects of the show that made it fun. In newer seasons, including the current <em>Battle of the Eras </em>season, the tone of the show has become almost comically serious and inspirational, as though the contestants are competing in the Olympics or for some greater cause beyond winning money and being on TV. Even the show’s dry, no-nonsense host, T.J. Lavin, has a gentler manner. It hardly feels like it’s from the same network that discovered Snooki and Spencer Pratt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> “You think of someone like Leroy,” says Williams, of fan-favorite Leroy Garrett, a <em>Real World</em> alum who first competed on <em>The Challenge: Rivals</em>. “When he came on the show, he was a sanitation worker, and you&#8217;re watching him jump over cars over water. You’re like, ‘Wow, he&#8217;s not trained to do this.’ Whereas now people have to prepare for <em>The Challenge</em>, and they call it the ‘fifth sport.’ Be real right now. This is <em>The Challenge</em>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Battle of the Eras</em> catering to Gen X and millennial fans is exciting in theory. But the neutered flagship show can’t resuscitate the original DNA of MTV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Where does MTV go from here?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">MTV was always going to have a difficult time sustaining itself as a cultural tastemaker, especially as a cable station in an online world. But the network has a history of reinventing itself to meet the moment. The channel, founded in 1981, was initially targeted toward white, male rock fans until it was forced by public pressure to feature music videos by Black R&amp;B and rap artists, debuting the program <em>Yo! MTV Raps</em> in 1988.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When MTV’s first generation of viewers started outgrowing the channel in the early ’90s, it pioneered reality programming, starting with <em>Real World</em> and, later, shows like <em>The Osbournes</em>, <em>The Hills, </em>and <em>Jersey Shore</em>. As Amanda Ann Klein writes in her book <em>Millennials Killed the Video Star</em>, MTV executives have always had to work hard to maintain MTV’s key demographic. “The youth audience is fickle because the moment a company figures out how to create content that pleases them, they age out of that content,” she writes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reality shows sustained the network for nearly two decades, in addition to music-focused hits like <em>Total Request Live (TRL) </em>and <em>MTV Unplugged</em>.  The early 2010s saw the final season of <em>Jersey Shore</em>, the surprise scripted hits like <em>Awkward</em> and <em>Teen Wolf</em>, and the last truly memorable VMAs thanks to Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke – before a few years entering the proverbial programming desert, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/cable-tv-decline-streaming-cord-cutting-1234710007/\">running episodes of the clip show <em>Ridiculousness</em></a><em> </em>almost 24/7. By 2019, it seemed as though MTV had found a solution by upcycling successful IP. The reunion show <em>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</em> <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/tv-ratings-jersey-shore-family-vacation-has-strong-premiere-1100398/\">garnered big ratings</a> and was followed by a <em>Teen Mom</em> reunion series and a not-as-successful reboot of <em>The Hills. </em>On Paramount+, MTV launched <em>The Challenge: All Stars</em> and <em>Real World: Homecoming</em>. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1021995388.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Mike &#039;The Situation&#039; Sorrentino, Paul DelVecchio a.k.a.

In the book <em>Television&#8217;s Streaming Wars</em>, Florida State University professor Leigh H. Edwards writes about how MTV’s nostalgic marketing strategy cleverly (if not temporarily) reignited interest in the brand. “In effect, MTV turns existing IP into new content on streaming that targets the older streaming audience and encouraging those viewers to rewatch older content,” she tells Vox. “These series generate nostalgia by including flashback footage that encourages audiences to go watch the original episodes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This nostalgia approach, though, is more like a life jacket than a sustainable business plan. <em>Real World: Homecoming</em> is no longer available to stream and was seemingly canceled. <em>The Challenge: All Stars</em> has become less and less distinguishable from the original series as the casts overlap. Despite all the relative star power of <em>Battle of the Eras</em>, the landmark season still represents a ratings decline since the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/04/mtvs-the-challenge-total-madness-season-35-premiere-ratings-key-demos-1202899199/\">highly watched</a> 35th season, <em>Total Madness</em>. Last year, <em>Variety</em> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2023-tv-network-ratings-1235850482/\">reported</a> that MTV was the 44th most-watched television network in 2023, an 11 percent drop in total viewers from the previous year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s any hope for an MTV revival, it’s that the viewership for this year’s VMAs <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mtv-video-music-awards-ratings-viewership-1236142631/#:~:text=The%20VMAs%20nabbed%20approximately%204.08,biggest%20audience%20in%20four%20years.\">increased by 8 percent </a>compared to last year’s show. One has to think this has more to do with appearances by big, next-gen artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan — as well as ratings magnet Taylor Swift — than the show’s tributes to its peak era. At a time when networks are constantly renamed, rebranded, or completely scrapped, losing MTV wouldn’t be surprising, but it would be a huge cultural blow. Unfortunately, a network can only rely on nostalgia for so long before it looks like a graveyard. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_van_hollen_letter_to_prudential_regulators_on_baas_oversight_91124.pdf\">are calling for banking reforms</a>, and the FDIC is <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/fdic-proposes-deposit-insurance-recordkeeping-rule-banks-third-party\">proposing changes</a> to its rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/fintechs-a-new-paradigm-of-growth\">a growing number of people</a> are embracing these financial technology, or fintech, services. More than <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2023/07/05/the-checking-account-war-is-over-and-the-fintechs-have-won/\">a third of Gen Z and millennials</a> used a fintech app or a digital bank as their primary checking account, according to a 2023 Cornerstone Advisors study.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So some questions are worth asking: Is it a bad idea to use an app like Venmo as your main bank? Are digital banks like Chime trustworthy enough?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answer to both questions is yes. Venmo is not a bank, and using it as your primary checking account comes with some risks. Some fintech companies, like Chime, are just as big as traditional banks and offer some nice perks. Again, because they’re nontraditional, there are risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You&#8217;re not going to go back to a world where everybody works with a small bank and walks into a branch,” Shamir Karkal, co-founder of Simple, one of the first digital banks. “The future is just going to be more fintech, and I think we all just need to get better at it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To get better at all of this, it helps to know what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Neobanks and money transmitters, briefly explained</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The term fintech can refer to a lot of things, but when you’re talking about everyday services for everyday people, it typically refers to either neobanks or money transmitters. Chime is a neobank. Venmo is a money transmitter. They’re regulated in different ways, but because most of these companies issue debit cards, many people treat them like checking accounts. Fintech apps are not the same thing as FDIC-insured banks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neobanks are fintech companies that offer services like checking accounts in partnership with chartered banks, which are FDIC-insured. Neobanks sometimes enlist intermediaries known as banking-as-a-service, or BaaS, companies, which are not FDIC-insured. Still, you will often see the FDIC logo on neobank websites, just like you see it stuck to the glass doors of many brick-and-mortar banks. That logo instills trust, and thanks to their partnerships, neobanks can claim some FDIC protections. But because they do not have bank charters, these neobanks and BaaS companies are not directly FDIC-insured. Instead, neobank customers can be eligible for something called <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/financial-institution-employees-guide-deposit-insurance/pass-through-deposit-insurance-coverage\">pass-through deposit insurance coverage</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three things to know</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Listen to Vox’s Adam Clark Estes break down the potential pitfalls of keeping your money in a fintech app, like Venmo or Chime.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@vox/video/7419371061923400991\" data-video-id=\"7419371061923400991\" data-embed-from=\"embed_page\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@vox\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@vox?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener\">@vox</a> <p>Venmo or Chime aren&#8217;t as safe as you think they are. Here&#8217;s what to know.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Vox - Vox\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-Vox-7419370992780233503?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener\">♬ original sound &#8211; Vox &#8211; Vox</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pass-through insurance is a simple concept <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-analysis-of-deposit-insurance-coverage-on-funds-stored-through-payment-apps/full-report/\">that’s deceivingly complex in practice</a>. Essentially, if you deposit money into an account with a neobank, like Chime, the funds get routed to a chartered bank, sometimes through one of those BaaS intermediaries. If the chartered bank fails, no problem: FDIC insurance kicks in, and you can recoup up to $250,000 of your deposits. If the intermediary fails or the neobank itself fails, you might be eligible for pass-through insurance — but you might not. In its explainer about when or if you’ll get your money back in these kinds of situations, the FDIC literally says, “<a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2024-06/banking-third-party-apps\">It depends</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“American consumers see the FDIC logo, and they interpret that as meaning: My money is safe and I will get it back,” said Jason Mikula, who runs the popular <a href=\"https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile\">Fintech Business Weekly newsletter</a>. “That&#8217;s just not what FDIC does exactly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Money transmitters, also known as money services businesses, are even further removed from the perceived safety of the FDIC. Put bluntly, if you’re keeping all your money in a Venmo or Cash App account, you don’t qualify for FDIC insurance. Money transmitters are not neobanks or banks at all but rather completely <a href=\"https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-a-money-transmitter#introduction\">different legal entities</a> that are regulated by individual states as well as the Department of the Treasury. There are certain protections provided by these agencies, but FDIC insurance is not one of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So when an app like <a href=\"https://www.withyotta.com/security\">Yotta</a> or <a href=\"https://www.chime.com/\">Chime</a> says on its website that it’s FDIC insured, it’s not a lie, but it’s not necessarily true either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Venmo, to its credit, admits in the fine print of its homepage that its parent company PayPal “is not a bank” and “is not FDIC insured.” To confuse you even more, however, certain PayPal services that enlist a chartered bank partner, like a PayPal Mastercard or savings account, <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/program-banks-tnc\">might qualify for FDIC insurance</a>. Again, it depends.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The perils and perks of banking with an app</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fintech companies take careful steps to make banking with them feel safe. They include the FDIC logo on the website to provide customers with some peace of mind, even though the fine print on those protections is more complicated. They issue debit cards with the Visa or Mastercard logo to suggest that these cards play by the same rules as any big bank’s debit card. These logos can act as a stamp of approval, an assurance that your money is in good hands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is actually the heart of the problem, as far as Sen. Elizabeth Warren is concerned. This month, she and Sen. Van Hollen <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_van_hollen_letter_to_prudential_regulators_on_baas_oversight_91124.pdf\">asked regulators</a> to ban neobanks and fintech companies from using the FDIC name and logo if they were only offering pass-through insurance. They also called for greater supervision of these companies under the Bank Service Company Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The average consumer shouldn’t be expected to understand the intricacies of FDIC insurance in order to comfortably and safely save or invest their money,” Warren’s letter says. “Consumers must feel confident that they are dealing with a regulated and insured entity when they see the FDIC logo.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t necessarily mean that all neobanks and fintech companies are untrustworthy. In some cases, the sheer size and track record of fintech companies can instill quite a bit of trust. Chime, the largest digital bank <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2024/03/24/is-chime-ready-for-an-ipo-it-has-more-primary-customers-than-chase/\">with roughly 22 million customers</a>, scored a $25 billion valuation in its latest round of funding and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/chime-financial-is-said-to-target-public-listing-in-us-in-2025?sref=qYiz2hd0\">is planning to go public next year</a>. Venmo’s parent company, PayPal, is widely <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2023/60percent-of-consumers-trust-paypal-over-their-bank-with-stored-payment-credentials/\">considered safe and trustworthy</a>. And don’t expect Block, the $42 billion company that owns Cash App <a href=\"https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-financial-services-begins-banking-operations\">as well as its own chartered bank</a>, to fail any time soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The truth is, even if there is some false sense of security, fintech apps offer certain customers features that big banks can’t or won’t. One thing that’s made Chime and many other neobanks so popular, for instance, is that they don’t charge so many fees. That’s a huge boon to young people <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22367985/paypal-venmo-financial-inequality-unbanked-underbanked\">as well as people without bank accounts</a>. If a fintech app is your only option, then you might not care so much about FDIC insurance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you&#8217;re poor in America and you&#8217;re banking at Chase or Wells Fargo, you&#8217;re going to get overdraft fees, minimum balance fees,” Mikula explained. “So there is a real need that [fintech] companies fulfill as a result of your establishment banks essentially not wanting to bank poor people because it&#8217;s difficult to do profitably.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As many as 6 percent of Americans <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/23percent-of-low-income-americans-are-living-without-a-bank-account.html\">were living without a bank account</a> in 2023, according to Federal Reserve data. That share grows to 23 percent for those making less than $23,000 a year. The unbanked population, which disproportionately comprises Black, Hispanic, and undocumented people, is at a greater risk of falling victim to predatory lending practices, including payday loans. Some fintech companies also offer short-term loans, though they’ve been criticized <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/earned-wage-access-costs-payday-loans-9679d1bd09546d12074e0f27e23f0632\">for being predatory as well</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fraud alert</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Payment apps like Venmo are popular with scammers. Using a Venmo-branded debit card <a href=\"https://venmo.com/purchaseprotection/\">comes with some purchase protection</a>. If you happen to fall for a scam, however, there’s a good chance the app will not pay you back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209681208-I-accidentally-paid-a-stranger-on-Venmo\">Venmo</a>, <a href=\"https://cash.app/help/6544-avoiding-common-scams-with-cash-app\">Cash App</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.zellepay.com/safety-education/fraud-scams-overview\">Zelle</a> are all clear about issuing refunds for payments to other individuals: They don’t do it. Or at least they can’t guarantee it. You should treat these peer-to-peer payments like cash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here are some tips for spotting and avoiding scams on <a href=\"https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048404533-Common-Scams-on-Venmo\">Venmo</a>, <a href=\"https://cash.app/help/6544-avoiding-common-scams-with-cash-app#\">Cash App</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.zellepay.com/safety-education/fraud-scams-overview\">Zelle</a>. But if you’re more of a motivated-by-fear person, read <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zelle-fraud-scam-swimming-pool-online-payment-apps-mobile-banking-2023-10\">this story</a> about a guy who wanted a deal on a swimming pool and got “a $31,000 lesson in the downside of payment apps” instead.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, fintech companies offer the unbanked <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/12/17/three-barriers-unbanked-citizens-face-and-how-fintech-overcomes-them/\">the ability to save money and build credit</a>. For someone who can’t open a traditional bank account, Venmo can be a lifeline, since they can add funds to their Venmo balance and then pay bills using their Venmo debit card without needing a traditional checking account. If they have access to a smartphone, getting basic banking services is simple these days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As I learned firsthand when testing out many of these services over the years, it’s very easy to sign up for and easy to deposit money into a fintech app. If you have a problem, however, help can be hard to find. Many fintech companies and neobanks, including Chime, lack brick-and-mortar locations, which means you can’t walk into a branch to get an issue resolved. In fact, poor customer service <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/neobanks-customer-service-growing-client-base\">is a common complaint</a> for these companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means you should always research a company before giving money to it. Read the reviews and study the fine print. Obvious red flags include hidden fee structures and reports of customers not being able to withdraw their money. You should also consider trying services out with small sums rather than your life savings. And, as always, <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/mobile-payment-apps-how-avoid-scam-when-you-use-one\">watch out for scams and frauds</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What is true in the real world is even more true in the app world: Beware of deals that look too good to be true. Only gamble with what you’d be willing to lose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story was also published in the Vox Technology newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here</a></em></strong><em>&nbsp;so you don’t miss the next one!</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

His conclusions are highly provocative —&nbsp;and damning toward the Israeli government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates, a former writer for the Atlantic, skyrocketed to prominence with the 2014 publication of “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">The Case for Reparations</a>,” a deeply researched essay on the history of racial housing discrimination in America that became a national sensation. The essay almost single-handedly turned reparations <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/ta-nehisi-coates-revisits-the-case-for-reparations\">from a joke into a serious talking point in American politics</a>, and in the process, it made Coates an intellectual celebrity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2018, Coates was a National Book Award winner, a Pulitzer finalist, and widely discussed as the next James Baldwin. Yet around that time, Coates took a step back from his perch as one of America’s leading public intellectuals. He got off Twitter. He stepped down from the Atlantic. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/24/20879736/water-dancer-review-ta-nehisi-coates\">He published a novel</a> and wrote a Black Panther arc for Marvel. He started teaching journalism at Howard. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/3/16387092/ta-nehisi-coates-we-were-eight-years-in-power-review\">The writer who set the conversation on race in America during the 2010s</a> decided he had had enough halfway through the Trump years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Message</em> is Coates getting back into political discourse for the first time in years, and characteristically, he’s not starting off with an easy problem. In his new book, Coates sets out to make the case that the treatment of Palestinians in Israel is analogous to the treatment of Black Americans in the Jim Crow South, and that as such, it is morally reprehensible — an incendiary argument but one that Coates imbues with the force of his own newly discovered conviction. “I don’t think I ever, in my life, felt the glare of racism burn stranger or more intense than it did in Israel,” Coates writes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>He has always positioned himself as a diagnostician rather than a physician</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>The Message</em>, Coates makes it clear early on that he’ll be presenting his argument primarily from the perspective of Palestinians, whom he describes as “voiceless” and, as such, in need of the platform he can offer them. He declines to mention Hamas. He also declines to suggest potential solutions for the problem of Israel and Palestine, a move that is not unusual for him; he has always positioned himself as a diagnostician rather than a physician. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That perspective has predictably earned Coates detractors who find his omissions disgraceful. <a href=\"https://x.com/CBSMornings/status/1840749848703770679\">In a widely seen interview with Coates on <em>CBS Mornings</em></a>, host Tony Dokoupil declared that Coates’s work would “not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,” before pressing Coates on whether Israel should have a right to exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,” Coates replied. He added, “There’s nothing that offends me about a Jewish state. I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ta-Nehisi Coates’ new book, “The Message,” is a trio of interconnected essays that examine how the stories people tell — or avoid telling — can shape and even distort reality: “I am most concerned always with those that don’t have a voice.” <a href=\"https://t.co/bDsBxZMbah\">https://t.co/bDsBxZMbah</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/G4WCkI146I\">pic.twitter.com/G4WCkI146I</a></p>&mdash; CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1840749848703770679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What has always made Coates’s work most striking is not just his ability to muster a convincing argument. He’s also simply a beautiful prose stylist. Coates cares about the mechanics of a sentence, about its rhythms and imagery. He makes you want to read him, even if what he’s saying feels frightening or hard to take, because his voice is so astounding on the page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates writes that his aim in writing <em>The Message</em> is to “haunt” his readers, to give them images and ideas they cannot get out of their minds. In that, he succeeds. <em>The Message</em> is haunting. It gets under your skin. People who will not read other books on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will read this one by dint of Coates’s unparalleled stature, and they will remember it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates is the rare writer who can turn his political writing into haunted houses. And he’s never more effective than when he transforms himself into the main character.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Searching for a moment of ecstatic discovery</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Message</em> is made up of four separate essays, of which the essay on Palestine is the last and longest. The book becomes a sort of travelogue, each essay taking place in a new town, where Coates tracks the different ways race has manifested itself there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The book is also framed as a letter to his Howard writing students, laced liberally with his philosophy on what writing should look like. Each new location prompts thoughts on what Coates’s duty is as a writer, or what the effects of writing properly done can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He writes that he finds the most aesthetic pleasure in writing when he is able, through research and argument, to answer one of his own questions and convince himself of that answer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Through reading, through reporting, I begin to comprehend a truth. That moment of comprehension is ecstatic,” Coates writes. “Writing and rewriting is the attempt to communicate not just a truth but the ecstasy of a truth. It is not enough for me to convince the reader of my argument; I want them to feel that same private joy that I feel alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates’s writing at its best is animated by that private joy, by the ecstasy he feels when he has reached a new understanding of the world. You can see his sheer grim delight in making these discoveries in “The Case for Reparations.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To ignore the fact that one of the oldest republics in the world was erected on a foundation of white supremacy, to pretend that the problems of a dual society are the same as the problems of unregulated capitalism, is to cover the sin of national plunder with the sin of national lying,” Coates writes in that essay, the rhythms of his sentences building and mounting as if he were a preacher at the pulpit. “The lie ignores the fact that reducing American poverty and ending white supremacy are not the same.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Coates’s writing at its best is animated by that private joy, by the ecstasy he feels when he has reached a new understanding of the world</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a triumph to the way he writes here: <em>I figured it out; they tried to hide it but I figured it out; I’m going to make you see exactly what I figured out</em>. The thing he has figured out, put plainly, is that America is a rich country because it was built on stolen land, with stolen labor and stolen resources. That is the basis of the argument for reparations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By contrast, Coates’s 2015 essay “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/10/the-black-family-in-the-age-of-mass-incarceration/403246/\">The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration</a>” is probably one of the least-influential of his major features for the Atlantic<em>.</em> In his essay collection <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/3/16387092/ta-nehisi-coates-we-were-eight-years-in-power-review\"><em>We Were Eight Years in Power</em></a>, Coates describes it as “an end point for my inquiries,” and that sense of resignation bleeds into the writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There, Coates doesn’t seem to make any major theoretical advances in his own understanding of the world. As such, even though the essay is well-researched and well-argued, it seems to lie inert on the page. It’s not a piece that haunts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The comfort of redemptive myths&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>The Message</em>, Coates once again returns to his own ecstatic search for truth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Each of the three essays preceding the final one on Palestine serves to establish Coates as his own main character, a man whose understanding of the world will be fundamentally changed by what he sees in Palestine during a 10-day trip in 2023. What he finds out shocks him into a new state of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He begins at Howard, which he attended as a student and which he credits with teaching him that his writing must “be in service to a larger emancipatory project.” It’s here that he lays out his values as a writer, his passionate love for language, his belief that its pleasures must be harnessed for a greater political good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his second essay, Coates travels to Senegal and grapples with his own discomfort with the “vindicationist tradition” of Black America that says that Black people were born to be royalty, the kings and queens of Africa. He understands that this redemptive myth is a response to centuries of oppressive pseudoscience and philosophy that sought to prove that Black people were naturally inferior to whites — but still, he’s suspicious of any story that relies so heavily on the idea that social hierarchies are good when your personal group is the one on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He visits <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/26/\">Gorée</a>, the island that is popularly held to have been the largest slave-trading center on the African coast. Coates is aware that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/07/01/the-sincere-fiction-of-goree-island-africas-best-known-slave-trade-memorial/\">historians now dispute that idea</a>, but he finds himself still immensely moved by the experience of visiting it. For Coates, Gorée becomes a sort of personal Israel, a promised land, a mythic homeland he is aware does not truly belong to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have a right to our imagined places, and those traditions and places are most powerful when we confess that they are imagined,” Coates concludes. “We have a right to imagine ourselves as pharaohs, and then again the responsibility to ask if a pharaoh is even worthy of our needs, our dreams, our imagination.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates travels next to South Carolina, where a teacher had been forced to drop <em>Between the World and Me</em> from her curriculum because it made some of her white students uncomfortable. This essay serves as a kind of proof of the ideas Coates laid out at Howard: that beautiful language marshaled for a worthy political project can change people’s minds.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/sc-statehouse.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.658825623304,100,78.682348753393\" alt=\"A grand building with a domed tower and columned front, flanked by palm trees and a stone monument.\" title=\"A grand building with a domed tower and columned front, flanked by palm trees and a stone monument.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The South Carolina State House at dusk.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He keeps meeting Southern white people who say that his writing has reshaped the way they look at the world, and that, Coates concludes, is why conservative governments are always trying to ban his books and the works of other Black writers. People in positions of power, he says, are threatened by narratives that question their natural superiority.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It all works not simply to misinform but to miseducate; not just to assure the right answers are memorized but that the wrong questions are never asked,” Coates writes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Applying the lens of American racial caste politics&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Coates reaches Israel in the final and longest essay of <em>The Message</em>, the arcs of the previous essays become foreshadowing for what he is on the precipice of learning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates reads Israel as a sort of twisted realization of the dream of the vindicationist tradition. He imagines Zionist Jews as people who, like the descendents of enslaved Africans, have been deprived of power for centuries and millennia, and who then find a way to claim strength and safety for themselves — only to brutally inflict that power on others.<strong> </strong>This is his reading of the founding of Israel: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23921529/israel-palestine-timeline-gaza-hamas-war-conflict\">that the first Arab-Israeli war offered</a> a chance for Israel’s founders to prove that they were not the Jews who had been so horribly killed in the Holocaust, that they were strong and that they could fight and conquer in their own name.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates spends 10 days in Israel over the summer of 2023, before the current war broke out, traveling between the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Once there, he struggles to understand how he could have been so unaware of how brutal life is for Palestinians in Israel and Israeli-occupied territories. He has always had the sense, he writes, that “Israel as a country … was doing something deeply unfair to the Palestinian people,” but “I was not clear on exactly what.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moreover, his sense from American political coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict left him with a sense that the whole situation “was so fraught that a body of knowledge akin to computational mathematics was needed to comprehend it.” But the fact that a situation might be complex, he concludes, does not mean he cannot recognize brutality when he sees it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/East-Jerusalem.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.75214828329,100,78.49570343342\" alt=\"An ornate octagonal structure with blue Islamic mosaic walls and a golden dome. Crowds mill around on the stone square in front of the building.\" title=\"An ornate octagonal structure with blue Islamic mosaic walls and a golden dome. Crowds mill around on the stone square in front of the building.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After visiting Palestine, he’s astounded to realize how few reporters and editors claimed Palestinian heritage in American newsrooms. He comes to see this blind spot of American journalism as analogous to the way conservatives keep trying to censor his books in the South: “No other story, save one that enables theft, can be tolerated” by the powerful, he concludes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Describing the project of Israel as one of theft is classic Coates. What he brings to his descriptions of Palestine is his bone-deep knowledge of American racial caste politics, for which he developed his specialized and distinctive vocabulary. At the Atlantic, Coates described the state policies that strip wealth and resources from Black Americans as “plunder,” and he uses the same words to describe Israel’s policies governing Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It is not just the cops shooting your son, though that happens,” Coates writes. “It is not just a racist carceral project, though that is here too. And it is not just inequality before the law, though that was everywhere I looked. It is the thing that each of those devices served—a plunder of your home, a plunder both near and perpetual.” What Israel wants, Coates argues, is Palestinian land, minus the Palestinians who live on it. Any policy in service of that larger aim is what he describes as plunder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates describes being accosted on the street by an armed soldier who demands he identify his religion. He writes about being held at a checkpoint for hours because his guides are Palestinians. He marvels at Israeli law, which he says “clearly and directly calls for a two-tier society,” with its arcane sub-citizen hierarchies for Palestinian residents, its stinginess in allowing Palestinian citizens to pass their Israeli citizenship on to their descendents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I figured it out; they tried to hide it but I figured it out; I’m going to make you see exactly what I figured out</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Learning that in Israel, any structure designed for gathering water requires a government permit and that such permits are rarely granted to Palestinians, he cracks that “Israel had advanced beyond the Jim Crow South and segregated not just the pools and fountains but the water itself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s this learning that powers <em>The Message</em> forward. The whole book is lit up by his outrage at his old inferior understanding of Palestine and his palpable pleasure in forging the new. “My sense of the world was stunted,” he writes, “and never did I feel it expand in the way I felt it expanding in Palestine.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s that sense of triumph again: <em>I figured it out; they tried to hide it but I figured it out; I’m going to make you see exactly what I figured out</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Has he actually figured it out? It’s a fair question. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2024/09/ta-nehisi-coates-message-essays-israel-palestine/680001/\">Critics more nuanced than Dokoupil</a> have already taken issue with Coates’s decision not to discuss the fact that, for instance, Israel is surrounded by states committed to destroying it, or to mention <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/375398/israel-palestine-lebanon-october-7-anniversary-one-year\">the horrific attack carried out by Hamas on October 7</a> last year and all that came after. It would be reasonable to argue that not only has Coates failed to figure it out, but that he neglected to even try to wrap his mind around the bigger picture of what’s happening in Israel and Gaza.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that would be a misreading of his project. What Coates is trying to capture, more than anything, is the experience of being an ordinary Palestinian living in Israel under the vicious disdain of the state. He is interested largely in the physical experience of oppression. He succeeds in capturing that specific reality as completely as anyone could. If what he’s figuring out is how to write convincingly about the horrors of apartheid through a lens of America’s own racial caste system, he’s got it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If what he’s figuring out is how to write a book on Israel and Palestine that will be as paradigm shifting as “The Case for Reparations,” he’s failed.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The problem of a diagnosis with no solution&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coates’s great weakness here is, probably, his old insistence that he doesn’t offer solutions, just describes problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While “Reparations” characteristically and pointedly declined to engage with the question of what reparations should look like, there was an inherent action point. The United States government has repeatedly stolen wealth from its Black citizens, and so it should pay reparations for that theft. Coates even <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/12/1054889820/a-bill-to-study-reparations-for-slavery-had-momentum-in-congress-but-still-no-vo\">pointed to a congressional bill</a> introduced every year since 1989 and never taken up in the full House or Senate that would create a federal commission to study the issue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem of Israel and Palestine is very different, however, from the problem of reparations. Finding a solution to the conflict has been a locus of geopolitics for decades and has yielded few tangible results, especially in the conditions for Palestinians under Israeli occupation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is not Coates’s job to create peace in the region with <em>The Message</em>. Yet this weakness does mean that his book lacks the one-two punch of “Reparations:” problem, solution<em>.</em> Coates is not the first person to say that the situation of the Palestinians is unconscionable. He is simply one of the most famous to do so, and probably the most beautiful writer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beauty here is a driving force for Coates. Part of his philosophy is that only truthful writing is really beautiful, and he says that he wrote <em>The Message</em> in an attempt to live up to that idea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, in “The Case for Reparations,” Coates offers what he saw then as a successful example of governments making financial reparations for their sins: Germany, which paid reparations to the Israeli government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I was seeking a world beyond plunder,” Coates says of writing “The Case for Reparations,” “but my proof of concept was just more plunder.” Once he reaches Palestine, he writes, he feels astonishment “for my own ignorance, for my own incuriosity, for the limits of my sense of Reparations.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Message</em> is Coates’s attempt to make his own reparations to Palestine: using the fame and the goodwill and the platform he acquired from writing “The Case for Reparations” to bring awareness to the suffering he has managed to elide for so long.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The overriding strategic motivation, however, is far greater than that. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is harking back to a day, decades ago, when Israel’s military superiority was so overwhelming that no other power in the region could dare seriously challenge it. What both the year-long Gaza campaign and the ongoing attacks of the past two weeks are primarily about is to reestablish what, in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, had arguably been lost: deterrence. This is all about deterrence, demonstrated through overwhelming, asymmetric reaction to any military provocation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Israel’s post-October 7 mission</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only potential brake on a Gaza response that has been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatars-emir-what-is-happening-region-is-collective-genocide-2024-10-03/\">plausibly described by many as genocide</a> has been the potential threat of international condemnation in the form of sanctions and formal war-criminal status for Israeli leaders, as well as the loss of US military and political support. It is now clear that Israeli officials who might have feared those consequences needn’t have, and won’t need to fear them for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the context of Hezbollah and Iran, the two key members of the so-called “axis of resistance,” some observers, including me, had thought that Israeli deterrence had been permanently lost after October 7, replaced instead by a mutual “balance of terror” such that neither they nor Israel would willingly resort to all-out war. The Israelis have exploded that illusion, quite literally. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past two weeks, employing everything from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza\">rigged pagers</a> to multi-thousand-pound bunker-busters, Israel has called the Hezbollah bluff. What we have learned is that Hezbollah’s long-range missile capabilities have been seriously overhyped, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-30/iron-dome-hezbollah-rockets-missiles-conflict-israel-lebanon/104394246\">countered</a> by Israel’s effective “Iron Dome” antimissile system. As Israel continues to pound leadership bunkers and weapons caches at will from uncontested airspace — at the cost of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-iran-live-updates-beirut-strike-idf-hezbollah-lebanon-rcna173762\">hundreds of civilian lives in Lebanon</a> — the Lebanese Shiite militia has been revealed as a paper tiger. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Monday, Israel again <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/israel/375125/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-iran-invasion-gaza\">launched</a> a “limited” ground invasion to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, but it is unlikely to push far, nor to repeat its mistakes from past invasions of attempting to hold ground. However the endgame plays out, Hezbollah will soon have to accept what has now been amply demonstrated, just as it was during the month-long <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/01/israel-invasion-lebanon-hezbollah-2006-war-lessons-learned/\">disaster</a> of the Israeli invasion of 2006:  It is completely overmatched and will be forced, once again, to retrench and rearm.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>We can stop fearing a wider regional war because it is already being fought, and Israel has largely won it</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For Iran, the lesson of its two <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjrwg9dly1o\">largely impotent missile assaults</a> this year on Israel’s Iron Dome, compared against the success of Israel’s ongoing attacks on its ally in Lebanon, has surely hit home. Tehran may have felt obliged on Tuesday to respond in some way to repeated Israeli humiliations, delivered in Lebanon, Syria, and the heart of Tehran itself, but make no mistake: The clerics who control Iran are anything but suicidal. We cannot know precisely how Israel will respond to the latest assault, but Iran will find a way to climb down before the exchange gets entirely out of hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What this means is that we can stop fearing a wider regional war because it is already being fought, and Israel has largely won it. And with it, the relative deterrence Israel sought has been restored.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The costs of a remade Middle East</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This doesn’t mean that the emerging regional balance, even if favorable to Israel at the moment, is stable. Even after its leadership decapitation, Hezbollah is still a formidable institution; the militant group, not the Lebanese government, remains the preeminent power in the country. The next round of confrontation, when it comes, will likely find the reconstituted Hezbollah stronger than before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the far side of the Persian Gulf, Iran’s newly inaugurated President Masoud Pezeshkian will <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-03/weakened-iran-raises-fears-it-may-make-push-for-nuclear-weapons\">likely be forced</a> by domestic political considerations, if not international diplomatic inertia, to put aside any notion of resurrecting the 2015 nuclear deal. He will focus instead on achieving the genuine deterrence that only nuclear arms can provide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah still insists that it will continue its strikes on Israel until the war in Gaza ends, but nearly a year after October 7, that war has all but ended. Israel has achieved nearly all it can militarily there, at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24055522/israel-hamas-gaza-war-strategy-netanyahu-strategy-morality\">horrific cost to the Palestinian people in Gaza</a>. Even after the guns have mostly fallen silent, Israel may see the odd missile salvo from Lebanon or the occasional terrorist attack. But the fact that Israel’s enemies will need to resort to terrorism will be a sign of their weakness, not their strength.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for Palestine, its future is a question no more. Diplomats from the US, Europe, and the Arab world can save themselves the effort: There will be no negotiations worthy of the name and no solutions in Gaza or the West Bank, other than those unilaterally imposed by Israel and tacitly permitted by the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Netanyahu, whose <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c243zempn6zo\">political rehabilitation is well underway</a>, and others on what used to be referred to as Israel’s extreme right, are hardly losing sleep over good governance in Gaza. The “solution” in the territory has already been arrived at. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel will retain physical control of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-egypt-philadelphi-corridor-cd15c27cecffe70322becd933cf38909\">Philadelphi Corridor</a> on the border with Egypt and the east-west strip bisecting what remains of the enclave, largely preventing reconstruction of the tunnels through which Hamas might otherwise rearm and the free movement of armed fighters within Gaza. With little effort, Israel can continue to control the flow of international aid to Gaza’s destitute population and use disproportionate and overwhelming force against any nascent glimmer of resistance. Should Gaza devolve into chaotic clan warfare, that will hardly arouse concern in Jerusalem, which will care only that the effective threat of militancy is permanently removed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have seen a similar policy of asymmetric military response to armed Palestinian restiveness playing out to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/west-bank-raids.html\">telling effect</a> in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Tulkarm in recent weeks. Israel has responded with a combination of heavy air- and drone attacks, ground incursions, and the willful destruction of businesses and civilian infrastructure. These actions, stepped up but hardly new, are meant to quash popular resistance to a <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena-israelpalestine/246-stemming-israeli-settler-violence\">pervasive post-October 7 wave of Israeli settler-led violence</a> against Palestinians, aided and abetted as a matter of <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/04/west-bank-settler-violence-serves-israel-interests-idf-gaza-war/\">government policy by the Israeli Defense Forces</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this overlays a foundational policy of enforced impoverishment, as Palestinians are <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2024/03/13/no-one-helping-us-palestinians-west-bank-barred-israel-face-unemployment\">barred from jobs</a> they previously held in Israeli-controlled areas and as Israel <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/why-is-israel-sending-palestinian-taxes-to-norway\">routinely withholds tax revenues</a> gathered on behalf of a Palestinian Authority it is systematically undermining. The message to Palestinians from Israel is clear: Resistance is futile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel’s 40-year program of inexorable dispossession of Palestinians through land seizures and settlement, a process long slow and implicit, has become increasingly rapid and explicit since October 7. Even if occupied Palestinian lands aren’t formally annexed, a unitary Israeli state <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23972967/river-to-sea-palestine-israel-hamas\">from the river to the sea</a> is all but inevitable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What will be left is managing the optics of what is clearly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23924319/israel-palestine-apartheid-meaning-history-debate\">apartheid</a>. Though neighboring Jordan is unlikely to facilitate Palestinian expulsion, the desire of individual Palestinians to flee endemic poverty and hopelessness to neighboring countries may become difficult to stop. Nominally voluntary exile, arguably, is the policy of the Israeli far right. And while it won’t be easy, time is on their side.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">A campaign of state terror</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What we are witnessing is state terror, committed on all sides throughout the Levant, limited only by the combatants’ greatly differing capacities. To terrorize, one must necessarily practice wanton disregard for civilian casualties. For Israel, such willful indifference to suffering carries the risk of joining its adversaries as an international pariah. But Israelis are discovering that its pariah status, unlike for its enemies, carries few practical consequences when balanced, as it is, with <a href=\"https://globalaffairs.org/bluemarble/how-us-has-used-its-power-un-support-israel-decades\">unblinking American support</a>.<br><br>The American reaction to Israel&#8217;s stunning but bloody military success is utterly predictable. Exultant Republicans are claiming vindication for their unembarrassed support of Israel’s merciless military strategy. As for the fate of Palestinians, former President Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-i-told-netanyahu-get-your-victory-quickly-because-the-killing-has-to-stop/\">already articulated</a> what we can anticipate to be his baseline policy, albeit one tinged with an amoral regard for PR optics: Do whatever you feel you must, “but get it over with fast.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats, despite their discomfort with the civilian casualties on the ground, will nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/01/democratic-voters-kamala-harris-palestinians\">uphold their traditional policy</a> of steadfast political and military support of Israel. They may feel differently, and they are acutely aware of the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-generation-gap-in-opinions-toward-israel/\">significant generational drift</a> in American attitudes toward Israel and Zionism, particularly on the left. For now, political realities remain unchanged: Israel can still <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-congress-gaza-hamas-israel-6ea5daf3cd1988b0ad6e874bd450f9bf\">command more support</a> in Congress than any American president of either party could ever hope to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris, however she may betray humanitarian sentiment, would follow the example of President Barack Obama before her: She will not sacrifice precious political capital and her entire legislative agenda on the altar of a two-state policy gambit that has zero prospect of success. The toll of Palestinian casualties <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/5/2/24147192/israel-palestine-student-protest-columbia-ucla-radicalism\">brought out mass protests</a> in the US and may continue to do so, but they have yet to meaningfully change US policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Sunni Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/normalisation-of-saudi-arabia-israel-relations-depends-on-two-state-solution\">paused</a> the diplomatic efforts that might otherwise by now have resulted in a historic rapprochement with Israel, but this should be seen as little more than a hiatus in deference to domestic political optics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Human emotions aside, the <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/unlike-past-arab-israeli-conflicts-arab-governments-pursue-diplomacy-while-iran-proxies-fight/7807615.html\">geopolitical interests</a> driving a de facto Saudi alliance with Israel remain in play. Generational change in Gulf country leadership has brought with it relative indifference to the Palestinian cause. Memories of crushed children and wailing mothers will soon fade when the media turns away. Compelling national interests in confronting the shared enemy, Iran, and promoting high-tech Israeli investment will prevail. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even as we look ahead to a time when Israel’s Shiite antagonists are again ready to engage, there may be little left to fight over. Nothing is so persuasive, or so deflating, as immutable facts on the ground. For those in the “axis of resistance,” the deepening hatred of Israel generated by the events of the last year will seethe for at least another generation. Even if the threat they pose to Israel is never existential, it ensures that Israelis will not be able to rest easy. And for Israel, as the reality of apartheid over the Palestinians becomes undeniable, it will gnaw at the national soul. For now, however much we may like to think otherwise, in our time as much as at any time in human history, might — for those ruthless enough to exercise it — still wins in the end.    </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Dock workers with the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) went on strike Tuesday following a breakdown in negotiations between the ILA and the organization of international shipping companies that employ them. Now, they are back to work as negotiations on a new contract continue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Approximately 45,000 workers walked off the job at 12:01 am Tuesday, making it the most significant strike the union <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977\">has engaged in since 1977</a>. ILA laborers stopped work after their six-year contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/\">shutting down 14 ports</a>, including some of the country’s largest. That could have had a monumental impact on the US economy, with a weeks-long strike bringing higher prices and goods shortages ahead of the presidential election and holiday season. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The striking workers shut down some of the country’s biggest ports, like the <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977\">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. Overall, the affected ports handle about 50 percent of the imports and exports to the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pause in the strike is an opportunity for the ILA and USMX to come back to the bargaining table and try to negotiate a new six-year contract. Workers will be covered by their old contract <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/port-strike-ends-tentative-deal-until-jan-15-dockworkers/\">until next January</a>, though the two sides have <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/port-strike-ends-tentative-deal-until-jan-15-dockworkers/\">apparently made progress on a wage hike</a>: The dockworkers have <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/dockworkers-strike-suspended-sources/story?id=114445386\">reportedly secured a 62 percent raise</a> over the course of the new contract. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the </strong>International Longshoremen’s Association? Why are its members <strong>striking?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ILA represents the approximately 45,000 workers who manage the unloading of massive shipping containers from large cargo ships. Eventually, inventory from the ships makes its way to warehouses, store shelves, and factories. The members work at ports up and down the East Coast as far north as Maine, as well as Gulf Coast ports in Louisiana and Texas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There&#8217;s a strike over two main issues,” Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. “One is money. Two is technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The union has demanded a significant pay raise for dock workers over the six-year life of the contract, as well as increased contributions to their retirement plan and a say in the role of automation in their industry. Some reports indicate the union asked for as much <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000\">as a 77 percent pay increase</a>; the most recent proposal from USMX offered a 50 percent increase over the life of the contract.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The biggest concern is, the dock workers do not want automated machines to be responsible for picking up, dropping off, and releasing the cargo automatically,” Wheaton said. “They would like to have a human operator there” to ensure the quality and safety of their operations — and job security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Negotiations between USMX and ILA for a new contract stopped in June, reportedly over the use of <a href=\"https://mynbc15.com/news/local/hundreds-of-mobile-dockworkers-set-to-go-on-strike\">automation at a port in Mobile, Alabama</a>. USMX filed a complaint with the National Labor Review Board last week claiming that ILA refused to continue with contract negotiations. USMX did not respond to Vox’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shipping companies that compose USMX —&nbsp;all of which are based abroad —&nbsp;have made billions as global trade and shipping has boomed, the union argues, while worker wages have stagnated in the face of inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dock workers on the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/economy/port-strike-economy.html\">West Coast make about $55 per hour compared</a> with the East and Gulf Coast <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/business/us-port-workers-strike-tuesday/index.html\">average of $39 per hour</a> for experienced workers. West Coast dockworkers received an impressive <a href=\"https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract\">wage increase</a> in their most recent contract<a href=\"https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract\">;</a> they belong to a different union, the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which has long been much more radical than the ILA in terms of its politics, demands, and tactics, according to Gabe Winant, a labor historian at the University of Chicago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the ILWU workers’ big wage wins proved that it was possible to demand more — and get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the ILA hopes to achieve a similar victory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which goods will be impacted?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More than 50 percent of all goods <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/\">imported into the US using container ships</a> come in through the East and Gulf Coast ports, and nearly 70 percent of containerized exports leave through them. However, since the potential for a strike had been well-known for months, companies had plenty of time to prepare. The most immediate casualty of the strikes would have been perishables. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have all these perishable goods coming imported [to] the East Coast,” like blueberries, bananas, and fish from South America, Chris Tang, a professor of supply chain management at UCLA, told Vox. “We also have apparel, toys, electronics, we import through the East Coast.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The automotive industry also depends on East Coast ports, as many cars and car parts are imported from Europe. “There’s still some inventories available in the car manufacturing, and as well as the car dealers, so in the short term, it is not a major impact,” Tang said. Under a prolonged strike, that inventory will run out, and car repairs could become more challenging as parts shipments are delayed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the strike, there are other factors affecting global shipping at the moment, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/24113479/what-the-red-sea-ship-attacks-are-really-about\">Houthi attacks in the Red Sea</a> that have disrupted shipping since November of last year, as has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene\">extreme weather</a>. The Panama Canal has also been impacted independent of the strikes; the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html\">waterway is suffering from a drought</a>, which has created a shipping backlog there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As anyone who tried to buy toilet paper during the pandemic can tell you, we have a delicate supply chain, and when you start messing with the cargo ships, the rail, and the semi trucks, you&#8217;re toast,” Wheaton said. “You just aren&#8217;t going to get anything moved. Add to that that you just had a huge chunk of the East Coast get buried in water from the hurricane that just went through.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How might the dockworker’s strike end?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The progress on negotiations is a positive sign. The two sides agreed on January 15, 2025, deadline for finalizing a new contract, which gives them a cushion to negotiate on outstanding issues, namely the role of automation at the ports and an increase in pension contributions.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the enormity of the potential fallout from the strike, there was some question of whether President Joe Biden would order dockworkers back to the ports for 80 days as USMX and the ILA continue contract negotiations through powers granted by the Taft-Hartley Act —&nbsp;something Biden said <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839\">he did not want to do</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration faced “pressure from the consumers, from the retailers, from the manufacturers, and also the shipping companies” to take action and reopen the ports, Tang said. Some business groups had <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839\">already called on Biden</a> to send ILA members back to work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Biden has also been largely supportive of union action, save the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/29/23484623/congress-rail-strike-biden-sick-days\">2022 railway workers strike</a>, and union support has been important to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/372935/teamsters-union-harris-biden-uaw-labor-trump-endorsement-vote\">Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The official policy of the government for more than 100 years, that the best solution is a negotiated solution,” Wheaton said. “The union won&#8217;t get everything they want, management won&#8217;t get everything they want, but you sit at the bargaining table to see what both sides can live with.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 4, 10:40 am ET:</strong> This story was originally published on October 1 and has been updated to reflect the dock workers’ return to work as a contract is negotiated. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Although most infections are among health care workers from two hospitals in Kigali, the capital of the East African country, seven of Rwanda’s 30 districts have seen cases. It is the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537\">first</a> time the virus has been known to cause infections in Rwanda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.\">indicated</a> the outbreak is highly likely to spread to neighboring countries, but the risk of further global spread is low. Typically, humans become infected when they come into contact with a Marburg-carrying Egyptian <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">fruit bat</a>, a species found across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of western Asia. Once a person has the virus, though, it can then spread to others through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces and materials, like clothing or bedding. This mode of transmission means that Marburg virus will not spread as easily as, say, Covid-19 or other respiratory diseases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was first featured in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sign up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Already, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537\">one person</a> who came into contact with an infected patient in Rwanda has traveled to Belgium, underscoring the possibility of isolated overseas cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, Marburg virus disease is fatal in about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.\">50 percent</a> of patients, but in some previous outbreaks, the mortality rate has exceeded 80 percent. People <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">experience</a> high fever, severe headache, extreme fatigue, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/about/index.html\">rash</a>, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/marburg-rwanda#:~:text=Marburg%20is%20a%20viral%20hemorrhagic,Marburg%20virus%20is%20often%20fatal.\">unexplained bruising</a> and bleeding from the nose and gums.

Between 1967 and 2008, the US, Germany, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands have reported Marburg disease among travelers returning from Uganda.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To date, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for Marburg virus disease, but there are at least <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true\">four</a> vaccines in development. All four have been <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true\">effective</a> in studies involving animals. A small, early-stage clinical <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract\">trial</a> in humans had promising results; however, study participants who received the Marburg vaccine were not exposed to the virus to test how protective the shot was. Two other <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">vaccines</a> for Ebola virus could also be effective against Marburg virus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Researchers in Rwanda are preparing to submit protocols for phase 3 trials to a Rwandan ethics committee for approval. This would be an opportunity to expedite the development of Marburg virus vaccines and treatments and perform larger trials in a real-world outbreak.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the trial moves forward quickly, the current crisis could allow scientists to identify a shot that protects millions of people in the years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The slim vaccine silver lining</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The WHO, Rwandan public health officials, and <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010805\">a group of scientists and institutes</a> working on vaccine research <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03218-3\">met</a> earlier this week to discuss quickly setting up a vaccine trial that could help quell the ongoing outbreak.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of the vaccine candidates being developed, the most promising one that seems most likely to be tested if a trial moved ahead in Rwanda is the cAd3-Marburg vaccine developed by the National <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/\">Institute</a> of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Last year, the NIAID tested the vaccine for safety in humans for the first time in a phase 1 clinical <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract\">trial</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Forty healthy adults received one of two different doses of the vaccine and were monitored for adverse reactions and to see if their immune systems produced antibodies, an indication that the vaccine would be effective if the individuals were exposed to the virus. The vaccine was deemed safe, and 95 percent of the participants had developed antibodies four weeks after receiving it. However, the participants were never exposed to the virus, so the vaccine’s practical effectiveness was not evaluated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.sabin.org/\">Sabin Vaccine Institute</a> started a <a href=\"https://www.sabin.org/resources/sabin-vaccine-institute-begins-phase-2-clinical-trial-for-marburg-vaccine-in-uganda/\">phase 2</a> clinical <a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05817422?cond=Marburg%20Virus%20Disease&amp;term=Sabin&amp;rank=1\">trial</a> for the NIAID vaccine in Uganda and Kenya. Healthy adults will randomly be assigned to receive the vaccine or a placebo shot and then will again be monitored for adverse responses and antibody responses. Participants will also not be exposed to the Marburg virus during this trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, if phase 2 trials are successful, scientists proceed to larger phase 3 trials and roll out the vaccine to a large group of people and then observe its impact when individuals are exposed to the virus. The emergency situation in Rwanda may accelerate this process. Scientists may move ahead with a phase 3 trial even though phase 2 results are not yet available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Researchers and health officials have been preparing for this. Earlier this year, scientists from the WHO and 17 countries at risk for Marburg virus outbreaks developed <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/02/20/default-calendar/building-research-readiness-for-a-future-filovirus-outbreak-workshop-february-20-22-2024-uganda\">protocols</a> to test both <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/consultation-rdb/vx-discussion_martha-nason_who-filovirus-workshop-key-analyses-and-endpoints.pdf?sfvrsn=fccf158_3\">vaccines</a> and treatments during an outbreak. A phase 3 clinical trial in Rwanda would follow a ring vaccination strategy where contacts of infected people are vaccinated. The trial would have two groups, one group of contacts who are immediately vaccinated and then a second “delayed” group who are presumably vaccinated at a later time. Researchers would then compare the impact of the vaccine between the two groups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scientists may also test a treatment that uses antibodies, proteins made by the immune system to kill viruses and other pathogens, against the virus. One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5719873/\">study</a> found that treating animals such as guinea pigs and monkeys with these antibodies after they were infected with Marburg virus prevented serious illness and death. Medical workers successfully treated patients with antibody <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00552-2/fulltext\">cocktails</a> during previous Ebola virus outbreaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The WHO’s ethics committee has already approved protocols to test vaccines and the antibody treatment, a spokesperson told Vox. The next step is for these protocols to be approved by an ethics committee within Rwanda. Two Rwandan researchers have been selected to lead these efforts in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One other hurdle remains. There are fewer than <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true\">2,000</a> total vaccine doses currently available. In April 2023, the Sabin Vaccine Institute had produced about 850 of those doses. Oxford University, which is developing another Marburg vaccine, had about 1,000 doses. Larger-scale production could be needed, especially if the outbreak becomes more widespread. Both the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Oxford University have existing manufacturing capacity for the Marburg vaccines and previously reported to the WHO that they could rapidly produce additional doses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Marburg outbreak has ignited amid a surging mpox outbreak in the region, which the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern\">declared</a> an international health emergency in August. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, which neighbors Rwanda, is the <a href=\"https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/\">epicenter</a> of the mpox outbreak. (The DRC has not yet recorded any Marburg cases.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fortunately, Rwanda has one of the <a href=\"https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/rwandas-health-care-success-holds-lessons-others\">strongest</a> public health systems in Africa and has only reported a handful of mpox cases. An estimated <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10926934/\">90 percent</a> of the population have health insurance, much higher than most of its neighbors. Rwanda also has a strong infectious disease surveillance <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/lessons-rwanda-building-systems-protect-against-infectious-diseases-and-biothreats\">system</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424001800\">history</a> of successfully containing outbreaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes it an ideal setting for testing a Marburg vaccine during the current outbreak —&nbsp;if public health authorities can move quickly. The race is on.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Too many type As, too many people too into their jobs, too many people ready to leave after two years — it’s not exactly a city that screams romance. They say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/08/modern-politics-show-business-for-ugly-people\">politics is show business for ugly people</a>, which would make DC the Hollywood of uggos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given Washington’s notoriety, it was only a matter of time before Netflix took <em>Love Is Blind</em> to the nation’s capital.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In its first season, the Netflix reality dating series asserted the hopefulness of romance — the possibility of falling in love with someone sight unseen and marrying them within a month — but it has become a show about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22958499/love-is-blind-season-2-recap-review\">irreparable incompatibility</a> featuring terrifying tales of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/22/23885294/love-is-blind-season-5-review-uche-villain\">red flag-waving monsters</a>. There have also been <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/04/renee-poche-love-is-blind-netflix-lawsuit/72101776007/\">lawsuits from contestants</a> alleging toxic and inhospitable <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/is-love-is-blind-a-toxic-workplace\">workplace environments</a> in and out of the “<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-is-blind-pods\">pods</a>.” Yet the love experiment is one of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/04/16/love-is-blind-most-popular-streaming-show-netflix-the-gentlemen-avatar-brooklyn-99-bluey/\">Netflix’s biggest hits</a>, and each season a captive audience tunes in to see a new batch of daters and the horrors — body shaming, weaponized therapy speak, flies in toilets — that await them on the other side of the wall.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Love_Is_Blind_n_S7_E1_00_23_01_22RC.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4383212962771,100,93.123357407446\" alt=\"A group of women in colorful dresses gather in a beige living area and raise glasses of wine to each other in a large circle.\" title=\"A group of women in colorful dresses gather in a beige living area and raise glasses of wine to each other in a large circle.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Let’s go girls! Time to talk to faceless men! | Courtesy of Netflix\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of Netflix\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now we have what sounds like a perfect, hellish match: one of the worst dating cities in the US, combined with one of the bleakest reality TV dating shows in history. On paper, it feels more like a dare or taunt, a gift to haters. Truly only the freakiest freaks, some real District of Columbia sickos would sign up to be on <em>Love Is Blind: DC</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while this immensely watchable season has plenty of villains and inter-crossing love triangles, it, sadly, doesn’t feel very DC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one thing, no one on this season explicitly works in government. To be fair, the show isn’t very specific when it comes to its participants’ professions, so an “IT specialist” could ostensibly be working for some military government contractor and an “engineer” could be doing research for, say, Lockheed-Martin. Still, the closest we get is a cast member being described as a “policy advocate,” which seems like a nice euphemism for lobbyist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Capitol Hill keeping their employees from representing on <em>Love Is Blind</em> is understandable because of how embarrassingly and negatively many of the participants are portrayed. But that dynamic of an adjacency to national political power fueling a person’s dating identity is exactly what makes DC dating unique and (from all these news stories about people who hate dating there) so hostile. That the show spent a season in DC and couldn’t capture the snobbiness of a staffer asking “Who do you work for?” feels like a loss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There seems to be a reluctance to get into politics this season, too. A contestant talks about how he voted in the 2016 and 2020 elections, and there’s a conversation about what kind of political beliefs one has while serving in the military, but politics as they relate to dating preferences  — e.g., whether love trumps politics, whether similar politics mean compatibility, etc. — is barely addressed. That’s a missed opportunity, not only given how politically active DC allegedly is, but also because finding partners who share the same politics has increasingly become <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/3917348-politics-are-increasingly-a-dating-dealbreaker-especially-for-women/\">more and more important</a> to singles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, there’s still enough relationship dysfunction this season to sustain its horror-junkie audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Brittany, a beautiful woman who wants to be a trophy wife and tells the camera she cannot spell the word “physicist,” falls for Leo, a young art dealer who tells everyone that one of his insecurities is that he inherited a humongous amount of money and never has to worry about anything financially. The more the audience gets to know Leo, the more it seems like this isn’t an insecurity at all. The more Brittany gets to know Leo, the more interested she is in his “insecurity.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Love_Is_Blind_n_S7_E1_00_22_59_12RC.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4383212962771,100,93.123357407446\" alt=\"A group of men sit and stand around a long table, all dressed in suits or business casual, raising wine glasses to each other.\" title=\"A group of men sit and stand around a long table, all dressed in suits or business casual, raising wine glasses to each other.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The dudes from Love Is Blind | Courtesy of Netflix\" data-portal-copyright=\"Courtesy of Netflix\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also Hannah, a 26-year-old woman who quit her “dream job” to be on the show. The dream job in question? Medical device sales. Perhaps there is honor and allure in, say, the vending of CPAP machine accessories, but she’s given it all up for the possibility of sight-unseen reality TV love. To that end, she tells Nick, one of her pod suitors, that she dates athletes and she’s always worried that men only see her as a hot girl. Nick tells her he looks like a less buff Henry Cavill. Neither is setting themselves up to overdeliver.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hannah, Nick, Leo, Brittany and their cohort deliver a season draped in red flags and dealbreakers. From chilling fights about yapping too much to roundabout conversations about getting the ick from watching your partner straddle patio furniture, there’s plenty here. If you’re coupled, they’ll make you breathe a sigh of relief that you’re not in the dating pool. If you’re single, they’ll make you relish it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Love Is Blind </em>is still a riveting, deranged exploration of the worst people falling in and out of love, even if it doesn’t feel like DC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story originally appeared in&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Today, Explained</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

After abandoning President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24125496/young-voters-trump-biden-polling\">in favor of third-party candidates, former President Donald Trump, or simply not voting</a>, they have rallied to support Vice President Kamala Harris since her entrance to the race this summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s true across much of the electorate, though to differing degrees. After all, Harris took over from a candidate in political free fall. But young voters have responded with particular enthusiasm: They <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/27/kamala-harris-identity-zoom-00171489\">organized</a> Zoom calls for her nascent campaign. Their activist groups <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/07/31/kamala-harris-young-voters-gen-z-mobilizing/74566303007/\">rushed to endorse</a> the VP. They signed up to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/gen-z-feels-the-kamalove-youth-led-groups-see-surge-of-energy-around-harris-campaign\">volunteer</a> for her campaign and registered to vote for the first time. “A breath of fresh air” was the phrase of the day, and some Gen Z activists wondered if this was what it felt like to be young during Barack Obama’s first presidential run in 2008. And, of course, you <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/363560/gen-z-brat-coconut-kamala-harris-vote-young-voter\">can’t forget the memes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The conventional wisdom from pundits and pollsters was that, like any honeymoon, the good vibes could be temporary. It seemed only natural that as young voters who didn’t really know Harris learned more about her, some share of them would be turned off by elements of her political track record or personal history. And surely the usual fusillade of Trump attacks would sour some part of the electorate, including young voters, against her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet, about two months later, Harris has managed to sustain that youth enthusiasm and recover much of the support Biden received in 2020. Part of that success, polls suggest, is because her campaign is tackling some deep-seated frustrations young voters have had with American politics in the Trump era: a disconnected feeling, an absence of representation, and a sense that they just aren’t being heard by the political establishment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That appeal may be key to what’s going on with Harris and young voters. While she’s made gains with a number of groups since entering the race — independents, suburban voters, even white non-college-educated voters, to name a few — only Black voters have swung as hard in her favor as young voters have. <a href=\"https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1838038449703567570/photo/1\">An analysis of crosstab data</a> from polls conducted before Biden’s dropout and after Harris’s debate performance by the former Democratic pollster Adam Carlson found a Harris gain of nearly 12 points with voters 18–29, compared to a shift of 4.2 points for the electorate at large.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/fallbackimg.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Young voters desire to be seen and heard, particularly in this presidential race that just felt really disconnected from them,” Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, cofounder of Way to Win, a political strategy group that focuses on mobilizing minority voters, told me. “The opportunity now is to present this campaign as a response to young voters’ desire for younger candidates at the top of the ticket, affirming their collective power and their ability to affect change.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That ability may rest in part on turnout; while millennial and Gen Z voters combined <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/gen-z-millennials-vote-republican/674328/\">are on track</a> to make up a larger chunk of the electorate this year than they ever have, they regularly participate at <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/voter-turnout-rate-by-age-usa\">lower levels than older generations</a>. Even in 2020, a year of record young voter turnout, only <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016\">about</a> <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html\">half</a> of those younger demographic cohorts voted. And yet, turning out and winning less reliable young voters by large margins is a necessary part of any Democratic presidential victory, even if it’s not enough to swing the whole race.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Young voter enthusiasm has shot up — and stayed there</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most polls since the Democratic National Convention in August and the first Harris-Trump presidential debate last month present similar accounts of the “youth vote”: After nearly a year of bad polling for Biden, Harris has managed to open and hold a margin of support nearly equal to what Biden got four years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, for context, Biden won voters under the age of 30 by about 24 points, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GIovkPfwUJvFZeFPdOi0fK8Rr7aOVFCYBzrlMG4Vjro/edit?gid=0#gid=0\">post-election surveys</a>. That result itself was a decline from the support Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama received in past cycles, but Biden had <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23042037/joe-biden-young-voters-disapprove-progressive-gen-z\">long had trouble</a> energizing young people.<strong> </strong>Harris now has an average polling lead of about 22 points with young voters when you look at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16D9GSxqF5LFIRTcoVJlvWWefU_h-ZMzlomghgbvYRaM/edit?pli=1&amp;gid=1863533280#gid=1863533280\">aggregated crosstab results</a> from polls in September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even a return to the 2020 status quo, though, represents a dramatic shift. Before dropping out, Biden was routinely just <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/02/26/biden-trump-gen-z-millennial-poll\">barely leading</a> Trump with young voters, if not falling <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/19/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html\">slightly behind</a>. Pundits and the public were regularly asking if the polls were just broken or if Biden could really be <em>that</em> unpopular with young people. Harris’s candidacy may have provided an answer: By late July, mere days into her campaign, she had begun to restore the Democratic edge. She was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/25/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html\">leading</a><a href=\"https://www.generationlab.org/trump-vs-harris-vs-biden\"> Trump</a> by about 20 points in some of the same polls that had spelled doom for Biden. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polling isn’t the only sign of this sudden reversal. Voter registration rates for young people provide another data point. According to tracking from the Democratic strategist Tom Bonier, rates of new registration for the young, particularly young Black and Hispanic women, have <a href=\"https://x.com/tbonier/status/1828457890228629534/photo/1\">surged</a> both in the immediate aftermath of Biden’s dropout and Harris’s ascension, and in the <a href=\"https://x.com/tbonier/status/1838393369057169834\">six</a><a href=\"https://x.com/tbonier/status/1836002142122885200\"> weeks</a> since. These statistics <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/363560/gen-z-brat-coconut-kamala-harris-vote-young-voter\">mirror</a><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/21/young-voter-registration-breaking-records-swift/75306021007/\"> what</a> independent voter registration trackers, like Vote.org, <a href=\"https://x.com/Jemsinger/status/1816065585844764715\">say</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polls gauging the enthusiasm of young voters and their interest in the presidential election have also shifted in the last few months. The <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/48th-edition-fall-2024\">Harvard Youth Poll</a>, one of the best surveys of young voters out there, found significant movement in young Democrats’ enthusiasm for the election from March to September 2024. In the spring, similar shares of young Democrats (66 percent) and young Republicans (64 percent) told pollsters that they would “definitely” vote in the November election. Last month, young Democrats were much more likely to say they will vote: 74 percent compared to just 60 percent of young Republicans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Harvard pollsters argue that much of this boost is due specifically to Harris. Back in March, just <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024\">44 percent</a> of self-identified Biden voters in the Harvard poll said they were enthusiastic about supporting him. In September, <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/48th-edition-fall-2024\">81 percent of Harris voters said so</a>. And views of Harris specifically have gotten much more positive: Her overall favorability ratings have risen since the spring, and she also holds an advantage over Trump in the kinds of personal attributes they ascribe to her and in who they trust more on most policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The University of Chicago Institute of Politics Youth Poll found similar shifts from its<a href=\"http://api.genforwardsurvey.com/download/431/?f=true&amp;_gl=1*13jlxhq*_ga*MTk2NjgzMzY1LjE3MjczMTIyNTE.*_ga_CSCXTK5ECE*MTcyNzMxMjI1MC4xLjEuMTcyNzMxMjI2OC4wLjAuMA..\"> May</a> 2024 survey to its most recent poll from <a href=\"https://politics.uchicago.edu/uploads/homepage/2024-08-August-Toplines-Public-Young-Adult-Sample.pdf\">late July and August</a>, which was taken shortly after Biden exited the race. Both young Republicans and young Democrats are now paying more attention to election news, but the share of young Democrats who say they will “definitely” vote this year has risen, while the share of Republicans has stayed flat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taken together, these surveys and statistics suggest not only that the rush of early youth enthusiasm for Harris is sticking but that there are clear opportunities for Harris’s campaign to continue to increase these margins of support.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris is a symbol for some of the longer-term, deeper changes young voters want from politics</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s apparent success with young voters wasn’t a given, but reckoning with just how rotten the vibes had gotten for young voters while Biden was the nominee is key to understanding how it came about. That context also explains why so many young people are projecting a new kind of hope onto Harris — and what she can still come to represent in the little over a month left of the campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to national-level polling, researchers and strategists are using focus groups and surveys to zoom in on young voter sentiments and better understand the “why” and “how” of their evolving support for the Democratic ticket. Fernandez Ancona’s Way to Win, for example, identified and surveyed a group of battleground state young voters to examine how young people were feeling about the country, the electoral process, and the candidates before them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://waytowin.docsend.com/view/kzsc2x277i73gjkz\">survey</a> was conducted this summer before Biden dropped out of the race. “One of the challenges that we saw early on with Biden’s candidacy,” Fernandez Ancona said, “was [that young people] felt like Biden had abandoned them. They felt like Biden couldn’t fight for them because … he was too old and he could no longer understand them or feel empathy for them. So that disconnect was a huge problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The results were grim for Democrats and confirmed what other <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/05/28/2024/a-dying-empire-led-by-bad-people-poll-finds-young-voters-despairing-over-us-politics\">qualitative research</a> of young voters has found: that young people feel like the American dream is a “fading mirage” that is increasingly “out of reach.” They were still hopeful, dreaming about what could be, but felt especially left out of political discussions, uninspired by Biden or Trump, and pressured by the cost of living, debt, and threats to abortion rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I am struggling in every aspect when it comes to the cost of living, the cost of food, everything is barely making it so that I can [stay] just above water … (barely making it),”<strong> </strong>one 28-year-old Biden-supporting female participant told the researchers. Pluralities of respondents felt the same way. And more than half of them said 2024 was trending in a worse direction than any of the past few years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You’d see over and over again, just how young people do feel powerless and out of control, regarding their finances, their own ability to provide themselves, health care, and just the state of the world. That is something that [persists] and is still a thing we have speak to,” Fernandez Ancona said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The results offered a clear picture of what Democrats needed to change if they wanted to win in November: Replace Biden, promote younger leadership, and offer a clearer, more positive, and more forward-looking platform that moved beyond Biden or Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s just what has happened in the following months. “What we see in the data is that Harris is almost kind of the ideal candidate for them, because [she presents] the three things that [young people] said they wanted most: authenticity, actionable policies, and a change from the status quo,” Fernandez Ancona said. “Harris becomes that avatar for everything you are asking for. So she can possibly help solidify them as a voting block by speaking to their agency in [pushing for this change].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aside from representing the kind of shock to the political system that many young people were hoping for, Harris is also benefitting from a high level of trust from young people, both on the issues they said matter most and on being the “change” candidate. The University of Chicago poll, for example, found that while young people continue to disapprove of Biden, they <a href=\"https://politics.uchicago.edu/get-involved/youth-poll#keyTakeaways\">don’t necessarily apply</a> that same disapproval to Harris. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What all these surveys and studies also confirmed was the way these narratives of trust, change, and hope were boosted by viral memes and social media engagement. It was through social media, and <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/what-are-we-getting-wrong-about-young-voters\">TikTok in particular</a>, that many young voters were reintroduced to Harris as a candidate and prompted to <a href=\"https://www.scholarsandstorytellers.com/young-voters-in-a-digital-world\">tune back</a> into election news and look into her policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, these analyses also point to a central vulnerability for Harris, one that existed even before the summer shakeup. Young voters, and voters writ large, are still concerned <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/young-voters-election-issues/index.html\">about affordability and their economic prospects</a>, and that’s the big issue holding back stronger support from young men, and young men of color, in particular. It’s the biggest issue where Trump continues to hold an advantage over Harris in the Harvard Youth Poll,<strong> </strong>it’s the <a href=\"https://politics.uchicago.edu/get-involved/youth-poll#keyTakeaways\">most important issue</a> in the University of Chicago poll, and it’s the<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2024-09-21/harris-hasnt-sealed-the-deal-focus-groups-with-young-voters-show-why-politics\"> major sticking point</a> for undecided and marginal young voters in the focus groups that Harvard’s John Della Volpe, the director the youth poll, has been running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also swamps the share of young voters who are concerned about the other big vulnerability Biden faced — his handling of the war in Gaza. Anywhere from 1 to 4 percent of respondents in either poll prioritized the Gaza war, though 11 percent of respondents in the <a href=\"https://politics.uchicago.edu/uploads/homepage/2024-08-August-Toplines-Public-Young-Adult-Sample.pdf\">UChicago poll</a> said they were Harris voters who felt less likely to support her because of the administration’s handling of the war.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris, scholars and researchers say, should focus on her economic vision as young voters continue to prioritize issues and “change” in their vote choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Having an economic plan and a real plan for the future — yes, she talks about the opportunity economy that she envisions, but really spelling out for people how that’s going to work and play out, and how she may get that through Congress, is going to be critical, especially for that kind of cohort, these different demographic splits of Gen Z,” Alisha Hines, the director of research at the UCLA Center for Scholars and Storytellers, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris and her team may be getting the message. She <a href=\"https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf\">rolled out</a> an extensive economic policy vision in late September, followed in quick succession by a major <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/25/harris-economy-pittsburgh-speech-00181079\">speech</a> and an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4900063-kamala-harris-stephanie-ruhle-interview-takeaways/\">interview</a> with MSNBC to flesh out her plans — all of which mark a new phase of her campaign, drilling down on the policy specifics she has slowly rolled out since becoming the nominee. Polling and surveys tell us that young people want more of that. Harris has about a month left to do it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But it can also have cascading effects, from increasing wildfire risk to disrupting harvests. And, because of the effects of climate change, temperatures like those seen across the western US this week could become far more common.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Human-caused climate change … is loading the weather dice toward more frequent and intense heat waves,” University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It’s part of a larger trend</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This October heat is largely the result of a phenomenon currently happening <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/02/record-heat-wave-west-palmsprings-phoenix/\">in the West known as a “heat dome”</a> — which involves a high-pressure system trapping heat closer to the Earth’s surface.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Long-term climate change, however, is likely exacerbating the heat dome’s effects. Greenhouse gasses that fuel climate change also trap heat, leading to higher temperatures that can make an already hot heat dome even hotter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to a <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/risky-summer-heat\">study from the climate nonprofit Climate Central</a>, 91 million people in the US experienced 30 or more “risky heat days” this summer, and those were made twice as likely because of climate change. The organization describes “risky heat” days as ones warmer than “90 percent of temperatures observed in a local area over the 1991-2020 period.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Climate change has also led to higher temperatures around the world throughout this past year, including a particularly hot summer in states across the US. According to the <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news/us-sweltered-through-its-4th-hottest-summer-on-record\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),</a> this was the country’s fourth-hottest summer on record, when looking at temperatures from June through August 2024. During those months, the average temperature in the contiguous United States was 73.8 degrees Fahrenheit — 2.5 degrees above the average from 1991-2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was noticeable in multiple places, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/03/phoenix-100-degree-temperatures-record/\">including Phoenix</a>, which experienced more than 100 consecutive days of 100-degree heat or higher this year. Globally, the world could also be on track to <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20240906/2024-shaping-up-as-the-hottest-year-on-record\">hit its hottest year on record.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to getting warmer, summers are getting longer, with Drexel University researchers noting that seasonal temperatures <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/uhc/about/News/2024/July/data%20summers%20getting%20longer%20and%20hotter/#:~:text=UHC%20researchers%20also%20noted%20an,are%20getting%20hotter%20and%20longer.\">are lasting 30 days longer</a> than they have in the past, meaning well into October for some in the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means fall doesn’t bring the same relief from heat it once did. As a September <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/2024-fall-package\">Climate Central</a> report, which looked at 242 US cities, found, fall temperatures went up 2.5 degrees, on average, between 1970 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The warmer fall days could have major implications for natural disasters, especially for wildfires in places like Southern California, where heat amplifies the risk of potential blazes on drier landscapes that have also seen decades of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46702-0\">fire suppression</a>. While wildfire season has typically run from early summer into the fall, <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/longer-more-intense-fire-weather-seasons\">it has the potential to go longer</a> as higher temperatures persist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/7/21/23799004/invisible-consequences-extreme-heat-physical-mental-health\">More days with higher temperatures</a> can also translate to increased cases of heat stroke, cardiovascular problems caused by stress on the heart, and respiratory challenges. They can extend, too, the window <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22383707/allergies-2021-pollen-allergy-covid-19-climate-change-asthma\">when people experience seasonal allergies.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, warmer falls could affect plant and animal preparations for hibernation, severely shortening the time they usually take to prepare for winter, and delaying <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/fall-foliage-and-climate-change\">processes like changes in foliage and leaf dropping</a>. Farmers may increasingly need to shift <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/warmer-weather-fall-farming-illinois/\">planting and harvesting schedules for different crops</a> as temperatures continue to fluctuate as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Short of major changes needed to curb human contributions to global warming, this year’s October heat waves aren’t likely to be a fluke.

But amid the overwhelming destruction and chaos, and a death toll already <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-helene-survivors-north-carolina-rescue/\">exceeding 160</a> people across six states, one group risks being overlooked in the scramble: the homeless population, those already vulnerable before the storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disaster relief for people who were homeless prior to a hurricane has always been lacking, as FEMA, the main federal agency tasked with providing aid, has a policy that <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_iappg-1.1.pdf\">explicitly excludes</a> those unhoused people from most forms of help, including housing and direct assistance. In recent years, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has stepped up to try to plug some of those gaps in social safety, but a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr1605/BILLS-118hr1605ih.pdf\">new bill moving</a> through Congress <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/HR_1605_Sign_on_Letter_Final.pdf\">threatens these efforts</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These dynamics have grown more pressing as major hurricanes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/natural-disaster/374366/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-beryl-storms-climate\">increase in frequency</a> and the number of unsheltered Americans <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html\">continues to grow</a>. In June the US Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing\">issued a landmark decision</a> in <em>Grants Pass </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, greenlighting local governments’ legal authority to clear out <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/3/8/23618237/homelessness-tent-encampments-housing-affordable\">homeless tent encampments</a> even if a city lacks any available housing or shelter for the unhoused person to stay in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since then, more jurisdictions have passed laws criminalizing homelessness, part of a broader effort to crack down on those sleeping outside. Just this week <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/20/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-address-homelessness-and-protect-the-public-and-quality-of-life-for-floridians/\">a new law</a> in Florida —&nbsp;that bans sleeping on public property anywhere in the state — took effect. While the law <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/1365/?Tab=BillText\">includes exceptions</a> during emergencies like major storms, those protections end when the hurricane order is no longer in place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practical terms, this means that when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis or a county official lifts Florida’s emergency hurricane order, Floridians who were homeless before Helene — <a href=\"https://fchonline.org/the-issue/\">roughly 31,000</a> people —&nbsp;could face new criminal penalties. Local homeless advocates say there are countless questions and rumors circulating about how the new law will be interpreted and enforced in the wake of disasters just like Helene, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water\">made landfall last week</a> in Florida’s Big Bend region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most people experiencing homelessness were aware the new anti-camping law was set to take effect, according to Martha Are, the executive director at the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. “Some people are already trying to relocate their encampments to harder-to-find areas,” she told me in mid-September, about a week before Helene hit Florida.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>Leaders like Are have little idea yet what to expect, and she hears unofficially that most jurisdictions are in wait-and-see mode, watching to see which city gets sued first and what the judge who reviews that lawsuit decides. (Under the new Florida law, any citizen or business can sue beginning in January if they feel the anti-camping ban is not being properly enforced.) <br><br>“It’s going to be a challenge for how leaders actually enforce these [anti-camping] laws, like if I’ve lost my house from a hurricane and I’ve lived in that town for a decade, will I be found in violation of the law and are they going to arrest me?” asked Noah Patton, the manager of disaster recovery at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “These laws create significant complications, will really make aid more difficult to sort out, and what I have been saying is it makes a community less resilient to disasters.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moving homeless people to safety when a hurricane hits is difficult — and the anti-camping laws make that harder</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s always a stressful scramble to try and reach homeless people when a hurricane is coming. “A lot of people have phones but they don’t have data, they aren’t getting texts,” said Kelly Young, the CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston and Harris County.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, homeless outreach workers will try and go out to spread the word, and existing homeless shelters will work to make extra room, sometimes allowing people to sleep in places like the kitchen and hallways. Unhoused individuals can usually seek refuge in convention centers and public schools, or at newly-erected Red Cross emergency shelters. Some governments and nonprofits arrange transport for unhoused people to get indoors, while others leave it on the individual to figure out their own travel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We had up to 13,000 people at George R. Brown Convention Center <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning\">after [Hurricane] Harvey</a> and there was no distinguishing between the homeless versus people who had just lost their homes and needed a place to be,” said Larry Satterwhite, who leads the Houston Mayor’s Office of Public Safety and Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not everyone experiencing homelessness gets the information they need, and not everyone living outside <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Understanding-Encampments.pdf\">feels comfortable going to a shelter</a>, said Eric Camarillo, the executive director of SALT Outreach, which works with unsheltered homeless people in Orlando and central Florida. Some people fear losing their personal belongings, while others may have had traumatic prior experiences at shelters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The face of homelessness is not the same as it was 50 years ago,” Camarillo added. “These are single moms who can’t afford day care, these are seniors in their 70s and 80s on fixed incomes who can’t afford their rent increases, and youth and young adults.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new anti-camping laws are intensifying the already tumultuous disaster response situation, as many homeless people living outside now try to become less visible to avoid jail time. The punitive laws are also expected to increase distrust between local government and homeless individuals, making it even more difficult for people to accept help if they are found.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These laws exist, in my opinion, to push people away and out of sight which makes our job tougher,” said Eric Samuels, the president of the Texas Homeless Network. (Texas passed its statewide camping ban in 2021.) “And if people are badly hurt and they’re miles from public view because they don’t want to get a ticket, then emergency crews might not be able to get out to help.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disaster aid for those already experiencing homelessness faces an uncertain future</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">FEMA has the primary responsibility of providing disaster relief and works with states and local communities to manage emergency shelters, <a href=\"https://maps.redcross.org/website/maps/ARC_Shelters.html\">which are mostly run by</a> the Red Cross. FEMA prohibits housing assistance from going to those who were already homeless — “because the need for housing was not caused by the disaster,” as their policy states — though homeless individuals may qualify for temporary transportation, funeral, child care, and medical aid.<br><br>FEMA policy does permit those who lived, pre-disaster, in “non-traditional forms of housing” like “tents, certain types of huts, and lean-to structures” to apply for a few months of rental assistance. But to receive this FEMA money, applicants must obtain verification of their pre-storm situation from “a credible or official source” which, according to Patton, makes accessing the aid virtually impossible.<br><br>“People do not apply,” he said. “It’s an exceptionally burdensome and administratively difficult process.”<br><br>Recently, in light of this, and after years of advocacy by housing organizations, HUD stepped up to establish the <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/news/rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-notice/\">Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing</a> (RUSH) program, using unspent funds from <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/esg\">another emergency grant program</a>. RUSH aims to help those who were homeless prior to a storm or other climate disaster, and the first grants <a href=\"https://www.nhlp.org/resources/nlihc-and-nhlp-release-report-on-huds-rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-program/\">were deployed</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23389508/hurricane-ian-death-toll-storm-florida-landfall-climate\">wake of Hurricane Ian</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We were very pleased to have the ability to launch the program because we see that people who are doubled up or experiencing homelessness during the disaster often don’t access FEMA funds or receive support from FEMA for long,” said Marion McFadden, HUD’s principal deputy assistant secretary for community planning and development. “By providing funds specifically for these situations, we’re filling in gaps.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>The other way HUD comes in is through its <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/cdbg-dr\">Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery</a> program (CDBG-DR), which is a highly flexible, long-term disaster aid program that can be used to provide months of rental assistance and build new affordable housing well after FEMA is gone. However the program is not permanently authorized — meaning it relies on periodic appropriations from Congress, which are often delayed and insufficient. The Biden administration has called for Congress to permanently authorize CDBG-DR, and a bipartisan bill in Congress <a href=\"https://www.naco.org/news/bipartisan-bills-introduced-support-counties-disaster-recovery-process\">has called for the same</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1605\">a separate bill</a> currently moving through Congress seeks to move much of this longer-term disaster recovery work back over to FEMA, something low-income housing advocates believe will threaten those who are homeless before a hurricane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are concerned that the bill, as written, may lead to the misuse of scarce federal recovery funds and prevent critically needed long-term recovery assistance from reaching low-income disaster survivors,” more than 35 national<strong> </strong>housing advocacy groups wrote in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U15ZfvjLRefLildANBu3ij7zRXRGjL_51893RBYPTaE/edit\">a congressional letter</a> last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">McFadden, of HUD, said there’s “a real role” for her agency to play in supporting communities after disasters. “We are making billions of dollars in grants every year and we understand the unique needs of low-income people and of low-income housing,” she told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">FEMA was noncommittal when I inquired about the agency’s plans for unhoused individuals during a disaster if Congress granted them new authority, or whether they’d reconsider their stance on aiding the pre-disaster homeless.<br><br>“If additional or new authority is passed by Congress and signed into law, FEMA would then develop guidance necessary to implement the new authority,” an agency spokesperson said. “FEMA would focus on supporting communities’ recovery in addressing needs resulting from a disaster and adhering to the intent of Congress in approving any new authority.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As climate change escalates, communities across the US face increasing threats not only from hurricanes but also from heat waves, floods, and wildfires. Advocates <a href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/energy-justice/pdfs/EMBARGOED_FEMA-Petition-on-Heat-and-Wildfire-Smoke.pdf\">have been petitioning</a> FEMA over the last year to expand its criteria for disaster aid to include heat and smoke, emphasizing the need for more adaptable responses to these challenges. The nation’s severe shortage of affordable housing worsens the struggles of both the newly displaced and the long-unsheltered, and addressing these intertwined crises of climate resilience and housing stability has never been more urgent.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In the past days, Israel has also instructed residents of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-iran-hezbollah-attack-hamas-war-airstrikes-beirut-gaza-latest/\">77 southern towns and villages to flee</a>, telling people to move far north of an internationally recognized border zone — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-news-10-03-2024-5fad98f56ebcc7e1751388b608c7c8dd\">possibly indicating Israel’s intention to move further into Lebanon</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These attacks follow weeks of bombing campaigns near and within Beirut, and the Israeli military’s announcement that it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share\">transferred one army division</a>, typically numbering around 10,000 troops, to the Lebanese border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The invasion marks a dangerous new phase in the long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party that has fought Israel since its founding decades ago. Israel has recently escalated its attacks on Hezbollah, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group\">assassinating the group’s reclusive leader</a>, Hassan Nasrallah, in a bombing in a Beirut suburb after reportedly launching a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza\">series of attacks on thousands of mobile devices</a> used by members of Hezbollah throughout Lebanon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel’s latest operations have been costly: More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest\">1,000 Lebanese have been killed, 6,000 wounded</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-heart-beirut-killing-six-2024-10-02/\">more than a million displaced</a>, according to Lebanese government officials. Hezbollah’s recent attacks on Israel — largely missile strikes — have meanwhile left at least <a href=\"https://www.jns.org/idf-probing-cause-of-sirens-in-central-israel/\">eight</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv\">people</a> wounded. Close combat in Lebanon’s south has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-war-ground-operations-as-hamas-war-continues/\">killed eight Israeli soldiers thus far</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the two sides have fought on and off over the decades, Hezbollah has been engaged in more intense fighting with Israel since the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas last year. Hezbollah has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas/here-are-the-latest-developments-on-strikes-in-lebanon?smid=url-share\">continue its missile strikes</a> into Israeli territory until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza, where at least <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/\">40,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. Israel has shown no sign it is contemplating ending its operations, either. The country’s leaders have said they want to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/352059/why-israel-cant-destroy-hamas\">completely eradicate Hamas</a>, and Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon\">defense minister said Monday</a> that the “next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Key allies also seem unable to end the fighting. The United States reportedly had a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html\">Hezbollah-Israel peace plan that it has now abandoned</a>. While the US has publicly told Israel it should try to deescalate the situation, the US <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797\">reportedly privately offered Israel support</a> for its Hezbollah strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Iranian officials have responded to Israel’s recent attacks with a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-launched-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-rcna173434\">ballistic missile strike</a> on Tuesday. The regime launched at least <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-10-01-2024-eb175dff6e46906caea8b9e43dfbd3da\">180 missiles at Israel</a>, though <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-us-prepared-israel-defend-iranian-attack/story?id=114393069\">US forces in the region</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-what-to-know-hezbollah-incursion-c44358cb4c70db69bdab4b254cb2ed76\">Israel’s own missile defense system </a>intercepted most.<strong> </strong>Iran’s mission to the UN suggested the country did not have further attacks in store, <a href=\"https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106\">writing on X</a> that the country’s “response … has been duly carried out,” though it added the threat: “Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here is what we do know so far about what has happened, and what’s likely to come next.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The animosity between Hezbollah and Israel is decades old; in fact, Hezbollah formed in <a href=\"https://merip.org/1982/09/the-war-in-lebanon/\">1982 in southern Lebanon</a> as a response to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/6/4/a-cosmic-stink-israels-invasion-of-lebanon-40-years-on\">Israel’</a>s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/\">disastrous invasion</a>, which killed tens of thousands of Lebanese, and subsequent decades-long occupation of that area. Hezbollah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/24/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon\">waged guerilla warfare against Israeli troops for decades</a>, and Israel finally left in 2000 following years of brutal fighting and a UN resolution requiring it to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The two sides settled into a conflict that simmered until 2006. After Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two others, Israel responded with a counterattack that led to a short, bloody war in which <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/echoes-of-2006-israel-hezbollah-and-the-potential-for-regional-war/\">more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis were killed</a>.<strong> </strong>A UN-brokered ceasefire ended that conflict, but fighting continued for years — and it intensified again in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, and, starting on October 8, 2023, began firing major salvos into northern Israel, eventually displacing around <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo\">60,000 residents there</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Initially, with Israel focused on uprooting Hamas in Gaza, fighting along its northern border with Lebanon was limited to tit-for-tat strikes. But starting in September, Israel escalated the fighting significantly, first by attacking Hezbollah members and leadership with exploding electronics, then bombing Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon and the outskirts of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ever since the October 7 attack, observers have warned about the possibility that Israel’s war with Gaza might spread to encompass Hezbollah and, perhaps, the entire region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear if that’s what’s happening now or what a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah might look like. Despite Hezbollah’s previous ability to stand up to Israeli firepower, it’s also not clear how it will fare with its communication networks disrupted by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon\">the recent pager and walkie-talkie attacks</a> —&nbsp;which Israel has not claimed but is widely assumed to be behind. What’s more, a significant number of mid-level and senior Hezbollah leaders were killed in that attack and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/israel/373428/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-hamas-gaza\">subsequent bombings</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What might Hezbollah’s next move be?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the Middle East. It boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained\">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. Israel <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollahs-tunnels-flexible-command-weather-israels-deadly-blows-2024-09-25/\">claims to have destroyed thousands of the group’s rockets and shells</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/natan-sachs/\">Natan Sachs</a>, director of the Middle East policy program at the Brookings Institution, says Israel may have destroyed some of Hezbollah’s precision munitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Hezbollah has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on\">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/\">digital espionage</a>. And recent Israeli attacks on Lebanese mobile devices and the assassination of Nasrallah haven’t completely wiped out that capacity. Hezbollah claimed to strike at least two locations in northern Israel on October 3 — <a href=\"https://aje.io/l9o832?update=3220211\">a military site and civilian settlement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There was kind of this gleefulness about Hezbollah being completely disabled and destroyed now because all the leadership’s gone,” said <a href=\"https://x.com/phillipsmyth?lang=en\">Phillip Smyth</a>, an independent analyst focusing on the Middle East and terrorism. “That’s not how it works.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the success of recent Israeli attacks has called into question the extent of Hezbollah’s capabilities — and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html\">reportedly shaken Iranian leadership</a>. In that sense, Hezbollah may have limited options going forward, even though it had previously pledged not to relent until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached. On October 3, Israel’s military claimed to have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-heart-beirut-killing-six-2024-10-02/\">killed more than a dozen Hezbollah militants in an attack in central Beirut</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Hezbollah turns out to be less capable, militarily, than I expected,” <a href=\"https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/\">Thanassis Cambanis</a>, a senior fellow and director of the think tank Century International, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cambanis and other experts believed that Hezbollah had the technology to effectively strike military targets in Israel, as well as civilian infrastructure in Haifa and even Tel Aviv, a major population center. But if it was willing and able, it seems it would have done so by now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It turns out that Hezbollah wasn’t willing to use its most powerful military options, or that it couldn’t because Israel was able to infiltrate or neutralize Hezbollah capabilities,” Cambanis said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The group’s second-in-command, Naim Qassem, sought to dispel doubts about Hezbollah’s capabilities in a speech on Monday, though he also seemed to suggest Hezbollah is currently on the defensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Israel was not able to reach our military capabilities, and what its media says about hitting most of the medium and long-range capabilities is a dream they have not achieved and will never achieve,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ\">Qassem said</a>. “We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He added that an announcement will be <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-says-choose-nasrallahs-successor-at-earliest-opportunity\">made in the coming days</a> about Nasrallah’s successor, who Smyth said will most likely be <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822451\">Hashem Safieddine</a>, Nasrallah’s handpicked heir and cousin. Safieddine currently oversees&nbsp; Hezbollah’s political affairs and sits on the council managing the group’s military operations.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Iran’s role here?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tuesday’s missile barrage is Iran’s most escalatory move since April, when the regime sent around 300 missiles and rockets toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted by US and regional partner forces, as well as Israel’s own air defenses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel has threatened to retaliate against Iran for this latest attack. “The regime in Tehran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to exact a price from our enemies,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a meeting of the country’s security cabinet Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not clear <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/02/iran-israel-missile-attacks-response?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top\">exactly what form that retaliation will take</a> —&nbsp;whether it will be an outright attack on Iranian territory, more covert actions like assassinations or disruptions to critical infrastructure, or increased attacks against Iranian partner groups. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, Iran asserts its regional power and carries out foreign policy goals —&nbsp;primarily, antagonizing Israel —&nbsp;by funding and providing resources to a network of militia groups. Those include Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, Hezbollah.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/14/23917078/israel-hamas-war-gaza-iran-hezbollah-khamenei-lebanon\">told Vox</a> last October.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, while NATO allies pledge to defend one another from attacks, Iran has been reluctant to be actively involved in a war against Israel; a drone attack on Israeli territory in April, following the assassination of an Iranian military leader in an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, was obviously telegraphed and minimally destructive. And the July assassination of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779\">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the former Hamas leader, while he was in Tehran prompted no obvious retaliation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not to say that Iran has no appetite for conflict: “The appetite for them was quite high, to be perfectly frank,” Smyth said.&nbsp;“They just thought that they could micromanage this so that it wouldn’t get to this point. And the Israelis clearly called their bluff.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, it seems, Iran has offered a show of force — but there are limits to how far the country will go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Escalation could come, but [the Iranians] need to thread a needle,” Sachs said. That involves trying to show solidarity with Hezbollah and that Iran is capable of attack, without getting into an extended war with both Israel and the US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Israel’s Lebanon campaign a prelude to a larger ground invasion?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel’s plan for its “limited” ground invasion <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/30/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzI3NjY4ODAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI5MDUxMTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mjc2Njg4MDAsImp0aSI6ImFlMTRkYjY5LTk5YTYtNDIzMS05YmVkLTlhODEzNjVhOTdiYSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDI0LzA5LzMwL2lzcmFlbC1sZWJhbm9uLWhlemJvbGxhaC1oYW1hcy13YXItbmV3cy1nYXphLyJ9.gPdOCFqWeUNDOOgWc_u8OxxY2nTy62a09dLm8KwWSa4\"><strong>initially appeared to </strong>involve</a> rooting out Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel to neutralize the threat to Israeli communities nearby. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, by Thursday, there were some indications that Israel could move further into Lebanon’s south: The military instructed residents in Lebanon’s southern Nabatieh governorate to move about 36 miles to the north, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-news-10-03-2024-5fad98f56ebcc7e1751388b608c7c8dd\">according to the Associated Press.</a> That’s beyond the Litani River, which serves as the northern border of an internationally recognized border zone between Israel and Lebanon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s a fear that Israel’s narrow mission could balloon into something bigger — much as it already has in Gaza, where Israel’s stated operational objective of eliminating Hamas has given way to widespread destruction of civilian life. If the conflict with Hezbollah does grow, that would likely spur fierce Lebanese resistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“An invasion of Lebanon will mobilize Lebanese as a national issue to resist, including the many Lebanese who don’t support Israel but also oppose another Israeli invasion and occupation,” Cambanis said. “Perhaps in the short term Israel can achieve some of its aims by pursuing the logic of total war, but it will only make Israel and the entire Middle East less safe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Lebanese government —&nbsp;or what passes for it, since an unelected caretaker government has been in place since 2022 — has clearly demonstrated that the country is not interested in yet another war with Israel. Caretaker <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-hold-session-elect-president-after-ceasefire-caretaker-pm-says-2024-09-30/\">Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced Monday</a> that his government is prepared to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war. That resolution would deploy the Lebanese army to the country’s south to crack down on Hezbollah and require Israel to pull out of southern Lebanon. Now that Israel has entered Lebanon, it’s unclear whether Mikati will trigger the resolution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The conflict has already taken a significant toll on Lebanese civilians and it could only get worse from here. In anticipation, Lebanon and the United Nations petitioned for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/23dd80ed-e9dd-5ee3-a552-622fbac870f6?smid=url-share\">$426 million</a> in humanitarian aid on Tuesday to help those affected in the next three months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lebanon has already struggled under decades of war and government dysfunction, as well as an influx of Syrian refugees that have stretched already-limited state capacity. Now, Israel’s bombing attacks and invasion have displaced around 1 million Lebanese from the south of the country, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o\">according to Mikati</a>, and the Lebanese government says <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-30-2024-83ea5f243688f309754ec74850de4238\">at least 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s next for the Gaza-Hezbollah-Israel conflict overall?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There seems to be no end in sight for the widening conflict, for several reasons: US unwillingness to restrain Israel by restricting weapons shipments; Hezbollah’s stated position that they will not stop attacks on Israel until a ceasefire with Gaza is reached; and the repeated breakdown of Gaza ceasefire talks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US and France did attempt to negotiate a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/lebanon-temporary-ceasefire-plan-hezbollah-israel\">21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel last week</a>, but “Israel (Netanyahu) has flat out rejected the US-French 21 day ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,” <a href=\"https://history.stanford.edu/people/joel-beinin\">Joel Beinin</a>, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University, said. As Hezbollah also frames its attacks as support for Gaza, it most likely won’t agree to a ceasefire as long as Gaza is still under attack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for the US, there seems to be almost no effort to truly restrain Israel following the failed ceasefire attempt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The United States is just not driving events,” <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/michael-wahid-hanna\">Michael Hanna</a>, director of the US program at the International Crisis Group, said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups. Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis. And ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” a spokesperson from the National Security Council told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US could, however, do more to deter escalation; <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/in-the-news/bernie-sanders-preparing-resolutions-to-block-20b-in-us-arms-sales-to-israel/\">Sen. Bernie Sanders </a>(I-VT) has introduced <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-resolution-forces-vote-arms-sales-israel-gaza_n_66f5b5a4e4b0b663235fb66d\">a resolution to block arms sales to Israel</a>, on the premise that the arms transfers violate international law, although that is unlikely to pass in Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although Lebanon is the current site of the crisis, Israeli military operations are ongoing in Gaza, where <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240711-more-than-186-000-dead-in-gaza-how-credible-are-the-estimates-published-on-the-lancet\">as many as 186,000 people may have been killed in the past year of fighting</a>, according to some researchers. (Many media sources put that figure at 40,000, but an accurate count is difficult given that much of Gaza is destroyed and fighting is ongoing.) Medical infrastructure has been destroyed, and there are many reported instances of communicable disease and malnutrition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People are getting killed in Gaza daily, the humanitarian situation is dire,” Hanna said. “Life is disrupted and on hold — there are no schools, there’s no functioning society. There’s nothing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel appears to be emboldened by its victories, and Hezbollah appears reluctant to launch large-scale attacks on Israel. The US has maintained its support for Israel and is sending <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1\">more troops to the region</a>. Iran has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392\">issued some threats</a>, but hasn’t yet been much of an active participant in the fighting. All that makes it impossible to say where the war goes from here. Cambanis, however, predicts the worst.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s a dangerous and delusional march to war on Iran,” he said. “I would have liked to rely on the US government to restrain Israel, but it’s clear that the Biden administration supports Israel’s widening gyre of escalation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 3, 1:50 pm ET: </strong>This piece was originally published October 1 and has been updated to include more information about Iran’s missile strikes against Israel, Israel’s missile strikes on Lebanon, and the state of ground operations in southern Lebanon.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Doctors use it as a mild anesthetic, sending patients off into brief and largely pain-free dissociative euphorias before having a tooth pulled or dislocated finger yanked straight. Inhaling nitrous gives a loopy, giddy sort of high that can last up to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8081181/\">five minutes</a>. As a pressurized gas, nitrous also powers <a href=\"https://www.dawnaerospace.com/latest-news/transitioning-space-propulsion-to-a-nitrous-based-industry-standard\">rockets</a>, race cars, and whipped cream dispensers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The gas is both legal and widely available. It comes in small pressurized canisters intended for kitchen use; large tanks for heavier applications, like medicine or car engines; or even as the gas that shoots out of whipped cream canisters when there’s no cream left (hence: “whippets”).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thanks to being both accessible and cheap, nitrous has been used as a recreational drug for decades, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bI2fFpz1lE\">Grateful Dead</a> concerts in the ’60s to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-03-07-mn-3542-story.html\">raves</a> in the ’90s. Lockdowns during the Covid pandemic seem to have set off <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9201030/\">a new wave</a> of recreational nitrous use. Today, “People on Nitrous Gas” has its own TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/people-on-nitrous-gas\">discovery tab</a>, with videos racking up millions of views. Celebrities are putting the risks of abuse on display, from <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kanye-west-loses-lawyer-shocking-112257343.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEg-ZUh8CHlFfz_YckfzG8OS2nzrn2qK_9bFWwymxF_jU05V5UOcawWGpNziJfFHPbqkRBDV26ukNE9h2xYCdICLCLtuWnKldyYliusXLhO1Zde9IEraNeTcK4Zg99-IlZVKtdVeqMaTFLsytZntSuSGo0LmCSv-6_SuKgwvggA4\">Kanye West</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bet.com/article/y6qcns/sza-shares-concerns-over-nitrous-oxide-galaxy-gas-tik-tok-vertical-celebs\">SZA</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/steve-o-interview-jackass-tour-live-bucket-list-b2367273.html\">Steve-O</a> of the stunt show <em>Jackass </em>fame. The <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/secret-lives-of-mormon-wives-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-comparison.html\">Mormon mothers</a> and social media influencers of “<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/momtok?lang=en\">MomTok</a>,” whose faith <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2007/08/not-even-once?lang=eng\">shuns</a> any drug use, recently <a href=\"https://people.com/secret-lives-of-mormon-wives-laughing-gas-and-botox-derm-answers-our-questions-8711616\">said</a> that part of the draw of all the Botox they’ve gotten is getting the nitrous first. “It’s a party,” one said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Inhaling nitrous is considered relatively safe for people who don’t use it often and don’t take too much. But there are definitely <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26496821/\">risks</a>, and more so in recreational contexts. As recreational use rises, particularly <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611736.pdf\">among teenagers</a>, those risks are gaining more attention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The primary one is vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366039/\">inactivates B12</a> in the body, which coupled with long-term use can lead to <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/nitrous-oxide-effects-are-reversible-with-early-treatment/#:~:text=When%20recreationally%20inhaled%2C%20nitrous%20oxide,the%20brain%20and%20spinal%20cord.\">nerve damage</a> across the brain and <a href=\"https://casereports.bmj.com/content/16/11/e254727\">spine</a>. Without intervention, that can develop into paralysis or <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379581/\">brain damage</a>. There’s <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16426\">currently</a> no <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16419#:~:text=Unlike%20other%20addictive%20substances%2C%20nitrous,best%20%5B5%2C%206%5D.\">consensus</a> as to whether nitrous <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16430\">should</a> be labeled an addictive substance. While it doesn’t seem to build the same physical dependency as opioids, it does still carry the risk of habit formation in some cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And while nitrous <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/46th-ecdd/nitrous-oxide_46th-ecdd_critical-review_public-version.pdf?sfvrsn=f6dcf08d_1\">doesn’t have</a> a known fatal dose, deaths from use have been known to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1506823/\">occur</a>, usually from accidents that can happen while high on nitrous or from asphyxiation. Across the UK, where statistics on nitrous are more detailed, there were just 56 deaths <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsrelatedtovolatilesubstancesheliumandnitrogeninenglandandwales/2001to2020registrations\">attributed</a> to nitrous between 2001 and 2020, including both recreational and medical settings. (To put that in some perspective, there were nearly <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/alcoholspecificdeathsintheuk/2021registrations#:~:text=There%20were%209%2C641%20deaths%20related,14.0%20deaths%20per%20100%2C000%20people.\">10,000</a> deaths in the UK attributed to alcohol in 2021 alone.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while the rise in using recreational nitrous for its brief highs is prompting new concerns, the drug is actually one of the oldest stories in the Western history of mind-altering substance use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through the centuries of up-and-down nitrous use across the US and UK, you find a rich, at times hilarious, trail left by this so-called atmosphere of heaven. Theaters across the US in the early 1800s filled with members of the public, watching volunteers inhale nitrous on stage and provide a delirious form of entertainment for the crowds. Traveling caravans brought nitrous shows on the road. Poets celebrated a new form of pleasure, while <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1996/05/the-nitrous-oxide-philosopher/376581/\">philosophers tried nitrous</a> in Harvard laboratories, frantically scribbling down rushes of insight.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2_11557a.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.974209811906,100,62.051580376188\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An 1840 engraving of a man dancing after inhaling nitrous oxide.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The history of nitrous use is a history of shifting cultural attitudes about the mind. More specifically, about the value —&nbsp;or rejection —&nbsp;of chemically altered states of <a href=\"https://blog.apaonline.org/2024/09/20/are-psychedelic-experiences-intrinsically-valuable/\">consciousness</a>. Today, as the gradual <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721486/ketamine-dmt-lsd-psychedelics-magic-mushrooms-legalization-recreation-psilocybin\">return of legal access to psychedelics</a> is sparking renewed conversation around the potential benefits, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23954347/psychedelics-bad-trips-ketamine-mdma-psilocybin-lsd-risks\">and harms</a>, of mind-altering drugs, seeing the many different iterations of nitrous use across history can help us think more expansively about what, if anything, the strange experiences of nitrous mean and what the future of recreational nitrous might look like.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">“A new pleasure for which language has no name”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In late 18th-century industrial Britain, the air <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00022470.1978.10470577#:~:text=Over%20the%20period%201660%2D1800,other%20time%20in%20their%20history.\">was foul</a>.

Respiratory diseases were rampant, like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128530/tuberculosis-vaccine-efficacy-solutions-tb-bcg\">tuberculosis</a>, which had come to be <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5432783/\">known</a> as “the robber of youth.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The deadly air inspired the founding of the Pneumatic Institution in 1799, a medical facility in Bristol intended to study whether gasses could be used as medicines, too. It was there that the first experiments with nitrous began in earnest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The chemist Joseph Priestley <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30829177/#:~:text=Background%3A%20Joseph%20Priestley%27s%20discovery%20of,N2O)%20was%20recorded%20in%201772.\">discovered</a> nitrous oxide in 1772, but dismissed it as toxic. Humphry Davy, a young lab assistant at the Pneumatic Institution, had a hunch that Priestley’s discovery had been confused with a chemically similar but highly irritating compound: nitric oxide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April, Davy repeated Priestley’s experiment, and wrote to a friend afterward that he had “made a discovery which proves how necessary it is to repeat experiments,” prefiguring the role of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics\">replication in science</a> today. Nitrous oxide, when purely synthesized, was perfectly breathable. Davy then set out to breathe as much as he possibly could.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He sealed himself inside a box that was designed to boost the inhalation of gasses. He sat for over an hour while a steady flow of nitrous oxide filled the chamber. When he stepped out, he grabbed a giant silk air-bag full of more nitrous and huffed that too, just for good measure. Then, his mind peeled away from his body, and he “lost touch with all external things,” entering a strange, revelatory world of flashing insights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That summer, Davy invited dozens of curious writers, physicians, and philosophers to visit the Pneumatic Institute in the late evenings after normal operations had ceased. They all huffed nitrous, experimenting with entirely new regions of the mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to historian Mike Jay, author of <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300276091/psychonauts/\"><em>Psychonauts: Drugs and the Making of the Modern Mind</em></a>, nitrous gave Western scientists one of the first chemical means of reliably accessing mystical states of consciousness. Against the banality of our ordinary experience, nitrous delivered a shocking contrast, a state of mind full of unfamiliar pleasures that often carried <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\">a sense of insight into the nature of the cosmos</a>. The poet Robert Southey, after his first hit of nitrous, <a href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/o-excellent-air-bag-humphry-davy-and-nitrous-oxide/\">wrote</a> to his brother that “Davy has actually invented a new pleasure for which language has no name.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Gas-living-room-color-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,21.837837145893,100,56.324325708214\" alt=\"A colored etching of poets in a living room, one reclining on a sofa, passing around a balloon of nitrous oxide.\" title=\"A colored etching of poets in a living room, one reclining on a sofa, passing around a balloon of nitrous oxide.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Colored etching by Robert Seymour of his evening with a group of poets composing verses while on nitrous oxide in 1829. | Wellcome Collection\" data-portal-copyright=\"Wellcome Collection\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Within a year, however, most who had come to try nitrous lost interest. Its pleasures were new and exciting, but rarely stuck with users once they returned to sobriety after a few minutes. Others who tried the gas just ended up with an upset stomach and the giggles. Davy, who would go on to become president of <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/\">the Royal Society</a>, stayed with his experiments, eventually producing <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/researcheschemic00davy/page/n9/mode/2up\">a hefty book</a> on the chemistry and philosophy of nitrous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He predicted that since nitrous temporarily extinguished pain, it could be useful during surgeries. No form of anesthesia existed yet, so surgeries were very painful, and very dangerous. But the idea failed to gain momentum. Instead, nitrous became something else: entertainment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How nitrous became entertainment, and then medicine</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the early enthusiasm for nitrous fizzled, it was easy enough to produce that, as word got out, chemists learned they could make it in their home laboratories. This turned nitrous into something of a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-20/laughing-gas-parties-discovery-of-anaesthesia/10811060\">party fixture</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Maybe it will become the custom for us to inhale laughing gas at the end of a dinner party, instead of drinking champagne,” a young German chemist speculated in 1826, after participating in a garden party where guests enjoyed nitrous under the afternoon sun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Public nitrous shows began <a href=\"https://books.google.ie/books?id=djPCfSAsHN0C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22inhaled+the+gas+and+stormed+around+the+lecture+hall%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ry2S783wwc&amp;sig=ACfU3U1-wSj-2qhXweEMYRPD8hxyuYRpAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCha-Ln7v-AhXyRkEAHZBCAEUQ6AF6BAgJEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22inhaled%20the%20gas%20and%20stormed%20around%20the%20lecture%20hall%22&amp;f=false\">taking place</a> as early as an 1814 lecture series in Philadelphia. First, a doctor gave a discourse on the effects of nitrous to the assembled crowd. Then, a series of young men volunteered to inhale balloons of nitrous onstage, putting on a raucous spectacle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Davy and his friends had been interested in the mental side of what being on nitrous felt like, these public shows put a spotlight on the uninhibited bodies that the chemical set loose. After inhaling the gas, volunteers would clumsily dance, fight, sing, or even strike up the occasional fencing match. Sometimes, the first row of a theater was <a href=\"https://www.google.ie/books/edition/The_Wondrous_Story_of_Anesthesia/H--3BAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=horace+wells+knees&amp;pg=PA19&amp;printsec=frontcover\">kept empty</a> to protect onlookers from the mayhem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“On stage, the subjective experience was incidental,” writes Jay. “The moment of return to waking consciousness was not interrogated for mystical revelation, but held up for confused hilarity.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Soon, nitrous shows were taken on the road, carried by traveling carnivals to new, hooting crowds each night. Volunteers were charged around 25 cents per huff, bringing in good profit for those who’d invested in the necessary gas tanks, tubes, and breathing bags. One traveling nitrous show, put on by Samuel Colt (who would go on to invent the pioneering Colt firearm), dosed roughly 20,000 volunteers from Canada to Maryland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was during a show in 1844 that the American dentist Horace Wells <a href=\"https://www.google.ie/books/edition/The_Wondrous_Story_of_Anesthesia/H--3BAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=horace+wells+knees&amp;pg=PA19&amp;printsec=frontcover\">witnessed</a> a teenager on nitrous slam into a wooden bench. The boy, Wells noticed, felt no pain, which led him to wonder whether he could give the gas to clients to numb the pain of having a tooth pulled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wells first tried on himself, inhaling nitrous and having another dentist pull his own wisdom tooth. It was a great success: Wells felt no pain, and proclaimed “a new era in tooth pulling.” He successfully performed the procedure on a few of his patients, before convincing a surgeon at the prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital to let Wells administer the gas during an operation, doubling as <a href=\"https://www.google.ie/books/edition/Blessed_Days_of_Anaesthesia/9gYTDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=horace+wells+%22denounced+as+an+imposition%22&amp;pg=PA21&amp;printsec=frontcover\">a demonstration</a> for a strictly medical audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It didn’t go well. Nervous in front of a scrupulous crowd, Wells pulled away the nitrous balloon a little <a href=\"https://www.google.ie/books/edition/Blessed_Days_of_Anaesthesia/9gYTDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=horace+wells+%22denounced+as+an+imposition%22&amp;pg=PA21&amp;printsec=frontcover\">too quickly</a>. During the operation, the patient appeared to groan in pain (though it was later deemed an involuntary and unconscious response). Onlookers nevertheless booed Wells out of the theater, and the embarrassment pushed him into a depression that culminated in suicide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the demonstration inspired Wells’s former partner to try a similar procedure, only with a different substance: a solvent called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920664/\">ether</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After a few successful experiments using ether as an anesthetic, another demonstration was arranged in the same theater where Wells’s had failed. This time, ether was successfully administered as a pain-vanquishing anesthetic, prompting one of the most significant medical breakthroughs of the century, as well as a revisitation of Wells’s work with nitrous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The hospital theater was renamed “<a href=\"https://www.massgeneral.org/museum/exhibits/ether-dome\">The Ether Dome</a>,” while anesthetic use of both ether and nitrous began to spread across the country.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The next 150 years of nitrous</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rise of anesthetics like nitrous in medicine was accompanied by a decline in their use&nbsp;as recreational drugs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Physicians began to think of nitrous-induced revelations as gibberish, closer to delirium than real insight. Too much interest in their short-lived pleasures, doctors <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/2221699/Anesthetics_and_the_Chemical_Sublime\">began to write</a>, could pose a public health risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recreational anesthetics like nitrous would “delight the animal sensations, while they destroy the moral sentiments; they introduce their victims to a fool’s paradise; they mock them with joys which end in sorrows.” Jay describes the mid-1800s arc of nitrous as a “shift away from subjectivity,” prefiguring the same trajectory across a variety of disciplines, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0952695119874009\">including psychology</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through the middle of the 19th century, nitrous settled into dentistry while falling out of philosophy, with at least one major exception that ultimately proved the rule: the eccentric American philosopher Benjamin Blood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1860, during what he expected to be a very normal visit to the dentist, he awoke from a routine dose of nitrous with the vague sense that he’d glimpsed the essence of all philosophy, the “secret or problem of the world,” as <a href=\"https://ia801307.us.archive.org/18/items/cu31924029019003/cu31924029019003.pdf\">he later wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blood asked dentists and doctors why their gas had given him a spiritual epiphany. He <a href=\"https://ia801307.us.archive.org/18/items/cu31924029019003/cu31924029019003.pdf\">learned</a> two things. First, that “nearly every hospital and dentist office has its reminiscences of patients who, after a brief anesthesia, uttered confused fragments of some inarticulate import which always had to do with the mystery of life.” Across the country, patients returning from anesthesia had been asking their doctors something to the effect of, “What does it all mean, or amount to?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, the doctors and the dentists couldn’t care less. Blood received smiles and shrugs, but no explanations. So he spent 14 years reviving the tradition of nitrous self-experimentation, eventually publishing <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/anstheticrevela00bloogoog/page/n9/mode/2up\">a pamphlet</a>: <em>The Anaesthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It didn’t get particularly famous, but it did catch the attention of Harvard philosopher William James. Inspired by Blood’s curious writings, James followed Humphry Davy’s old protocol, heating a beaker of ammonium nitrate in the Harvard chemistry laboratory, capturing the escaping gas, and inhaling deeply with pen and paper in hand. His subsequent <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/release/nitrous.html\">experience</a> of “intense metaphysical illumination” informed the rest of his life’s work, where he would go on to become <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-79061-9_1552#:~:text=William%20James%20is%20known%20as,and%20studied%20the%20human%20mind.\">known</a>, today, as the father of American psychology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, innovations in the delivery mechanisms for laughing gas were starting to ramp up its use in dentistry. George Poe, cousin of the poet Edgar Allen Poe, figured out how to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/04/revolution-in-the-air-how-laughing-gas-changed-the-world\">manufacture nitrous</a> in liquid form. This allowed for packaging and distributing it in easy-to-use canisters. By 1883, he was supplying <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/01/13/6830090/dr-poe-and-his-curious-breathing-machine\">5,000 dentists</a> with canned nitrous oxide across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once nitrous came in a convenient package, people began finding all sorts of new uses for it. In 1914, American rocketeer Robert Goddard filed <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US1103503\">a patent</a> suggesting it could work as a rocket propellant, where it’s <a href=\"https://www.dawnaerospace.com/latest-news/prevalence-of-nitrous-based-in-space-propellants\">still used</a> today.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-583937001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.305650459131,100,35.388699081739\" alt=\"Clubgoers at Studio 54 in New York enjoy a tank of nitrous oxide on the dance floor in 1977.\" title=\"Clubgoers at Studio 54 in New York enjoy a tank of nitrous oxide on the dance floor in 1977.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Clubgoers at Studio 54 in New York enjoy a tank of nitrous oxide on the dance floor in 1977. | Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the innovation that brought nitrous back into style as a contemporary recreational drug was a little more mundane: whipped cream canisters. It turned out that dispensing cream out of a nitrous gas cylinder delivers the perfectly fluffy whipped cream we can so easily buy in grocery stores today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These whipped cream canisters are also where the name “whippets” comes from, and how we’ve landed in the awkward situation of <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611736.pdf\">rising nitrous use</a> among teenagers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Nitrous, today and tomorrow</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the neighboring arena of psychedelic drugs, many advocates are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/360200/how-to-buy-psychedelics-lsd-shrooms-stores\">pushing for wider accessibility</a> to these mind-altering substances. With nitrous, that accessibility is already here, and now, attracting strong criticism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The UK recently reinstated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67346032\">a shade of prohibition</a>, making possession of nitrous oxide for “unlawful use” illegal. You can still use it to dispense whipped cream and other culinary delights, but if you’re just interested in a giggly high, or even seeing whether it might reveal, as Blood thought, the world’s philosophical secret, that’s unlawful. But prohibition inevitably pushes drug use underground, where it’s guaranteed to be riskier and less well-informed than legal, regulated, and educated use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And with a substance like nitrous that has relatively few risks <a href=\"https://www.euda.europa.eu/spotlights/spotlight-recreational-use-nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas_en\">when used responsibly and occasionally</a>, there’s an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9517250/\">work on promoting</a> more responsible <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/everything-you-need-to-know-about-whippets-and-how-to-stay-safe\">forms of use</a> through public education (such as awareness that the gas impairs the body’s ability to take in oxygen, so doing whippets in a tight, closed space is probably not as safe as in a backyard).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since nitrous-related substance abuse is such a small problem relative to opioids and alcohol, it hasn’t received all that much study. The past few years of data, however, have prompted <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16380\">a new conversation</a> around whether nitrous <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16430\">should be</a> considered addictive. It <a href=\"https://gladstonesclinic.com/blog/addiction-news/hippy-crack-nitrous-oxide-addiction/\">doesn’t</a> seem to form a physical dependence, like opioids, and has no physical symptoms of withdrawal. But it does seem capable of forming a more psychological form of dependence (dissociative pleasure basically on tap does obviously pose some habit-forming risk), prompting <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16426\">concerns</a> around how exactly to label it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Either way, ensuring support and harm reduction is available to those who need it may prove to be a challenge. But if we can’t figure out how to handle recreational use with nitrous, it’s difficult to imagine how we’d do it in a world where LSD and psilocybin mushrooms <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/360200/how-to-buy-psychedelics-lsd-shrooms-stores\">become widely available</a>, too.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1276667241.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4750998734523,100,93.049800253095\" alt=\"Discarded canisters of nitrous oxide on a road.\" title=\"Discarded canisters of nitrous oxide on a road.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Discarded canisters of nitrous oxide. | Adam Webb/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Adam Webb/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More broadly, though, set against the long history of different approaches and interpretations of nitrous, our current situation isn’t all that new. Today’s social media spectacles of nitrous use are just digitized versions of the same nitrous shows from the 1800s. Back then, some people <a href=\"https://books.google.ie/books?id=djPCfSAsHN0C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22inhaled+the+gas+and+stormed+around+the+lecture+hall%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ry2S783wwc&amp;sig=ACfU3U1-wSj-2qhXweEMYRPD8hxyuYRpAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCha-Ln7v-AhXyRkEAHZBCAEUQ6AF6BAgJEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22inhaled%20the%20gas%20and%20stormed%20around%20the%20lecture%20hall%22&amp;f=false\">believed</a> that wild behaviors while on nitrous revealed “the volatility of the democratic masses.” What might it say about our own cultural moment that recreational nitrous use is returning as a sort of performative delirium?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As far as the philosophy of nitrous goes, I imagine curious experimenters today are working with different substances, like <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/169525/psychonauts-training-psychedelics-dmt-extended-state\">extended DMT</a>. Maybe someone like Benjamin Blood will come along and make the case that we still have much to learn from nitrous. Maybe dentists will begin to read up on metaphysics and begin engaging with their woozy patients rather than dismissing their experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or, maybe nothing much will happen with nitrous. The social media hype will die down as <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/15/1067904/ai-automation-drug-development/\">new drugs</a> take its place, and it will sink back into relative obscurity, propelling rockets and numbing minor surgeries, inspiring the occasional dorm-room conversation about God and the nature of pleasure. At the very least, as its long history shows, nitrous will always remain capable of giving us a great story.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

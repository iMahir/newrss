Go on YouTube or scroll through X and that feeling gets a face. Videos claiming that someone <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tUfQQwHo8R0?feature=shared\">“silenced”</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/x_WvnOV97js?feature=shared\">“destroyed”</a> another party in a discussion about politics abound on social media. There are now nearly unavoidable clips of conservative personalities like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SXdFOubvJKo?feature=shared\">Charlie Kirk</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CyirB7dqa1M?feature=shared\">Ben Shapiro</a> arguing with college students at liberal universities or leftist commentators on their social platforms. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EEIvWNhuL8U?feature=shared\">videos</a> of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bVH_c-s9Oho?feature=shared\">random</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qn_WAD-WZEY?feature=shared\">folks</a> with polar-opposite political views sitting in a dark room arguing over hot-button issues — and often saying wildly offensive or misinformed things — are on the rise. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">She fought a good fight, but lost I fear . <a href=\"https://t.co/k7U3lOrvkl\">pic.twitter.com/k7U3lOrvkl</a></p>&mdash; Stace (@StaceDiva) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StaceDiva/status/1837572383491621001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 21, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the end of September, a YouTube video titled, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/68aej2qmCtw?feature=shared\">“Can 1 Woke Teen Survive 25 Trump Supporters”</a> went viral, drawing attention for its absurd, Battle Royale-like premise. In two weeks, it had accumulated 9.6 million views. The video sees 19-year-old liberal TikTok pundit Dean Withers (a.k.a. the “woke teen”) thrown into a lion’s den of young, zealous Trumpers eager to prove him wrong. One by one, he argues with his opponents across a table about reproductive rights and Kamala Harris’s bona fides. One <a href=\"https://x.com/StaceDiva/status/1837572383491621001\">clip</a> where he appears to stump a woman during a discussion about abortion and IUDs garnered millions of views on X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is just one of the contentious and extremely clicky scenarios explored by the media company Jubilee in its popular YouTube series “Surrounded.” The series’ setup looks like a satire of what debate has become in the age of Trump: extremely competitive, theatrical, and unbalanced (literally and emotionally) to boot. What should theoretically be an exchange of facts and logic has become the ultimate bloodsport for a certain type of “thought leader” often happy to traffic in opinions and distorted truths. These oral pugilists are more interested in some online-only version of “winning” than having meaningful discourse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the political spectrum, there has proven to be an appetite for watching people shout at each other. These on-air clashes have been the bread and butter of cable news networks like CNN and Fox News. Still, these filmed debates mostly promote the pessimistic notion that the US is too polarized to be saved. They’re frequently a front-row seat to all the misinformation, conspiracy theories, and regressive attitudes polluting the political landscape and affecting people’s daily lives. So why can’t we stop watching them?  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">In the Trump era, liberal vs. conservative face-offs are everywhere </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While this critique has certainly been amplified in the Trump era, the observation that public debate has become a circus is not exactly new. You can go back decades; in the 2000s, Jon Stewart (fairly) disparaged <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8016365/jon-stewart-crossfire\"><em>Crossfire</em></a>; in the ’90s, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> parodied the unproductive and shouty nature of political panel show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOLF_D7JVZM\"><em>The McLaughlin Group</em></a> and, later, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Hp9kYKFRh2I?feature=shared\"><em>The View</em></a>. However, in the digital age, this kind of content has been mass-produced and even more degraded. You no longer have to watch CNN or programs like <em>Real Time With Bill Maher</em> to see opposing parties talk over each other and manipulate facts. Instead, you can go to the New York Post’s website to watch two random people shout about the legitimacy of the Black Lives Matter movement in a series called <a href=\"https://nypost.com/video/why-this-black-woman-is-against-black-lives-matter/\">“Face Your Hater</a>” or watch a group of strangers argue about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nE3EQEBzc0\">traditional and modern masculinity</a> on Vice’s YouTube channel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ryan Broderick, a freelance journalist who writes the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/\">Garbage Day,</a> began noticing these viral confrontations ramping up after the Obama era, a period that saw a growing cultural backlash to progressive policies and rhetoric (i.e. the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12118872/southern-racism-tea-party-trump\">Tea Party movement</a>) and eventually culminated in Trump’s election. This was a time when liberals and moderates were encouraging each other to “reach across the aisle” and talk about politics with their Trump-supporting relatives during holidays. He describes these filmed social experiments as an “impulse from extremely naive digital media companies.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That whole style of content got really popular because there was this impulse coming out of the Obama years that we could bypass all the unpleasantness of the last 10 years if we could just talk to each other,” said Broderick. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of these videos are at least designed as slightly more benevolent attempts to see if two supposedly opposing identities can find common ground or at least engage in a civil conversation. The YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhEt049ohYg&amp;list=PLxNRGjzMwCdzo0VFIT36FA5FHJrac2hhX\">Only Human</a> has a series called “Eating With the Enemy” where two people from different backgrounds — like a drag queen and a Catholic priest, for example — share a meal while discussing political issues, like gay marriage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others, like Vice’s popular “Debate” series on YouTube, can get a little more dramatic and heated, like watching a daytime panel show or a scene from <em>Real Housewives</em>. Even with a moderator guiding the discussion, they aren&#8217;t exactly designed with the goal of finding middle ground or even having one side convince the other of their argument. Rather, they feel like useless surveys meant to convey our country’s deeply divided climate. For instance, one debate between a group of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEIvWNhuL8U\">“anti and pro feminists”</a> arguing over a slew of women’s and trans issues ends with some of the participants talking to the camera about their experiences. Ultimately, they leave more affirmed in their established beliefs than moved by other arguments. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Anti &amp; Pro Feminists Debate Abortion, Trans Rights, and #Metoo | VICE Debates\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEIvWNhuL8U?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jubilee’s “Surrounded” series feels more like a MrBeast-inspired game show in its pure stuntiness. Even the way the channel highlights the number of people debating against one another resembles his excessive model. The prompts displayed in the top corner of the videos — like “trans women are women” or “Kamala Harris is a DEI candidate”— aren’t rigorous or challenging. They feel primed to become “rage bait” clips meant to get viewers excited or angry, to the tune of millions of clicks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, this content is sort of genius in the way it attracts and satisfies a range of audiences because there’s typically someone you can agree with and believe made the better argument. For instance, someone can watch Jubilee’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WV29R1M25n8?feature=shared\">video of Charlie Kirk</a> being schooled by college students with more educated arguments and still, if they’re a fan of his, believe he won the debate. Broderick says that Jubilee, despite the pugnacious nature of their videos, inadvertently creates this sort of “feel-good centrist” content designed for everyone. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can&#8217;t fathom watching this and thinking that Charlie Kirk looks good,” says Broderick. “But from what I&#8217;ve seen of right-wingers watching this stuff, they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, he&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s making sense.’”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Online debates have become a successful way to self-brand  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Conservative pundits, in particular, have taken online debate culture to competitive and self-serving extremes. The phrase “debate me, bro” has become  largely associated with the very online and combative community of right-wing commentators, like Dinesh D’Souza and Steven Crowder — a.k.a. the guy in the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/steven-crowders-change-my-mind-campus-sign\">“change my mind” meme</a> — who are constantly challenging liberal politicians, women, or practically anyone who disagrees with them on the internet to verbally spar. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For personalities like Kirk, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson, these videos have become a promotional tool to prove their authority in the marketplace — or, more precisely, battlefield — of ideas. Given that many of them host debates or upload in-person confrontations on their media platforms, they’re able to edit or advertise themselves as outsmarting their opponents. For instance, the YouTube channel for Turning Point USA <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AeEFiJQCe_c?feature=shared\">features</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SkbzCZlFTVg?feature=shared\">videos</a> of Kirk supposedly “destroying” “arrogant” and “naive” students on liberal college campuses on his speaking tours. These videos are not actually about producing an interesting dialogue but rather humiliating their opponents and highlighting their supposed stupidity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itsdeaann/video/7385308966747639071\" data-video-id=\"7385308966747639071\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@itsdeaann\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itsdeaann?refer=embed\">@itsdeaann</a> <p>Full Rally Video Tmr, Friday the 28th at 10am PST!

Journalist Max Read, who writes the newsletter <a href=\"https://maxread.substack.com/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://maxread.substack.com/\">Read Max</a>, says that, when it comes to these chronic debaters, the line between “self-promotion and movement-building” can be very thin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can understand the idea that you&#8217;re not just boosting your own profile; you&#8217;re boosting the profile of your politics and trying to bring more people into it,” says Read. “However, I’m inclined to be more generous to YouTubers who make explanatory response videos than join debates.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dean Withers, who’s participated in several Jubilee videos, hosts livestreams on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itsdeaann?lang=en\">TikTok</a> where he debates with users about political subjects. He also posts solo responses to right-wing talking points. He says he understands people’s criticism around his debate content as clicky and unproductive. However, he says he uses these exchanges as opportunities to educate his audience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The main prerogative of my platform is to inform the people watching the debates that I have on what the issues are, why they matter, and why you should agree with me,” he says. “I know that getting my opponent to agree with me is more than likely to never occur.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For someone, like Withers — who was in middle school when Trump was elected and whose political consciousness was developed in the social-media age — debating with strangers online may just seem like an obvious approach to activism. Research has found, though, that this phenomenon may create a more toxic picture of how humans engage in political discourse. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Political boxing matches might be entertaining, but they don’t reflect how we communicate in reality</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A March <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55131-4\">study</a> found that political debates on social media often give the impression of a climate that’s more combative and divided than it actually is. Specifically, research found that Americans are more likely to argue over political topics with people they know and trust, like family and friends, than strangers on the internet, and often leave these interactions with positive feelings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">University of California Berkeley professor Erica Bailey, who co-authored the study, says these intense, Jubilee-like debates “almost never happen in real life.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“While these debates can seem ubiquitous because we&#8217;re constantly being fed them through our screens, my research has found that the typical American debates hot-button issues infrequently,” she says. “Of the most common topics, like vaccines, reproductive rights, and policing, only about half of Americans have debated these topics in the last year.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the rare occasion that you may be forced to defend a political stance, it can still be a pretty daunting task and cause feelings of anxiety. This seems to be one of the reasons we can’t stop watching these videos. On the whole, these exchanges seem generally unpleasant, but it can provide a sense of relief to watch an expert — or someone who claims to be an expert — confidently expressing their opinions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When you engage in debate, you often find out all the ways in which your knowledge and understanding is incomplete,” says Bailey. “Watching debate videos is cathartic because we get to cosplay as an excellent debater who can articulate our position with ease. It also helps that these clips are certainly edited to show us the most persuasive moment of the exchange.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Humans also just tend to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345698319_Emotion_and_Virality_What_Makes_Online_Content_Go_Viral\">engage more</a> with content that elicits a strong emotional response. It’s one of the reasons even the most obvious “rage bait” is hard to avoid on social media, whether you&#8217;re the type of person who would ordinarily click on it or not. This behavior, plus algorithms that boost this sort of controversial content, has created a cycle of doom content we can’t escape. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While content like Jubilee’s abounds, the staginess and over-produced structure of these videos underlie a comforting truth: This level of antagonism surrounding political discourse may be clicky but it is thankfully not natural. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> “It might be surprising given the state of polarization,” says Bailey. “But humans are typically wired toward social cohesion. In the end, we really don’t want to fight; we want to belong. ” </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

No more, “Bro, that movie’s so dumb, it’s [r-word],” no more, “Don’t be stupid, why are you acting like such a [r-word]?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the internet, commentators had their doubts that the movement would succeed, or even that it was worthwhile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Surely, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021103896_2.html?sid=ST2010021403772\">detractors</a> <a href=\"https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/r_word.html\">argued</a>, we had seen this dance before, with words like “idiot” and “moron” and “stupid.”&nbsp;All of them were originally developed as clinical terms for people with intellectual disorders, and they all eventually became insults as the wider public picked up on them, in a process variously called <a href=\"https://becauselanguage.com/39-is-this-a-reference/\">the euphemism cycle</a> or the <a href=\"https://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf\">euphemism treadmill</a>. “Idiot” and its ilk emerged in an era that lacked <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24098830/holy-shit-brief-history-profanity-melissa-mohr-what-the-f-benjamin-bergen-praise-michael-adams\">our current moment’s sensitivity over slurs</a>, so they hadn’t experienced the same boycott campaign that the r-word was facing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if the r-word was banished, wouldn’t new pejoratives simply replace it? “If interest groups want to pour resources into cleaning up unintentional insults, more power to them,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021103896_2.html?sid=ST2010021403772\">allowed a Washington Post column in 2010</a>. “But we must not let ‘retard’ go without a requiem. If the goal is to protect intellectually disabled individuals from put-downs and prejudice, it won&#8217;t succeed. New words of insult will replace old ones.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>All of them were originally developed as clinical terms for people with intellectual disorders, and they all eventually became insults</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet apparently against the odds, the campaign worked. Over the past decade, bit by bit, the r-word more or less vanished. (To a certain extent, though, the expected also occurred, as other euphemisms did in fact emerge. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/28/trump-harris-attacks-mentally-impaired-criticism/\">Donald Trump has lately taken to contending</a>, just on the edge of a slur, that he thinks Kamala Harris might be “mentally disabled.”)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until the past year or so, that is, when the r-word appeared to be trending back up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Posts <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/r-word-social-media\">using the word</a> have racked up tens of thousands of likes, bookmarks, and reposts on X in the last year. Edgelord comedians have started to use the word in their sets. “I know I said ‘retarded’ there a couple times. My bad on that,” said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce9_jwots-w\">comic Shane Gillis in a recent set</a> as he introduced a joke about his uncle’s Down Syndrome. On FX’s new sitcom <em>The English Teacher</em>, teachers muse about how “the kids are not into being woke” anymore and “they’re saying the r-word again.” It’s become a bipartisan slur, available to anyone on the right or the left or in between <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/373990/heterodoxy-anti-woke-libertarian-tech-bro\">who wants to show off their iconoclasm</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This summer I started hearing it right after the Democratic convention,” says Katy Neas, CEO at The Arc, a disability rights advocacy group. “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/tim-walz-gus-walz-neurodivergence/\">Governor Walz’s son</a> [who has neurodivergence] appeared, and I saw people being comfortable in using it on social media.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Andrea Cahn, vice president at Special Olympics Unified Champion Schools who helped <a href=\"https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/news/spread-the-word-inclusion\">lead the 2009 campaign against the r-word</a>, says she’s seen steadily increasing attention to the old parts of the Special Olympics website that used to promote their anti r-word campaigns. “Last year, people started asking for it because they were saying that they needed to reconnect with that messaging,” says Cahn. “So we promoted those pages, and traffic to the website went up by 200 or 300 percent or something like that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to say for sure that usage of the r-word is increasing. The use of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24098830/holy-shit-brief-history-profanity-melissa-mohr-what-the-f-benjamin-bergen-praise-michael-adams\">swear words across time is notoriously hard to track</a>. But it does at the very least look as though for some demographics, the r-word has become trendy in a way that it wasn’t a few short years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s how the r-word fell out of usage and why it seems to be coming back now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Running on the euphemism treadmill</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the ways you can tell when a group is particularly marginalized is that the words we use to describe them come to seem humiliating and dehumanizing, even when they’re not intended to be. We can track this process very neatly when it comes to people with intellectual disabilities by observing the name changes of a group now known as the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_1820#:~:text=The%20name%20was%20changed%20again,American%20Association%20on%20Intellectual%20and\">American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</a> (AAIDD).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the AAIDD was founded in 1876, its name was the Association of Medical Officers of American Institutions for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Persons. In 1910, it became the American Association for the Study of the Feebleminded. By 1933, it was the American Association on Mental Deficiency. In 1957, the American Association on Mental Retardation. Finally, in 2007, it became the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Idiot” and “feeble-minded” were legitimate medical diagnoses in their day. So, too, was “mentally retarded.” Over time, though, they all became words that laypeople were happy to throw around as insults, which in turn meant that as medical terminology, they came to feel humiliating to the people they were supposed to help. In order to do their work, the words had to shift. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This kind of shifting of meaning was called <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087798\">the euphemism cycle by linguist Sharon Henderson Taylor in 1974</a>, and later renamed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/opinion/the-game-of-the-name.html\">euphemism treadmill by psycholinguist Stephen Pinker in 1994</a>. “Euphemisms denoting low intelligence seem particularly susceptible to the sort of pejoration that the word ‘retarded’ is undergoing,” observed Taylor in her paper “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087798\">Terms for Low Intelligence</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The r-word started to fall out of official usage in the last decades of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st. In 2010, <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/11/2017-14343/rosas-law\">Barack Obama signed into effect Rosa’s Law</a>, which removed the words “mental retardation” from federal law and replaced them with the words “intellectual disability” or “intellectual disabilities.” <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145120/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704865104575588273153838564\">Multiple states followed suit</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>By 2018, so many students had signed a pledge not to use the r-word as part of “Spread the Word” that the campaign was basically over</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the r-word faded out of official language, activists began to turn their attention to more casual use. Cahn says the 2007 film <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, which prominently features <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WHBO_Qc-Q\">a joke about actors “going full retard,”</a> was a major impetus for Special Olympics to launch their “Spread the Word to End the Word” campaign to eradicate the r-word once and for all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;“We had some youth advocates that were really vocal about the harm and the insult that it was — people with intellectual disabilities, athletes of Special Olympics, and a lot of our young people that were involved in Unified Sports in schools,” says Cahn. “We had a fairly concerted campaign around <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, and that really galvanized our population.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By 2018, so many students had signed a pledge not to use the r-word as part of “Spread the Word” that the campaign was basically over. “Our school participants were asking, ‘What’s next?’” says Cahn. The Special Olympics team decided to expand to “focus on a larger, broader inclusion message” focused less on teaching kids about the r-word specifically. After all, they already knew.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or, at least, they used to. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/r-word.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.060057723875,100,79.879884552251\" alt=\"Student protesters on the City Hall steps hold hand-lettered signs that read “Respect is the new r-word.”\" title=\"Student protesters on the City Hall steps hold hand-lettered signs that read “Respect is the new r-word.”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Special education students rally on the City Hall steps in San Francisco, California, in March 2017 to discourage the use of the r-word. | San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images \" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the r-word came back</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to say why the r-word is suddenly so much more visible now than it was a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One reason might be that influencers have far more reach now, and they experience less incentive to avoid insulting parts of their audience than traditional celebrities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;“Perhaps it has to do with the fact that the more traditional celebrity is more aware of the feedback or more concerned about a feedback loop that could happen,” Cahn says. “Whereas, for the more individual influencer, they have less at stake when being outrageous.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, for some online personalities, being outrageous is the whole point. Linguist Caitlin Green points out that the r-word has become a convenient marker of edgy identity among conservatives online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What you&#8217;re doing when you use a slur is you&#8217;re telling the people in your audience, ‘This is the kind of person I am, and this is the kind of attitude I have toward the normies that don&#8217;t use that word,’” says Green. “You get the right-wingers using it because they&#8217;re anti-woke and not using the slur is <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Locals\">local</a>, right?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Linguist Christopher Hom notes that the heroes of the online right are those with the loudest voices when it comes to mocking those with disabilities, if not outright using the r-word. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/3/1/14772908/trump-disability-fda-megan-crowley\">Trump infamously mocked journalists with disabilities</a> <em>twice</em> in 2015 during his successful campaign for the presidency. “That really sends a signal about what&#8217;s acceptable and about how our social norms can change,” says Hom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who has <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-under-fire-for-using-anti-disability-slur-on-x\">publicly used the r-word</a> to taunt his critics online, has chosen to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1142399312/twitter-trust-and-safety-council-elon-musk\">remove the old Twitter safeguards against hate speech</a> since he purchased the site in 2022. Under Musk’s reign, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/25/1239549276/elon-musk-lawsuit-hate-speech-researchers\">the r-word has been free to spread and flourish</a> on what is now known as X.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It creates this cycle where you see that the word is allowed, so then others feel like they can use it,” says Hom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The r-word seems to be particularly appealing for <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/03/elon-musk-racist-tweets-science-video/\">Musk and others in the Silicon Valley right </a>who are preoccupied with racist pseudoscience around <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/race-science-far-right-charlie-kirk/679527/\">whether some races have higher IQs than others.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That ideology is pretty closely connected with the tendency to go for a mental disability over another kind of slur,” says Green. If a central part of your worldview is the reprehensible idea that some races are physically and mentally superior, ableism becomes especially important: You prove that one race is better than another by making the claim that it’s less likely to experience disabilities and that people who experience disabilities are less than human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“It creates this cycle where you see that the word is allowed, so then others feel like they can use it”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The r-word can also be attractive to people who identify as leftists and want to make a point that they’re cooler than mainstream liberals. “A lot of them are trying to claim this position that&#8217;s actually kind of a balancing act to maintain,” says Green, “which is ‘Yes, I&#8217;m on the left, but I&#8217;m not one of those crazy, screechy lefty people. I&#8217;m cool. I&#8217;m willing to use slurs.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The resurgence of the r-word could also be seen as a sign that mainstream culture has gotten less censorious in the post-pandemic 2020s than it was during the more progressive 2010s. “People are just being less sensitive,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18mz8jk/whats_with_the_resurgence_of_the_rslur/\">said one poster on Reddit</a> during a conversation earlier this year about why the r-word has returned. “For most of the 2010&#8217;s the attitude was not offending anybody and walking on eggshells. Now it seems to be shifting to ‘Just don&#8217;t be an asshole and if you are here&#8217;s the hardline’ and the word ‘Retard&#8217; isn&#8217;t on that line.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why people think ableism is just not that bad&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ableism is frequently the prejudice that doesn’t quite make it to the hardline. “Ableism is an easy one to ridicule as a concept,” says Green. “We have these discourses that come up every once in a while on social media, where someone will be like, ‘<a href=\"https://themighty.com/topic/disability/imani-barbarin-ableist-backlash-doorddash-delivery/\">Telling me not to use DoorDash is ableist</a>,’ or like, ‘Telling me I have to smile when I’m at my customer service job is ableist.’ And then everybody piles on them, and they&#8217;re like, ‘Oh my god, these online woke people, they&#8217;re out of control.’”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Ableism is the vector” that leads to stern think pieces about how wokeness has gone too far, Green adds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People may overlook the discrimination disabled people face if they compare it to other prejudices that run rampant in the US. Hom cites the <a href=\"https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime\">FBI’s hate crime report</a>, which shows 28 incidents of violence against those with mental disabilities over the past year, as opposed to over 1,000 incidents against Black people and Jewish people combined. But violent crime against people with disabilities is still disproportionately high, <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/capd0919st.pdf\">and in 2021, the Department of Justice reported that it was rising</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“But if you look at the other factors,” Hom continues, “the kind of boring factors that are really significant about quality of life, the ability to have a dignified life, to be able to have self-determination, it&#8217;s really bad actually. The numbers are quite shocking.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.prb.org/articles/u-s-adults-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-are-living-longer-but-covid-threatens-to-erase-recent-gains/\">People with intellectual disabilities live 12 years less</a> than other adults on average. For those with Down Syndrome, it’s 18 years less, and for those with cerebral palsy, it’s 23 years less. People with intellectual disabilities are more likely to develop <a href=\"https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/23-1/people-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-growing-old-an-overview\">chronic health conditions</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21200257/disabilities-coronavirus-group-homes-isolation-policy\">die of Covid-19</a>. During the height of the pandemic, some states adopted the policy that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21200257/disabilities-coronavirus-group-homes-isolation-policy\">ventilators should be preferentially saved</a> for those without disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To state plainly a thing most people sort of already know: Our society <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/352245/caregiving-intellectual-disability-developmental-adult-autism-down-syndrome\">is not set up well for people with disabilities.</a> It is very difficult and very expensive to live a good life as a disabled person in the US. Despite those facts, it seems to be very easy for many people to think of ableism as the kind of prejudice that doesn’t really count and the r-word as not a real slur.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jason Rogers, 32, has been involved in Special Olympics for years. As a teenager, he competed in swimming, which he says is his all-time favorite sport, and also practiced track and field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It seems to be very easy to think of ableism as the kind of prejudice that doesn’t really count and the r-word as not a real slur</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, Rogers is the coordinator of workplace readiness and inclusion on the leadership and organizational development team at Special Olympics International. He’s also community liaison for the Down Syndrome Community of Greater Chattanooga. Last summer, a stranger called him the r-word at a memorial service for a recently deceased family member.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Think before you say something,” says Rogers. “Don’t say something you regret. We take the r-word very seriously in the Down community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite this seriousness, the r-word’s defenders protest that replacing it will be useless and that a new slur is certain to come along before too long. It’s a popular position to take. It’s popular even though the reason we keep having to replace medical terminology for people with intellectual disabilities is because we transfigure those words into a deeply humiliating insult, and we do that because our society is designed to treat people with disabilities with contempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Ableism is what is fueling the euphemistic treadmill,” says Hom. “I take this as evidence that ableism really is pretty significant in our culture.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Sent twice a week.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the popular framing of mental illnesses as being fundamentally caused by <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychiatrys-new-brain-mind-and-legend-chemical-imbalance\">electrochemical imbalances</a> in the brain, <a href=\"https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/01/psychiatrys-grand-confession/\">a pile of evidence decades in the making suggests the truth is much more complicated</a>. It’s the biggest open secret in neuroscience — psychiatric medications often don’t work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If drugs that alter chemical signaling in the brain are capable of silencing auditory hallucinations and suicidal thoughts, then brain chemistry must somehow explain mental illness, at least in part. But while medications like antidepressants and antipsychotics make many people feel a lot better, they make just as many — or more — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/2/25/16997572/causes-depression-pills-prozac-social-environmental-connections-hari\">feel the same or even worse</a>. (Prescribing the right meds for the right condition is mostly a guess, and the wrong match can accidentally shoot someone into a manic episode, for example.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The brain is one of the most complex machines in the universe, made up of 86 billion cells connected by<a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy\"> 100 trillion synapses</a>. To give you a sense of just how complicated that is, it took over four years for neuroscientists to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03190-y\">build a map of a single fruit fly’s brain</a>, which only contains about 0.00003% of the neurons in a human brain — and as much of a scientific achievement as that was, it doesn’t even come close to fully explaining a fly’s behavior. Try scaling that project up by several orders of magnitude, and the prospect of fully understanding human brain chemistry looks downright impossible. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It could be that neuroscience simply hasn’t had enough time to develop truly effective mental health therapies for most conditions. It’s a relatively young field, and scientists have only been able to get a good look at living brain activity for a few decades. The breakthrough psychiatry needs could be right around the corner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s also possible that some of the best mental health care lies outside Western psychiatry altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maybe two things can be true at once.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Psychiatrists no longer think chemical imbalances cause mental illness. Why do we?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For thousands of years, mental illness could only be explained by <a href=\"https://bcmj.org/mds-be/historical-perspectives-theories-diagnosis-and-treatment-mental-illness\">supernatural forces or moral deviance</a>. In Enlightenment-era Europe and its colonized territories, people with psychiatric disorders were largely <a href=\"https://ehne.fr/en/encyclopedia/themes/political-europe/control-and-discipline/psychiatric-institutions-in-europe-nineteenth-and-twentieth-century\">confined to asylums</a> — later rebranded as “psychiatric hospitals” — up <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/special/excerpt.html\">until the 1950s</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the early 20th century, Sigmund Freud and his peers popularized <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/psychoanalytic-therapy\">psychotherapy</a>, which helped (<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy\">and continues to help</a>) people navigate disorders like depression and anxiety. But physicians at asylums were initially <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/03/asylums#:~:text=Psychotherapy%20emerges,lay%20behind%20mental%20health%20problems.\">hesitant to adopt it</a>, preferring a “somatic” approach to mental health care that involved stimulating the body and the nervous system to alter the mind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Leading doctors once believed that disorders like schizophrenia were caused by an <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/jonmd/citation/1942/01000/Pharmacologic_Aspects_of_Shock_Therapy.3.aspx\">underactive “vegetative” nervous system</a>, an old term for the parts of the brain that control basic life-sustaining functions like digestion and breathing. Early psychiatric treatments were designed to send a big enough shock to the brain — whether with <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032700003670?via%3Dihub\">electricity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670443/\">an intentional malaria infection</a>, or<a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.89.1.143\"> coma-inducing drugs</a> — to kickstart these supposedly underactive processes. Psychiatrists who invented malaria treatment — using the malaria virus to induce a high fever, hopefully killing neurosyphilis-causing bacteria — and the prefrontal lobotomy <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670443/\">both won the Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> while asylums were still the norm in Europe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over time, however, physicians began to acknowledge that their somatic treatments weren’t working very well. That, combined with the observation that mentally ill brains didn’t seem to have anything visibly wrong with them when autopsied, began to drive physical treatments out of fashion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everything changed in 1952, when Parisian surgeon Henri Laborit <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dh52dr.html\">accidentally discovered that chlorpromazine</a>, an antihistamine he used to make anesthesia less dangerous for his patients, was also a powerful antipsychotic. When chlorpromazine entered the market in 1954, it <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2021.1.7\">changed psychiatry</a> like the <a href=\"https://diabetes.org/blog/history-wonderful-thing-we-call-insulin\">discovery of insulin</a> changed diabetes. Suddenly, people who had been chronically restrained in mental hospitals could have calm conversations with their psychiatrists. Within a year, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/special/excerpt.html\">public psychiatric hospitals in the US began closing</a> as policymakers hoped that new drugs would render institutionalization obsolete.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For years, no one knew how drugs like chlorpromazine worked, only that they did, albeit with unpleasant <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18811-chlorpromazine-tablets\">side effects</a> like drowsiness, weight gain, and uncontrollable muscle spasms. Neuroscientists later figured out that antipsychotics like chlorpromazine bind to a certain type of dopamine receptor in the brain, flagging <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24159087/what-is-dopamine-hacking-fasting-does-it-work-science\">the neurochemical dopamine</a> — specifically, having too much of it — as the biological root of schizophrenia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea that a chemical imbalance could change someone’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors quickly spread throughout psychiatry. <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a> (SSRIs) like Prozac, widely used antidepressants <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19442174/#:~:text=The%20clinical%20introduction%20of%20fluoxetine,for%20new%20families%20of%20antidepressants.\">introduced in the 1980s</a>, block neurons from reabsorbing leftover serotonin after a chemical signal is sent. Theoretically, if a lack of serotonin contributes to depression, keeping more serotonin molecules available should make people happier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">About <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK361016/\">half of people who take SSRIs</a> feel better after a couple of months. However, antidepressant researcher Alan Frazer <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/01/23/145525853/when-it-comes-to-depression-serotonin-isnt-the-whole-story/\">told NPR</a>, “I don’t think there’s any convincing body of data that anybody has ever found that depression is associated to a significant extent with a loss of serotonin.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pinning schizophrenia simply on dopamine is similarly oversimplified and old-fashioned. Today, researchers believe that many neurotransmitters — on top of other genetic, social, and environmental factors — affect the likelihood that someone experiences mental illness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even though dopamine- and serotonin-related self-help videos keep making the rounds on TikTok, neuroscientists and psychiatrists <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again\">have been vocally skeptical</a> of the “chemical imbalance” trope for decades. Electrochemical interactions, to the extent that scientists are capable of understanding them, can’t fully explain — or more importantly, treat — mental illness. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The future of mental health doesn’t belong only to neuroscience</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thinking of mental illness as something that medication can solve provides people “a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles,” sociology professor <a href=\"https://iasculture.org/scholars/profiles/davis\">Joseph Davis</a> wrote for <a href=\"https://psyche.co/ideas/lets-avoid-talk-of-chemical-imbalance-its-people-in-distress\">Psyche</a>. If a person claims their mental illness as a disease beyond their control, like cancer, then <a href=\"https://medium.com/@stefkaufman/visions-for-a-liberated-anti-carceral-crisis-response-c81791459a99\">others may be more likely to view them as humans</a> worthy of respect and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two weeks ago, the US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/health/fda-schizophrenia-drug.html\">approved a new antipsychotic drug</a> that doesn’t target dopamine receptors — the first since chlorpromazine was first introduced. The new medicine, called Cobenfy, targets acetylcholine instead, a neurotransmitter that notably isn’t dopamine, but can affects dopamine levels indirectly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that Cobenfy is the first new option presented in 70 years was enough to make headlines. But&nbsp;whether it actually works better than existing options remains to be seen: None of the drug’s three clinical trials ran long enough to tell whether Cobenfy will cause the same long-term side effects — dramatic weight gain, repetitive body movements — as its predecessors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The introduction of Cobenfy captures a lot of what’s troubling — and what’s hopeful — about the role of neuroscience in treating mental illness. Sure, a new pharmaceutical treatment may relieve the worst symptoms of schizophrenia with fewer side effects than before. But introducing a new drug can’t eliminate the condition altogether or fundamentally shift how people navigate psychosis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latter strategy — radically reconsidering how communities care for people with even the most severe mental illnesses — is <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia\">recommended by the World Health Organization</a>. In many cultures, mental health problems <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23402638/mental-health-psychiatrist-shortage-community-care-africa\">are not considered biomedical problems</a>, so people generally don’t seek things like medication. Community-based mental health care, where lightly-trained laypeople facilitate therapy sessions in their own neighborhoods, can work as well as formal psychiatric care in many settings, with or without medication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While community-based models are often discussed in the context of non-psychotic mental illnesses like depression, options beyond psychiatry can <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/magazine/antipsychotic-medications-mental-health.html\">help people experiencing more severe psychosis</a>, too. Anti-carceral care strategist and crisis responder <a href=\"https://medium.com/@stefkaufman/visions-for-a-liberated-anti-carceral-crisis-response-c81791459a99\">Stefanie Kaufman-Mthimkhulu believes</a> that whether the root cause of psychosis is ultimately ancestral spirits, childhood trauma, post-viral inflammation, or a delicate shift in neurochemistry, “it is critical to offer people multiple ways to define and make sense of our experiences.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neuroscience can only take us so far. At some point, our willingness to find value in mental states beyond our own has to take over.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

A <a href=\"http://worldwildlife.org/livingplanetreport\">new report</a> by two of the world’s leading environmental groups reveals that the average size of wildlife populations worldwide has shrunk dramatically, by what the report calls a “catastrophic” 73 percent in the last 50 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Living Planet Report, published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), found that creatures living in rivers and lakes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/amazon-river-dolphin\">Amazon river dolphin</a>, have experienced the most severe declines. Populations of these freshwater species have declined by an average of 85 percent, according to the Living Planet Index (LPI), a tool for measuring wildlife populations on which the report is based. Across the animal kingdom, meanwhile, wildlife populations are vanishing fastest in Latin America and the Caribbean — part of the globe that’s home to a tremendous diversity of life. The research does not include invertebrates such as insects and snails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Losing wild animals isn’t good for anyone. Bats eat insect pests and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/370002/bats-link-babies-death-study-white-nose-syndrome\">lower the use of pesticides</a>, yet many of them are imperiled. Parrotfish, which have declined in some regions, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/375178/parrotfish-algae-coral-reef-climate-change\">can improve the health of coral reefs</a> that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/366763/bonaire-coral-reef-caribbean-climate-change\">safeguard coastal communities</a>. All kinds of birds and mammals help pollinate plants and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22877262/seeds-plants-animals-climate-migration\">spread seeds</a> throughout the forest, sustaining forests and the rainfall they generate; many of them are vanishing, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is not just about wildlife,” Daudi Sumba, WWF International’s chief conservation officer, said on a press call Monday unveiling the report. “It’s about the essential ecosystems that sustain human life.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/LPI-screenshot.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.7625964082644,100,82.474807183471\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new report is an alarming status check on the state of our planet, and the headline numbers it reveals will likely be cited in countless news and government reports. The Living Planet Index is one of the key metrics used to track global progress in efforts to conserve the environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But … is it accurate?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coming up with simple figures to describe the state of the world’s wildlife is inherently difficult, but more than half a dozen scientists told me that the methods used to calculate the index may cause it to overstate wildlife declines, and perhaps significantly so. Some even called it misleading. One researcher voiced concerns that if leading environmental groups exaggerate wildlife declines, it could ultimately erode trust among the public, making action on a very real crisis that much harder to achieve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While there’s no question that biodiversity is in decline, growing criticism of WWF’s estimation casts doubt on the scale of loss —&nbsp;or at least on science’s ability to accurately measure it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Scientists have poked holes in WWF’s key figure</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before digging into the report, it’s important to reiterate: There is indeed a crisis of biodiversity loss. This is unequivocal. Coral reefs are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change\">overheating</a> and dying en masse. North America has lost some <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1313\">3 billion birds</a>.<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me/371434/insect-apocalypse-bees-decline-loss\"> Insects are indeed vanishing</a>. The rate of extinction is <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/decline-and-extinction/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20extinction%20rate%20is,are%20being%20degraded%20or%20lost.\">accelerating</a>. In Hawaii, which has been called the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/12/14/23990382/extinction-capital-hawaii-endangered-species-act\">extinction capital of the world</a>, entire species of birds — and all the cultural heritage they carry — are blinking out as I write this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new WWF report underscores this frightening trend. We are living in a time of profound biodiversity loss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Calculating a single figure to encompass all of this loss isn’t easy. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and counting animals year after year is difficult and time-consuming. “Generating a single estimate for all species in all locations is extremely challenging,” said <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/laura-melissa-guzman/\">Laura Melissa Guzman</a>, a quantitative biologist at the University of Southern California. “I don’t think we have reached consensus as a scientific community of what is the best way to do that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">WWF’s approach relies on something called the Living Planet Index, which is produced by ZSL. It measures the average change in animal populations worldwide since 1970. To come up with the global LPI, scientists first calculate how individual populations of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish have changed, as I <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2022/10/12/23399105/biodiversity-loss-wwf-living-planet-index\">wrote in 2022</a>, when WWF published its previous installment. A population of, say, 1,000 manatees that has lost 500 has decreased by 50 percent. The same is true for a population of 10 that has lost just five. Then they average up all of those changes, be they increases or decreases, to produce one number. That means the index is an average of changes in population sizes, not the average of the number of creatures lost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is confusing. In the past, many media stories <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2022/10/12/23399105/biodiversity-loss-wwf-living-planet-index\">misinterpreted figures</a> from the index and reported that Earth lost more than two-thirds of its wildlife in the last 50 years. That’s wrong. The headline number —&nbsp;two-thirds, or in the case of the new report, 73 percent —&nbsp;refers to the average decline of thousands of different animal populations, not the total number of animals.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-453767238-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.834813777373,100,78.330372445255\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Populations of Chinstrap Penguins in Antarctica have declined, on average, by over 60 percent since 1980, according to the new report. | Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But a more fundamental issue than bad headlines is that the index — the basis of the new report — is not calculated correctly, according to a team of researchers at the Center for Theoretical Study in the Czech Republic, a joint institution of Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, they published <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49070-x\">a paper</a> in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em> that pointed out what they considered mathematical flaws in the LPI. Those flaws, the authors claim, bias the index and cause it to exaggerate the decline of wildlife.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The study takes issue with a number of things, including the math used to calculate the index and how ZSL handles poor-quality population data. That lower quality data includes population trends —&nbsp;ups and downs in the number of animals —&nbsp;based on counts from only a few points in time. For a <a href=\"https://communities.springernature.com/posts/the-living-planet-index-is-not-a-reliable-measure-of-population-changes\">variety of complicated reasons</a>, the authors say, ZSL’s choices in how to calculate the index bias the data toward declines. In reality, declines and increases are more balanced, they say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One example relates to sampling errors, cases when scientists don’t accurately report the number of animals in a wildlife population, perhaps because they’re hard to spot. If the population is small to begin with, accidentally counting fewer animals has a more dramatic, negative effect on the population trend than accidentally counting more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m really convinced that the decline of vertebrate populations is not as serious as the LPI says,” David Storch, a study coauthor and researcher at the Center for Theoretical Study, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several scientists who were not involved in the <em>Nature Communications</em> study told Vox that the concerns the article raises are valid and that biases embedded in the calculation may indeed exaggerate wildlife declines. <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/rodolfo-dirzo\">Rodolfo Dirzo</a>, a biodiversity researcher at Stanford University who reviewed the new report, said that while the scale of wildlife population declines is extreme, it’s likely smaller than what the WWF report suggests due to how the LPI was calculated. (Disclosure: Dirzo was one of my advisers in graduate school.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Given the broad adoption of the LPI in global biodiversity policy arena, the kind of comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the LPI that Tószögyová and colleagues performed is long overdue,” <a href=\"https://www.natureserve.org/whos-who/staff/292\">Bruce Young</a>, chief scientist at NatureServe, a nonprofit wildlife data organization, said in an email. “I was always nervous about the certainty with which the LPI authors presented their results.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although an early version of the <em>Nature Communications</em> study was available in 2023, WWF did not tweak how the LPI is calculated in response to the paper. Storch believes there’s an incentive to keep the index as is. It’s not so much a scientific tool, he said, but a tool to raise awareness of the biodiversity crisis — and raise money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I see these indices more as a communication tool,” said Rahel Sollmann, a quantitative ecologist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife in Berlin, who was not involved in the new report or the <em>Nature Communications</em> study. “I wouldn’t put too much trust into its actual numerical value.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/freshwater-screenshot.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.880051767751,100,78.239896464498\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The Living Planet Index for freshwater animals including fish. | WWF/ZSL\" data-portal-copyright=\"WWF/ZSL\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I posed these criticisms to WWF and scientists at ZSL. <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/about-zsl/our-people/dr-robin-freeman\">Robin Freeman</a>, a scientist at ZSL who was involved in the LPI analysis, said he doesn’t agree that biases overestimate the measure of wildlife declines.&nbsp;Changing the way ZSL calculates the index to remove what some researchers see as statistical biases would have consequences of its own, he said. Freeman <a href=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2887653/v1\">argues</a> that removing less detailed or more error-prone data from the calculation — much of which is from poorer regions in the tropics where there’s less research — could fail to capture the full picture of wildlife declines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Louse McRae, another ZSL scientist who also works on the index, added that it’s also possible that the LPI actually underestimates the scale of declines. That’s because the index tends to include more population data from birds and mammals, well-studied groups that are typically declining less than, say, reptiles and amphibians, she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We do an awful lot of work to test the datasets, test the impact of outliers and extreme shifts in population,” <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/about-zsl/our-people/andrew-terry\">Andrew Terry</a>, ZSL’s director of conservation and policy, said in a Monday press briefing. Speaking about the index, he said ZSL remains “confident in its robustness.” (ZSL also published a <a href=\"https://www.livingplanetindex.org/documents/LPR2024_Technical_Supplement.pdf\">technical document</a> alongside the new report that details its testing.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A spokesperson for WWF, Amy Fallah, said the main purpose of the Living Planet Report “is to raise awareness about the scale of environmental challenges facing our planet and drive urgent action that prioritizes nature in global decision-making.” That’s why the group published it ahead of COP16, a major UN biodiversity conference, where environmental leaders will meet to hash out plans for conserving nature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The LPR’s central aim has always been to inform and influence policy decisions that put nature at the heart of solutions to the challenges our planet faces,” Fallah said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>We know wildlife is declining. Does it matter if it’s exaggerated?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes and no. If the leading research and advocacy groups, such as WWF, are seen to overstate the problem, the public could lose the sense of urgency and may be less likely to lend support for what is a very real problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s a real risk to overstating the magnitude of the biodiversity crisis,” Young of NatureServe told me. “The public could get the impression that the conservation community is prone to exaggeration and therefore calls for action to reduce wildlife loss could go unanswered.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Young also mentioned that the “<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01285-z\">extinction denier</a>” community — comprising people who deny that we’re living through a sixth mass extinction fueled by humans — feeds off examples, real or not, that show that wildlife is doing better than we thought. That makes it ever more important for measures of biodiversity loss to capture examples of successful conservation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then again, we’re just talking about shades of decline — whether the biodiversity crisis is really, really bad, or really, really, <em>really </em>bad. Regardless of how precise the LPI is, it portrays a trend of profound nature loss that no serious scientist disputes. “The report has been useful in bringing attention to the fact that there is a significant decline in populations of many species of vertebrates,” Dirzo said.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-549037541.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7813932477765,100,80.437213504447\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The number of hawskbill sea turtles in northeastern Australia has fallen precipitously in recent decades. | Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the figure ultimately serves as a communication tool, it’s an effective one, judging by how widely the LPI is reported and cited. “Our goal is to use it as a tool for raising awareness about the dual crises of nature loss and climate change and urging the public and private sector to take action,” Fallah said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And to be clear: Communication really matters. The decline of wildlife remains a somewhat fringe issue with <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/publications/2023/public-views-climate-change-biodiversity-loss.pdf\">low public awareness</a>, even compared to other environmental concerns like climate change. This in itself is alarming, considering the sheer scale of the problem and how it impacts us all. We are talking about the ongoing collapse of ecosystems with immeasurable spiritual and cultural worth that provide human communities with clean water, healthy food, and other basic needs. They are irreplaceable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If WWF’s new report — and the LPI index — can help communicate the problem, that ultimately seems useful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It shows us that we’re still not doing enough,” said <a href=\"https://www.ecolabunam.com/gceballos\">Gerardo Ceballos</a>, an ecologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). “The most important thing to understand is that unless we can save biodiversity there’s no way we can save humanity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People have accused me and other people of being alarmists,” Ceballos told me. “We are alarmists because we are alarmed.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The brothers were convicted in 1996 of murdering their wealthy parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, seven years earlier in a gruesome double homicide, when Lyle was 21 and Erik just 18. Their trials unfolded amid a tabloid media frenzy that emphasized the brothers’ presumed greed and sociopathy while mocking the decades of emotional and sexual abuse they claim to have experienced at the hands of their father. Despite overwhelming witness testimony presented in their first trials that they were telling the truth about their abuse, they were each ultimately sentenced to life without parole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/374720/menendez-brothers-abuse-claims-real-monsters-netflix-drama\">Netflix’s recent Ryan Murphy docudrama, <em>Monsters</em></a>, takes a frank look at the brothers’ allegations of abuse, but it doesn’t do them any favors either, buying into the possibility that the pair made the whole thing up for sympathy and even implying an unfounded incestuous relationship between them. So it makes sense that in order to balance out those rather jarring claims, Netflix also recently launched a documentary film, simply titled <em>The Menendez Brothers</em>, that backs the abuse claims with an impressive number of first- and secondhand sources — including the brothers themselves, who appear via recorded phone calls from prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several members of the Menendez family appear on the documentary with stories of the abuse the brothers suffered from their father, including Joan Vander Molen, Kitty Menendez’s sister, and Diane Vander Molen, a cousin of Lyle and Erik.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Diane spent most of her summers growing up with the Menendez family and has never deviated from <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/lyle-erik-menendezs-cousin-testified-sexual-abuse-speaks/story?id=44420173\">the story she testified to</a> at the brothers’ first trials — that Lyle had told her about their father’s sexual abuse when he was just 8 years old. Her testimony also implicated Kitty Menendez, who, she alleged, knew about Lyle’s claims and either disbelieved them or chose to ignore them. After that, the brothers have said the alleged abuse went on for years after that, with the brothers claiming that their father’s sexual abuse of Erik continued into Erik’s adulthood, with Lyle learning that his brother was still being abused just days before the murders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Multiple Menendez family members recalled several chilling stories of abuse, but one about a trust fall gone wrong in Lyle’s childhood, the first story Diane Vander Molen relates in the documentary, seems particularly revealing as a glimpse into the lives the brothers lived.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“One time Jose put Lyle on a kitchen counter and prompted Lyle to jump off, and he was going to catch him. As Lyle did so, Jose backed off and let him fall to the ground, telling him that you can never trust anybody.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taken as an isolated example, we might consider this an anecdote of a cruel prank played on an innocent child. But in the context of everything we know about Jose Menendez and his children, it becomes much more significant. It’s a simple but revealing look at a man whose behavior seemed to be a textbook example of <a href=\"https://endcoercivecontrolusa.com/blog/what_is_coercive_control\">coercive control</a> — a long-term behavior pattern in which a family member carries out an ongoing strategy of manipulation and emotional abuse against his partner and/or his children. This was just one example of a lifetime of alleged psychological torture. It’s anguishing to think what such an environment would do to two young boys forced to play these kinds of mind games by a parent whom they loved and trusted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coercive control <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22758030/gabby-petito-domestic-intimate-partner-violence-prevention\">often accompanies</a> other dysfunctional behaviors, including domestic violence and sexual abuse. Although the term was first coined in 1982, it wasn’t popularized as a concept until the late aughts (via an <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/coercive-control-how-men-entrap-women-personal-life\">influential book</a> on the subject) and still has yet to be fully or widely understood by the general public. More and more states are beginning to incorporate coercive control into their civil procedures and guidelines for understanding domestic violence, but as of 2024 only a handful of states, including <a href=\"https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/legal/USA-coercive-control-laws\">Hawaii</a> and <a href=\"https://msmagazine.com/2024/06/20/massachusetts-coercive-control/\">Massachusetts</a>, actually prosecute coercive control as a criminal offense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While most people recognize that strategic manipulation is a key factor in situations involving long-term domestic abuse, the justice system lacks sentencing guidelines that incorporate that understanding, including where juvenile and young offenders are concerned. In the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, the court failed even to accept that prolonged abuse could be a defense to murder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lyle and Erik were initially each tried separately in 1993; both trials, in which the defense relied heavily on testimony supporting their abuse claims, resulted in hung juries. The next trial began in October 1995, just eight days after the O.J. Simpson acquittal<strong> </strong>— the timing of which, the documentary implies, may have increased a public thirst for vengeance against wealthy defendants. For this trial, which saw them being tried together, the judge rejected what he called the “abuse excuse” and thus disallowed nearly all of the expert and personal testimony corroborating the brothers’ claims.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The jurors in that trial, according to one juror who appears in the documentary, were also dissuaded from considering manslaughter as an option, which could have dramatically reduced their sentences. Given the overwhelming number of witnesses who back their claims of an abusive household of coercive control and the increased understanding we have of how long-term abuse can affect children, it’s generally understood — and their defense attorneys have <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/menendez-bros-attorney-speaks-out-case-amid-appeal\">argued</a> — that their trials would have gone much differently today. The law increasingly <a href=\"https://bwjp.org/site-resources/evidence-of-battering-and-the-defense-of-duress/\">recognizes</a> coercive control and prolonged abuse as supporting a defense of diminished capacity, which can <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/diminished_capacity\">frequently result</a> in a conviction on a lesser degree of a crime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fortunately, the brothers have a shot at a reprieve: a recently rediscovered <a href=\"https://lamag.com/news/letter-calls-into-question-menendez-brothers-murder-conviction-attorneys-say\">letter</a> purportedly written by Erik Menendez eight months before the murders in which he details his ongoing sexual abuse by Jose has been used as the basis for a motion to vacate the brothers’ convictions. A recent story in <a href=\"https://people.com/menendez-brothers-will-they-go-free-people-cover-story-8724654\">People magazine</a> notes that the Los Angeles district attorney’s office will give the court a formal recommendation on the motion on November 26. That means the nightmare for the Menendez brothers could finally end.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

After Hurricane Helene dumped two feet of rain on western North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/01/asheville-climate-haven-flooding-hurricane/\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/climate-catastrophe-comes-to-asheville-north-carolina\">major</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/nx-s1-5137024/climate-haven-hurricane-helene-asheville\">media</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/climate/asheville-flooding-history-helene/index.html\">outlets</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/hurricane-helene-asheville-climate-change-nowhere-safe\">marveled</a> at how Asheville, which had been celebrated as a climate haven, had been devastated <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/climate/hurricane-helene-climate-change.html\">by a climate-related disaster</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some in the media later reported accurately that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/climate/asheville-climate-change-flood.html\">climate havens don’t actually exist</a>. But that still raises the question: Where did this climate haven concept even come from?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well before humans began putting billions of tons of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, entire populations would migrate toward better conditions in search of a place with milder weather or more fertile soil or the absence of drought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because of its speed and scale, however, human-caused climate change is especially extreme, and everywhere will be impacted by some degree of risk. There is no completely safe haven.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which is part of how we ended up talking about the idea of climate havens. It’s wishful thinking. At least that’s what several experts told me after <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina\">Helene laid a path of destruction across the Southeast</a> and as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/376323/hurricane-milton-category-5-tampa-florida\">Hurricane Milton barreled toward Florida</a>. As the impacts of climate change became more real and apparent, the media as well as local leaders started looking for a better story to tell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People are desperate for optimism,” said <a href=\"https://architecture.tulane.edu/people/jesse-m-keenan\">Jesse Keenan</a>, director of the Center on Climate Change and Urbanism at Tulane University, who described the concept of climate havens as a fiction. “It gives people hope.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Keenan actually blames himself for helping to popularize the term. For a concept that feels so widespread now, it’s surprisingly hard to find much mention of climate havens in the media before 2018. That was when the Guardian quoted Keenan in a piece about where you should move <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/climate-change-where-to-move-us-avoid-floods-hurricanes\">to save yourself from climate change</a> that used the phrase “safe havens.” Buffalo, New York, and Duluth, Minnesota, were Keenan’s suggestions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The concept gained more traction a few months later, when Mayor Byron W. Brown referred to Buffalo as a “<a href=\"https://www.buffalony.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=342\">climate refuge</a>” in his 2019 state of the city address, followed by outlets like <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/the-consequences-of-being-a-climate-refuge-city?sref=qYiz2hd0\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"https://qz.com/1895263/how-cities-can-prepare-to-support-climate-migrants\">Quartz</a> referring to Buffalo as a climate haven. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/climate/climate-migration-duluth.html\">did a whole spread on “climate-proof Duluth,”</a> a slogan Keenan wrote as part of an economic development package commissioned by the city. He told me it was just a joke that got pulled out of context.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to know how responsible one professor with a knack for marketing was for the mainstreaming of the climate haven concept. But it’s easy to see why local governments would latch onto it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Census Bureau estimates that as climate change warms the planet over the next several decades, 100 million <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-12/america-after-climate-change-mapped?sref=qYiz2hd0\">will migrate into and around the </a>US. Increased flood risk <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43493-8\">may have already pushed several million people</a> out of coastal and low-lying areas across the US, as wildfires <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50630-4\">start to raise questions about migration</a> in the West.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Inland cities, namely those along the Rust Belt that have been losing population for years, see an opportunity to pull those people in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The idea of a climate refuge itself is kind of an escapist fantasy,” said <a href=\"https://mcharg.upenn.edu/people/billy-fleming\">Billy Fleming</a>, director of the McHarg Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “To the extent that a climate refuge even exists, it&#8217;s not a particularly physical or geophysical phenomenon. It&#8217;s social and economic.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fleming added that, for these would-be climate havens, attracting new residents is a means to pull in more tax revenue and create wealth for the community. “It&#8217;s about keeping the real estate machine churning,” he added, “which is the thing that pays for everything else in the city.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2175688575.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A shirtless man carries a plank of wood, surrounded by muddy ground and debris.\" title=\"A shirtless man carries a plank of wood, surrounded by muddy ground and debris.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A volunteer starts to rebuild in Black Mountain, North Carolina, just days after Hurricane Helene dissipated. | Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The real estate industry has taken notice. Quite coincidentally, as Hurricane Helene was bearing down on the Southeast last week, Zillow announced a new feature <a href=\"https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2024/Zillow-introduces-First-Streets-comprehensive-climate-risk-data-on-for-sale-listings-across-the-US/default.aspx\">that displays climate risk scores</a> on listing pages alongside interactive maps and insurance requirements. Now, you can look up an address and see, on a scale of one to 10, the risk of flooding, extreme temperatures, and wildfires for that property, based on data provided by <a href=\"https://firststreet.org/research-library/national-risk-reports\">the climate risk modeling firm First Street</a>. Redfin, a Zillow competitor, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/02/13/redfin-air-quality-home-listings/\">launched its own climate risk index</a> using First Street data earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new climate risk scores on Zillow and Redfin can’t tell you with any certainty whether you’ll be affected by a natural disaster if you move into any given house. But this is a tool that can help guide decisions about how you might want to insure your property and think about its long-term value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s almost fitting that Zillow and Redfin, platforms designed to help people find the perfect home, are doing the work to show that climate risk is not binary. There are no homes completely free of risk for the same reasons that there’s no such thing as a perfect climate haven.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Climate risk is a complicated equation that complicates the already difficult and complex calculus of buying a home. Better access to data about risk can help, and a bit more transparency about the insurance aspect of homeownership is especially useful, as the industry <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/377094/hurricane-milton-helene-home-insurance-flooding-damage\">struggles to adapt to our warming world</a> and the disasters that come with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As we start to see insurance costs increase, all that starts to impact that affordability question,” <a href=\"https://www.zillowgroup.com/people/skylar-olsen/\">Skylar Olsen</a>, Zillow’s chief economist, told me. “It&#8217;ll help the housing market move towards a much healthier place, where buyers and sellers understand these risks and then have options to meet them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, knowledge of risk isn’t keeping people from moving <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/30/climate/americans-moving-hurricane-wildfire-risk.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb\">to disaster-prone parts of the country</a> right now. People move to new parts of the country for countless different reasons, including the area’s natural beauty, job prospects, and affordable housing. Those are <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-dynamics/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2022.886545/full\">a few of the reasons</a> why high-risk counties across the country <a href=\"https://econofact.org/are-americans-moving-to-locations-with-higher-climate-risk\">are growing faster than low-risk counties</a>, even in the face of future climate catastrophes, which are both unpredictable and inevitable. It’s almost unfathomable to know how to prepare ourselves properly for the worst-case scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The scale of these events that we&#8217;re seeing are so beyond what humans have ever seen,” said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pdx.edu/profile/vivek-shandas\">Vivek Shandas</a>, an urban planning professor at Portland State University. “No matter what we think might be a manageable level of preparedness and infrastructure, we&#8217;re still going to see cracks, and we&#8217;re still going to see breakages.”<br>That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23872640/coastal-climate-ocean-rising-miami-florida-building\">build sea walls</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/366765/megafires-climate-indigenous-controlled-burns\">find new ways to fight wildfires</a>. In a sense, we have the opportunity to create our own climate havens by making cities more resilient to the risks they face. We can be optimistic about that future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story was also published in the Vox Technology newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here</a></em></strong><em>&nbsp;so you don’t miss the next one!</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Oklahoma</em></a> is currently before the Supreme Court — and it is one of the most muddled death penalty cases the Court has faced in a while. Exactly how the justices untangle it will decide whether a man lives or dies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Richard Glossip is on death row after being convicted of an Oklahoma murder 20 years ago. Now, however, the state’s Republican attorney general says that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">his trial was unconstitutional and his conviction must be tossed out</a>. The state plans to retry Glossip if his conviction is vacated, but a ruling in Glossip’s favor will get him off death row for now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Attorney General Gentner Drummond has struggled to find a legal forum that will actually take the assertion that his trial was unconstitutional seriously. Oklahoma’s highest criminal court refused to accept Drummond’s arguments and kept Glossip on death row. The state parole board, meanwhile, split 2-2 on whether to grant clemency to Glossip, in part because one member of the board had to recuse himself because his wife was the lead prosecutor against Glossip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wednesday morning’s oral argument in <em>Glossip</em> only added more confusion to the mix. The two justices who typically take the most hardline positions against criminal defendants, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, appeared determined to toss the case out completely, without ever actually considering whether Glossip’s constitutional rights were violated. They likely have an ally in Chief Justice John Roberts, who seemed to doubt whether any possible constitutional violation in this case actually mattered enough to change the outcome of Glossip’s trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Justice Neil Gorsuch, who often votes with the Court’s most hardline members <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf\">in death penalty cases</a>, is recused from the case for reasons the Court did not disclose. That’s actually bad news for Glossip because he must assemble five affirmative votes to toss out his conviction in order to prevail, and the loss of even a skeptical justice is one less potential vote for him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All three of the Court’s Democrats, meanwhile, appeared sympathetic to Glossip’s arguments, and spent much of the case batting down Alito’s proposals to dismiss the case on procedural grounds — though Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson showed some openness to forming an alliance with Thomas to send the case back down to the state courts in order to gather additional evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That leaves Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, conservative Republicans who asked some questions that appeared sympathetic to Glossip, as the wild cards in this case. It is possible that they could provide the fourth and fifth vote to save Glossip’s life, but far from certain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The alleged constitutional violation that is before the Court — that prosecutors withheld evidence that a key witness has a serious mental illness, and failed to correct this witness when he lied on the stand — is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">fairly marginal</a>. It turns on four words in handwritten notes by prosecutor Connie Smothermon that were not turned over to Glossip’s lawyers until January 2023. The state agrees with Glossip’s legal team that these four words reveal a sufficiently serious constitutional violation to justify giving him a new trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while this narrow legal issue, which is the only issue before the Supreme Court, is the kind of legal question that reasonable judges could disagree upon, Smothermon’s notes are only one piece of a wide range of evidence suggesting that Glossip’s criminal conviction is unconstitutional: Oklahoma conducted two independent investigations, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">both of which concluded that Glossip’s trial was fundamentally flawed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among other things, those investigations found that Justin Sneed — the man who actually committed the murder at issue here — was pressured by police to implicate Glossip in the crime. They also show that police and the prosecution lost or destroyed evidence that could potentially exonerate Glossip. And they show that police inexplicably did not question potentially important witnesses or search obvious places for evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, however, Glossip’s life likely turns upon whether Kavanaugh and Barrett are moved by the procedural arguments pressed by the Court’s right flank, or by the arguments pressed by both Glossip and the state: That four words in Smothermon’s notes reveal a serious constitutional violation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Smothermon’s notes matter so much</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, prosecutors turned over a box of evidence for the first time to Glossip’s legal team. This box included handwritten notes from Smothermon, which included two significant questions. In the corner of the notes, Smothermon <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip\">wrote the words “on lithium?” and “Dr. Trumpet?”</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/glossip-note-supreme-court.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.3762739654562,100,89.247452069088\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"An excerpt from a prosecutor’s handwritten notes regarding Sneed and the Glossip case. Glossip v. Oklahoma brief.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both the state and Glossip’s legal team quickly discovered that these somewhat cryptic notes were quite significant. As the state <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7466/308265/20240423202240962_2024-4-23%20Final%20OK%20AG%20Glossip%20merits%20brief.pdf\">told the justices in its brief</a>, when Sneed was incarcerated in the Oklahoma County jail, that “jail had just one working psychiatrist in 1997 when Sneed was held there: Dr. Larry Trombka.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both Glossip and the state agree that the “Dr. Trumpet” referenced by Smothermon must have been a reference to Dr. Trombka, who was “the only possible treating psychiatrist and the only medical professional at the jail qualified to prescribe lithium.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The state had also previously withheld Sneed’s medical records from Glossip’s lawyers, and these records “confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a treatment of lithium at the county jail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this matters because Sneed was the key witness against Glossip at his trial. He was the only witness who implicated Glossip in the murder, and he did so on the theory that Glossip, who managed a motel where Sneed worked, hired Glossip to kill the motel’s owner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Dr. Trombka later said that Sneed’s mental illness could have triggered a “manic episode” that would have made him “more paranoid or potentially violent.” Trombka added that Sneed’s condition was “exacerbated by illicit drug use, such as methamphetamine.” So, if Glossip’s defense lawyers had known about Sneed’s medical diagnosis, they could have argued that Sneed committed the murder because he experienced a serious mental health event, and not because he was coaxed into doing so by Glossip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During Glossip’s trial, moreover, Sneed did testify that he was given lithium at the jail, but he suggested that he was prescribed it by accident and that he “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7466/308265/20240423202240962_2024-4-23%20Final%20OK%20AG%20Glossip%20merits%20brief.pdf\">never seen no psychiatrist or anything</a>.” Thus, Smothermon’s notes do not simply suggest that Sneed lied on the stand — a fact that would have diminished his credibility with the jury — they also suggest that Smothermon knew Sneed was lying and failed to correct him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The failure to turn over Smothermon’s notes sooner, and Smothermon’s failure to correct Sneed’s testimony potentially violate the Constitution in two ways. In <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/83/\"><em>Brady v. Maryland</em></a> (1963), the Supreme Court held that prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense that is “favorable to an accused” if that evidence “is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/360/264/\"><em>Napue v. Illinois</em></a> (1959), the Court held that “a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.” This rule applies even “when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.” So, by failing to correct Sneed’s false testimony that he never saw a psychiatrist, Smothermon potentially violated <em>Napue</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, the significance of Smothermon’s notes and her alleged violation of <em>Napue</em> appeared to divide the justices. Roberts was particularly skeptical of their relevance, pointing out early in the argument that the defense counsel knew that Sneed had been prescribed lithium, so why does it matter if defense lawyers had also known that this drug, which is used primarily to treat mental health disorders, was also prescribed by a psychiatrist?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Significantly, however, Kavanaugh appeared to break with Roberts on this question. “I’m having some trouble,” he told Christopher Michel, a Court-appointed lawyer tasked with defending Glossip’s conviction because the state would not, with the idea that the jury would be unmoved if they learned that Sneed lied on the stand “when the whole case depended on his credibility.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kavanaugh also said that Sneed’s mental health diagnosis creates “all sorts of avenues for questioning his credibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So Kavanaugh, at least, appears open to the argument that Smothermon violated <em>Napue </em>or <em>Brady</em>. But it is still unclear whether five justices agree with this argument. And it is also unclear how they will approach a procedural issue that could doom Glossip’s case.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The procedural problem in the <em>Glossip</em> case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Oklahoma law, like most states and the federal government, places strict limits on anyone’s ability to challenge their conviction once that conviction is finalized and all of the defendant’s appeals are exhausted. Among other things, Oklahoma forbids someone like Glossip from making more than one post-conviction attack on that conviction unless the issues raised in a later proceeding <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/glossip-v-state-2\">could not have been raised earlier</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These barriers, moreover, are augmented by an Oklahoma state law that required Glossip to present any new evidence he discovered <a href=\"http://okcca.net/rules/rule-9.7/\">within 60 days of discovering it</a>. So Glossip’s lawyers could not take their time, gather all the evidence they needed to make the best case for their client, and then present it to the courts all at once. They had to present this evidence piecemeal or lose the ability to raise it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a result, the case currently before the Supreme Court is Glossip’s fifth legal proceeding challenging his conviction after it was finalized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before this fifth proceeding reached the justices, moreover, Oklahoma’s highest criminal court rejected his <em>Brady </em>and <em>Napue</em> arguments, in part because, the court claimed, Oklahoma’s laws limiting his ability to repeatedly challenge his conviction prevented him from raising those arguments. If the Oklahoma court is right about this point, that precludes the Supreme Court from hearing the case, because the US Supreme Court typically <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/4/23481063/supreme-court-moore-harper-independent-state-legislature-doctrine-elections\">cannot overrule a state’s highest court on a question of state law</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, most of Wednesday’s argument focused on this threshold question — does Oklahoma’s own law prevent Glossip from even raising his <em>Napue</em> and <em>Brady</em> arguments? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that Oklahoma’s attorney general is on Glossip’s side in this case plays an enormous role in the debate over this threshold question. Were Glossip alone in seeking relief, he would probably be doomed. But several justices argued that Drummond has an absolute right to waive the procedural rules that would otherwise prevent Glossip from raising his <em>Brady</em> and <em>Napue</em> claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, one of the justices who seemed to agree that Drummond has waived those procedural rules is Barrett, who noted at one point that it is very unusual for a court not to accept such a waiver. Similarly, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that there are “100 years of history” where no Oklahoma court refused to honor a similar waiver, suggesting that the state court that heard Glossip’s case made up a one-time-only rule to prevent him from challenging his conviction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, while at least four justices seemed convinced that the state court should have honored Drummond’s decision to waive the procedural bars to Glossip’s case, it is unclear whether there are five. Kavanaugh, the most likely fifth vote for Glossip, played his cards especially close to his chest, often framing his questions about whether Smothermon violated <em>Napue </em>or <em>Brady </em>with caveats like “if you get past all the procedural bars.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the bottom line is that Glossip could prevail, but he’s got a tough road. Assuming that all three of the Democratic justices are on his side, he needs to win over Barrett — who seemed to be with him on the procedural question but who was largely quiet on the merits of his case — while also winning over Kavanaugh, who seemed to be with Glossip on the merits but silent on the procedural question.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Over <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/helene-death-toll-rises-to-at-least-232-across-6-states/1700671\">230 people were killed</a> because of the storm, and that number is likely to go up as the search for missing people continues. Entire homes, streets, and towns across the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida have been torn apart. Plans for rebuilding are bound to be a slow struggle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Florida is primed to face disaster once again — before it’s even had a fair chance at recovering from the last one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Wednesday night, Hurricane Milton, currently a Category 4 storm, will make landfall on Florida’s west coast. While forecasters say it’s likely to weaken a bit before reaching Florida, government officials are <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/evacuation-orders/\">ordering millions of people in over a dozen counties</a> to evacuate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die,” <a href=\"https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1843459098148327850\">said</a> Tampa Mayor Jane Castor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tampa Bay area, in particular, is in serious trouble. The land is prone to flooding and storm surges caused by hurricane season. Most recently, Hurricane Helene caused <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2024/10/07/helene-just-flooded-tampa-bay-heres-how-much-worse-miltons-surge-could-be/\">record storm surges</a> for the city.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But now, this region may be right in Milton’s path. The last time a hurricane <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/11/18485563/hurricane-florida-climate-change-tampa\">hit the area</a> directly was 1921 — it demolished homes and killed eight people. Back then, Tampa Bay was home to 65,000 people. Today, the population is 3.1 million. While the exact location of where Milton will make landfall is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-milton-florida-10-09-24#cm21s2s9200003b6n41gytj3q\">still uncertain</a>, even on the day of its arrival, it’s clear that there is much, much more to lose this time around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The back-to-back phenomena between Hurricanes Helene and Milton spells out disaster for communities in Florida that <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-milton-helene-debris-florida/\">just barely started to rebuild and recover</a> from Helene’s damage. As Hurricane Milton imminently approaches, coastal residents and their local governments are scrambling to move the heaps of debris off the streets, which can become dangerous projectiles if swept up by the coming storm, which is currently forecasted to make landfall as a Category 4. (Hurricane Katrina, for example, made landfall as a Category 3). Some towns are still getting back up on their feet from when <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/366041/climate-hurricane-debby-drenches-the-southeast\">Hurricane Debby</a>, a large Category 1 storm that wreaked havoc by continuously dumping heavy rain over parts of Florida and flooded towns, hit back in August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Florida is no stranger to extreme weather, or even weather disasters happening one after the other. But all of the above context makes this situation feel terrifyingly different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You could call it unprecedented, because you can take a similar meteorological setup, a similar tropical magnitude hurricane in a similar physical environment, but with more people and infrastructure — that is not something we have necessarily seen in the more recent, modern time,” says <a href=\"https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/about/people/emily-powell\">Emily Powell</a>, the assistant state climatologist for the <a href=\"https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/\">Florida Climate Center</a> and program manager of the <a href=\"https://flbrace.org/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://flbrace.org/\">Florida Building Resilience Against Climate Effects</a> (BRACE) Program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I spoke in depth with Powell to better understand the gravity of the situation and how communities are confronting this uniquely destructive moment for the millions of people in Milton’s path.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I know you&#8217;re based in Florida, it&#8217;s where you do your work. How are you feeling as Milton is getting closer to making landfall?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Milton is projected to cause more destruction, more storm surge, higher storm surge levels, potentially higher rainfall rates in places along the west Gulf Coast of Florida. These are places along the coast that will see really high, high levels of storm surge that we have not seen in those places in a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene brought storm surges of between 6 and 7 feet roughly, in the west central parts of Florida. And we&#8217;re projecting to see upwards of 15 feet in some places, and so much higher levels of storm surge. I think we&#8217;ve seen people being very responsive so far to this threat. People are evacuating. It sounds like there&#8217;s been a lot of congestion in traffic, which means people are listening and heeding warnings, which is good news and I hope that that continues to happen today. We have more time to prepare, and I think people are getting sandbags, getting their places secured, and hopefully finding safer places to ride the storm out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Florida just got through Hurricane Helene barely a week and a half ago, and some communities are still recovering from Hurricane Debby&#8217;s impact two months ago. Now, the state is bracing for Hurricane Milton&#8217;s arrival. What is it like on the ground right now for people in Milton&#8217;s path, in this sort of in-between moment?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was down in Steinhatchee end of last week, and so Steinhatchee had a direct hit from Helene, and that was their third storm in 13 months in that particular part of the coast, and in Steinhatchee, Keaton Beach, and Cedar Key, and then places further south that are projected to see a direct hit from Milton,<strong> </strong>people are very much still in response and recovery. In Steinhatchee — and this looked very similar last year after Hurricane Idalia — if you drive up and down the streets, you see piles and piles of debris, trash, the insides of people&#8217;s homes on the curb, some places, and so all that is still in the process of being cleaned up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What we&#8217;re seeing right now is sort of emergency preparations to remove and clean up and dispose of all that debris, get it out of the streets where that could become a hazard as the storm approaches and makes landfall. In addition to that, some people were still without power. I think Steinhatchee actually was at roughly 85 percent power restoration. I think where power can be restored, it has been restored following Helene, but there might be instances where a particular home or building cannot receive power because of damages to that particular structure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, we&#8217;re just having to hit pause and shift gears to prepare for this next landfalling hurricane, and then more recovery and cleanup.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How did Milton take shape so quickly after Helene?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This season, in addition to the last Atlantic hurricane season, the waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, as well as in the main development region of the tropical Atlantic Ocean basin, have been incredibly warm, much warmer than normal. And in some places, record warm, and so that is one factor that contributed to a really aggressive hurricane season forecast this year is the record warm water temperatures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So here in the Gulf, about this time in the hurricane season, we tend to see more development in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, as opposed to out in the tropical Atlantic basin. So it&#8217;s not very uncommon to see a lot of activity in this part of the basin at this time of year. Because the waters have been so warm, storms like Milton have been able to spin up really, really quickly. When we have other conditions conducive to that, developments like low vertical wind shear, we see explosive intensification as we did with Milton. It has just been in an environment in the western Gulf of Mexico that has been very conducive to this very rapid intensification.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These back-to-back storms are not necessarily uncommon. We&#8217;ve seen that in many other seasons, like 2020, we&#8217;ve seen places get hit again and again, it has to do with the atmospheric patterns that are also in play that are helping to steer the storms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What do these two storms happening back to back underscore and say about the types of disasters we&#8217;re going to see in a world impacted by climate change?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve seen this happen before. It&#8217;s not unprecedented, but it does speak to the fact that no one is really immune or safe to these storms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have seen a lot of studies show that there&#8217;s been a trend toward more rapid intensification with tropical cyclones, and so when we do get storms like tropical storms or hurricanes, we do see that the ability for them to rapidly intensify is increasing, and so that is certainly something that we&#8217;ll continue to see moving forward. People have to be prepared for these larger, more destructive hurricanes, unfortunately.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How are institutions in the area, such as local organizations and state agencies, preparing and helping communities that are in the path of Milton?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think emergency responses and preparations are getting better and more efficient at warning people ahead of time, getting those evacuation orders well in advance to give people the time to actually heed the warning and evacuate. So for example, we saw roadways starting to pile up and with traffic yesterday, two days before landfall, which is really great that people can get out that soon and get to safety and not have to worry about leaving at the last minute, you know, when roadways are going to be gridlocked. We are really good about asking for help from neighboring communities to&nbsp;come in and be in place before a hurricane makes landfall, so that they can be there to respond immediately once the conditions are safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing that we&#8217;ve looked at, through a program I work on that&#8217;s focused more on climate and health, is special needs sheltering and how that works during evacuations. One of the things we found is not all the special needs registries are up to date, so not knowing who all needs special accommodations during evacuations and where they&#8217;re located. Local health departments can prepare more for understanding where their most vulnerable populations are, making sure their special needs registries are up to date, and getting those ready so that when storms like this do come, they know where those people are, and they can send help where they need to get people to evacuation shelters. So this is all stuff that has to happen before a hurricane is approaching land and making landfall. It&#8217;s a challenge and a need that&#8217;s been identified, and so we&#8217;re starting to address it.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are communities in Florida who have been hit by extreme weather events multiple times in the course of a year. From your perspective, is there a breaking point for how many times a population can deal with these extreme weather disasters, and what might that breaking point look like?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s a good question for each individual as well as each community to think about for themselves. At some point, you have to sort of weigh your own individual risk tolerance and understand what you&#8217;re willing to deal with and what you&#8217;re not. Some people are more risk averse than others. Some are more risk tolerant. So I think for us as communities, and for us individually, that&#8217;s just something we have to each ask ourselves and then take steps to increase our preparedness and just ensure that we&#8217;re as prepared as we can be for these types of storms.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Sam Delgado</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Is there any advice or resources that you have for Florida residents to best protect themselves who are in the path of Hurricane Milton?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emily Powell</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The best, most credible resource is going to be the <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a>. Their website has the latest updates on the storm&#8217;s track, the storm&#8217;s intensity, the impacts, the hazards maps that they produce with the National Weather Service, your local National Weather Service office. Those are going to be the best sources of information on the storm itself. And then, of course, your local weather forecast office and your local Emergency Management Office for evacuation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Three-quarters of insured losses were due to <a href=\"https://www.munichre.com/en/company/media-relations/media-information-and-corporate-news/media-information/2024/natural-disaster-figures-first-half-2024.html?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=munich+re&amp;utm_term=073dff8d-ca8d-4a5d-89d6-bc641ad02705\">severe thunderstorms, flooding, and forest fires</a>. More recent calamities like Hurricane Helene will push the toll this year much higher. Damage estimates for Helene ranged as high as <a href=\"https://www.corelogic.com/press-releases/corelogic-final-estimated-damages-for-hurricane-helene-to-be-between-30-5-billion-and-47-5-billion/\">$47.5 billion</a> as of October 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/states-where-home-insurance-costs-are-surging-highest\">Home insurance premiums are rising</a> across the country. Florida homeowners already pay the highest rates, on average <a href=\"https://www.news-press.com/story/news/2024/04/01/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-highest-rising-how-much-cost/73104723007/\">more than $10,000 per year</a>, well above the national average of around $2,400 per year. Last year, US home insurance rates <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-homeowners-insurance-rates-jump-by-double-digits-in-2023-80057804\">jumped 11.3 percent on average</a>, which has led some to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/27/home-insurance-dropped-coverage/\">drop their coverage altogether</a>. Some Floridians have seen rate hikes as high as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/florida-home-sales-slowing-355616a2\">400 percent over the past five years.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s if they can find insurance at all. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have come home to a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/350705/your-home-insurance-company-dumped-you-now-what\">breakup letter from their private insurers</a>, canceling their coverage. Others can’t find any company that will protect their home, leaving expensive, <a href=\"https://www.wwno.org/coastal-desk/2024-07-15/louisianas-business-friendly-climate-response-canceled-home-insurance-plans\">state-run insurers of last resort</a> as their only option. Some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23746045/state-farm-california-climate-change-insurance-wildfire-florida-flood\">private insurance companies</a> have entirely pulled out of states like California, Florida, and Louisiana.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), a federal program that provides flood coverage to <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11049\">4.7 million policyholders</a>, is more than <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN10784\">$20 billion in debt to the US Treasury</a> accruing $1.7 million in interest daily. In September, <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/rules-legislation/congressional-reauthorization\">Congress reauthorized the program</a> for a few months. The next funding deadline is December 20, 2024. If authorization lapses, the NFIP would stop selling and renewing flood insurance for millions of people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurers like State Farm <a href=\"https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-general-insurance-company-california-new-business-update/\">point to several factors behind these trends</a>. Inflation has made rebuilding houses much more expensive and prices for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22686124/climate-change-insurance-flood-wildfire-hurricane-risk\">reinsurance</a> — insurance for insurance companies — have shot up. Insurers are also bearing more catastrophic risks as more people and property take root in high-risk areas like flood zones and neighborhoods that are more wildfire-prone, so that when a blaze ignites or a storm passes over, the losses are greater. And because of climate change, many types of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous\">natural disasters are packing more of a punch</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The turmoil in the insurance industry has major implications for the economy and for politics. Most banks will not offer a mortgage without homeowners insurance, and letting a policy lapse can lead to foreclosure. In the wake of a hurricane or wildfire, insurance payouts are critical for rebuilding lost homes or relocating to somewhere safer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurance is also where the risks of tomorrow manifest today, and with rising average temperatures, many buildings will face bigger threats. That means homeowners will have to pay more for insurance, go without, or move to a place with lower rates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, that leaves a trio of unpleasant options. Insurers can raise their rates in line with the risks they face, pricing more people out of coverage and leaving them to fend for themselves. Regulators can limit rate hikes and enforce coverage minimums, which can drive private insurers into bankruptcy or out of the market altogether. Or the government can subsidize or offer its own coverage, which would leave taxpayers holding the bag for mounting losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite all of this, insurers themselves are actually doing quite well. The US property and casualty insurers <a href=\"https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2023%20Annual%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20Insurance%20Industries%20Analysis%20Report.pdf\">netted $823 billion in premiums</a> last year, posting record profits in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23969523/climate-change-cop28-paris-1-5-c-uae-2023-record-warm\">hottest year on record</a> with <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters\">dozens of extreme weather disasters</a> with tolls in the billions of dollars. Insurers have already <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/insurance/us-p-c-insurance-poised-for-2024-profit-recovery-post-strong-1q-results-21-06-2024\">posted even higher profits this year</a>, and the sector is poised to do <a href=\"https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/sigma-research/Insurance-Monitoring/us-property-casualty-outlook-june-2024.html\">better in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So it’s a great time to be selling insurance, but not to buy it. Insurers have shown they can thrive even in a warmer world with more costly disasters; the challenge is getting their products to the people who need them. Doing so will require changes to how states regulate insurance, how companies model catastrophes, and new insurance products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But insurance is ultimately about risk, and over the long term, there’s no substitute for reducing the overall risks stemming from climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP5811016810\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How insurance works, and how it stops working</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like most businesses, a simple calculation lies at the core of the insurance sector: A company has to make more money in premiums than it pays out in damages, but figuring out where to set premiums and how much damage to expect gets extraordinarily complicated. The most common form of property insurance is <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indemnity_insurance.asp\">indemnity</a>, which grants a payout based on the amount of damage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The formula for the losses that an insurer can expect has three key components. The first is the hazard, such as the probability of a severe storm occurring. The next is exposure, which is the value of the insured property in the path of danger. And the third is vulnerability, or how well a property can stand up to a given extreme weather scenario — whether it readily floods, burns, collapses, or survives the disaster intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurers then have to distribute these costs across their customers. Companies are competing with one another, so they can’t set their rates too high, and in many states, they face further limits on their pricing and minimum coverage requirements. There’s a whole <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm\">subfield of mathematics</a> dedicated to this practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurers themselves cover their risks with reinsurers. When a major earthquake, hurricane, or wildfire demands more payouts than a company can afford at once, insurers can file a claim with their reinsurer, which in turn is balancing disaster threats among insurance companies all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you can balance these risks properly, insurance can be a lucrative line of business, as we’ve seen over the past year. But if they tip too far in any direction, it can lead to a financial collapse. After <a href=\"https://axaxl.com/fast-fast-forward/articles/remembering-hurricane-andrews-lessons-30-years-later\">Hurricane Andrew</a> rammed into the tip of Florida at Category 5 strength in 1992, causing $25 billion in insured losses (1992 dollars), at least 16 insurance companies became insolvent.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-842979178.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7570938182872,100,80.485812363426\" alt=\"A man drawing on a clip board. \" title=\"A man drawing on a clip board. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A State Farm catastrophe claims adjuster draws a sketch while surveying a home affected by Hurricane Harvey in Rockport, Texas. | Eddie Seal/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\" Eddie Seal/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The storm was a <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-features/2022/05/16/667461.htm\">major turning point for the insurance sector</a>. It showed that the old formulas for calculating risk underestimated how much destruction could end up on an insurer&#8217;s books. After the waters receded, companies began to adopt <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/resources/about-catastrophe-modeling/\">catastrophe models</a>, computer programs that use the physical traits of extreme weather events in a given area to estimate how much an insurer might have to pay out. This raised rates for many homeowners, but also led insurers to <a href=\"https://www.rms.com/blog/2022/08/24/30-years-on-from-hurricane-andrew-managing-a-storm-of-floridas-own-making\">advocate for stronger building codes</a> and defensive infrastructure like sea walls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now even catastrophe models are starting to show their weaknesses. These simulations are typically built on historical severe weather patterns, but because average temperatures are rising, the past is no longer prologue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Integrating climate change into catastrophe models and then into insurance premiums is its own technical challenge. Scientists are still trying to suss out exactly how much warming is in store given that the biggest factor is how aggressively the world will act to limit greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even within physical models of the Earth, there is still a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374253/climate-chamge-model-warming-ipcc-record-heat\">wide range of uncertainty</a> in how these gasses will alter weather. Insurers then have to gauge just how bad of a disaster they have to plan for, by what time frame, and then how to distribute those costs to policyholders in the present.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, the number of people is increasing in areas that are vulnerable to disasters worsened by climate change. Roughly <a href=\"https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/economics-and-demographics.html\">40 percent of the US</a> lives in a coastal county, for example, and in states like Florida, the waterfront has experienced some of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23372996/hurricane-ian-tampa-florida-miami-storm-surge-flood\">highest levels of population growth</a>. Just how many more people will build bungalows, condos, and office parks in places likely to burn or flood will shape payouts in the future — and thus premiums today. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reinsurance companies have been bracing for climate change for decades</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Incorporating climate change into their business may be a more recent development for retail insurers, but reinsurance companies have long kept tabs on warming. While the fundamentals of risk management are similar, reinsurance companies and retail insurance firms operate under different constraints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Frontline insurance companies tend to focus on specific regions and operate under local regulations, while the reinsurance business spans the globe in a freewheeling market. That gives reinsurers a more diverse risk portfolio and more flexibility in managing it, but they also must examine these risks on a global scale over decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, has studied climate change for 50 years, and their chief climate scientist, Ernst Rauch, has been working on this since for more than half of that time. While climate change is altering the risks on their balance sheets, Rauch said understanding the fundamental physics behind it has helped the company game out what to expect and adjust accordingly. With climate science, what was once a blank, uncertain view of the future is now coming into focus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We feel very well prepared to cope with the challenges of climate change,” Rauch said. “And with this understanding we want to not only continue with this business, but depending on the terms and conditions, also grow our business model.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This knowledge also lays a course for reducing the financial and physical threats from warming, for companies and for policymakers. Looking at the three-pronged formula for insurance risk — hazard, exposure, and vulnerability — climate change mainly comes into play with the hazard component since rising average temperatures increase the chances of weather events causing more destruction. That provides the impetus for halting the rise in greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2176489369.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.735459053117,100,78.529081893765\" alt=\"Couple looking at remains of burned down cabin.\" title=\"Couple looking at remains of burned down cabin.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Katie and Regis Saalfeld at the remains of their cabin in Holy Jim Canyon on Thursday, October 3, 2024.

For a house built decades ago, simply buying the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPS081\">lumber</a>, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU3241223241222\">shingles</a>, and <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU32733273\">concrete</a> for repairs after a storm is much more expensive now than it was when that house was built. Residential reconstruction costs have <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/4a3257/siteassets/media/underwriting-v/resources/360value-quarterly/360value-q3-2024.pdf\">risen almost 5 percent </a>in just the past year. Add to that the higher cost of labor and rising property values, which makes losses more expensive, and insurance costs go up independent of climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reducing vulnerability to disasters is one of the most immediate things people can do to keep threats in check. “This is where we as consumers, as policyholders, have the biggest influence on the risk,” Rauch said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tactics like preventing flooding by <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/habitat-restoration-projects-offer-protection-flooding\">restoring natural watersheds</a> and <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2023/11/valuing-prescribed-fire\">controlled burns</a> to reduce the odds of a deadly wildfire can blunt the impact of a disaster. Adapting to climate perils like sea level rise with tactics like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/miami-fl-seawall-hurricanes.html\">seawalls</a> or using <a href=\"https://emilms.fema.gov/IS320/WM0103020text.htm\">fire-resistant building materials</a> in wildfire-prone forests can allow properties to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5100886/lahaina-wildfire-maui-building-defensible-space\">endure a catastrophe</a>. But to drive down insurance premiums with these measures, insurers have to first recognize and reward the homeowners and property managers that undertake them, and they don’t always do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The computer models that insurers use to decide whether to renew or write insurance for homes and condominiums don&#8217;t always account for those investments in mitigation by homeowners,” said <a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/about/people/dave-jones-2/\">Dave Jones</a>, who runs the Climate Risk Initiative at the University of California Berkeley and served as California’s insurance commissioner from 2011 until 2018.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reinsurance companies also connect the impacts of disasters around the world. Their international portfolios allow them to withstand billions of dollars in insured losses. But that also means that a gargantuan disaster can create financial burdens even for people far removed from the destruction. If a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-typhoon-krathon-rain-e4acaaf0fbf22779c1f0124ee2f2712b\">massive typhoon hits Taiwan</a> and causes extensive insured losses, reinsurers may have to raise their premiums for retail insurers, who would then raise their prices for policies in Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Climate change isn’t the biggest factor behind the recent insurance premium spikes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many insurance companies say climate change is a key driver of long-term risk. Right now though, only 1 percent of the overall annual increase in insured losses seen so far is due to actual changes in the climate, according to <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/resources/campaigns/modeling-insured-catastrophe-losses-a-global-perspective-for-2024/\">Verisk</a>, a risk analytics firm. The larger force to date is growing exposure due to inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Verisk’s <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/company/about/leadership/rob-newbold/\">Rob Newbold</a>, who studies extreme events, noted that many of the disasters that insurers are worried about do stem from the climate, but they’re already built into insurance rates (or they should be). And the specific role of rising average temperatures exacerbating these catastrophes so far hasn’t shown up in a big way in the data. The trend right now seems to be “ordinary” extreme weather falling on more expensive homes and businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don&#8217;t want to try to suggest that climate change isn&#8217;t happening. The climate is changing. But climate itself has been a factor in insurance losses forever,” Newbold said. “We’re seeing this overall level of insured losses [rising], but from our perspective, the industry should not be surprised by this because the tools exist to quantify that risk.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2175073374.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.6701117381746,100,90.659776523651\" alt=\"Aerial view of truck driving down a flooded road.\" title=\"Aerial view of truck driving down a flooded road.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A vehicle drives through flood waters after Hurricane Helene hit the area as it passed offshore on September 27, 2024, in Crystal River, Florida. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to inflation, there are other local factors that have driven up the costs of insurance in some states. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23746045/state-farm-california-climate-change-insurance-wildfire-florida-flood\">major insurance firms like State Farm and Allstate</a> announced they would not sign new property insurance policies in California because the losses they were facing from perils like wildfires were too much to bear at the rates they were allowed to charge (State Farm and Allstate did not respond to requests for comment). Other insurers <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/350705/your-home-insurance-company-dumped-you-now-what\">dropped thousands of Californians</a> from their existing policies. Similarly, <a href=\"https://weartv.com/news/local/floridas-home-insurance-crisis-worsens-as-companies-exit-leaving-citizens-overloaded\">Florida has also seen private insurers leave the state</a> and drop customers in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/people/jerry-theodorou/\">Jerry Theodorou</a>, who leads insurance research at the R Street Institute, a free market think tank, noted that insurers in California face regulations that limit their ability to increase rates and for a long time blocked them from using forward-looking catastrophe models to set their prices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“California was a special case largely for regulatory reasons,” Theodorou said. “The main driver of the high premiums in Florida was plaintiff attorney firms run amok.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Florida is home to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">6.5 percent of the US population</a> but accounts for 79 percent of all <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/press-release/triple-i-extreme-fraud-and-litigation-causing-floridas-homeowners-insurance-markets-demise-062322\">homeowners insurance lawsuits</a>. The state has also become a <a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2024/09/02/florida-homeowners-need-to-be-careful-about-persistent-roofing-scams-cfo-says/\">hot spot for roofing scams</a> where roofing companies would seek out homes after a disaster to offer a cheap roof replacement and then turn around and bill insurance companies for much more expensive work. When insurance companies balk, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/roofing-scams-florida-property-insurance-hurricane-rcna29649\">the roofers sue</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So while climate change is increasing hazards over the long term, right now policy choices, economic trends, and market forces are driving most of the disruption in property insurance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is the future insurable?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That depends on who you ask.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">States have begun to take steps to lure insurance companies back. The Golden State is <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release011-2024.cfm\">beginning to allow insurers to incorporate catastrophe models</a> that anticipate the future while the Sunshine State just implemented a new <a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/florida-insurance-market-on-the-mend/\">law to limit insurance lawsuits</a>. States are also <a href=\"https://mysafeflhome.com/\">updating building codes and offering insurance discounts</a> for people who do things like upgrade their windows, use fire-resistant materials, and strengthen the frame of their homes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The tools are there,” Theodorou said. “They need to be deployed more.” He added that a <a href=\"https://www.reinsurancene.ws/proposed-legislation-could-reshape-catastrophe-reinsurance-landscape-in-us-goldman-sachs/\">government-run reinsurance company</a> as some legislators have proposed would only <a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/another-government-run-insurance-scheme-is-last-thing-the-nation-needs/\">entrench the current flaws of the insurance market</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And some insurers are responding. Earlier this year, Allstate said it would <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/making-it-in-the-bay/allstate-raise-california-home-insurance-rates/3637913/\">come back to California</a> under one condition: It gets to raise home insurance rates by an average of 34 percent.&nbsp;In North Carolina, insurers are asking state regulators to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-home-insurance-hearing-helene-96549139712a6c35fd0cb6e69b755d5d\">raise rates by an average of 42 percent</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite these challenges, the insurance industry is still profitable, <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/property-casualty-insurance\">investors continue to demonstrate an appetite for risk</a>, and insurance requirements to get a home loan haven’t changed, so it’s not going to fade away anytime soon. At the right price, there is theoretically an insurance policy that can cover even the most precarious home. “Technically everything could be insurable for the right amount of protection and the right amount of mitigation,” Newbold said. “There&#8217;s no such property you can&#8217;t put coverage on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s no guarantee that anyone would be able to buy such a policy. Some insurers offer alternatives and complements to conventional indemnity insurance. <a href=\"https://www.munichre.com/en/solutions/for-industry-clients/parametric-solutions.html\">Parametric insurance</a>, which pays a fixed amount based on the strength of a disaster rather than the extent of the damage, is one approach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jones echoed that a government-run insurer wouldn’t solve the underlying disruption in the insurance sector and agreed that inflation and greater exposure are the major factors driving price hikes right now. “However, none of those two factors would matter near as much if there weren’t more severe and frequent weather events due to climate change,” Jones said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He added that even though Florida fulfilled much of the insurance industry’s wishlist, such as protection from lawsuits and state-funded reinsurance, companies like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/insurance-florida-business-desantis-a6c3a8e6127ecbf270099e87238ed47e\">Farmers Insurance are still exiting the state</a>. “Florida may well be proof that we&#8217;re not going to rate our way out of this problem,” Jones said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also important to remember that insured losses are only the starting point for grappling with a disaster. According to Munich Re, <a href=\"https://www.munichre.com/en/risks/natural-disasters.html\">more than half of natural disaster losses</a> were not insured. Many of the people facing the greatest dangers from weather extremes are also the least equipped to deal with them and most likely to suffer in the aftermath. The dollar values don’t convey the entire social cost of a calamity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without halting greenhouse gas emissions, these problems are only going to get harder. According to Jones, the rising risks from unchecked warming is going to make it practically impossible for insurers to stay in the game over the long term. “Insurers are not magicians; they can&#8217;t wave a wand and make the risk go away,” Jones said. “Ultimately, it all goes back to the climate crisis.” </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Insured losses from natural disasters around the world in the first half of the year have already topped $60 billion, 54 percent higher than the 10-year average. Three-quarters of insured losses were due to severe thunderstorms, flooding, and forest fires. More recent calamities like Hurricane Helene will push the toll this year much higher.

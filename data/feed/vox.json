Putin’s counterpart in China, Xi Jinping, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/13/vladimir-putins-spies-are-plotting-global-chaos\">concurs</a>, foreseeing “changes the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This doesn’t mean World War III is inevitable or even likely. But it does mean we are in an era when the decisions of major leaders in moments of crisis could have an outsize impact on global security and the lives of millions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This also is the moment, after a stunning win, when Donald Trump will return to the presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The year 2016, when Trump was elected the first time, didn’t exactly feel like a very peaceful or stable moment in world history. The Syrian civil war and the US-led campaign against ISIS <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-us-policy-isis\">were raging</a>. In June, one of the terror group’s sympathizers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482322488/orlando-shooting-what-happened-update\">killed 49 people</a> at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Russian-backed forces were occupying much of Eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">About a month before the election, North Korea conducted its <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/08/asia/north-korea-seismic-activity/\">most powerful nuclear test</a> to date. Europe was still in the midst of an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911\">unprecedented influx of migrants</a> from the Middle East and Africa, which would end up having dramatic political consequences in several countries. Sen. Ted Cruz was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/happened-ted-cruz-told-year-girl-worlds-fire/story?id=29673686\">terrifying 3-year-olds</a> on the campaign trail by telling them the world was “on fire.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet, viewed from the vantage point of this year, 2016 feels like a simpler time. Wars of all types have gotten <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia\">more common and deadlier</a> around the world in the years since, and superpower conflict — a concern that had largely receded in the post-Cold War era — is back on the agenda.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In short, the global situation Trump will inherit this time around will be far more dangerous and unpredictable. And that in turn raises the risks of his erratic and transactional approach to foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What was, eight years ago, a localized “gray zone” conflict in Eastern Ukraine is now the first major land war in Europe in decades, one in which Russia’s president has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear\">threatened to use nuclear weapons</a>. Israel’s war in Gaza, already one of the <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/2024-08-14/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-death-toll-in-gaza-is-bad-even-compared-to-the-wars-in-ukraine-iraq-and-myanmar/00000191-50c6-d6a2-a7dd-d1decf340000\">deadliest conflicts for civilians</a> of the 20th century, is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/364148/haniyeh-iran-israel-hamas-hezbollah\">fast spiraling into a regional conflict</a> that could involve direct combat between Israel and Iran and could yet drag in the US military.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Further east, potentially even more dangerous conflicts loom. Many North Korea watchers believe the country is <a href=\"https://www.38north.org/2024/01/is-kim-jong-un-preparing-for-war/\">preparing for war</a>, and that the risk of all-out conflict on the Korean peninsula — which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/7/16974772/north-korea-war-trump-kim-nuclear-weapon\">could potentially kill more than a million people</a>, even if North Korea doesn’t use its nuclear arsenal — has never been higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s Taiwan. Even putting aside a death toll on both sides that could <a href=\"https://authory.com/app/content/ac08ba446e8ca4c4285b79969439856a1\">dwarf the war in Ukraine</a>, a war in Taiwan would be a <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/taiwan-economic-disruptions/\">body blow to the global economy</a>. If the US came to Taiwan’s aid, it could lose <a href=\"https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?VersionId=WdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ\">as many troops in a matter of weeks</a> as it did in 20 years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some analysts believe China could even <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/Thomas_Shugart_Testimony.pdf\">preemptively attack US bases</a> in the Pacific if it believed US intervention was inevitable, something the US military has not experienced since WWII. And the threat of nuclear weapons use would loom over the conflict: China has the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, <a href=\"http://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/Chinas-plan-to-be-the-next-nuclear-superpower-ada094a58e6db44acad90284fc2d087d4\">one that is growing fast</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran — a group <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine\">some have dubbed</a> the “axis of upheaval” — may not have much in common in terms of ideology of overall interests, but they are increasingly collaborating: The reported presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/north-korea-russia-military-ukraine.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">just the latest example</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this is to downplay the wars and security threats that existed in 2016 and continued through Trump’s first term, nor the obviously massive disruptive effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. But state versus state conflict, and even superpower versus superpower conflict, is an entirely different matter than war against terrorist groups. Gray zone conflict is a different matter than open warfare. Recent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24107959/replicator-drones-china-taiwan-ukraine-pentagon\">rapid advances in drone technology</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24151437/ai-israel-gaza-war-hamas-artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> are likely to make the wars of the future all the more unpredictable, and potentially more destructive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of which makes the idea of putting back in the Oval Office a president who <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/china/2024/10/23/ambiguity-or-madness-where-harris-and-trump-stand-on-china\">proudly calls</a> his foreign policy approach “crazy” so dangerous.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>A world on fire</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even putting aside the issues of Trump’s temperament, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/how-big-problem-is-mental-acuity-trump/\">mental acuity</a>, or the warnings from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/10/the-generals-warning/680279/\">senior</a><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/world/video/the-lead-israel-hamas-middle-east-2024-election-donald-trump-fasciscm\"> national security</a> <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/mattis-told-woodward-he-agreed-trump\">officials</a> from his own past administration that they believe he is dangerously unqualified for the presidency, there are several reasons to believe a new Trump presidency would amplify this “revolutionary situation” rather than moderate it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, Trump does not put much value on the idea of territorial integrity. It may sound like a wonky academic point, but we tend to take for granted that in our current era, <a href=\"https://authory.com/app/content/aba6c9c34b4b34f9498e48f63f97e04de\">countries rarely conquer each other and borders are rarely changed by force</a>. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has obviously <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest\">challenged this taboo</a> against what the <a href=\"https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/purposes-and-principles-un-chapter-i-un-charter#:~:text=Article%202%20(4)%20of%20the,political%20independence%20of%20other%20States.\">UN Charter calls </a>the “threat or use of force against the territorial integrity” of other countries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As president, Trump <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/trump-russia-crimea\">reportedly told other world leaders</a> that the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, is rightfully Russian because everyone there speaks Russian. Figures close to the Trump campaign like <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-ukraine-war-crimea-russia-state-tv-1776696\">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?lang=en\">Elon Musk</a> have openly endorsed the view that Crimea is rightfully Russian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump overturned decades of US policy and international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-made-golan-heights-decision-after-a-quick-history-lesson-idUSKCN1RJ01O/\">he has described</a> as a snap decision made after a quick history lesson from his ambassador to Israel and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. He <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/trump-morocco-western-sahara-israel.html\">did the same</a> for Morocco’s claims over the disputed region of Western Sahara, in return for Morocco recognizing Israel. (In fairness, the Biden administration hasn’t reversed either of these moves — once the taboo is broken, it’s hard to reestablish.) For Trump, the president who, after all, mused about <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-eyes-a-new-real-estate-purchase-greenland-11565904223\">buying Greenland</a>, sovereignty and territorial integrity are like anything else in a deal: negotiable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, Trump doesn’t value alliances. One reason Russia has not attacked any of the countries bordering Ukraine, even as weapons flow into Ukraine from those countries, is that they are members of NATO, meaning that an attack on them could bring a military response from the alliance as a whole. It’s proof of concept for the most powerful military alliance in history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump tends to take a narrowly transactional view of alliances. His antipathy to NATO and threats to pull the US out of the alliance <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine\">have been well-documented</a>, as have his comments that treat the US defense of Asian partners like <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/15/trump-asks-tokyo-quadruple-payments-us-troops-japan/\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/trump-usfk-sma-10162024034010.html\">South Korea</a>, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8\">Taiwan</a> as a protection racket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The third related point is Trump&#8217;s attitude toward nuclear weapons. Defying many predictions <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Bomb/Fred-Kaplan/9781982107307\">made at the dawn of the nuclear age</a>, no nuclear weapon has been used in war since 1945, a record that likely involves both a bit of luck as well as the power of nuclear deterrence and the very justified fear these weapons cause. Trump, though, seems a bit more blasé on the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to former aides, Trump discussed using a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120\">nuclear weapon against North Korea</a> as president during the period he was publicly threatening Kim Jong Un’s regime with “fire and fury.” As president, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-open-skies-treaty-arms-control.html\">withdrew</a> from, or <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/05/trump-administrations-aggressive-approach-arms-negotiatons-could-backfire/165334/\">let lapse</a>, a number of key arms control treaties, most famously the Iran nuclear deal, instead preferring an approach where the US would <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-armscontrol/u-s-prepared-to-spend-russia-china-into-oblivion-to-win-nuclear-arms-race-u-s-envoy-idUSKBN22X2LS/\">build up its own nuclear arsenal</a> to spend its rivals into oblivion. Recently on the campaign trail, he suggested that a reason presidents need legal immunity is so they could <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-nuclear-president-crime/\">use nuclear weapons without fear of legal repercussions</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The issue is not just Trump’s own attitude toward nuclear weapons. In a number of US allies in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24091566/europe-nuclear-weapons-poland-germany-france-putin-trump\">Europe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-arsenal.html\">Asia</a>, there is now an active debate over whether they need nuclear deterrents of their own, driven in part by concerns over whether they could actually count on the US nuclear umbrella. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently suggested that without effective security guarantees from allies, his country might need <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-nukes-volodymyr-zelenskyy-war-ukraine-aid-russia/\">nuclear weapons</a> for protection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The international community’s success at limiting the number of nuclear powers is one of the biggest reasons why the nuclear taboo has remained intact. But a world with more nuclear powers is a world where the use of nuclear weapons is more likely, and that world becomes more likely if allies don’t believe security guarantees are worth the paper they’re printed on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>An agent of chaos in the Oval Office</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the campaign, Trump countered that the very fact that the world has become so dangerous is the reason he should be returned to the presidency. He repeatedly made the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-27/debate-trump-foreign-policy-russia-ukraine-gaza-israel\">unprovable claims</a> that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas’s October 7 attacks would not have happened had he been president. He also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/\">falsely claimed</a> that there were no terrorist attacks and no wars during his presidency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those claims elide the major military escalations in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia that took place under his tenure, as well as risky actions like the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, which prompted an Iranian missile strike on US troops in Iraq. Thankfully, no one was killed in those strikes, but commanders say up to 150 troops <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/al-asad-missile-attack-nearly-killed-150-us-troops-destroyed-30-aircraft-report.html\">could have been</a>. As president, he reportedly considered <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html\">missile strikes</a> into Mexico and the idea of sending troops into America’s neighbor — and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2024/02/07/2023-results-are-in-us-has-new-top-port-trade-partner-export-import\">No. 1 trading partner</a> — has evolved into a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html\">mainstream Republican position</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump case, essentially, is that he was able to rule the world through fear. In his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5107967/viktor-orban-hungary-donald-trump-presidential-debate\">cited</a> his ideological ally Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán: “Why is the whole world blowing up? [Orbán] said, ‘Because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid.’ And I don&#8217;t like to use the word afraid, but I&#8217;m just quoting him. &#8216;China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him.&#8217; Look at what&#8217;s going on with North Korea, by the way. He said &#8216;Russia was afraid of him.’”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-the-bully-with-a-heart-of-gold-2024-presidential-election-dd922dd6\">claimed he threatened</a> to strike Moscow if Putin attacked Ukraine, though it’s not quite clear when this was since Russian troops were in Ukrainian territory throughout the entirety of Trump’s presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also not clear that US adversaries were deterred by Trump’s tough-guy posturing. Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html\">has maintained that the punishing sanctions</a> he put on Iran after withdrawing from the nuclear deal stopped it from orchestrating attacks in the region, but he had little response after <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-does-not-want-war-after-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-idUSKBN1W10X6/\">Iran attacked Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The killing of Soleimani <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-iran-escalation-timeline-march-2020-update\">did not stop Iran’s proxies from attacking US troops in Iraq</a>. When it comes to Taiwan, he has suggested that the island is simply too small and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-the-trump-or-harris-administration-approach-taiwan/\">insignificant to be worth defending</a> — the kind of rhetoric that might influence China’s calculations over a possible invasion.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Once more unto the breach</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent weeks, world affairs have seemed to be in a bit of a holding pattern, with leaders not making major decisions until they see the results of November 5. Trump may have soured a bit on his onetime good friend Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/24072983/biden-trump-palestinians-israel-gaza-policy-different\">but in all likelihood</a> — based on his past record — he will apply even less pressure than the Biden administration has to get Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or allow in more humanitarian aid. A Trump win will likely embolden annexationists within the Israeli government, including the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-once-fringe-movement-to-reoccupy-gaza-gains-momentum-9bcb6a28\">once-fringe but increasingly vocal movement</a> in favor of reoccupying Gaza with Israeli settlers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Ukraine, Trump promised to end the conflict immediately. Judging by comments made by his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html\">running mate Sen. JD Vance</a>, though, this would likely involve pressuring Ukraine to both cede territory to Russia and accept neutrality, without security guarantees — not far from Putin’s desired outcome. When it comes to China, the outlook is more unpredictable. Trump portrays himself as the ultimate China hawk, except when he believes doing so is <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-lies-china-coronavirus-timeline.html\">bad for business</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, the question is not whether Trump is a hawk or a dove. It’s what a return of the chaos and unpredictability that marked his first tenure will mean in a world where the risk of cataclysm is now so much higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, November 6, 7:50 am ET: </em></strong><em>This story, originally published October 28, has been updated to reflect the results of the 2024 presidential election.</em><br><br><em><strong>Correction, October 28, 10 am ET: </strong>A previous version of this story misstated the year that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down.

Vice President Kamala Harris no longer has a path to victory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The trend was broader than the swing states; there was a shift toward Trump across the nation, as he significantly improved on his performance in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, it looks quite plausible that Trump could end up winning the national popular vote for the first time ever, though that will take some time to determine for sure, as it depends on the exact margin in slow-counting states like California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s win will come with a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump\">new Republican Senate majority</a>, as Democratic incumbents lost in Ohio and Montana. But as of Wednesday morning it is not yet clear which party will control the House of Representatives, and it <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/06/hakeem-jeffries-becomes-deflated-democrats-last-hope?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top\">could take some time</a> to find out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What is clear is that Trump won. How did this happen?<br><br>The blame game among Democrats will come fast and furious. But though the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380750/harris-trump-closing-message-fascism-democracy-authoritarianism\">Harris campaign’s strategy</a> is sure to be second-guessed, the extent and nationwide nature of the shift in Trump’s favor suggest she had an uphill battle all around — because of the <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">widespread unpopularity</a> of President Joe Biden and public disapproval of his record in office.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris inherited a tough situation from Biden – and ultimately could not overcome it</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Harris unexpectedly joined the presidential race in July after Biden stepped aside, she faced three formidable obstacles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first was a global trend: In the years since the pandemic, incumbent parties <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/opinion/trump-harris-inflation.html\">have been struggling</a> in wealthy democracies across the world. The reasons for this are debated, though post-reopening inflation is likely a big one. But to win, Harris would have to defy this trend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second was Biden’s unpopularity. The president was <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">historically unpopular</a> long before his disastrous debate with Trump, and poll after poll showed voters irate with his handling of the economy and immigration. Foreign policy, particularly the Israel-Gaza war that divided Democrats’ coalition, was a problem too. And since Harris had served in his administration as vice president, she had to figure out what to do about that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Typically, such dynamics would seem to point to a “change” election where the incumbent party is booted. In such elections, the opposition can often put the blame for the current state of affairs on the incumbents, make vague promises that they’ll do things differently, and ride to victory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet there was nothing typical about Harris’s opponent: Donald Trump. The fact that Trump had recently served as president in his own controversial term, with his own controversial record, seemed to present Harris with an opening. Perhaps she could brand herself the change candidate who would deliver a fresh, new approach, breaking from the failed politics of the past.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That brings us to the third obstacle: Harris’s own record. While running for president in 2019, Harris embraced a set of very progressive policy positions that Democrats <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center\">now view as politically toxic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/06/kamala-harris-interviews-election-scrutiny\">including</a> banning fracking and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing. So she had a choice to make: Should she stand by her old positions and promise bold progressive change, or should she tack to the center?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the end, Harris took a kind of middle path. She downplayed, disavowed, or simply avoided mention of many of the progressive policies she’d supported back in 2019 — but she didn’t deliberately pick fights with the left in search of centrist cred, like <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-clinton-sister-soulja-moment.html\">Bill Clinton did</a> in his 1992 presidential campaign. Harris wanted to keep the Democratic coalition happy, pleasing as many people as she could, rather than taking sides in any factional fights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addressing Biden’s record, too, Harris tried to strike a balance. She decided not to criticize Biden, throw him under the bus, or break with him — or the Biden-Harris administration’s policies&nbsp;— in any significant way. When pressed about voter anger over inflation and unauthorized immigration, she did not acknowledge error. Rather, she tried to argue that the economy was doing well now, and blamed Trump for not supporting a bipartisan immigration bill. And she did not shift on Israel-Gaza.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s hope was that she’d done enough to present herself as a new face, and that the fundamental unfitness of Donald Trump — and his unpopular record on issues like abortion and his attempt to steal the 2020 election — would ultimately prove to be decisive to voters disgruntled with both parties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That hope was in vain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, much of the public was more resentful of inflation under Biden than they were about Trump’s attempted election theft. And so voters turned back to the candidate they kicked out of office just four years ago.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

So what does this mean for reproductive rights on the federal level? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The short answer is that there are many ways Trump could ban abortion, and the most likely way isn’t through Congress, even with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/republicans-senate-control.html\">Republican-controlled Senate</a>.&nbsp;(It is not yet clear whether Republicans will take control of the House.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The long answer is that as a candidate, Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/373046/trump-republicans-ivf-abortion-reproductive-rights-election\">waffled on his positions on abortion</a>. Despite frequently <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-was-able-kill-roe-v-wade-rcna84897\">bragging</a> about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>Trump started to soften his tune in the months leading up to the election, especially as his vice presidential pick JD Vance began generating negative media attention <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jd-vance-advocated-abortion-illegal-nationally_n_66984d11e4b076f190eb37a1\">for his anti-abortion views</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Election Day drew nearer, Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1827007862830452738\">began insisting</a> he’d be “great for women and their reproductive rights” but he also repeatedly dodged questions about whether he’d veto any national abortion bans that land on his desk. At the presidential debate in September, Trump refused to answer that question multiple times, insisting it wouldn’t be necessary since abortion rights are now a matter of state discretion. By October, though, he finally came out to say he would veto a federal abortion ban, posting on social media that he would “<a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1841295548109955091\">not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, that’s not as reassuring as it sounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Federal abortion bans in 2025 are not likely to take the form of bills landing on the president’s desk. Any bill out of Congress would still require some bipartisan agreement unless lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21424582/filibuster-joe-biden-2020-senate-democrats-abolish-trump\">overturned the filibuster</a>.<strong> </strong>Republican senators have already <a href=\"https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/senate-republicans-say-they-will-preserve-filibuster/\">promised to preserve the filibuster</a> in a Trump administration, and the anti-abortion movement, for its part, has not been counting on the GOP to push bills with a simple majority. Given the widespread support for abortion rights across the US, passing a federal ban would also be politically dangerous for congressional lawmakers from swing or moderate districts, making the near-term prospect of such efforts highly unlikely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Quite frankly, unless something really unusual happens in this election, neither side is going to have the votes in Congress to pass a national law,” Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-debate-2024-election-abortion-64c739e99ffa1ad51b973e420e1fe92d\">told the Associated Press</a> in early October. “So that wasn’t really at the top of our list anyway.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They do have a list, though.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sending abortion pills by mail is more at risk</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One agenda item at the top of the anti-abortion movement’s list is enforcement of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained\">the Comstock Act</a>, an 1873 federal law that could prohibit anything associated with abortion from being sent in the mail. Such a ban could mean not only restricting abortion medication —&nbsp;the most common method used to end a pregnancy in the US — but also any medical equipment used during abortion procedures, like speculums, suction catheters, and dilators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We don’t need a federal abortion ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Jonathan Mitchell, the legal architect <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/8/31/22650303/supreme-court-abortion-texas-sb8-jackson-roe-wade-greg-abbott\">behind a 2021 law in Texas</a> that effectively banned abortion in that state, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html\">told the New York Times</a> earlier this year. Mitchell urged anti-abortion groups to &#8220;keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election&#8221; regarding this strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Comstock Act was rendered moot by <em>Roe </em>in the 1970s but never formally repealed, and now, with <em>Roe </em>gone, many conservatives see it as an ideal vehicle for restricting abortion nationwide, precisely because it wouldn’t require the passage of a new federal law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For months Trump dodged journalists&#8217; questions regarding the Comstock Act, but by August, he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/26/nx-s1-5090224/trump-abortion-pills-comstock\">finally said</a> he would not use the old statute to ban abortion drugs in the mail. However, many people in his close orbit, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/\">including the vice president-elect</a>, are on record urging the opposite, and it was a core item in Project 2025, the notorious policy blueprint drafted by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">the Heritage Foundation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/politics/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation.html\">many people close to Trump’s campaign</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump could also ban abortion by appointing anti-abortion leaders to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tz2BUuzTmE\">control key federal agencies</a> that could use executive power to restrict reproductive rights, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said her top priority is to push Trump to appoint anti-abortion leaders to executive agencies so they can integrate anti-abortion policies into existing federal programs. “I think reversing the Biden-Harris abortion agenda will be vibrant, it’ll be active,” she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/opinion/kristan-hawkins-abortion-republicans-trump.html\">told the New York Times</a> over the summer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hawkins said her group’s second priority will be to push HHS to defund Planned Parenthood. While federal funds are already barred from financing abortion, Planned Parenthood receives federal money from the Office of Population Affairs for family planning and preventive health services, including contraception, cancer screenings, and STI testing. (In 2019, Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/14/20805628/planned-parenthood-title-x-trump-birth-control\">issued a rule to limit this money</a>, which was <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2021/10/title-x-contraception-family-planning/\">subsequently reversed</a> under the Biden administration.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Appointing anti-abortion leaders to agencies like the FDA and DOJ could affect anti-abortion litigation. In October, three Republican attorneys general (Raúl Labrador in Idaho, Kris Kobach in Kansas, and Andrew Bailey in Missouri) filed a lawsuit to force the FDA <a href=\"https://theweek.com/politics/gop-abortion-pill-republican-states-fda-mifepristone\">to heavily restrict access to mifepristone</a>, one of two drugs used to induce abortions. (Though medication abortion has a lower risk of complication than many other widely available drugs, it has faced stricter regulation in the US largely for political reasons. Since 2016, the FDA has gradually reduced these restrictions, including allowing for telemedicine prescriptions.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/355175/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-alliiance-hippocratic-medicine-fda\">threw out a similar FDA complaint</a> over the summer, concluding the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, the Republican attorneys general believe they’ll be better able to prevail in this new attempt. Notably, they also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/health/abortion-pill-mifepristone-lawsuit.html\">argue in their complaint</a> that the FDA has violated the Comstock Act by permitting abortion pills to be sent by mail. While a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/application-comstock-act-mailing-prescription-drugs-can-be-used-abortions\">2022 Biden DOJ opinion ruled that</a> the Comstock Act doesn&#8217;t criminalize mailing abortion drugs if the sender lacks intent for unlawful use, a Trump DOJ could interpret the law differently. A Trump FDA also may not fight changing rules on abortion pills at all.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The judiciary awaits</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The last major way Trump could promote a federal abortion ban is through federal court appointments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his first presidential term, for example, Trump appointed one of the most anti-abortion judges in the country — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/17/23512766/supreme-court-matthew-kacsmaryk-judge-trump-abortion-immigration-birth-control\">Matthew Kacsmaryk</a> — to a federal court in Texas. Kacsmaryk greenlighted the now-overturned legal opinion that the FDA <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/us/abortion-pill-ruling.html\">should revoke its approval of mifepristone</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s<strong> </strong>campaign has maintained close ties to Leonard Leo, the co-chair of the right-wing Federalist Society, which helped Trump vet all his anti-abortion judicial appointments in his first four years in office. (Leo also <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/supreme-court-leonard-leo-reforms-corruption-1235070458/\">helps finance groups</a> to bring cases to the Supreme Court and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/03/supreme-court-amicus-briefs-leonard-leo-00127497\">orchestrates strategy</a> for the conservative legal movement broadly.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The anti-abortion movement has been explicit that its long-term goal is “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/24090347/alabama-ivf-ruling-fetal-personhood-abortion-embryos\">fetal personhood</a>” — endowing fetuses, embryos, and fertilized eggs with full human rights and legal protections. This once-fringe idea has been gaining traction over the last few years. (Kacsmaryk also embraced the idea of “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/08/texas-judge-kacsmaryk-abortion-pills-ruling-anti-abortion-rhetoric\">unborn humans</a>” and fetal personhood.) At least 19 states have declared that fetuses at some stage of pregnancy are people, according to <a href=\"https://www.pregnancyjusticeus.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fetal-personhood-with-appendix-UPDATED-1.pdf\">a report from Pregnancy Justice</a>, a group that advocates for pregnant people’s rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In February, the Alabama Supreme Court issued a decision <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility\">that claimed frozen embryos</a> count as “children” under state law. In April, the Florida Supreme Court <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/4578252-florida-supreme-court-signals-readiness-to-rule-for-pre-born-personhood/\">signaled openness</a> to hearing a future challenge on fetal personhood when its chief justice asked whether Florida’s constitution should include “the unborn” in its equal protection statute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And in the 2022 majority opinion for <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\"><em>Dobbs v.</em> <em>Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em></a><em>, </em>the<em> </em>case that overturned <em>Roe</em>, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito seemed to lay the groundwork for a fetal personhood challenge by repeatedly emphasizing the significance of “fetal life.” Over the spring, Alito <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/justice-alito-voices-support-for-fetal-rights-in-federal-law\">also seemed to endorse the idea</a> that a fetus needed the same “stabilizing treatment” in a hospital as a pregnant patient.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Codifying a fetal personhood standard could lead not only to the outright ban of abortion but also of most forms of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24087411/anti-abortion-roe-dobbs-birth-control-contraception-ivf\">birth control</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility\">in vitro fertilization</a> (IVF). While Trump and Republican lawmakers insist they are determined to protect reproductive rights, including IVF and contraception, their anti-abortion judicial picks could do just the opposite. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Harris likely can’t count on Arizona, the swing state where she’d polled the worst, though it will take some time to count the votes there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Georgia and Arizona indeed fall to Trump — and keep in mind they haven’t been called yet, but he looks formidable there — Harris’s path to victory depends on winning <em>all three</em> of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If she loses just one in this scenario, it’s over for her. (The other remaining swing state, Nevada, will be very slow in counting, but it would be too small to make much of a difference in the Electoral College.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All three of those Rust Belt states are still close. Trump leads the current count in all three, though many uncounted votes remain from Democratic-leaning areas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But notably, outside the swing states, Trump is on track to do significantly better than he did in 2020, so a Harris win scenario depends on the Rust Belt defying an apparent nationwide shift in Trump’s favor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For instance, Biden won Virginia by 10. As of late Tuesday, with more than 80 percent of votes in the state counted, Harris led Trump by a mere 1.7 percentage points. That margin is sure to expand when more Democratic areas count, but per the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-virginia-president.html\">New York Times’s forecast of the uncounted vote,</a> she’ll likely end up with somewhere around a 5-point win, significantly worse than Biden.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similar dynamics are at play in many other states, and Trump utterly romped in Florida, winning it by about 13 percentage points. (In 2020, Trump won Florida by a little over 3 percentage points.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, it seems quite possible that Trump could win the national popular vote. It will take some time to determine that, as it would depend on the final margin in slow-counting states like California.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what really matters is how the Rust Belt states end up, and we&#8217;re still waiting to learn that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, November 6, at 1:07 am ET: </em></strong><em>This piece, originally published on the evening of November 5, was updated to include Georgia being called for Trump.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Having won power democratically, Trump is now in a position to enact his long-proposed plans to hollow out American democracy from within.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and his team have developed detailed plans for turning the federal government into an extension of his will: an instrument for carrying out his oft-promised “retribution” against President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and anyone else who has opposed him. Trump’s inner circle, purged of nearly anyone who might challenge him, is ready to enact his will. And the Supreme Court, in its wisdom, has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">granted him sweeping immunity</a> from his actions in office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In nearly every conceivable way, a second Trump administration will likely be more dangerous than the first, a term that ended in over 1 million deaths from Covid-19 and a riot at the Capitol. A predictable crisis — a president consolidating power in his own hands and using it to punish his enemies —&nbsp;looms on the horizon, with many unpredictable crises likely waiting in the wings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet as dire as things are, America has reserves it can draw on to withstand the coming assault. Over the course of the country’s long democratic history, it has built up robust systems for checking abuses of power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">America’s federal structure gives blue states control over key powers like election administration. Its independent judiciary stood strong during Trump’s first term. Its professional, apolitical military will likely push back against unlawful orders. Its politically active citizenry has a proven capacity to take to the streets. And America’s world-leading media will fiercely resist any effort to compromise its independence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><em>[We need&nbsp;strong, independent journalism more than ever right now.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.vox.com/click/37364084.147004/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9zdXBwb3J0LW5vdz91ZWlkPTU2MjJhMGE0YWNkYjM2OGViMjZhMDUyNTY0NGUyZDhm/6602f29095c4620665058440B0440c862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Become a Vox Member today</a>&nbsp;to support our work.]</em></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No country at America’s level of political-economic development has ever collapsed into authoritarianism. There are some reasonably close modern analogues, most worryingly modern Hungary, but even they are different in crucial respects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not to make an argument for complacency or naive optimism. Quite the opposite: The next four years will be American democracy’s gravest threat since the Civil War; if it survives them, it will surely do so battered, bruised, and battle-scarred.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this realism should not be cause for succumbing to despair. As grim as things feel now, it’s possible that — if people take the gravity of the threat seriously — the republic may come out intact on the other side.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump’s scary second-term agenda, explained</h1>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We do not know why, exactly, America’s voters have chosen to return Trump to high office. The data isn’t fully in, let alone analyzed in detail. But as murky as the electoral picture remains, certain elements of the policy future are crystal clear. Trump’s own comments, his campaign’s statements, and allied documents like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">Project 2025</a> give us a relatively coherent picture of what the agenda will be in the next Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of it resembles what you’d see from any other Republican president. Trump will appoint corporate allies to lead federal agencies, where they will work to slash regulations on issues ranging from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/03/trump-labor-union-election/\">workplace safety standards</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-02/climate-skeptics-are-hatching-big-plans-for-a-second-trump-term\">pollution</a>. He has already proposed <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/2024-09-20-trumps-tax-cut-a-rama-total-so-far-9-75-trillion/\">regressive tax cuts</a> without off-setting hikes, which would increase the federal deficit in the same way as President George W. Bush’s fiscal policy did. He will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/366495/trump-medication-abortion-mifepristone\">likely take steps to curtail abortion access</a>, end <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">federal police efforts to rein in abusive police</a>, and crack down on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/20/trump-lgbtq-second-term-agenda/\">federal protections for trans people</a> — all examples of how his agenda would hurt certain groups of people, typically already vulnerable ones, more than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s biggest breaks with his party in traditional policy areas will likely come on trade, immigration, and foreign policy. Trump has proposed a “universal” tariff on imported goods, a mass deportation campaign that detains suspected “illegals” in camps, and <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-can-t-withdraw-from-nato--but-he-could--quiet-quit\">weakening America’s commitment to the NATO alliance</a>. These policies would together be a recipe for economic decline, domestic turmoil, and global chaos — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/380060/trump-world-risks-war\">at an already chaotic time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But perhaps the most dangerous Trump policies will come in an area that traditionally transcends partisan conflict: the nature of the American system of government itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Throughout the campaign, Trump has proven himself obsessed with two ideas: exerting personal control over the federal government, and exacting “retribution” against Democrats who challenged him and the prosecutors who indicted him. His team has, obligingly, provided detailed plans for doing both of these things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This process begins with something called Schedule F, an executive order Trump issued at the end of his first term but never got to implement. Schedule F reclassifies a large chunk of the professional civil service —&nbsp;likely <a href=\"https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/what-mandate-for-leadership-says\">upward of 50,000 people</a> — as political appointees. Trump could fire these nonpartisan officials and replace them with cronies: people who would follow his orders, no matter how dubious. Trump has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">revive Schedule F “immediately”</a> upon returning to office, and there is no reason to doubt him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Between a newly compliant bureaucracy and leadership ranks purged of first-term dissenting voices like former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Trump will face little resistance as he attempts to implement policies that threaten core democratic freedoms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Trump and his team have already proposed many of them. Notable examples include <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-suggests-re-elected-biden-indicted-rcna132810\">investigating leading Democrats on questionable charges</a>, prosecuting <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">local election administrators</a>, using regulatory authority for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election\">retribution against corporations that cross him</a>, and either shuttering public broadcasters or <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/09/what-would-project-2025-do-for-or-to-journalism/\">turning them into propaganda mouthpieces</a>. Trump and his allies have claimed unilateral executive authority to take all of these actions. (It remains unclear which party will control the House, but Republicans will be in charge of the Senate for at least the next two years.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, all this executive activity is aimed at turning the United States into a larger version of Hungary — a country whose leadership and policies are regularly praised by Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance, and Project 2025 leader Kevin Roberts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hungary still has elections and nominal free speech rights; there are no tanks in the streets or concentration camps for regime critics. But it is a place where everything —&nbsp;from the national elections authority down to government art agencies — has been twisted to punish dissent and spread the government’s propaganda. Every aspect of government has been bent to ensure that national elections are contests in which the opposition never has a fighting chance. It is a kind of stealth autocratization, one that maintains the veneer of democracy while hollowing it from within.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is why the second Trump presidency is an extinction-level threat to American democracy. The governing agenda Trump and his allies explicitly laid out is a systematic attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/07/why-special-republican-relationship-hungary-so-worrying/679035/\">turn Washington into Budapest-on-the-Potomac</a>, to deliberately and quietly destroy democracy from within.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Democracy is not lost</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is important to remember that, as dire as things are, the United States is not Hungary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Prime Minister Viktor Orbán came to power in 2010, he had a two-thirds majority in the country’s parliament — one that allowed him to pass a new constitution that twisted election rules in his party’s favor and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/world/europe/19iht-hungary19.html\">imposed political controls on the judiciary</a>. Trump has no such majority, and the US Constitution is nearly impossible to amend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">America’s federal structure also creates quite a few checks on the national government’s power. Election administration in America is done at the state level, which makes it very hard for Trump to seize control over it from Washington. A lot of prosecution is done by district attorneys who don’t answer to Trump and might resist federal bullying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The American media is much bigger and more robust than its Hungarian peers. Orbán brought the press to heel by, among other things, politicizing government ad purchasing —&nbsp;a stream of revenue that the American press, for all our problems, does not depend on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But most fundamentally, the American population has something Hungarians didn’t: advanced warning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the form of subtle authoritarianism pioneered in Hungary was novel in 2010, it’s well understood today. Orbán managed to come across as a “normal” democratic leader until it was too late to undo what he had done; Trump is taking office with roughly half the voting public primed to see him as a threat to democracy and resist as such. He can expect major opposition to his most authoritarian plans not only from the elected opposition, but from the federal bureaucracy, lower levels of government, civil society, and the people themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the case against despair.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As grim as things seem now, little in politics is a given —&nbsp;especially not the outcome of a struggle as titanic as the one about to unfold in the United States. While Trump has four years to attack democracy, using a playbook he and his team have been developing since the moment he left office, defenders of democracy have also had time to prepare and develop countermeasures. Now is the time to begin deploying them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has won the presidency, which gives him a tremendous amount of power to make his antidemocratic dreams into power. But it is not unlimited power, and there are robust means of resistance. The fate of the American republic will depend on how willing Americans are to take up the fight.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The GOP successfully flipped key states including West Virginia and Ohio, while holding off unexpectedly competitive challenges in places like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380855/nebraska-dan-osborn-deb-fischer-senate\">Nebraska</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380707/texas-senate-race-allred-cruz-2024-election\">Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans’ victories come as former President Donald Trump leads in electoral votes, with multiple swing states still outstanding. As of 2 am ET, the presidential race has not been called for either candidate, though <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/05/2024-election-results-live-coverage-updates-analysis/blue-wall-trump-battlegrounds-00187653\">early results seem to suggest an advantage for Trump</a>, with Vice President Kamala Harris’s plausible paths to victory narrowing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In their campaigns, Republican Senate candidates leaned heavily on critiques of Democrats’ economic policies as many voters continued to grapple with inflation and high costs of living. They also kept up fear-mongering on immigration, arguing that only they could offer solutions to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum\">border crossing surges</a>, like the one in 2023. Overall, because they weren’t in control of the Senate, Republican candidates were able to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment — and current discontent — as they campaigned to take back certain seats. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans’ gains could have major implications for a potential Trump or Harris administration. If Trump wins, the Republican Senate would effectively offer him a blank check on appointments, and allow him to resume stacking the courts with his judges. Depending on the outcome of House races, a GOP Senate could also enable a possible Trump administration to pursue policy priorities like rolling back the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/aca-trump-repeal-affordable-care-act/index.html\">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) and renewing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit\">corporate tax cuts</a>. If Harris wins, the Senate could well stymie key judicial appointees, and block her legislative goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Republican Senate control could mean</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The role the Senate will play in the next few years will depend heavily on who wins the presidential race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The last Trump presidency was ultimately illustrative of what happens when both the White House and Senate are held by Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In that scenario, Trump was able to advance his judges at a rapid pace, reshaping the Circuit Court and Supreme Court with conservative picks. In total, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-judicial-nominations-judge-appointments/\">Trump was able to get 234 judges confirmed</a>, including the three who now sit on the Supreme Court who proved integral to overturning <em>Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, Trump faced little backlash or accountability for his rhetoric or policy decisions throughout his term, including attempts to implement <a href=\"https://time.com/5322856/trump-travel-ban-republicans/\">a Muslim travel ban</a> or to shut down the government as leverage for funding for a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-republicans-all-but-surrender-to-trump-on-wall-despite-shutdowns-toll/2019/01/20/dc3efb96-1b56-11e9-a804-c35766b9f234_story.html\">wall along the US-Mexico border</a>. Although some Republican senators spoke out, few truly vocalized their opposition to Trump or scrutinized his actions. When Trump was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22227519/house-second-impeachment-trump-incitement-insurrection\">impeached for his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, for example, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/2/13/22280838/senate-acquits-donald-trump-impeachment-vote\">only seven Republicans voted to convict</a> him — the rest voted to acquit him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Republicans maintain control of the House, a GOP Congress could also help Trump advance his legislative agenda. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has focused more on executive actions he’d like to take (such as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress\">tariffs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">immigration</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance\">international relations</a>) than on a congressional agenda. However, Republicans have long expressed an interest in curbing access to the ACA. One issue lawmakers will weigh in the next year is the expiration of ACA premium subsidies, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-republican-senate-health-care-policy/\">Stat reports</a>. House Speaker Mike Johnson has emphasized already that he’s interested in major “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html\">reform</a>” to the health care act as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html\">tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017</a> are also up for renewal, and will be another issue lawmakers in the next Congress will need to tackle. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-trump-tax-cuts-election-2024-what-to-know/\">Trump has suggested cutting</a> the corporate tax rate and has floated some income tax cuts too. Regardless of whether they take the House, Senate Republicans will likely advocate for those cuts. And Republicans could push, too, for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/republicans-climate-change-fossil-fuels.html\">expanded oil and gas drilling leases</a> that Democrats had previously curbed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Senate Republicans have already signaled that they plan to be as obstructionist as possible if they’re dealing with a Harris administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, both Sens. John Thune (R-SD) and John Cornyn (R-TX), two likely successors to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/29/politics/cornyn-thune-supreme-court-plans/index.html\">have told CNN</a> they aren’t sure if they would hold a vote for any potential Harris Supreme Court nominees. With the majority, the GOP can try to block <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377729/kamala-harris-supreme-court-electoral-college-senate-constitution\">any Harris judicial appointment from advancing</a>, much like they once did with former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and some of his lower court picks. In the case of Garland, the GOP successfully refused to ever hold a confirmation hearing or vote for him — and were able to prevent him from getting seated on the bench.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They could do the same for other Cabinet roles as well, and they could also block legislation from advancing. Harris campaigned heavily on working to enact policies that require congressional approval, including sweeping <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/dnc-harris-speech-election-2024/card/harris-pledges-to-sign-bipartisan-border-bill-csVc4bVyNHlyx9yqnyyE\">immigration</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5172251/how-much-power-does-a-president-have-when-it-comes-to-abortion-access\">abortion reform</a>. Those policy goals are unlikely to become a reality in a GOP-controlled Senate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless of whether Trump or Harris is in the White House, expect the upper chamber to play a significant role in advancing or hampering their efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>[Fearless journalism needs your support now more than ever. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/support-now\">Become a Vox Member today</a>.]</em></strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

For more of our 2024 campaign coverage,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers\">click here</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though votes are still being counted and several battleground states remain to be called, we can see a handful of trends developing in the 2024 election. Former President Donald Trump is once again showing that he can turn already ruby-red parts of the country even more Republican. And in the suburbs, where Democrats have made gains throughout the Trump era, those gains seem inconsistent at best this time around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, though it’s still too early to say for sure, it appears that Trump has made large-scale inroads with voters of color, particularly in Latino communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Exit polls, the main way commentators and journalists try to make sense of the electoral trends happening nationally, are notoriously unreliable, and it will be weeks, or months, before they paint a full picture. But here are some trends that appear clear so far.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump has been able to maximize his support in rural areas</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everyone expected Trump to dominate in rural areas. What wasn’t clear, however, was whether he could improve on the already large margins by which he won in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, it seems that he has. Early in the night, Trump built big cushions of support in Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and North Carolina. That trend continued throughout the night. In rural counties across Pennsylvania, for example, the general trend as votes were counted was that Trump was able to both increase turnout and increase his margin of support in the GOP heartland.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One obvious example of this rural surge: Lackawanna County, home to President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton, swung 5.6 points to the right from 2020 — even though Kamala Harris still looked on track to win the county by the smallest of margins.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The suburban shift toward Democrats stalled</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To offset those expected GOP margins of support in rural places, Democrats have had to rely not just on winning urban centers, but getting a boost in surrounding suburbs. Those suburbs have been trending toward Democrats since 2016 — but it’s not clear today that this leftward lurch has continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first clear sign of trouble in the suburbs came northern Virginia’s Loudoun County, a Washington, DC, suburb with a large concentration of college-educated voters. Biden won it by about 25 points in 2020; this year, Harris appears to have won it by just about 17 points.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Indiana’s Hamilton County, seen as perhaps an early indicator of other trends because of its Indianapolis suburbs, Harris was trailing Trump by about 6 points — running nearly even with Biden’s performance in 2020 (Trump +7).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, other suburbs around the country did continue that Democratic drift. In the suburban counties surrounding Atlanta, for example, Harris was on track to do a bit better than Biden in 2020, increasing the Democratic margin in Cobb and Gwinnett counties by about a point each.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Democratic support among voters of color, especially Latinos, is continuing to erode</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pre-election polling indicated that Trump was on track to post historic gains in support from nonwhite voters. Though we don’t have great national data yet (early exit polls can be unreliable), we did see some dramatic shifts from places with large Latino populations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most obvious example is Florida. The state moved in a decidedly Republican direction, and its Latino electorate did as well. Miami-Dade County, which used to be a reliably Democratic county with a huge Cuban American population, swung for Trump by double digits. Osceola, a county with a large Puerto Rican community, also flipped for Trump, after Biden won it by 14 points. And more specifically, cities with large Puerto Rican and Cuban populations, like Kissimmee and Hialeah, saw a dramatic drop-off in Democratic support, according to Democratic firm <a href=\"https://x.com/carlosodio/status/1854008462826488012\">Equis Research’s analysis</a>. One caveat: Florida’s Latino population is unlike those in other parts of the country&nbsp;— it’s much more diverse in terms of national origin and had been already shifting toward Republicans after 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, similar swings happened in South Texas, where Trump expanded his margins in the county he won in 2020, Zapata; flipped two more counties (Starr and Cameron); and ran nearly even with Harris in Hidalgo and Webb counties. Beyond those two states, which drifted further red, national exit polls, as unreliable as they may be, seem to be painting a broader picture of eroding Democratic support with Latinos: <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls\">Early results</a> suggest Democrats just barely won the majority of these voters, after exit polls in 2020 signaled Biden won about two-thirds.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Some voters in Nevada, for instance, are reportedly having their ballots rejected because the signature they used to sign their ballots <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/nevada-voter-signature-matching-election-forensics/\">does not resemble the signature the state has on file</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s also good news: Often, a voter whose mailed-in ballot would otherwise not be counted can “cure” that ballot and then their vote will count. All “curing” means is that voters are given a chance to fix the disqualifying error. The rules vary by state, and if you want to know what the rules are in your home state, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-15-states-with-signature-cure-processes\">the National Conference of State Legislatures lists them here</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One important thing to keep in mind is that, if you did cast a ballot that needs to be cured, both state election officials and your political party may attempt to contact you by phone, text, or email. So, <em>if you voted by mail and receive a call from an unfamiliar number in the next few days, it’s a good idea to answer it</em> — it may be someone warning you that you are about to be disenfranchised if you don’t act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of the seven swing states, five allow ballots to be cured in at least some circumstances:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arizona</strong>: In Arizona, ballots can be tossed out if an election official determines that the signature on the envelope containing the ballot <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/title-16/section-16-550/\">doesn’t match the signature</a> in a voter’s registration record. State law, however, requires election officials to “make reasonable efforts to contact the voter, advise the voter of the inconsistent signature and allow the voter to correct.” The voter has until the fifth business day after the election to correct the signature.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Georgia</strong>: In Georgia, a ballot <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-21/chapter-2/article-10/section-21-2-386/\">can be rejected for a number of reasons</a>, including if the voter incorrectly writes their driver’s license number when they submit their ballot. If a ballot is rejected, state law says election officials “shall promptly notify the elector of such rejection.” The voter then has three days to cure the ballot, although what they are required to do to cure it varies depending on what caused the ballot to be rejected.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Michigan</strong>: In Michigan, ballots can also <a href=\"https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Laws/MCL?objectName=MCL-168-766\">be rejected due to a signature matching problem</a>. To cure the ballot, the voter must fill out a cure form and return it by 5 pm on the third day after the election.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nevada</strong>: Nevada also can reject ballots because of signature-matching problems. According to state law, if that happens, “the clerk shall contact the voter” and inform them of what they need to do to cure the ballot. The voter then must cure the ballot by 5 pm on the sixth day following the election.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>North Carolina</strong>: North Carolina ballots can be <a href=\"https://ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_163/GS_163-230.1.html\">rejected for a variety of clerical errors</a>. Should that happen, state law says “the county board of elections shall promptly notify the voter of the deficiency and the manner in which the voter may cure the deficiency.”&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again, if you cast a ballot that needs to be cured, you will likely be contacted either by election officials, by your political party, or both. For this reason, voters who cast their ballot by mail should be alert to phone calls from unfamiliar numbers, as the caller may be trying to inform them that their ballot needs to be cured. If you miss that call, and your ballot is disqualified, you could lose your chance to vote in this election.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

We’re not going to let it happen anymore.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those aren’t empty promises. Presidents have wide latitude on foreign policy and can enter or nix many international agreements unilaterally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It really does vary, agreement to agreement, in terms of what the exit criteria are, but there are very few where a congressional approval for withdrawal is required,” Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his first term, Trump pursued what he called an “America First” foreign policy, which saw him withdraw from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw\">major international agreements</a>, launch a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/6/17542482/china-trump-trade-war-tariffs\">trade war with China</a>, verbally <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta\">antagonize allies</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/26/18239694/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-vietnam-summit\">attempt complex negotiations</a> with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/16/17577096/trump-putin-meeting-nato\">several of the US’s adversaries</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This campaign season, he has promised to continue attempts to dramatically alter or otherwise hamper international agreements, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517\">including the NATO security alliance</a>, in ways that could fundamentally weaken the US’s place in the global order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of Trump’s stated foreign policy positions, his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/2/9/24064244/trump-economy-china-tarriffs-today-explained\">planned protectionist trade policy</a> would likely be the most immediately damaging to Americans; his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress\">proposed tariff increases</a> would spark a global trade war and drive up prices for American consumers. In the longer term, his ideas about the US role in international affairs could erode US diplomacy and undermine institutions like NATO and the UN. That could have lasting effects on the geopolitical landscape, much as his first-term foreign policy decisions did.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trump’s isolationist first administration, briefly explained</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump withdrew the US from multiple international agreements, including the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw\">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), often called the Iran deal</a>. That agreement, negotiated in 2015 under President Barack Obama, essentially eased US sanctions on Iran in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program and allowing greater international oversight of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“​The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into,” Trump said when the agreement was terminated in 2018. Since then, <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/a-worthless-withdrawal-two-years-since-president-trump-abandoned-the-jcpoa/\">Iran has built up its stockpile of enriched uranium</a> and increased its missile supply, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/no-evidence-iran-rushing-build-nuclear-weapon-cia-director-says-rcna174004\">reportedly bringing the program much closer to developing nuclear capabilities</a> — despite the Trump administration’s promise that Iran would never have them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, which commits all signatories to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Other diplomatic casualties of the Trump administration include the <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-withdraw-united-states-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-inf-treaty/\">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a> (INF), a Cold War-era pact between the US and Russia limiting the development of short- and intermediate-range nuclear weapons; the <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/openskies\">Open Skies Treaty</a>, which allows signatories to conduct military reconnaissance flyovers; and two <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-wants-out-of-global-migration-discussions-cities-want-in/\">international migration agreements</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also repeatedly critiqued NATO during his first term. He argued the other countries in the military alliance weren’t spending enough on defense (and they did <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine\">begin to spend more</a>), questioned whether the organization was still necessary, and in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/trumps-sudden-and-dangerous-troop-withdrawal-germany\">withdrew almost 10,000 troops stationed in Germany</a>, a decision Vice President Kamala Harris’s foreign policy adviser Philip Gordon said seemed “designed to send a message about the limit of what Americans are prepared to spend to defend foreign borders and, more broadly, uphold world order.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Trump could do in a second term</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a second term, Trump has pledged to again withdraw from international agreements and organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He explicitly promised to pull the US out of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQcZZbCFL2I\">Paris climate accords again</a>, after the US reentered the agreement under President Joe Biden. And Trump could limit US cooperation with UN organizations that his administration was critical of, like the <a href=\"https://2017-2021.state.gov/update-on-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/\">World Health Organization</a>. He has also floated a variety of new tariffs — at times calling for new taxes as high as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/14/trump-rally-speech-north-carolina-economy-jd-vance/?itid=lk_inline_manual_30\">20 percent on US trading partners</a> and recently threatening to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/04/trump-mexico-tariff-trade/\">impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on Mexico</a>, the US’s <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/topcm.html\">largest trading partner for goods in 2024</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One partnership that would be difficult for Trump to alter is the US agreement with NATO. The NATO charter doesn’t have a withdrawal mechanism. As Kavanagh explained, “Recently, Congress passed a law specifically aimed at NATO that would require congressional approval for withdrawal from NATO,” in an effort to further protect the US membership in the alliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even with that safeguard, there are ways a second Trump administration could hollow out NATO or other US military pacts, such as the one between the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-horizons-korea-us-japan-trilateral-cooperation\">US, South Korea, and Japan</a> meant to deter China and North Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“​​Trump can decide to change US posture in any country, whether that&#8217;s Asia or in Europe, and just pull forces out, close bases, stop investing in sort of the joint infrastructure and on all the committees and logistical pieces that keep an alliance running, that keep us tied into allies and partners,” Kavanagh said. “Any president could do that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But neglecting NATO and alienating those allies is not the only way a Trump administration could damage US foreign policy and diplomacy, according to James Lindsay, a senior fellow in US foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A lot is going to depend upon how he staffs his administration,” Lindsay told Vox. “We don&#8217;t have a good sense of who would be a secretary of state, secretary of defense, [or] national security adviser.” The people in those positions could have serious implications for all kinds of foreign policy decisions, from how (and if) ceasefire negotiations are conducted to which countries receive weapons transfers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the absence of a robust, experienced diplomatic apparatus, Trump may try to negotiate foreign policy largely on his own, as he has in the past. Those attempts had poor outcomes, like when his <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-at-the-us-north-korea-summit-in-hanoi/\">attempt to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/1/20659074/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-dmz\">ended in 2019</a> with no guarantees on the North Korean side to stop nuclear weapons development and no fundamental change in the relationship. His talks with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/20/trump-peace-deal-taliban/\">the Taliban</a> led to the withdrawal of US and NATO forces and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22626240/taliban-afghanistan-baradar\">collapse of the civilian government in Afghanistan</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has made big promises on the types of negotiations he’d conduct as president —&nbsp;like ending the war between <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893\">Russia and Ukraine in 24 hours</a> —&nbsp;but as was the case in his first term, the reality is likely to be much harder and messier than he’s suggested.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

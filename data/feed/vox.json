And the only remotely viable alternative to him, for now, is a massively unpopular, geriatric Democrat who just <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">advertised his inability to speak</a> in complete sentences on national television.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the reality that confronts us in the wake of Joe Biden’s catastrophic performance at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">Thursday night’s presidential debate</a>. A comprehensive account of how we arrived at this grim moment would require a multi-volume history. But one cause of our current predicament is worth highlighting: Democratic presidential candidates repeatedly failed to select running mates with an eye to their party’s long-term best interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice presidents do not always go on to become presidential nominees. But they very often do. In partisan primaries, few résumé items are more advantageous than a tenure as a beloved president’s heir apparent. Given this reality, a presidential nominee should aim to pick a running mate whom they consider <em>highly</em> electable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, the last two Democratic presidents did not prioritize political chops when selecting their veeps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Barack Obama didn’t choose Joe Biden because he thought that the then-Delaware senator would make a great Democratic nominee in 2016. To the contrary, by most accounts, Obama thought that Biden would be a totally nonviable candidate by the time his own hypothetical presidency ended. And he reportedly selected Biden precisely for that reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to senior Democrats who spoke with <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/joe-biden-and-barack-obamas-one-sided-embrace.html\">New York magazine’s Gabriel Debenedetti</a> in 2019, Obama had assumed that Biden would be too old to run for president by 2016. And he reasoned that this fact would render Biden an especially loyal second-in-command: Bereft of political aspirations of his own, Biden would have no compunction about putting Obama’s interests and goals above all else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As it happened, Obama misjudged his running mate in more ways than one. In hindsight, it appears likely that Biden would have been a stronger nominee in 2016 than Hillary Clinton — Obama’s hand-picked successor — proved to be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, Obama was certainly correct that — even eight years ago — Biden, then 71, was much older than an ideal presidential candidate. Instead of making the Delaware senator his running-mate, or putting his thumb on the scales for Clinton, Obama should have found a veep who was in his or her political prime and boasted a demonstrable capacity to compete in a swing state. Instead, he put his own campaign and future administration’s interests over the long-term best interests of the Democratic Party, likely damaging his own legacy in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s choice of Kamala Harris in 2020 was even more misguided. When he made that choice in August 2020, there was little basis for believing that Harris was one of the most politically formidable Democrats in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris had just mounted an exceptionally lackluster bid for the presidency. Then a California senator, Harris had entered the race for the Democratic nomination with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-more-billionaire-donors-than-any-other-democratic-candidate-2019-11\">strong donor support</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/kamala-harris-first-good-month-poll-of-the-week/index.html\">early surge in the polls</a>. Despite these early advantages, Harris failed to maintain — let alone build out — her coalition over the ensuing months, and her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nor was Harris’s electoral track record before 2020 especially encouraging. She had never won an election in a swing state or competitive district. And in her first statewide race in deep blue California in 2010, Harris defeated her Republican rival by less than 1 percentage point. Two years earlier, Barack Obama had won that state by more than 23 points.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that Biden was 77 in August 2020, the likelihood that his running-mate would one day become his party’s standard-bearer was unusually high. It was entirely plausible that health problems would force him to retire before the end of his first term, let alone his second. And were Harris to become an incumbent president, no other Democrat would stand a chance of defeating her in a contested primary. For these reasons, Biden’s primary consideration in choosing a running-mate should have been his or her electability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, he put enormous weight on demographic considerations. “I think he came to the conclusion that he should pick a Black woman,” former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/biden-harris.html#:~:text=In%20the%20end%2C%20Mr.%20Biden,might%20be%20expected%20to%20govern.\">told the New York Times</a> in the summer of 2020. “They are our most loyal voters and I think that the Black women of America deserved a Black vice-presidential candidate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without question, it is desirable for a vice presidential candidate to energize the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituencies. That is one dimension of electability. But it is not obvious that Harris actually possessed that capability; after all, her 2020 campaign resonated so little with Black voters in South Carolina that she was forced to withdraw before that state’s primary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any case, the ability to appeal to swing voters is much more electorally valuable than a penchant for pleasing loyal Democrats. Turning out a Democratic voter who would otherwise stay home increases your margin by 1 point; flipping a Republican voter into your column increases it by 2. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The desire to give historically marginalized groups representation at the apex of American power is a righteous one. Such representation does have the potential to shift cultural perceptions about race and gender in a progressive direction (although, as Obama’s presidency showed, it also <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/5/18052390/trump-2018-2016-identity-politics-democrats-immigration-race\">has the potential to catalyze a reactionary backlash</a>). But such diffuse cultural shifts are ultimately of less consequence than public policy, above all for the most vulnerable in American society. Working-class Black women have more to lose from a Congress that <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/biggest-outrage-of-trumpcare-continues-to-be-medicaid-cuts.html\">guts Medicaid</a> and a civil rights division that prioritizes <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/04/01/trump-reverse-racism-civil-rights\">anti-white discrimination</a> than they have to gain from seeing someone of their race and gender squander a national election. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, there were plenty of non-white-male Democrats with a proven record of appealing to swing voters for Biden to choose from. Amy Klobuchar had repeatedly won landslide victories in light blue Minnesota. Tammy Duckworth had unseated a Republican incumbent in a purple Illinois House district before subsequently winning election to the Senate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had demonstrated her appeal to Rust Belt independents. Tammy Baldwin had repeatedly won Senate races in Wisconsin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, Biden opted for a running mate who few in the party considered to be an optimal general election candidate, despite the fact that — were Biden to win — there was a high probability that Harris would be her party’s standard-bearer at some point in the near future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past two years, Harris’s <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">poor poll numbers</a> — and Democratic <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/30/harris-democrats-worry/\">insiders’ lack of confidence in her political acumen</a> — reduced pressure on Biden to step down, and allow his party to run a less aged and unpopular nominee. Many party leaders seemed to reason that Biden was a safer bet than his vice president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Thursday night, it looks like this view was mistaken. For all her liabilities, Harris’s approval rating is somewhat <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">better than Biden’s</a> at this point. The vice president has some gifts as an orator and no shortage of vitality. Given the immense difficulty of coordinating behind a non-Biden candidate at this late date, there’s a plausible case that she is now the Democratic Party’s best option. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Considering the importance of keeping Trump out of power, however, we deserve a better option. And if Obama and Biden had prioritized their party’s long-term best interests when choosing their running mates, we would likely have one.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that a federal law, providing that anyone who “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-fischer-64\">obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so</a>” commits a very serious federal crime, does not actually apply to everyone who obstructs, influences, or impedes an official proceeding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Worse, the Court does so in a case involving a January 6 insurrectionist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Approximately <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/25/24108640/supreme-court-january-6-insurrection-fischer-united-states-obstruct\">330 people</a> who allegedly participated in that insurrection are charged with violating the statute at issue in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-5572_l6hn.pdf\"><em>Fischer v. United States</em></a>, including Donald Trump. So Friday’s decision could potentially undermine much of the Justice Department’s ability to prosecute hundreds of people who attacked the US Capitol.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the surface, in other words, the <em>Fischer</em> decision could not play more into the growing narrative that the Supreme Court is a partisan institution that protects the interests of the Republican Party, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/22/24133424/supreme-court-donald-trump-immunity-january-6-president\">and of Trump in particular</a>. How else can one explain the Court’s decision that the anti-obstruction law does not do what it says it does?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The full story of <em>Fischer</em>, however, is slightly more nuanced. For one thing, while five of the justices in the majority are Republicans, Biden-appointed Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson joined these five in the majority. Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the dissent, which was joined by the Court’s two remaining Democrats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, while Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion does not read the obstruction law according to its plain text, it does rely on rules governing statutory interpretation that the Court has, at least, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/25/24108640/supreme-court-january-6-insurrection-fischer-united-states-obstruct\">applied in less politically charged cases</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Fischer</em>, in other words, is less a case about justices tying themselves into knots in order to help out January 6 defendants than it is a case about how easy it is for judges to read a seemingly unambiguous law in multiple ways. The rules governing statutory interpretation are not clear, and it is not even certain when judges should apply one of those rules as opposed to a different one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And that means each of the justices could have chosen either outcome in the <em>Fischer</em> case.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So what did <em>Fischer</em> actually hold?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <em>Fischer </em>case involves a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512\">federal law with two separate subsections</a>. Subsection (1) applies to anyone who “corruptly &#8230; alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, subsection (2), the provision many January 6 defendants are accused of violating, applies to someone who “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Barrett writes in dissent, the most natural reading of this statute is that anyone who broke into the US Capitol to disrupt certification of the 2020 election “can be tried for ‘obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding.’” Subsection (2) of this law “is a very broad provision.” The case that it applies to January 6 defendants “seems open and shut.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, the overwhelming majority of lower court judges who heard similar cases reached the same result as Barrett.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roberts’s reading of the statute is, to put it mildly, less intuitive. He claims that subsection (2)’s broad language is “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-5572_l6hn.pdf\">linked to its ‘surrounding words</a>.’” So subsection (2)’s broad language is “limited by the preceding list of criminal violations” in subsection (1).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Therefore, under Roberts’s reading, subsection (2) must be read to only capture activities similar to the ones described in subsection (1) — that is, activity like altering, destroying, mutilating, or concealing a record or document. The way that plays out, according to Roberts, is that January 6 defendants can only be charged under this statute if they created false evidence or otherwise impaired “the availability or integrity of other things used in an official proceeding beyond the ‘record[s], document[s], or other object[s]’ enumerated in (c)(1), such as witness testimony or intangible information.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let’s stipulate that Roberts’s interpretation of the statute is super confusing and that it does not comport with the way most English speakers would read this law. The oddest thing about <em>Fischer</em> is that there are actually some Supreme Court precedents that support Roberts’s decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Consider <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3213681007315665467&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Yates v. United States</em></a> (2015), which involved a very similar dispute in a much less politically charged case. The law in <em>Yates</em> targeted anyone who “knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object” with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation or proceeding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The defendant was a commercial fisherman who caught undersized red groupers, then ordered a crew member to toss these fish overboard “to prevent federal authorities from confirming that he had harvested undersized fish.” <em>Yates</em> asked whether these undersized fish are a “tangible object” within the meaning of the federal statute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Remarkably, a majority of the justices concluded that they are not. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s plurality opinion concluded that a court should “avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words,” and thus the term “tangible object” should be read “to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of tangible objects involving records and documents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ginsburg’s opinion only garnered four votes, but Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion saying that the question in <em>Yates</em> is “close,” but that largely agreed with Ginsburg’s reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that <em>Yates</em> exists, Roberts’s <em>Fischer</em> opinion isn’t entirely ridiculous. The uncomfortable reality about <em>Fischer</em> is that a judge who wants to crack down on January 6 defendants can read the law according to its plain text, as Barrett did, while justices who wish to reach a different result can rely on <em>Yates</em>, as Roberts did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What actually happened in this case is that five of the Court’s Republicans read the law in a way that minimizes the law’s impact on a particularly lawless band of Trump supporters, and they were joined by the Court’s sole former public defender. Read into that what you will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The point is simply that previously established rules governing statutory interpretation give judges a great deal of leeway to reach a variety of results in many cases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Raimondo</em></a> fully consolidates the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett\">Court’s dominance over federal agencies</a> within the executive branch of government. It is a radical reordering of the US separation of powers, giving the one unelected branch of government all of its own power, plus much of the power that Congress has vested in the executive branch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Loper Bright </em>overrules a decades-old decision, known as&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council</a></em>&nbsp;(1984), which held that courts typically should defer to federal agencies when those agencies determine federal policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While this decision will undoubtedly be celebrated by Republicans — and especially Republican lawyers in conservative legal organizations like the Federalist Society, which have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/10/24025127/supreme-court-chevron-deference-loper-bright-relentless-raimondo\">pushed for a decision like <em>Loper Bright</em> for years</a> — the six Republican justices responsible for <em>Loper Bright</em> will likely come to regret Friday’s power grab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Loper Bright</em> transfers a simply astonishing amount of policymaking authority from federal agencies that collectively employ tens of thousands of people, to a judiciary that lacks the personnel to evaluate the overwhelming array of policy questions that will now be decided by the courts. This problem will be felt most acutely by the Supreme Court itself, which has only nine justices staffed by a bare handful of law clerks and a skeletal administrative staff.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court’s decision to seize this power is all the more puzzling because it has already given itself sweeping authority to veto nearly any decision by an executive branch agency that, in the Court’s words, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett\">involves a matter of “vast ‘economic and political significance.’”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court’s Republican majority, in other words, is already the final word on any policymaking question that Congress delegated to a federal agency, which triggers a partisan controversy. <em>Loper Bright</em> expands the Court’s authority so that it is also the final word on thousands of questions that hardly anyone cares about at all —  questions like what the cable television rates should be on one of Hawaii’s islands, or how much nitrogen can be discharged by a wastewater treatment plant in Massachusetts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The specific policy question in <em>Loper Bright</em>, for example, is whether the government or fishing vessels must pay for federal observers that sometimes must accompany those vessels while at sea — a question that virtually no one who doesn’t own a fishing vessel has any reason to care about whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So <em>Loper Bright</em> makes the courts, and ultimately, the Supreme Court, responsible for resolving thousands of low-stakes policy questions, which often cannot be resolved simply by reading the law’s naked text.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The justices, in other words, can look forward to missing their children’s basketball games, skipping out on date nights with their spouses, and not really doing much of anything at all besides deciding the crushing weight of cases that are about to land on their desks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Welcome to hell, justices of the Supreme Court. It is a hell of your own making.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So what is <em>Loper Bright</em> actually about?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Loper Bright</em> overrules a Reagan-era Supreme Court decision known as <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/\"><em>Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council</em></a> (1984), which held that when a federal statute delegating policymaking authority to an agency is ambiguous, courts typically should defer to the agency’s reading of that statute rather than trying to resolve the ambiguity itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reasons for this deference were twofold. As <em>Chevron</em> explained, “judges are not experts” in the kind of difficult policy questions that come before federal agencies. Think of questions like whether a product derived from red rice yeast, which purportedly helps promote healthy cholesterol levels, counts as a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17763944631660966083&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">“drug” or a “dietary supplement</a>” under federal law? Under <em>Chevron,</em> this question would be decided by FDA officials who’ve spent decades studying drugs and dietary supplements. Now it will be resolved by political appointees with law degrees and black robes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other justification for <em>Chevron</em> is democracy. “While agencies are not directly accountable to the people,” the Court said in <em>Chevron</em>, the leaders of agencies are political appointees, and they answer to a president who is accountable to the voters. And so “it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such policy choices,” rather than placing that power in the hands of unelected political appointees who serve for life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Chevron</em> was initially <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett\">celebrated as a triumph by many prominent Republicans</a>. It was 1984 and President Ronald Reagan was cruising to a landslide reelection, and Republicans appeared likely to control federal agencies for years into the future. Many federal courts, meanwhile, were still dominated by liberal Johnson and Carter appointees who were prone to striking down the Reagan administration’s deregulatory actions. So <em>Chevron</em> meant that those courts would have to butt out and let Reagan and his appointees determine the direction of government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of its biggest cheerleaders was Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative icon, who predicted in a 1989 lecture that “in the long run <em>Chevron</em> will endure and be given its full scope” because it “<a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3075&amp;context=dlj\">reflects the reality of government, and thus more adequately serves its needs</a>” than the alternative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beginning in the Obama administration, however, <em>Chevron</em> fell out of favor with the legal right, and the Federalist Society’s annual lawyers’ convention became a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22276279/supreme-court-war-joe-biden-agency-regulation-administrative-neil-gorsuch-epa-nondelegation\">showcase of proposals seeking to disempower the administrative state</a>. Many of the same Republicans who praised <em>Chevron</em> when it enabled Reagan-era Republicans to roll back regulations abandoned that view when President Barack Obama’s appointees were in charge of the agencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Federalist Society calls for <em>Chevron</em> to be overruled reached a fever pitch as Republicans consolidated more and more control over the Supreme Court. Why should policymaking authority be wielded by the Executive Branch, which will sometimes be controlled by Democrats, when it could be wielded by a judiciary firmly in Republican Party hands?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so Roberts’s opinion for himself and his fellow Republican justices is an ode to judicial power. The framers “envisioned that the final ‘interpretation of the laws’ would be ‘the proper and peculiar province of the courts,’” Roberts declares in <em>Loper Bright</em>. Indeed, his opinion seems to deny even the possibility that statutes are sometimes ambiguous and subject to multiple plausible interpretations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Courts, he writes, “understand that such statutes, no matter how impenetrable, do — in fact, must — have a single, best meaning.” And so he holds that he and his fellow oracles will not simply resolve ambiguities in statutes delegating power to agencies, but that their resolution of these cases necessarily determine that only one possible interpretation is “best.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/10/24025127/supreme-court-chevron-deference-loper-bright-relentless-raimondo\">facts of <em>Chevron</em> itself</a> belie any claim that every law has a single “best” meaning that can be determined by diviners wearing black robes. That case involved a law requiring certain power plants to obtain a permit if they built or modified “stationary sources” of air pollution — an ambiguous phrase that raises an obvious question: “What is a stationary source?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the Carter administration, the EPA determined that this phrase means any ”<a href=\"https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/685/685.F2d.718.81-2208.html\">identifiable piece of process equipment</a>,” which meant that a plant that wanted to modify a single piece of equipment often had to obtain a permit. Reagan’s EPA, by contrast, changed this rule to only require a permit if the entire plant would produce more emissions after individual pieces of equipment were modified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Truthfully, both of these constructions of the statute were equally plausible. But <em>Chevron</em> ensured that this difficult policy question would be resolved by environmental policy experts overseen by politically accountable people — if voters preferred Carter’s rule to Reagan’s, they could have elected a new president who took a more expansive approach to environmental regulation. <em>Loper Bright</em>, by contrast, rests on the fiction that there is one “best” interpretation of all laws, and it is the interpretation preferred by entirely unaccountable judges.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Loper Bright</em> turns the Supreme Court into micromanagers of an astounding array of minor policy questions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most baffling things about <em>Loper Bright</em> is that the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett\">already gave itself an unchecked veto power</a> over any agency action it deems too economically or politically significant — a power it’s wielded ruthlessly to strike down Biden administration policies that garner strong objections from Republicans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Often these cases, which are known as “major questions” cases, permit the justices to veto agency actions that are clearly and unambiguously authorized by federal law. The most egregious example is <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf\"><em>Biden v. Nebraska</em></a> (2023), which struck down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts\">despite a federal statute</a> which gave the Secretary of Education sweeping authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs &#8230; as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency” — an emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, before <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court’s Republican majority already had the power to overrule any agency action that garnered political controversy, effectively replacing a Democratic president’s policy with one preferred by the GOP. After <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court is now the final word on a broad range of policy questions that hardly anyone cares about, but that are very important when taken in the aggregate, and that often involve hyper-technical questions that are far beyond the justices’ expertise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca1/16-2280/16-2280-2018-07-09.html\">How much nitrogen may be discharged by a wastewater treatment plant</a> in Taunton, Massachusetts? Is there <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/mass-dept-of-telecomms-v-fed-commcns-commn\">“effective competition” between cable TV providers and streaming video providers</a> in Kauai, Hawaii? Does the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4533199890412583875&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">process of mixing and bagging sand</a> constitute “milling,” which is regulated under the Mine Safety and Health Act, or “manufacturing,” which is regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act? Which electrical facilities are “<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12830125190145456521&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">used in local distribution</a> or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce,” and therefore exempt from certain federal regulations? Does a service that streams live programming over the internet <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=277482026179987814&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">qualify as a “cable system”</a> under the Copyright Act?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Federal courts will soon be inundated with lawsuits forcing them to decide questions like these, which, under <em>Chevron,</em> have been the ken of federal agencies. And there’s simply no reason to think that some guy with a juris doctorate and a judicial commission will know how to handle these questions. Instead of leaving questions about, say, cable TV rates to officials in the Federal Communications Commission who have spent their careers studying those questions, they’ll now be resolved by lawyers who know little, if anything, about telecommunications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because lower court judges typically have no real expertise in any of these questions, moreover, policy questions that have historically been resolved by agencies are likely to cleave the federal courts down the middle, forcing the justices to resolve countless disagreements among federal circuit courts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The one good thing that can be said about <em>Loper Bright</em> is that it does contain some language limiting its scope. Roberts concedes that the “best” meaning of a statute will sometimes be that an agency is “authorized to exercise a degree of discretion.” And, most likely to prevent the courts from being forced to relitigate every single challenge to a federal regulation filed in the last 40 years, Roberts also declares that “we do not call into question prior cases that relied on the <em>Chevron </em>framework.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Loper Bright </em>gives Roberts and his colleagues the final word on any new regulation issued by a federal agency, but it avoids the chaos of undoing four decades of previous decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, <em>Loper Bright </em>is an earthquake that reorders US law, and that transfers a simply astonishing amount of authority away from democratically accountable officials and to a Republican judiciary. It is likely to lead to worse governance, more arbitrary decisions, and even more contentious judicial confirmations because so much now turns on which party controls the courts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the biggest losers of all may be the justices themselves. I hope that Chief Justice Roberts didn’t plan on seeing his wife and kids any time soon, because he can look forward to many long, boring nights in the office.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If President Joe Biden decides to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">drop out</a> of the presidential race, it appears <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357739/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-nominee-whitmer-moore-newsom\">likely</a> that his replacement at the top of the ticket would be his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until this week, that possibility wasn’t really worth pondering too much. But after Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">disastrous performance</a> during Thursday night’s debate, Harris becoming the Democratic nominee is suddenly a more serious hypothetical.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before considering what that would actually look like, it’s helpful to take stock of her vice presidency — and vice presidential candidacy — so far. Despite<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/27/23655248/kamala-harris-vice-president-approval-criticism\"> frequent criticisms</a> and confusion surrounding what exactly her job is, she is now emerging as an indispensable surrogate and defender,&nbsp;and maybe even successor. She hasn’t been a particularly groundbreaking vice president, but she has had moments on the campaign trail, albeit overlooked by the public and the press, when she is able to showcase her value. It’s a preview of how her role could change in the coming months and even years, whether or not Biden steps aside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thursday night was one of those times. As shocked and panicked reactions from Democratic operatives and the political press began to pour in post-debate, Harris was dispatched to defend Biden on CNN and MSNBC. She admitted that Biden had a “slow start,” but rounded that answer off by playing up a “strong finish” by the president. She went on offense: attacking Trump for his many lies during the debate and emphasizing Trump’s statements in defense of the January 6 insurrection and refusal to accept the results of the election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the process, she surprised a host of pundits <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-debate-trump-biden-06-27-24/index.html\">who wondered</a> why the White House has “kept her under wraps for three years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answer is complicated.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris’s vice presidency has been muted by design</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike Biden’s tenure under former President Barack Obama, Harris’s role as vice president has been low-key. For most of her term, she’s been relegated to warm-up speaker and occasional Biden stand-in, delivering remarks at White House events with the president, attending summits and visiting foreign leaders when Biden is needed in DC or on another trip, or, like Thursday night, brought in to do clean-up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of those back-seat responsibilities have been due to the nature of the vice presidency: a constitutional office without any clear authorities beyond being a spare body in the event the president can’t do his job and being an extra vote when the US Senate is evenly tied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But some of it appears to have been intentional. Vice presidents have exerted influence and power before. Vice President Dick Cheney essentially ran foreign policy for a few years during George W. Bush’s first term. Biden himself was given a large mandate by Obama during the government’s response to the Great Recession, administering hundreds of billions of dollars in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/06/828303824/a-look-back-at-how-joe-biden-managed-the-2009-stimulus-package\">federal stimulus spending</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris got no such assignments, despite Biden suggesting that he wanted his second-in-command to be a governing “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/kamala-harris-working-partnership/index.html\">partner</a>” during the 2020 campaign season. Questions about this have dogged Harris. Just nine months into Biden’s term, after waves of negative media coverage, public absence, staff departures, and rhetorical missteps (which have now become a <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree\">genre of meme</a>), the White House issued a <a href=\"https://x.com/PressSec/status/1460070063025831936?s=20\">statement</a> assuring the public that the president did rely on Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By that point, the idea that Harris served a superfluous role was already baking into public and media perception. Instead of working on issues like criminal-justice reform and policing — her areas of expertise —<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html\"> she took on voting rights</a>, an issue that was doomed to fail in an evenly divided Senate. Her portfolio was then filled with another cursed assignment: dealing with the root causes of migration from Latin America. Mainstream <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-3400f56255e000547d1ca3ce1aa6b8e9\">press coverage</a> of that task, and Republican framing of it online and in right-wing media, made it seem like her job would be dealing with immigration and the southern border, however. That fog made her an easier target for Republicans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, something changed in 2022: When the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception\">overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a> that summer and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, Harris suddenly had a clear lane in which to operate, and she has taken it: being the Biden administration’s <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/08/abortion-rights-fight-gives-kamala-harris-a-chance-to-lead.html\">point person</a> on conservative threats to reproductive rights.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Campaign-trail Harris has shown how much of an asset she could be</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Post-<em>Dobbs</em> and since the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23448972/midterms-results-democrats-senate-red-wave\">generally</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23439022/midterm-elections-2022-results-charts-maps-takeaways\">successful</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/27/23475262/midterm-elections-2022-results-red-wave-democrats\">midterms</a> that followed later that same year, Harris’s official role has shifted. She’s been on more foreign visits and to gatherings of NATO and allied leaders, headlined a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/07/vice-president-harris-launches-nationwide-fight-for-our-freedoms-college-tour-to-mobilize-students-and-young-people-in-the-fight-for-their-rights/\">national college tour</a>, and embarked on two other nationwide tours: one this winter dedicated to raising awareness of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/19/vice-president-kamala-harris-launches-reproductive-freedoms-tour/\">threats to reproductive freedom</a> (it kicked off on the 51<sup>st</sup> anniversary of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>) and another this spring focused on “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/vice-president-kamala-harris-launches-nationwide-economic-opportunity-tour/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20Vice%20President%20Kamala%20Harris,has%20the%20freedom%20to%20thrive.\">economic opportunity</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tours, though events run out of the White House, served a campaign function as well. The stops were concentrated in swing states, and meant to reach a swath of core Democratic constituencies that Harris may be better positioned to speak to like young voters and college students, women, Black and Latino Americans, and working-class communities. Unlike Biden, who has been struggling with voters from all of these backgrounds, Harris is a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/18/1239107278/vp-harris-takes-to-the-road-to-convince-voters-to-give-biden-another-term\">natural communicator</a> in these settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The change in these official duties has also resulted in a shift in her campaign role, especially as the primary season wrapped up this spring and the general election began. She made history, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/kamala-harris-abortion-clinic.html\">the White House said</a>, when she visited and toured an abortion clinic in Minneapolis in March, and has since delivered <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?534902-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-arizona-abortion-rights\">campaign speeches</a> in states that have taken measures to restrict abortion access, like <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-travels-florida-6-week-abortion-ban/story?id=109704247\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/04/10/abortion-arizona-law-ban-kamala-harris\">Arizona</a>, both when the state’s top court allowed a century-old abortion ban go into effect and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUzB0GURNQ\">again</a> on the second anniversary of <em>Dobbs</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s also been zeroing in on other progressive priorities like <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-03-23/kamala-harris-to-tour-blood-stained-building-where-2018-florida-school-massacre-happened\">gun safety</a>, <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/kamala-harris-philadelphia-visit-student-loan-relief/\">student loan forgiveness</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/kamala-harris-gaza-speech-watered-down-cease-fire-rcna141750\">war in Gaza</a>. She’s been engaging media and giving many more interviews than Biden, appearing as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/podcasts/the-run-up-kamala-harris-interview.html\">guest</a> on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnTpTTKeeTg\">popular</a><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kamala-harris/id1521578868?i=1000488347134\"> podcasts</a>, TV shows like <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-05-01/drew-barrymore-kamala-harris-mamala-internet-backlash\"><em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3-KA8ja6g\"><em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94QBUk_-IPg\">online</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFJJxvlAVkE\">talk shows</a> to discuss the White House and the Biden campaign’s priorities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s filling the void that Biden has created intentionally (because of his age) or not (because he is also president, governing the country). Thursday night’s interviews, and whatever appearances she will have to make to defend Biden, show us what is likely to come: an expanded role for the veep in this term and a theoretical next.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden will need it&nbsp;and Democrats should want it, in the event that Harris has to step up to win the election, govern the nation, or just be a solid backup — precisely as the vice presidency is supposed to work.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He spoke quietly and with a scratchy throat — his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4744889-joe-biden-has-a-cold-debate/\">aides say he had a cold</a>. Overall, his performance only added fuel to existing <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/majority-americans-think-both-biden-and-trump-are-too-old-serve-second-terms\">concerns about his age</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-election-2024-8ee15246\">ability to perform his duties</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be clear, Trump’s performance was a horror too; it was full of outright lies and rambling incoherence as well. He once again made clear that he poses a grave threat to US democracy — which is, in part, why some Democrats are saying Biden must step aside and allow a stronger candidate to lead the party in November.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee would be difficult, but not impossible, as my colleague <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357739/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-nominee-whitmer-moore-newsom\">Christian Paz writes</a>. It would require Biden himself to direct delegates at the convention this summer to vote for someone else and hand over his campaign funds. No party operative can force him out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Friday, Biden <a href=\"https://x.com/kaylatausche/status/1806675665845903645\">indicated</a> that he does not intend to drop out and remains committed to a second debate in September. But if Biden changes his mind, there is a roster of potential candidates who could replace him — the most obvious being Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Harris would be the most practical alternative to Biden</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Voters have already grappled with the notion that Harris is just one 81-year-old heartbeat away from becoming president. Only a little over a third of voters said in a September <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23979668-671717605-cbsnews-20230917-sun\">CBS News/YouGov</a> poll that they thought Biden would complete a second term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When up against other Democratic presidential contenders, she performs well. A <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000018f-f8f8-d844-a1ff-fffed00f0000\">June Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> of registered voters found that 21 percent would want her to be the nominee if Biden weren’t running — more than any other candidate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’d be the easiest person to swap in, as she could also pick up campaigning right where Biden left off. Unlike other potential contenders to replace Biden, she could start using his campaign funds immediately because she’s already on the presidential ticket. Otherwise, Biden would have to transfer his funds to the Democratic National Committee, which would then disperse them to another candidate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden campaign has also been trying to boost Harris’s profile by sending her on a tour of the country to talk about abortion rights, a key issue that has contributed to Democratic victories in elections from North Carolina to Kansas in the years since the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. And since <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/353753/new-york-trump-conviction-justice-department\">Trump’s criminal conviction</a>, she’s proved <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/13/kamala-harris-trump-conviction-hush-money/\">capable of going on the offensive</a>, leveraging her experience as the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These facts, however, may not be enough to overcome the fact that Harris is unpopular, even relative to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-approval-rating-2024-problem-1853029\">her predecessors as vice president</a>. Her net disapproval rating is currently about 49 percent, according to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a>. That’s better than Biden’s <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">disapproval rating of 56 percent</a> — but he’s also <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/644252/biden-13th-quarter-approval-average-lowest-historically.aspx\">historically unpopular</a>, and Harris would be running on the same record as Biden. Moreover, the Morning Consult/Politico poll found that just a third of voters and 3 in 5 Democrats believe it’s likely that she would win an election as the Democratic nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is partially a result of the White House’s failure in the first half of Biden’s presidency to give her the kind of exposure that might have boosted those numbers, instead giving her a portfolio that included the ever-intractable issue of immigration. That reportedly contributed to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60061473\">tensions between her office and the White House</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Attacks on Harris — the first woman, the first Black woman, and the first South Asian vice president — have also been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/27/23655248/kamala-harris-vice-president-approval-criticism\">colored with sexism and racism</a>, as former <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/27/ron-klain-kamala-harris-sexism-criticism-00094166\">White House chief of staff Ron Klain</a> has noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Replacing Biden with Harris, therefore, would require the Democratic establishment to go all-in on her in a way they have yet to do.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The other possible contenders to replace Biden</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If not Harris, a Biden replacement could also come from the bench of talent that Democrats have been eyeing for 2028: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, when asked about whether they would be willing to step in, they have demurred so far — which is as expected given all of them have been strong Biden surrogates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the Morning Consult/Politico poll, Newsom and Buttigieg came second after Harris as favored Democratic presidential contenders with 10 percent support. Whitmer came in third with four percent support. (Pritzker was not polled.) Newsom, Whitmer, and Pritzker also have<a href=\"https://www.multistate.us/insider/2023/8/4/decoding-2023-gubernatorial-approval-ratings\"> strong approval ratings in their states</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Gavin Newsom</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newsom’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/23832897/gavin-newsom-ron-desantis-debate\">recent debate</a> with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has boosted his national profile. His record includes further protecting reproductive rights in California, <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2024/01/california-homeless-encampments-2/\">clearing homeless encampments</a>, phasing out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/climate/california-gas-cars-emissions.html\">gas-powered vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/health/2023/12/undocumented-health-insurance-new-california-laws-2024/\">expanding healthcare for undocumented immigrants</a>, imposing a <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/california-death-penalty-18711016.php\">death penalty moratorium</a>, enacting <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/30/us/california-police-reform-laws-decertification/index.html\">police reforms</a>, and more. But his tenure as governor hasn’t been without challenges: He’s faced <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/26/newsom-recall-budget-2024-00143252\">multiple recall campaigns</a>, and the state is reeling from a multibillion-dollar deficit that required deep budget cuts this year. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Gretchen Whitmer</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whitmer led Democrats to win majorities in both chambers of the Michigan legislature in the midterms. In the years since, she has worked to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/whitmer-michigan-abortion-election-a4323a955a8dc0b3f4875216289f2e12\">shore up abortion rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/whitmer-signs-anti-discrimination-protections-lgbtq-residents-michigan-law\">expand LGBTQ rights</a>, implement <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/12/michigan-new-gun-safety-laws/72494522007/\">stricter gun safety measures</a>, take <a href=\"https://michiganadvance.com/2023/11/28/whitmer-signs-climate-change-legislation-setting-100-clean-energy-standard-for-michigan-by-2040/\">aggressive climate action</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wilx.com/2024/01/25/gov-whitmer-pushes-free-access-universal-preschool-across-state/\">institute free universal preschool</a>, and reverse policies like a <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/michigan-right-to-work-law/\">“right to work” law</a> that hurt union membership and was previously implemented by the Michigan GOP.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">J.B. Pritzker</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pritzker, who has a multi-billion dollar fortune, may have a strategic advantage in being less reliant on donors to fund a bid for president. He balanced his state’s budget and enacted a progressive agenda that included a $45 billion infrastructure plan, increased the hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2025, expanded Medicaid coverage to undocumented seniors, transitioned the state to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, and more. His state will host the Democratic National Convention this summer.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Pete Buttigieg</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Buttigieg made his mark during the 2020 presidential campaign, essentially coming in third after Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT). As transportation secretary, he’s overseen the implementation of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed in 2021, sought to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/podcasts/23698202/pete-buttigieg-roadway-deaths-public-transportation\">improve road safety</a>, and addressed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-pete-buttigieg-797fc9ea60ee9d9a22181a2622867fd5\">pandemic-related supply chain disruptions</a>. But he’s also come under heavy scrutiny over a series of <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2023/11/15/23921286/bad-traffic-pete-buttigieg-transportation/\">high-profile train derailments</a> and widespread <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/14/pete-buttigieg-airlines-transportation-00077957\">flight delays and cancellations</a>, though has since made efforts to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/08/1174853874/dot-secretary-buttigieg-wants-to-hold-airlines-accountable-for-delays-cancelatio\">hold airlines accountable</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the public is still broadly unfamiliar with these rising stars in the Democratic party. With only months before the election, it may be late to introduce them now, even setting aside the tricky logistics at the convention. But voters might also be content to cast their ballot for someone who isn’t Biden or Trump: Previously, a generic Democrat has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/06/an-ominous-poll-democrats-what-it-says-about-biden-alternative/\">polled significantly better</a> than Biden against Trump.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Following a disastrous performance in Thursday night’s presidential debate, President Joe Biden is facing a flood of calls from Democratic pundits and strategists to step aside and make way for a different Democratic nominee amid real doubts that he is fit to defeat former President Donald Trump in November.

That might be debatable, but she must at least be the most famous person in recent memory who gained notoriety because of onomatopoeia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Hawk Tuah Girl (which is not her real name, or even a particularly accurate description of her phase of life) has gone extremely viral over the last week, thanks to a video featuring her evocative description of oral sex. But she’s largely known by one demographic: straight men. In a completely informal and totally incomplete survey of the Vox staff, her existence had reached a cross-section of heterosexual males, while others around the office had absolutely no idea what the discourse was about. And boy, did that make things weird.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because I myself am a Hawk Tuah Girl newb, I asked her main audience to help me explain the phenomenon. As her rise to fame involves both innuendo and sound effects, Vox gave these straight men anonymity so they could speak candidly and freely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it turns out whether or not you know who Hawk Tuah Girl is can say a lot about you, your algorithm, and how online you are, not to mention what internet fame actually means, and to whom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is Hawk Tuah Girl and how did she get famous?&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before she became known as Hawk Tuah Girl, Hawk Tuah Girl was known as Hailey Welch. But Welch’s destiny was forever altered when she appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8DYCErhbet/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=f0f79c8d-72c1-4571-97e4-e26545632e42\">girl-outside-a-bar video</a> from creators Tim &amp; Dee TV. These <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@weoutherehtx/video/7182617798810766638\">kinds</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@weoutherehtx/video/7201629750513634606\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kingisrael__/video/7181279136428608810\">videos</a> — usually involving beautiful women who may or may not be slightly inebriated — are a subset of the bigger “TikToker talks to people on the street” genre.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the video, Welch is asked, “What’s one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thang,” Welch says, laughing. “You get me?”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@iamdlaney/video/7379375290398559530\" data-video-id=\"7379375290398559530\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@iamdlaney\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@iamdlaney?refer=embed\">@iamdlaney</a> <p>😂 <a title=\"funny\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/funny?refer=embed\">#funny</a> <a title=\"fy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fy?refer=embed\">#fy</a> <a title=\"foryoupage\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage?refer=embed\">#foryoupage</a> <a title=\"foryou\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed\">#foryou</a> <a title=\"lol\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lol?refer=embed\">#lol</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Dustin Laney\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7379375281389636394?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; Dustin Laney</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s in this moment that Welch’s perfect onomatopoeia eclipses whomever she may be. Her interior life, her desires, her fears, her being — it all fades away because she’s produced such a rich and accurate sound effect for a specific kind of fellatio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hailey Welch is no longer. Hawk Tuah Girl is born, and the people love Hawk Tuah Girl. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She was hailed as a <a href=\"https://x.com/verbalriotshow/status/1805076351457882146\">hero</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/Pornhub/status/1804220755736965586\">revolutionary</a>, and the <a href=\"https://x.com/Travispaints/status/1804122667123081519\">It girl of the moment</a>. Hawk Tuah was <a href=\"https://x.com/jennyfootball26/status/1803991388553646473\">memed</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/ZELIVNA/status/1804698908104298745\">mimicked</a>, and people were <a href=\"https://x.com/BrentTerhune/status/1806126048511156244\">seeing Hawk Tuahs everywhere</a> now that Hawk Tuah girl had opened their eyes to the Hawk Tuahs around them. There were also, as <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/hawk-tuah-girl-viral-tiktok-video-explained.html#/\">the Cut notes</a>, some inaccurate reports that she’s been fired from her job but <a href=\"https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1805939731693232550\">internet users</a> were quick to point out the misinformation and protect her young legacy. The lore of Hawk Tuah Girl grew and grew.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chad, a straight man who works in crypto-adjacent finance, told me that he first encountered the video last Wednesday or Thursday. Friends were sending him the video throughout the day. When asked who these friends were, he replied: “White, straight men mostly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“How many women sent you the video?” I asked him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“None,” Chad said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite receiving the video and links to it multiple times, Chad refrained from clicking. He tried to sit it out. He didn’t want to partake in another meme. Around the same time, Chad noticed that someone had created a “<a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hawk-tuah/\">Hawk Tuah</a>” altcoin currency to take advantage of the moment. Within hours, he said, the volatile currency was worth “tens of millions” of dollars. If finance bros are making shitpost currency, that’s usually a sign to Chad that perhaps the meme at hand does not warrant further examination. Perhaps thumbnails and stills would be enough to understand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, Chad eventually relented.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To be honest, it was sort of visceral and gross,” Chad told Vox, explaining his first reaction to the video. His disgust was not with the particular sex act, but the shockingly crisp audio on a literal spit take that arguably swerves into loogie territory. “She’s just very well mic’d,” he told me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The video made its way to George’s feed last week, too, via Instagram reels. George, a 30-year-old straight guy, didn’t have an adverse reaction to the sound the way Chad did. He thought it was funny, if not kind of charming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Despite finding it sort of endearing and quite funny, I thought she was fairly lit and that she would probably regret it,” George told Vox. “I did think that it would probably be at least a minor viral moment, but I had no idea it would rise to prominence so quickly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I asked both George and Chad if there was any reason why they thought this video caught fire so quickly. Straight men tend to be fans of both funny noises and oral sex. Conventionally attractive women saying raunchy things have long been a pop culture fascination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both mentioned that it was the earnestness that really stuck out. Social media is curated, to the point where even this genre of TikTokers and content creators speaking to women on a night out tends to be a trope. “Hawk Tuah” was a moment that didn’t feel like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It was an innocent moment of total honesty, probably,” Chad said. “She was, or seemed to be, unapologetically herself for two seconds.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cameron, a self-described “too-online” straight man, put it more simply — asking me to consider Occam’s razor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You’re asking me <em>why did the attractive young woman talking about oral sex, and how it’s her favorite thing, and the answer to every problem </em>go viral?” he said. “Straight men are exactly what you think they are … I don’t want to pander and be like,<em> Yeah, man, we are so stupid. </em>But like, we are kind of.” </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will Hawk Tuah Girl be Hawk Tuah Girl forever?&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A fascinating facet of Hawk Tuah Girl’s rise to fame is that there were still people who hadn’t yet heard of her.  Anecdotally speaking, the divide in my personal and professional life was, as of Monday morning, straight guys knew everything about her, and people who weren’t straight guys needed more of an explanation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps that’s because while the internet has seemingly made the world smaller, there are still pockets and mini internet worlds that — by cookies, by algorithm, by interests — we’re not privy to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cameron, the very online guy who is probably online this very second, mentioned another internet heroine called <a href=\"https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/3517732/the-oilers-flasher-posed-for-playboy-as-everything-continues-to-come-up-edmonton\">Oilers Girl</a>. Oilers Girl (not her real name) flashed the crowd during the NHL playoffs and went viral in what he calls the “Barstool internet” but may not have breached the mainstream masses. (“Barstool” for <a href=\"https://www.barstoolsports.com/\">Barstool Sports</a>, the long-running digital media company founded by Dave Portnoy, known for their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/magazine/spurned-by-espn-barstool-sports-is-staying-on-offense.html\">ardent fanbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/barstool-sports-persistence-traditional-masculinity-sports-culture-n1057061\">intentionally crass culture</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Oilers Girl and Hawk Tuah Girl —&nbsp;they&#8217;re the Chappell Roan and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/354634/charli-xcx-brat-album-review\">Charli XCX</a> of straight guy internet right now,” Cameron told me, trying to speak a language we both knew. Cameron didn’t know how to pronounce Chappell Roan, but this is when it clicked for me, and I no longer felt like I was speaking to an alien.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wherekhushgoes/video/7382069472015797546\" data-video-id=\"7382069472015797546\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@wherekhushgoes\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wherekhushgoes?refer=embed\">@wherekhushgoes</a> <p><a title=\"stitch\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stitch?refer=embed\">#stitch</a> with @Dustin Laney  <a title=\"hawktuah\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hawktuah?refer=embed\">#hawktuah</a> <a title=\"memestiktok\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/memestiktok?refer=embed\">#memestiktok</a> <a title=\"titanicmemes\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/titanicmemes?refer=embed\">#titanicmemes</a> <a title=\"hawktuahh\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hawktuahh?refer=embed\">#hawktuahh</a> <a title=\"memegod\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/memegod?refer=embed\">#memegod</a> <a title=\"memetiktok\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/memetiktok?refer=embed\">#memetiktok</a> <a title=\"comedy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/comedy?refer=embed\">#comedy</a> <a title=\"spit\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spit?refer=embed\">#spit</a> <a title=\"titanic\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/titanic?refer=embed\">#titanic</a> <a title=\"leonardodicaprio\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/leonardodicaprio?refer=embed\">#leonardodicaprio</a> @LeonardoDiCaprioedits @leonardo dicaprio <a title=\"katewinslet\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/katewinslet?refer=embed\">#katewinslet</a> <a title=\"rosetitanic\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/rosetitanic?refer=embed\">#rosetitanic</a> <a title=\"rosedawsontitanic\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/rosedawsontitanic?refer=embed\">#rosedawsontitanic</a> <a title=\"jackdawsontitanic\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/jackdawsontitanic?refer=embed\">#jackdawsontitanic</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Khush JM | Travel Blog ✈️\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7382069475249621803?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; Khush JM | Travel Blog ✈️</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s the idea that stuff on the internet and on social media can feel so inevitable and inescapable to you and not even register as a blip to a different audience. As small as the internet seems to be and as seemingly connected as we are, it’s hard to know these days how big a thing really is. Whether it’s Hawk Tuah Girl, Oilers Girl, or a “<a href=\"https://x.com/prasejeebus/status/1804182492506706194\">let’s work it out on the remix</a>” joke, the relative size of a meme is harder to perceive because of how divided our different internets are.

But what will that panic result in?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The party is in uncharted territory. Doubts about Biden’s ability to defeat Trump have grown and speculation about whether he could be convinced to drop out of the race is mounting. Calls for Biden to quit are suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">widespread</a> in the media, even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html\">among</a> <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/honor-demands-joe-biden-step-aside\">commentators</a> who had previously defended the president. Top Democrats are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/biden-trump-presidential-debate-analysis/index.html\">having similar discussions</a> behind the scenes, but the extent and seriousness of those discussions is not yet clear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First off: Don’t expect anything to happen immediately. No one can outright force the president of the United States to quit the race, and he would not do so on a whim. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the moment, Biden’s aides <a href=\"https://x.com/kaylatausche/status/1806675665845903645\">are telling reporters</a> he has no plans to drop out. If top Democrats, Biden’s own most trusted advisers, and his family members urge him to reconsider, that could change. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that process would take some time — likely weeks, particularly given the complicated question of what would happen next.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, despite a great deal of uncertainty about what’s next, there appear to be three plausible options for where we’re headed.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) Biden sticks it out</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Often, when pundits are hyping a supposedly game-changing political moment, it’s useful to take a step back and skeptically ask: Will anything actually change?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden won every state in the Democratic primaries this year, and the <a href=\"https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P24/D-HS.phtml\">overwhelming majority</a> of delegates are obligated to vote to nominate him at the convention by party rules. Those delegates are typically party loyalists trusted by the Biden team and state Democratic parties. They will not somehow revolt against him and depose him at the convention against his will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t mean it’s certain that Biden will remain on the ticket. But basically, the only way he’s leaving the race is if he decides to do so himself — likely after being urged to do so by people he trusts and party bigwigs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new chorus of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/25/opinion/thepoint/krugman-biden-must-withdraw?smid=url-share\">calls</a> from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/opinion\">New York Times opinion writers</a> for Biden to drop out is an ominous development for him. Former Democratic aides who are now media commentators, like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/video/2024/06/28/theres-still-time-van-jones-says-biden-should-be-replaced-1346384\">Van Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4745670-mccaskill-biden-debate-performance/\">Claire McCaskill</a>, are saying similar things. But we have not yet seen similar public defections from currently serving elected Democrats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How intense will the pressure get? In part, that depends on the personal choices of Biden’s family members, his trusted advisers, and top Democrats, who will all have to decide whether they want to try and nudge him out or stand by him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their decisions will likely be shaped in part by post-debate polling. In the optimistic scenario for Biden, there’s little change and he can simply ignore his critics, grit his teeth, and weather the storm. But the worse the polling looks, the more panic will rise and the more isolated he’ll be.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) Biden quits the race and endorses a successor </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Biden does decide to drop out, one way that could play out is that he’d endorse an intended successor at the same time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The obvious choice would be Vice President Kamala Harris. But the obvious problem with that obvious choice is that many Democrats think Harris has her own serious political weaknesses. That includes Biden himself, who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2022/12/20/the-juicy-new-biden-book-00074849\">reportedly called Harris</a> a “work in progress” early in his term. A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/politics/kamala-harris-biden-reelection-effort/index.html\">report earlier this year</a> claimed Harris was still struggling to penetrate what she called the “bubble” of Biden campaign thinking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Biden had clearly made Harris a trusted partner, helped prepare her for succession over the past several years, and viewed her as ready for prime time, a Biden-for-Harris swap would be an easier case to make. But none of that is really true.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Could Biden endorse someone else? In theory, he <em>could</em> pluck a Democratic governor somewhat at random — Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California are often mentioned. He could then call on the party to unite behind that person, cross his fingers, and hope it happens. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in addition to infuriating Harris and her supporters (passing her over for a handpicked white nominee would be quite controversial), that decision would lack any democratic legitimacy. And if any faction in the party or wannabe candidate are sore enough, they could make their own play for delegates at the convention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In contrast, every Democrat who voted in the primaries knew they’d be getting VP Harris — and potentially President Harris, should Biden not make it through a second term. So if Biden does try to avert the possibility of convention chaos by anointing a successor, she’s by far the most rational choice.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) Biden quits the race and there’s an open convention</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other option, if Biden chooses to drop out, is that he <em>doesn’t</em> try to pick a successor and simply says the party should figure it out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the obvious venue for such a discussion would be at the Democratic convention in late August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent decades, the major parties’ national conventions have been coronations, in which the winner of the most delegates in the primaries gets the nomination. But in the days of yore, the conventions were where the nominee was actually decided — typically, in backroom deals among party power brokers who controlled the delegates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the convention was “open” again due to Biden’s withdrawal — freeing up the delegates to vote their conscience — the process would likely play out very differently in the modern media and social media environment. It would be far more public. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html\">Ezra Klein’s interview with Elaine Kamarck</a> has more specifics on how this could play out.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ideally, an open convention would be a fair venue for all the contenders in the party to make their respective cases, resulting in a fair vote (or multiple rounds of balloting), and eventually a nominee with majority support at the convention that the party can unite behind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In theory, this is more small-d democratic than Biden trying to pick a successor in advance. It lets thousands of delegates decide, rather than just the power players at the top who stood beside Biden for so long.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But one problem is that Democratic Party delegates don’t have very much democratic legitimacy themselves. They were not picked to pick a president — they were picked to rubber-stamp Biden’s nomination. And they don’t truly represent the public. The only real rationale for letting them pick the nominee is that it’s too late and logistically difficult to redo the nationwide primary process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other risk is that an open convention devolves into a chaotic mess that divides and embitters the party rather than uniting it, and makes Democrats look awful to the public on national television.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The convention is less than two months away, so preparation for an actual open process would really need to begin soon if it’s going to happen. So all eyes will be on Joe Biden as he determines which path he will take.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He muttered, babbled, and failed to pounce on Donald Trump’s lies and threats to democracy. By Friday morning, the country’s liberal commentators were telling Biden to step down — and, behind closed doors, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/06/28/democrats-wake-up-to-a-nightmare-00165710?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000015d-a357-df20-adff-b3ff37130000&amp;nlid=630318\">many Democrats were saying the same thing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid this gloom, I found a ray of hope from an unusual source: Astead Herndon, the New York Times reporter who has been <a href=\"https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1755692285537271992\">banging on about the political risks of Biden’s age for months</a> (and taking <a href=\"https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1800975561688482180\">a lot of Democratic fire</a> for doing so). After being proven spectacularly right on Thursday night, Herndon didn’t take a victory lap — he looked to the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t think the election is over. I think it’s just starting,” <a href=\"https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1806533355766169673\">he wrote on Twitter/X</a>. “We’re finally out of the [delusion] phase. Country and parties both.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Herndon’s comment stood out not just because it cut against the chorus of gnashing teeth, but because it pointed to <em>why</em> everything might not be doomed. If we truly were in a mass delusion about Biden’s ability to campaign, and now that’s ending, it opens up new possibilities for the 2024 election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And not just that. If the Democratic Party does prove capable of convincing Biden to step aside for a more inspiring candidate, it might even help address a deep concern about the future of the country itself.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biden as a symptom of national decline</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For months —&nbsp;maybe even years — American politics <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/americans-dismal-views-of-the-nations-politics/\">has been mired in malaise</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are lots of reasons: Lingering <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-inflation-economy-vibecession-cbs-explains/\">anger about inflation</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/pandemic-politics-malaise.html\">legacy of the pandemic</a>. Deep and <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/trust/archive/winter-2024/navigating-the-challenges-of-the-us-political-landscape\">seemingly intractable polarization</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I think a large part of it was the uninspiring prospect of a Trump and Biden rematch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Poll after poll showed that Americans were dissatisfied with the prospect of a 2020 rematch. Most of the country didn’t want this choice and still doesn’t. It’s conventional wisdom that “double haters” — voters who dislike both Biden and Trump — <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/23/double-haters-biden-trump-deciders/\">are the most decisive swing voters in the 2024 election</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We all know the reasons this dire matchup was going to happen. While Trump is unpopular with the public and the GOP elite, he has an unshakable grip on the Republican base. And though Biden is even less popular, no serious Democrat was going to risk torpedoing the party’s general election chances against Trump by launching a bitter primary challenge they’d almost certainly lose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the fact that things are this way is exactly the problem. When political parties offer people choices they hate, for whatever reason, people become (even more) disillusioned with their functioning. The “<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691248554/the-hollow-parties\">hollow parties</a>,” as two political scientists recently described them, feel like just another symptom of America’s broader political brokenness.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biden’s departure as a (possible) symbol of national renewal</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most plausible scenario is that Biden simply weathers the current PR storm and stays atop the ticket. If that happens without him doing <em>something</em> to prove the debate catastrophe was a one-off, it’ll simply reaffirm that the institutions designed to safeguard American democracy are as broken as everything else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have institutions to handle this. Biden could just step down. But we could also have an open convention. The party could nominate someone else. But the institutions are as moribund as the candidate: they have not seen use in many years,” <a href=\"https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/king-leer?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=112019&amp;post_id=146076182&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=7ttw&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">writer John Ganz</a> observed on Friday morning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But at the same time, something feels <em>different</em> about the current wave of pressure on Biden to quit the race.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In February, after special counsel Robert Hur released a report suggesting that Biden had a poor memory, most liberals and Democrats <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/2024/2/23/24081128/joe-biden-age-mental-fitness-brokered-dnc-kamala-harris\">insisted the president was being smeared</a>. After the debate, the liberal opinion-making world is in lockstep: Joe Must Go. And the quotes anonymous Democrats are giving to connected reporters are unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think the president has one week to prove he is not dead,”’ a swing-state Congress member told <a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1806690977077239890\">Slow Boring’s Matt Yglesias</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can imagine a scenario where this level of panic, combined with <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jill-biden-must-step-up-now-to-help-oust-joe-biden\">someone</a> from <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/06/biden-trump-debate-2024/678826/\">Biden’s inner circle</a> telling him the truth, might reach the president and convince him that his time is up. All of a sudden, the idea of Biden’s departure has left the realm of fantasy and entered the blurry world of uncertain probability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In such a scenario, the Democratic party could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">avoid the chaos of a nasty primary or contested convention</a>; Biden could, in consultation with other party leaders, pick a successor and endorse them. The party would have months to rally behind <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/28/who-replace-biden-2024-election-democrats\">whoever it was</a>: Vice President Kamala Harris, a Cabinet member like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, or a popular and successful governor like Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. For a party whose Washington leadership is dominated by boomers, its young bench is surprisingly deep.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This would do more than improve the Democratic party’s chances against Trump: It would show Americans that their institutions actually can do surprising, and maybe even impressive, things. It would provide concrete evidence that we aren’t stuck in a downward spiral of political sclerosis, that the unexpected can happen, and that sometimes it might actually be good.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I certainly don’t want to suggest that replacing Biden will fix everything, either for Democrats narrowly or for the country more broadly. In our polarized system, the election will remain close no matter what; the country’s problems run far deeper than the two old men running for president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s important not to let realism lapse into nihilism. Just because few things have changed American politics of late doesn’t mean nothing can. And we shouldn’t underestimate the importance of the person in the top job: The mere fact of Barack Obama’s identity <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X\">altered American politics at such a profound level</a> that we still haven’t fully grappled with the consequences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s rare to see a clear pathway toward rebooting American politics. But Biden’s disastrous debate performance has created an opening for one. It’s up to him to take it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Johnson</em>, the most significant legal challenge to the rights of homeless people in decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a 6-3 decision written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the Supreme Court ruled that cities enforcing anti-camping bans, even if homeless people have no other place to go, does not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Gorsuch was joined by the rest of the court’s conservatives, including Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Constitution’s Eighth Amendment serves many important functions, but it does not authorize federal judges to wrest those rights and responsibilities from the American people and in their place dictate this Nation’s homelessness policy,” the opinion read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Friday’s ruling has huge implications for cities and people experiencing homelessness nationwide. It strikes a fatal blow to two Ninth Circuit decisions — the <em>Grants Pass v.</em> <em>Johnson </em>case and its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23748522/tent-encampments-martin-boise-homelessness-housing\">2018 predecessor <em>Martin v. Boise</em></a><em> — </em>that have shaped cities’ responses to homeless encampments<em>. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Leaders from dozens of cities and states — both liberal and conservative — have been hoping the US Supreme Court would overturn the <em>Martin </em>and <em>Grants Pass </em>decisions, which they claimed were incorrectly decided and left governments hamstrung and incapable of safely managing their communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many groups representing the rights of unhoused people, in turn, argued there was no reason for the US Supreme Court to reconsider the rulings, and warned that doing so will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/24123323/grants-pass-scotus-supreme-court-homeless-tent-encampments\">make it both easier to criminalize people</a> experiencing homelessness and much harder to land them permanent housing later on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to <em>Martin </em>in 2019, but pressure mounted on the high court as the nation’s homelessness crisis grew worse, especially in the Western states under the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over 650,000 people in America experience homelessness on any given night, and roughly <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/resource/hud-releases-2023-annual-homeless-assessment-report\">40 percent</a> of those individuals are sleeping outside on the streets, in cars, parks, train stations, and other places not designed primarily for people. Federal <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html\">data published in late 2023 showed</a> a rise in homelessness in most states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homelessness advocates immediately denounced the ruling, warning that it will make things worse and further marginalize vulnerable Americans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <em>Grants Pass </em>decision undoubtedly marks a significant setback to the constitutional rights of homeless people, and local governments will feel more confident passing punitive policies with the Supreme Court’s blessing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it will not end the political battles over tent encampments. It only concerns what cities <em>can </em>do, and not what they should do. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Conservatives want clearing homeless tent encampments to be non-discretionary</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those who want cities to be more aggressive in clearing homeless tent encampments are celebrating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Theane Evangelis, the lead counsel for the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, praised the Court for “restor[ing] the ability of cities on the frontlines of this crisis to develop lasting solutions that meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of their communities, while also keeping our public spaces safe and clean.” She said she hopes that years from now this moment is recognized as “the turning point in America’s homelessness crisis.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even though overturning <em>Martin </em>and <em>Grants Pass </em>would <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/24123323/grants-pass-scotus-supreme-court-homeless-tent-encampments\">make it easier</a> for cities to clear out tent encampments, local governments still hold considerable discretion over whether they <em>should </em>do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And especially in liberal cities, where leaders may be more inclined to leave people experiencing homelessness alone (or come under more pressure from advocates to do so), some conservatives have long felt additional legislative and legal action would be needed to actually force cities to act.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Many cities have used <em>Martin </em>as an excuse, you know, they throw up their hands and say, ‘Our hands are tied,’” said <a href=\"https://law.umn.edu/profiles/ilan-wurman\">Ilan Wurman</a>, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who hoped the Supreme Court would overturn the decisions. “We don’t think that was a fair reading, that you can’t enforce your camping bans, and reversing <em>Grants Pass </em>would take that argument away [from cities]. But it still doesn’t require them to do anything at that point.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, Wurman and others <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/a-legal-strategy-for-tackling-homelessness\">have been promoting</a> public nuisance lawsuits as a way to force cities to disband tent encampments. These types of lawsuits can be based on things like loud noise or air pollution, but also things like unsanitary conditions or other health hazards. Importantly, private citizens have the right of action to bring public nuisance claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first successful example of this strategy <a href=\"https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/09/16/phoenix-downtown-residents-businesses-file-lawsuit-homeless-camp/\">was in 2022</a> against the city of Phoenix, Arizona, when Wurman and colleagues sued for a declaration that a downtown homeless encampment on city property constituted a public nuisance. More than 1,000 people had moved to this encampment — known as “the Zone” — and the plaintiffs pointed to the crime, defecation, drug use, theft, and other safety hazards there that threatened public health. Arizona <a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/az/title-36-public-health-and-safety/az-rev-st-sect-36-601.html\">state law defines</a> “[a]ny place, condition or building that is controlled or operated by any governmental agency and that is not maintained in a sanitary condition” as a “public nuisance … dangerous to the public health.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A judge <a href=\"https://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CV2022-010439-926-09202023.pdf\">ruled in favor of the plaintiffs</a> last year, declaring “the Zone” a public nuisance, and ordered Phoenix to address the situation. The encampment is now cleared, but the city is appealing the decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wurman has had less success in his two other lawsuits pursuing the public nuisance strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last September, two Tucson homeowners and one Tucson business owner sued the city for failing to clear an encampment, citing things like trash, fire set by residents that burned uncontrollably, and car and residential theft.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like in Phoenix, the plaintiffs asked the courts to declare the campsite a public nuisance and order Tucson to clear it out. The city in turn argued the plaintiffs lacked standing and that they could not be liable for “fundamental government policy,” which includes how and whether to spend its public resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In May, a judge ruled in favor of the city and concluded the plaintiffs failed to show Tucson is “the legal cause of their alleged injuries.” The judge also drew contrasts between Tucson’s situation and the encampment in Phoenix, where Phoenix police actually helped transport unhoused people to be there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The residents are now appealing the case, and Wurman told me he believes they’ll win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The judge in the Tucson case agreed with us that the city consented to the encampments but then he said the city didn’t consent to the feces or the drugs, and that’s what we lost on,” Wurman said. “We think that is quite frankly insane, right? Because everyone understands that encampments universally come with feces and drugs. Their own city witnesses testified that they’re always feces and urine and needles.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wurman saw another setback recently in his third public nuisance case, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The lawsuit, originally filed last September, was dismissed in March, with the judge defending the city’s right to use its discretion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;Any given member of the public might complain about how a city allocates its resources, and many such complaints could be articulated under the broad umbrella of nuisance law,” the judge wrote. “The <a href=\"https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/march-2023/understanding-the-public-duty-doctrine\">public duty doctrine</a> places limits on when such complaints may be litigated in the courts as opposed to the ballot box.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wurman told me they’re appealing this case too, with a brief to the court due next month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homelessness advocates think the nuisance legal strategy will ultimately fail because governments typically enjoy a lot of latitude in deciding where to put their resources and what laws to enforce. When the district attorney of Sacramento filed a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/us/sacramento-homeless-lawsuit.html\">public nuisance lawsuit</a> last year alleging the city had let its encampments get out of control, a district judge ruled that most of the DA’s allegations were legally insufficient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Phoenix lawsuit is an outlier,” Will Knight, the decriminalization director at the National Homelessness Law Center, told me. “I think they&#8217;re going to lose on appeal in Tucson and Salt Lake City, and they’re going to keep losing similar nuisance lawsuits.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/erwin-chemerinsky/\">Erwin Chemerinsky</a>, dean of UC Berkeley’s law school, also told me he thinks there’s a “huge difference” between reversing a Ninth Circuit decision and courts requiring that cities must clear tent encampments or arrest homeless people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, advocates are intent on trying different strategies, including some legislative ones. The Cicero Institute, an Austin-based conservative think tank, has been pushing bills across the country to ban outdoor homeless camping, and to make cities liable if they fail to enforce those bans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A Cicero-backed bill in Missouri that was signed into law in 2022 allows the state’s attorney general <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2022/06/29/new-missouri-law-makes-sleeping-on-state-land-a-crime-for-people-experiencing-homelessness/\">to sue local governments</a> that don’t enforce their encampment bans. Earlier this year in <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/21/florida-camping-ban-homeless-public-spaces/73048034007/\">Florida Republicans passed a new anti-camping law</a> that allows not just the state attorney general but also local residents and businesses to sue local governments if they fail to enforce their bans. It takes effect this fall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another strategy advocates hope to ultimately take nationwide is at the ballot box. This fall, in Arizona, voters will vote <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-04-24/homeless-encampments-arizona-california-ballot-november-election\">on a first-of-its-kind ballot measure</a> that could allow property owners to sue for tax refunds if they can prove financial damages from homeless tent encampments. The right-leaning Goldwater Institute, a Phoenix-based think tank, drafted the measure and hopes other cities will follow suit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Today’s decision is the first step toward a sensible approach to the many problems of homelessness,” said Goldwater Institute vice president for legal affairs Timothy Sandefur on Friday in a statement. “By overturning that decision, the Supreme Court today enables local communities to find actual solutions for the people who are suffering—and who deserve better than to be forced by the Ninth Circuit&#8217;s fiat to live indefinitely in public parks and on sidewalks.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Homelessness advocates hope to galvanize the public around housing solutions</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homelessness advocates, taking a page from abortion rights groups after the overturn of <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>have been in discussions with lawmakers to move forward both state and federal legislation that would codify the <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Boise</em> decision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, they hope to push legislation to counteract what the Supreme Court just ruled and ensure that homeless people can’t be punished for sleeping outside on public property if there are no adequate alternatives available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They also criticized the decision: “This decision sets a dangerous precedent that will cause undue harm to people experiencing homelessness and give free rein to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment, rather than real solutions,” said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “This ruling allows leaders to shift the burden to law enforcement. This tactic has consistently failed to reduce homelessness in the past, and it will assuredly fail to reduce homelessness in the future.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, liberal homelessness activists hope to use the <em>Grants Pass</em> attention to focus the national conversation on policy solutions they say will actually solve homelessness, including universal rental assistance, repairs to public housing, and funds for eviction prevention. Advocates plan to call for $365 billion in the next year to fund these initiatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following the ruling advocates sent out an email blast inviting people to email their elected officials for more funding for housing and to join the “<a href=\"https://housingnothandcuffs.org/join/\">Housing Not Handcuffs</a>” advocacy campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We knew from Day 1 that the Supreme Court case wouldn’t end homelessness,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, the communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center. “Now, we must use this moment in time to ensure that Congress and the White House do their job by funding the housing needed to ensure that nobody experiences homelessness in the richest country in the world.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They were doing this the year an Everest-sized, dinosaur-slaying asteroid smashed into what is now Mexico.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And they continued doing this as humans transformed the planet, replacing forests with farms, covering beaches with buildings, and flooding the air and water with pollution. Even on some of the most urban stretches of coastline, in North America and Asia, these creatures still appear each year to seed the next generation.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Horseshoe_Spot.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.141532949541,100,39.716934100918\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One evening during a heat wave in June, I drove to Plumb Beach in south Brooklyn with a couple of friends. It’s a beautiful spot. The water is calm and the sand is speckled with shells and tufts of tall grass. It’s also very much a city beach. Plastic takeout containers poke out of the sand. There’s a large tire in the shallows. Traffic on the Belt Parkway competes with the sound of waves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nonetheless, in May and June, horseshoe crabs appear here, like magic, around full and new moons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The females, which are noticeably larger than the males, release pheromones on their way into shore to draw in suitors. One lucky male will grab onto her rear, using a pair of specialized claws, and release sperm while she lays eggs in the sand. Other “satellite” males will follow the pair around and try —&nbsp;often with successful results —&nbsp;to get their sperm in the mix too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This ancient animal orgy was on full display that evening.&nbsp;Just before sunset, dozens of the crabs — which are not technically crabs but arthropods more closely related to spiders — started coming to shore. Most of them paired up. Every few meters I saw a female the size of a dinner plate dragging along a salad-plate-size male. Some crabs were in piles. Others were in conga lines: rows of five or more individuals all attached to each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The horseshoe crabs were coated in a colorful amalgam of other sea creatures —&nbsp;barnacles, mussels, snails, and even crustaceans — as if they each had their own style. Sometimes called walking hotels, these animals are a foundation for so much life. They are ecosystems unto themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0287.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0656-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not all they support. The many eggs that horseshoe crabs lay on the beach — which can number in the tens of thousands per female — are food for more than 20 species of migratory birds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None, perhaps, rely on them more than red knots. Rotund sandpipers that sport rust-colored chests in the summer, they&#8217;re among the world’s most impressive travelers. In the eastern hemisphere, some red knots migrate more than 9,000 miles, from the tip of South America to the Arctic Circle. And they rely on horseshoe crab eggs to fuel this trip. In the spring, red knots time their journey north to align with spawning on the East Coast (and especially the Delaware Bay).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Red knots will use Plumb Beach to refuel, though I saw a different crew of egg-eaters that evening: laughing gulls, which are basically elevated seagulls. While they too are&nbsp;seagulls — a&nbsp;colloquial&nbsp;term&nbsp;that people tend to use for&nbsp;all gull species found near the sea — they have black heads and calls that sound like cackles. I watched dozens of them travel in a pack down the beach, feasting on eggs and laughing.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0525.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach.\" title=\"A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Horseshoe crabs also support billions of human lives. Their blood, made blue by copper-based proteins that transport oxygen, is a medical marvel. It quickly clots in the presence of bacterial toxins, and that has made it invaluable for sterility testing. Scientists use horseshoe crab blood to make sure medical devices, intravenous drugs, and vaccines — including those for Covid-19 — are free of harmful bacteria and safe to use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I find this all pretty remarkable: These animals, which are basically walking helmets, have been supporting life around them for hundreds of millions of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0534.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Horseshoe crab eggs.\" title=\"Horseshoe crab eggs.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an imperceivable fraction of the horseshoe crab timeline, humans have torn countless lives apart. We’ve ripped up forests and grasslands and overfished the seas, and we’re now slowly cooking the planet with carbon dioxide. Humans are fracturing the support beams of ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re even challenging the resilience of horseshoe crabs. In the last few decades,&nbsp;and especially in the 1990s,&nbsp;millions of these crabs were harvested and drained of blood. They often died afterwards. Fishermen also capture horseshoe crabs and use them as bait for eels and conch. Overharvesting caused their population —&nbsp;and the populations of some birds that depend on them —&nbsp;to crash. Red knots are federally threatened under the US Endangered Species Act, largely due to a decline in horseshoe crabs.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0342.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water.\" title=\"A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0359.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container.\" title=\"A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Benji Jones/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you glimpse these creatures on the beach, they don’t appear especially intelligent or skillful. Males will confuse other males for mates. Sometimes they even pair up with rocks. I also saw a number of them stuck upside down, like capsized June bugs, their legs moving in the air with an almost mechanical rhythm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then again, these animals have outlived almost every other organism on Earth. They’re obviously doing something right. More profoundly, they’ve helped sustain life around them. I might even suggest that we should all aspire to be more like horseshoe crabs. We should look up to these sea spiders, and try fortifying ecosystems rather than destroying them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So many important issues are at stake in the 2024 election: <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-trump-on-key-foreign-policy-issues-/7561392.html\">foreign policy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court\">reproductive rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality\">immigration</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term\">future of American democracy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But coming out of the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, one topic has crowded all those out: Biden’s performance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s rationale for agreeing to this historically early presidential debate was, in part, to try and put concerns over his age to rest. Instead, they’ve been supercharged. Multiple reports soon after the debate claimed that top Democrats were downright panicked by how Biden came off onstage. Major media outlets wrote that Biden “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/06/27/presidential-debate-live-updates/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001\">struggled</a>” and appeared “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate\">shaky</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden is the oldest president ever, and Republicans have long been trying to push an exaggerated narrative that he is senile. He didn’t seem senile on stage — but he didn’t seem sharp, either. He spoke very softly, his answers were often messy on the substance, and when he did have decent lines they were usually hampered by his halting and understated delivery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sources told NBC News midway through the debate that Biden <a href=\"https://x.com/kellyo/status/1806505436457189594?s=46\">has a cold</a>, implying his affect was a one-off fluke. The risk, though, is that voters determined after watching that he is simply not up for the job he wants to keep. This was, after all, the most prolonged look at Biden in an adversarial setting we’ve gotten in some time, and he didn’t come off well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s performance was no great shakes: He said absurd and untrue things, rambled and lost coherence. But he did it more energetically — and, more to the point, he was typical Trump, no one would be surprised by what he said or how he said it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On one level, all of the above is so shallow and superficial that I feel somewhat embarrassed to have written it. Politics should be about more than theater criticism and affect. It’s about important issues that will affect the lives of millions of people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, the question of what a relatively small group of swing voters thinks about Joe Biden’s age may well be what the 2024 election hinges on. Many Democrats think they have a winning argument against Trump on the issues, but they’re worried that Biden simply can’t make the case. So the most immediate consequence of Thursday’s debate will be a revival of chatter about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">whether Biden should even stay</a> in the race or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357739/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-nominee-whitmer-moore-newsom\">whether there’s still some other option</a> for Democrats. And that consequence makes for a pretty clear set of takeaways for the race in the wake of this debate. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Loser: Joe Biden</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No need to belabor the point: If the debate ends with your party debating whether you should even stay in the race, it’s pretty obvious you lost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden “age issue” is really a conflation of a few separate things. Again, there’s the exaggerated right-wing narrative that he’s senile. There are normal concerns about aging slowing people down somewhat mentally and physically. There’s the question about whether his health would hold up in a second term. There are questions about whether any of this has impaired his decision-making or governance (I don’t believe it has; it’s hard to point to an example of any administration that would be different if he was Joe Biden but younger).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s also a more difficult concern for Biden to rebut: that he has failed to appropriately “perform” the role of president or presidential candidate. That he hasn’t been good at seeming like he’s in command, like he’s energetic, can handle tough questioning, and is up to the job. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where he failed most glaringly during the debate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For many elite Democrats, the worry about Biden’s age is mainly a meta-worry: It’s about what swing voters will think about Biden’s age. If that’s your rubric, it doesn’t matter if you think he’s doing a great job as president; what matters is what the swing voters will think. And it’s hard to believe many liked what they saw on Thursday.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner: Donald Trump</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By default, in a two-person contest, Trump won the debate due to Biden’s weakness. But his performance was not particularly impressive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As usual, Trump got sidetracked into his perennial grievances (“Russia Russia Russia,” “the laptop,” James Comey, false claims of 2020 election fraud). He lied, said ridiculous things, and dodged questions. He also missed opportunities: Biden was shaky enough that a more disciplined and savvy Republican candidate could well have embarrassed him far more — by, for instance, posing questions directly to him and truly throwing him off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump did benefit from the relative lack of focus on his attempt to steal the 2020 election and his recent criminal conviction. And perhaps the way he won most was that the debate seemed to normalize him: His attack on American democracy was just one issue among many, only showing up halfway through. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Loser: Substantive issues</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Look, it never seemed particularly likely that with these two candidates on stage this debate would be an enlightening and nuanced exchange about policy issues. Neither are wonks, Trump lies constantly, and every debate he has participated in ends up devolving into a mudslinging contest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, for anyone interested in substance, this debate was a truly desultory affair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On abortion, Trump accused Biden of wanting to kill 9-month-old babies and Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html#:~:text=BIDEN%3A%20I%20supported%20Roe%20v.%20Wade%2C%20which%20had%20three%20trimesters.%20First%20time%20is%20between%20a%20woman%20and%20a%20doctor.%20Second%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20and%20an%20extreme%20situation.%20And%20a%20third%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20%E2%80%93%20I%20mean%2C%20it%E2%80%99d%20be%20between%20the%20woman%20and%20the%20state.\">struggled to explain</a> <em>Roe v. Wade</em>’s three-trimester framework. On climate change, Trump bragged that while he was president the country had clean air and “H2O.” On the economy, Biden claimed Trump destroyed the economy in 2020, while Trump claimed Biden solely caused inflation and has only created jobs for migrants — all false.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The nadir was the supremely stupid exchange in which both candidates insulted each other’s golf games. ”I’m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag,” Biden said. Trump responded by mocking Biden’s “swing.” Why?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner: Kamala Harris</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Back in March, Biden’s fiery State of the Union address quieted many concerns among Democrats over whether he was up to the rigors of another campaign. Now, the debate has reopened that topic of discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It will take more time (and polling numbers) to determine just how serious the damage to Biden is. Maybe mainly politics die-hards who have their minds made up were the people watching this very early debate. The media may focus on Biden’s age for a while, but attention will inevitably shift to other topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the odds that Kamala Harris ends up the Democratic presidential nominee for 2024 are, in my view, higher after the debate than they were before it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic National Convention is at the end of August. Biden won the primaries and has most Democratic delegates pledged to him, so he can’t be totally pushed out against his will. But if power players in the party tell him that he has to step down — and he listens — then Harris would be the obvious next in line.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When this scenario has been discussed, it’s often been about an “open” convention, where delegates would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html\">come together</a> to somehow choose their own nominee, as in older political eras. My guess is that this would be far too messy and impractical, and coordination and consensus-building around one option would be too difficult. There have been doubts within the party about Harris’s political strength, but if Democratic elites come to agree Biden is fatally politically flawed, they’d be more likely to roll the dice with her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, dropping Biden still seems very unlikely. But it seems less unlikely than it did Thursday morning.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He never did.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, Trump said that he’d accept the results if he thought they were “fair and legal and good” — while at the same time repeating the false claim that the 2020 election was shot through with fraud (a claim that the moderators let stand).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Put together, the former president was all but openly telling us that he’s ready to repeat the campaign of lies and incitement that produced a mob attack on the Capitol less than four years ago. (He did offer a rote rejection of political violence.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That all of this felt normal, even expected, shows how much Donald Trump has warped our sense of what’s tolerable in America. Here was an authoritarian spouting falsehoods, ranting incoherently about policy, issuing thinly veiled threats against democracy, and somehow we’ve come to accept it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re all so used to this behavior, in fact, that we have trouble reminding ourselves how dangerous it is. I can guarantee Trump’s comments on the election won’t be the top headline at any major newspaper in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That honor will likely go to Joe Biden’s poor performance, and I can understand why. The president of the United States barely stringing a cogent answer together for the first hour of a nationally televised debate is indeed a major story. It seems like the critics <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html\">warning about Biden’s age</a> had a point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s something quietly obscene about Trump’s naked authoritarianism falling out of the frame. It wasn’t only these few comments about election results: It was his entire performance, <a href=\"https://x.com/nytimes/status/1806527958095474702\">a cavalcade of lies</a> that betrayed a staggering contempt for the American public’s intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Thursday night, an authoritarian put his distaste for democracy on open display. Opposite him was a man who <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/01/05/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-third-anniversary-of-the-january-6th-attack-and-defending-the-sacred-cause-of-american-democracy-blue-bell-pa/\">claims to care about democracy</a> above all else but has seemed wholly incapable of considering whether there might be some tension between its future and his own ambitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blame Biden for running again. Blame the Democratic Party for failing to stop him. Blame CNN for burying the democracy questions halfway through the debate. Blame the Republicans for nominating Trump. Blame Trump, most of all, for acting the way he chooses to act — and his voters for standing by him while he does it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump reminded us tonight that he is uniquely unfit for office and hostile to our democracy. The fact that those qualities have lost their ability to shock underscores just how much the man has bent our politics to his will.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>A comatose Joe Biden would make a better president than Donald Trump. And the president’s capacity to lead the executive branch is, by most accounts, far greater than his capacity to speak in coherent, extemporaneous sentences on CNN.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the idea that Joe Biden is the best possible standard-bearer for the Democratic Party this November has lost all plausibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357642/biden-trump-debate-presidential-cnn-poll-takeaways-live-coverage\">first presidential debate</a> in Atlanta Thursday night, Trump spouted an endless stream of deranged lies, painting a portrait of a nonexistent United States in which babies are summarily executed in maternity wards, undocumented criminals live in the penthouses of luxury hotels on Uncle Sam’s dime, and the world’s wealthiest nation has become “a Third World country.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Biden’s senescence spoke louder than Trump’s mendacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president spoke in broken sentences through a soft, sometimes tremulous voice (Biden’s campaign said that he had a cold). At various points, his mind failed to keep pace with his lips, causing him to abandon a half-delivered talking point or else lose his train of thought entirely. In one excruciating early moment — while trying to advertise his administration’s efforts to cap the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries — Biden said that he had been “making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I’ve been able to do with &#8230; the Covid &#8230; excuse me, with, um, dealing with everything we have to do with &#8230; uh &#8230; look &#8230; if &#8230; we finally beat Medicare.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president’s visual appearance was similarly unsettling, his skin pallid and his mouth hanging oddly agape during some of Trump’s answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This despairing spectacle — of a viciously dishonest insurrectionist turning in a debate performance that, if juxtaposed with anything but the president’s even more disjointed efforts would have seemed astoundingly rambling and incoherent — led many Democrats on <a href=\"https://x.com/JulianCastro/status/1806519938984845809\">social media</a> and in <a href=\"https://x.com/charles_lister/status/1806518997732438091?s=46&amp;t=DqqqiPqo3dK8m-7tJy5LZA\">private channels</a> to call for Biden’s replacement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those calls are now irrefutable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The case for Biden was weak even before the debate</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans currently disapprove of the president’s job performance by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">a roughly 18-point margin</a>, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average. By contrast, voters disapprove of Trump by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/\">only 11 points on average</a>, and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">Kamala Harris</a> by only 10.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When asked whether they plan to vote for a Democrat or Republican for Congress, voters favor Democrats by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/\">a margin of 45.6 to 45.1</a>. In polls of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/20/joe-biden-underperforming-democrats-polls-00164156\">battleground state electorates,</a> Democratic Senate candidates routinely run far ahead of Biden. Democrats have plenty of political challenges as a party, but Biden had even more as a candidate even before the cameras started rolling in Atlanta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president is saddled with the misfortune of presiding over the highest inflation in four decades. This does not reflect any great economic mismanagement on his part; to the contrary, he has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24134257/biden-economy-inflation-wages-interest-rate\">shepherded the US to the strongest recovery</a> of any G-7 country. Yet, across the wealthy world, more or less <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/its-not-just-biden\">every leader</a> who presided over 2022’s inflation has suffered overwhelming public disapproval. For many voters, Biden is the personification of price increases. Even if he were in his prime as an orator, there would be a case for swapping him out merely because bad luck had damaged his brand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But of course, Biden is not in his prime. He would be 82 years old at his second inauguration and 86 at the close of his second term. It strains credulity to claim that the person best suited to run the United States is an octogenarian. Were the Democratic nominee anyone else, Trump’s age — 78 —  would be a significant liability for the Republicans. But Biden is three years older than Trump, and<em> </em>seems about a decade his senior. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or so voters appear to think. In <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-americans-on-biden-age/story?id=107126589\">an ABC News poll</a> from February, 86 percent of voters said that Biden was too old to serve another term. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Partly for these reasons, Biden has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/upshot/introducing-2024-poll-tracker.html\">trailing Trump</a> in polls of virtually every swing state. And in both 2016 and 2020, the polls significantly overestimated Democratic support in the Electoral College’s battlegrounds. Before Thursday night, <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">Nate Silver’s model</a> gave Trump a 66 percent chance of winning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, there was already a solid case for Biden to step aside and let Kamala Harris or some other Democrat lead the party into November’s election, even before his dispiriting debate performance. By far the most likely consequence of staying the course was America’s reelection of a corrupt and authoritarian reactionary. Rolling the dice on a new candidate was plausibly the party’s best move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, Biden went on national television and made it impossible for anyone to honestly say, “I am confident that the president will still be fit to serve in January 2029.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">It is not too late for Democrats to replace Joe Biden (with his cooperation)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no way for the Democratic Party to deny Biden the nomination at this point. But Democratic leaders could personally lobby the president to step aside and endorse his preferred successor, preempting the hazards of a contested Democratic convention in late August. Waiting months to anoint a presumptive nominee would be highly risky. Rallying around Biden’s handpicked heir now would be much less so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If one wishes to minimize intra-party strife, then Biden could simply endorse his vice president, who already functions as his default replacement. Few consider Harris to be among her party’s best political talents, but she offers far more upside than the version of Biden we saw Thursday night. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Democratic leaders believe that it would be possible for Biden to endorse a more electorally formidable candidate (perhaps Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer?) without alienating key constituencies, then that might be the optimal course of action. Sticking with Biden, plainly, is not. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president’s policy positions and governing record matter more than his current skills as a rhetorician. But precisely because of how much is substantively at stake in this election, Democrats cannot afford to wager it on American voters changing their minds and deciding that Biden isn’t too old for his job after watching him struggle to remember the topics of his own sentences. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many aspects of Biden’s legacy are laudable. His best chance for preserving it would be to voluntarily end his presidency after one term before voters get the chance.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That President Joe Biden, age 81, is an elderly man is nothing new.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the first presidential debate between Biden and former President Donald Trump Thursday night has pushed the question of Biden’s age to the top of the public’s consciousness. His verbal stumbles, weak voice (the campaign <a href=\"https://x.com/axios/status/1806514229500850238\">has said</a> that he was dealing with a cold) and meandering responses to Trump’s jabs and the moderators’ questions are likely to bring up one question: Is there any way Biden could be replaced as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The short answer is, practically, there probably isn&#8217;t. All 50 states have already held their primaries, and Biden has won the vast majority of their delegates. Only Biden himself can direct those delegates to vote for someone else, as they are pledged to vote for him unless he drops out before the Democratic convention this August.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is where practical and political challenges merge: Biden is the only one who can decide if he wants to drop out before the floor vote. No secretive party apparatus or individual can direct him to do it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And unless Biden has a serious change of heart after Thursday night, there are plenty of reasons that wouldn’t happen.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The real-world challenges</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first obstacle: Presidents are chosen through elections between candidates picked through a specific, organized party process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic presidential nominee is chosen in August at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where a candidate needs to win the support of the majority of the Democratic delegates. Those delegates are assigned proportionally based on the vote totals in a state’s primary (for any candidate who wins more than 15 percent of votes) and are then <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/presidential-election-delegate-selection-process-primary-caucus-9720daa8d706a4afceaa2d939f59a1b9\">“pledged” or “bound” to that candidate</a> in the first round of voting at the Democratic convention. Under this system, some other candidate would need to win more delegates than Biden in order to become the nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Biden has not just all the delegates he needs, but essentially all the delegates, period. So practically, there isn’t anyone that could be swapped in at this point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And according to DNC rules, these delegates are bound to support Biden during the first floor vote of the DNC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond the limits set by that process, there are also practical financial hurdles: Only Biden has the fundraising and money machine necessary on the Democratic side to run ads, hold events, hire staff, and, effectively, run a campaign. No other Democrat, elected or unelected, has that practical machinery in place.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Political challenges are still tricky</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At this point, it’s also politically risky for anyone to try to publicly force Biden out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic establishment has already united around Biden — endorsing him, stumping for him, and leading the party’s operations not only because he is the incumbent,<em> </em>but because it’s him specifically<em>. </em>They have deep relationships with him and are loyal to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is also where it’s important to dispel the notion that anyone could force Biden to drop out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DNC is not some omnipotent, shadowy operation that has the power, influence, or ability to crown a different party leader. Who do you think <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/jaime-harrison-picked-new-democratic-national-committee-chair-n1254292\">chose the DNC chair and vice-chairs</a>? Biden! There just isn’t a council of decision-makers who can tell Biden to drop out or choose to ditch him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The power of party elites is <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-parties-cant-decide\">often overstated</a>, and the primaries so far show the influence of voters. As unpopular as Biden might seem to some folks, he still won handily in the 2020 primary, and when given options to protest-vote in New Hampshire or select “none of these candidates” in Nevada this year, Democrats have still sided with Biden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And all the leading figures who could replace him — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, maybe even Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (let alone Vice President Kamala Harris) are all major public surrogates and supporters of Biden. They wouldn’t publicly turn on him now. And it’s not clear that they would privately try to force him out. Even at the most self-interested level, none of them has an incentive to let the other strongarm a Biden capitulation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So only Biden could make the decision to drop out. He doesn’t want to (not least because he sees himself as key to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-says-trump-wasnt-running-m-not-sure-d-running-rcna128232\">stopping Trump’s reelection</a>). And even if he did choose to, the only option that would not risk massive dissension among the Democratic base would be to choose his vice president, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>. The vice president has her own political drawbacks: She <a href=\"https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1755963760173289503?s=20\">polls</a> <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">worse</a> than Biden against Trump, has never run a successful national campaign, and, unfortunately, faces different voter prejudices because she is a woman of color.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other polls also show similarly negative results for Whitmer, Shapiro, and Newsom. They have <a href=\"https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1756003253190357282?s=20\">polled worse</a> than Biden, or are biding their time. And to bypass Harris for one of them also opens up potential ire from Black voters, without whom Democrats can’t win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Should another Democrat savior emerge, with the vocal support of someone like Barack Obama and a core of Biden-critical strategists and politicians, and should first lady Jill Biden and other Biden confidantes approach Biden and convince him to drop out, we’d likely head toward a brokered convention with multiple rounds of voting. That also opens up the chance for even more chaos and disunity among Democrats. Does that seem worth it to anyone in Democratic politics right now?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At least until Thursday night, the answer was simple: No. It’s too late.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

(Photo by Leah Millis-Pool/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Thursday, the Court handed down a 6-3 decision, on a party-line vote, that could render a simply astonishing array of federal laws unenforceable. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in dissent, “the constitutionality of hundreds of statutes may now be in peril, and dozens of agencies could be stripped of their power to enforce laws enacted by Congress.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The dispute in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-859_1924.pdf\"><em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em></a> turns on whether a hedge fund manager accused of defrauding investors is entitled to a jury trial to determine whether he violated federal securities law, or whether the government acted properly when it tried him before an official known as an “administrative law judge” (ALJ).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The charges against this hedge fund manager, George Jarkesy, are civil and not criminal, which matters because the Constitution treats civil trials very differently from criminal proceedings. While the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment\">Sixth Amendment</a> provides that “in all criminal prosecutions” the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> provides a more limited jury trial right, requiring them “in suits at common law” (more on what that means later).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the question of whether Jarkesy is entitled to a jury trial arose in the absence of any precedent, then he’d have a reasonably strong case that he should prevail. But, as Sotomayor lays out in her dissent, nearly 170 years of precedent cut against Jarkesy’s position.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Congress, moreover, has enacted a wide range of laws on the presumption that many enforcement proceedings may be brought before administrative law judges and not juries. According to one somewhat dated review of federal law cited by Sotomayor, “by 1986, there were over 200” federal statutes calling for trials before ALJs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of these laws, including the one allowing the SEC to bring enforcement actions against people like Jarkesy, give the government a choice. That is, they allow federal agencies to bring a proceeding either before an ALJ or before a federal district court that may conduct a jury trial. So the SEC, at least, has the option of retrying Jarkesy in a district court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, as Sotomayor warns, many federal agencies — including the “Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and many others” — may only seek civil penalties in administrative proceedings. That means that a wide array of laws guaranteeing workplace safety and advancing other important federal goals could cease to function after <em>Jarkesy</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <em>Jarkesy</em> case, in other words, is an example of the Roberts Court at its most arrogant. Were the Court tasked with resolving the dispute on a blank slate, then there are entirely plausible arguments that Mr. Jarkesy should be entitled to a jury trial. But that ship sailed many years ago, and the federal government has operated for an exceedingly long time on the assumption that many disputes can be adjudicated by ALJs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By upending this longstanding assumption, the Court may have just thrown huge swaths of the federal government — particularly enforcement by those agencies Sotomayor listed — into chaos.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So when does a civil defendant have a right to a jury trial?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Seventh Amendment provides that civil litigants generally have a right to a jury trial “in suits at common law,” but what does that mean?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Broadly speaking, the common law refers to the body of judge-made law developed by English courts, much of which was imported into American law and which still governs many American lawsuits involving matters such as contracts and torts. Common law courts typically had the power to award money damages to a victorious plaintiff, which distinguishes them from <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/court_of_equity\">courts of “equity”</a> that had the power to issue injunctions and other non-monetary relief. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion in <em>Jarkesy</em> leans heavily into the kind of remedy available to the SEC if it prevails in a suit before an ALJ. Like a suit before a common law court, the SEC sought monetary damages from Jarkesy, and thus this case resembles a suit at common law in that way. As Roberts writes, “money damages are the prototypical common law remedy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, Roberts notes that common law courts also historically had the power to hear suits alleging fraud. Thus, the suit against Jarkesy resembles a common law suit in that way as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of this part of Roberts’s opinion is uncontroversial. His disagreement with Sotomayor turns on a longstanding exception to the jury trial right known as the “public rights” doctrine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The term “common law” refers to judge-created law developed over the course of many centuries, as distinct from law created by acts of a state legislature or Congress. The somewhat unhelpfully named public rights doctrine provides that many lawsuits that arise under federal statutes are not subject to the Seventh Amendment, and thus the government is free to try these cases in an administrative proceeding without a jury.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The earliest Supreme Court case applying this public rights doctrine was <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/59/272/\">handed down in 1856</a>, so it isn’t exactly an idea invented by 20th-century Progressive Era reformers who wanted to eliminate barriers to law enforcement. As the Court explained in <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/430/442.html\"><em>Atlas Roofing v. OSHA</em></a> (1977), the doctrine applies when Congress passes a law authorizing suits by the federal government that are “unknown to the common law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In “cases in which the Government sues in its sovereign capacity to enforce public rights created by statutes within the power of Congress to enact,” <em>Atlas Roofing</em> held, “the Seventh Amendment does not prohibit Congress from assigning the factfinding function and initial adjudication to an administrative forum with which the jury would be incompatible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, this public rights doctrine does have limits. It applies only to suits brought by the federal government, and only when the government sues to enforce a federal statute authorizing a kind of suit that did not already exist under the common law. But, in those circumstances, trial before an ALJ is permitted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though Roberts’s opinion denies that it overrules <em>Atlas Roofing</em> and similar cases, he speaks of that decision in disparaging terms. And his opinion places such an extraordinary amount of weight on the fact that the SEC sought money damages against Mr. Jarkesy that it is unclear how much, if any, of the public rights doctrine remains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Were this the first time that such an issue came up, that might not be that big of a deal. Had Congress known a century ago that the Supreme Court would someday eliminate its ability to assign certain cases to ALJs, it could have written hundreds of statutes differently so that they would be enforced in jury trials. It also could have appropriated sufficient money to federal agencies to allow them to hire trial counsel who could bring proceedings in federal district courts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Congress has instead operated for many decades under the assumption that cases like <em>Atlas Roofing</em> are good law. And now the Supreme Court has pulled the rug out from under a multitude of federal statutes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This Court doesn’t typically care this much about the Seventh Amendment</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In light of the Court’s newfound appreciation for civil jury trials, it’s worth noting that the Court’s Republican appointees have historically read the Seventh Amendment very narrowly in cases that do not involve hedge fund managers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court has long held that companies may force their workers and consumers to sign away their right to sue that company in a real court — one that can conduct a jury trial — and instead <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/3/14/22969321/supreme-court-forced-arbitration-southwest-airlines-saxon-circuit-city-adams\">have the case heard by a private arbitrator</a>. The Court has, at times, claimed that forced arbitration is lawful because workers and consumers nominally consent to arbitration when they decide to do business with the company. But many of the Court’s arbitration decisions raise very serious questions about whether the justices understand what the word “consent” means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-285_q8l1.pdf\"><em>Epic Systems v. Lewis</em></a> (2018), for example, the Court held that an employer can simply order their employees to give up their right to a jury trial, under pain of termination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the Court’s approach to the Seventh Amendment is incoherent, and after <em>Jarkesy</em>, it could lead to dozens or even hundreds of federal laws arbitrarily ceasing to function.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "On Thursday, the Court handed down a 6-3 decision, on a party-line vote, that could render a simply astonishing array of federal laws unenforceable. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in dissent, “the constitutionality of hundreds of statutes may now be in peril, and dozens of agencies could be stripped of their power to enforce laws [&#8230;]",

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m really tired of being called a protectionist,” <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/about-us/biographies-key-officials/katherine-tai-ambassador\">Katherine Tai</a>, President Joe Biden’s trade representative and a leading architect of his confrontational economic approach to China, told me on Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given what Biden’s opponent has been saying lately, I empathize. Former President Donald Trump reportedly told Republican lawmakers he wants <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/trump-all-tariff-policy-to-replace-income-tax.html\">an “all tariff” policy</a>, in which all federal taxes would be replaced with taxes on imports. In the near term, Trump has <a href=\"https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/\">committed to a 10 percent tariff</a> on all imports from any country. Next to proposals like that — which would explode consumer prices and make the tax code far more regressive — Biden and Tai sound like free-traders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But compared to the bipartisan consensus that prevailed until Trump took office, I think “protectionist” is fair. Tai and Biden have continued many of Trump’s tariffs from his term, <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2022/december/statement-ustr-spokesperson-adam-hodge\">in defiance of World Trade Organization (WTO) rebukes</a>. This spring saw a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/\">flurry of new Biden tariffs targeting China</a>, most notably hitting electric vehicles and batteries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tai and the administration see themselves as charting a new course, reversing anti-worker trade policies of the past. “We have shunted workers to the side,” Tai told my colleague and <em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King, “and we need a domestic and international economic policy that champions the interests of our people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But was the previous era really so bad? And are the Biden administration’s policies helping matters?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Global trade helped the poor catch up</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the perspective of humanity as a whole, the period of hyper-globalization starting in 1990 was kind of miraculous. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030438782100064X\">Growth rates in poor countries have sped up markedly</a>, and economists have found they were gradually “converging” toward rich countries. This era saw <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-share-and-number-of-people-living-in-extreme-poverty\">dramatic reductions in extreme poverty</a>, especially but not solely in China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For manufacturing workers in rich countries, however, the consequences were grim. Regions and industries in the US exposed to competition from Chinese imports saw <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131578\">declining employment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015041\">lower lifetime incomes</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180396\">higher drug overdoses</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, <a href=\"https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-china-shock-reevaluating-the-debate/\">researchers</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/on-the-persistence-of-the-china-shock/\">those who identified some of the biggest costs of the “China shock,”</a> have found that the US as a whole benefited from trade with China, albeit modestly. Chinese imports lowered the cost of goods, which raises living standards for poor people in particular, given <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/13/low-income-high-inflation-inequality/\">how much more they have to spend on consumer goods</a> as a share of their income than the well-off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We could preserve the gains from globalization to both the world and the US while addressing its very real costs by combining open trade with more assistance to workers displaced in the process, such as through the <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5acbd8e736099b27ba4cfb36/t/5be07a4140ec9a642e20aa70/1541438026120/Hyman_TAA_Latest.pdf\">successful Trade Adjustment Assistance program</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2016/04/21/elites_are_clueless_on_trade_paul_krugman_cant_connect_the_dots_of_his_own_analysis_partner/\">critics have long contended</a> that the redistribution offered to those who’ve lost out has been, in practice, far too limited.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s fed a desire for a more confrontational attitude toward exporters like China, culminating in the tariffs adopted by Trump and largely continued by Biden.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Trump tariffs didn’t work</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In her interview with Vox, Ambassador Tai contended that consumers do not necessarily wind up paying the cost of high tariffs. “When we have started looking back at the last five and six years of prices in the United States, you did not see an automatic increase in prices as a result of tariffs,” she told King. After all, the companies that import goods could simply choose not to pass along the cost of tariffs to their customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Except, in reality, they always <em>do</em> pass along the cost. At least <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.187\">four</a> <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/1/1/5626442\">different</a> <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611\">high-quality</a> <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190536\">studies</a> have looked at the Trump tariffs. All have found “complete” or “almost complete” passthrough: that is, the tariffs were paid for entirely or almost entirely by US consumers in the form of higher prices. Make no mistake: US consumers pay for tariffs we impose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/Help%20for%20the%20Heartland%20-%20The%20Employment%20and%20Electoral%20Effects%20of%20the%20Trump%20Tariffs%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf\">Trump’s tariffs did not succeed in creating jobs in the US</a>. They did, however, destroy jobs in agriculture by prompting China to retaliate with its own tariffs, particularly on soybeans and cotton. It’s not clear to me that Biden’s tariff regime will be any more successful at preserving or adding jobs in sectors like battery and auto manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even though they were an economic dud,&nbsp; the researchers found the tariffs were a political success. Areas protected by Trump’s tariffs were more likely to vote for him in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though Tai certainly believes in tariffs against China on the merits, you don’t have to be a total cynic to wonder how much political factors are driving the Biden administration’s tariff policy too.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trade and the world order</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tai has also continued the Trump policy of <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/93024/its-time-for-the-united-states-to-end-its-bipartisan-attack-on-the-wto/\">obstructing appointments to the WTO’s appeals board</a>, and spent much of our interview criticizing the global trade body for inadequately fighting China’s own protectionist policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She and her team have been <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/us-trade-representative-katherine-tai-transatlantic-trade/\">talking a lot</a> about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade_Organization\">International Trade Organization</a>, a never-created agency floated 80 years ago by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They see it as a more pro-worker, pro-environment, and anti-monopoly vision of what international cooperation on trade might look like. FDR, Tai told me, understood the power of “market-based economies coming together to fend off the challenges of fascism on the right and communism on the left.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As an economic history nerd, I find discussions about FDR’s trade philosophy fascinating, but I did not expect to have one with a White House Cabinet member in 2024. We don’t have an ITO because the <a href=\"https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans\">US Congress</a> blocked it in 1950. If you look through the <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/havana_e.pdf\">institution’s charter</a>, which Tai is right to say includes a lot of tough anti-monopoly and labor rights language, “a lot of it is not something the US Congress would ever sign up for,” <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/expert/inu-manak\">Inu Manak</a>, a trade policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tai is surely thinking about China when she invokes the dream of an organization uniting “market-based economies” against fascism and communism. But at the same time she is defending <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/section-232-tariffs-steel-aluminum-2024/\">tariffs on steel and aluminum</a> that apply to almost all countries, not just China.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden administration’s <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/bye-america\">Buy American provisions</a> hurt allies like South Korea too, and Biden is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-steel-tariffs-union-workers-0399b0450b67086ca86edc43ac45e5e9\">opposing a Japanese company’s effort to purchase US Steel</a>. Is this really just about China, or a more general (here’s that word Tai hates again) protectionist turn?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I hope I’m wrong. Tai has expressed <a href=\"https://agoa.info/news/article/16376-remarks-by-ambassador-katherine-tai-at-the-closing-ceremony-of-the-20th-agoa-forum.html\">strong support for US trade preferences toward Africa</a>, which gives me some optimism that the new paradigm she represents will treat poor countries fairly. But so far, the new trade approach is mostly reminding me of how much we gained from the old one — and how much we might lose by abandoning it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And the question of whether Americans have prospered under the president’s watch is certain to feature prominently in his Thursday night debate with Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answer to that question, though, may ultimately hinge on which Americans we’re talking about. Any set of economic policies and developments will inevitably impact different sectors, workers, and regions differently. Some Americans are indisputably better off today than they were in January 2021. Others are not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Specifically, the real winners of the Biden economy have been 24-year-old student debtors who lost their jobs during the pandemic and now work in hospitality, own a house in Tampa Bay, Florida, live in Minneapolis, have savings in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, lease an electric vehicle, and hate fast food.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not to say that only people who fit that elaborate description have prospered since January 2021. But the closer an American comes to possessing that odd assortment of characteristics, the more likely they are to have benefited from virtually all of the Biden era’s major economic changes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To see why this is the case, consider seven ways that the US economy has changed under Biden.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">1) <strong>Unemployment rapidly fell</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Joe Biden took office, America’s unemployment rate sat at 6.4 percent. By the end of his first year in the White House, it had fallen to 3.9 percent, roughly equal to its pre-pandemic level.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pace of this labor market recovery was extraordinary. After the Great Recession of the late aughts, unemployment didn’t return to its pre-crisis level for more than nine years. After the Covid recession, unemployment returned to its pre-pandemic mark in just two.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like most features of the Biden-era economy, the president cannot claim full responsibility for this development. In 2020, the Trump administration and the House’s Democratic leadership united behind <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/7/21308450/extra-600-unemployment-stimulus-expiring-cares-act\">historically robust relief spending</a> that laid the foundation for a swift recovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Biden’s policies accelerated job growth. And this was no accident. The White House chose to prioritize rapidly restoring full employment over minimizing the risk of inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To appreciate how big a premium Biden put on a speedy labor market recovery, consider the state of the economy in early 2021. By the time his American Rescue Plan was drafted, US households <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-households-net-worth-hit-130-trillion-in-2020-51615543202\">were already $12 trillion wealthier</a> than they had been before the pandemic, and boasted <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/americans-are-sitting-on-a-lot-of-spare-cash-it-may-not-boost-growth-as-much-as-youd-think-51614366901\">more disposable income</a> and less debt than they did at the peak of the Trump-era expansion. Unemployment was already recovering at a healthy pace.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/356784/trump-biden-economy-abortion-immigration-crime-explained\">Facts on the Ground</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is part of Vox’s series exploring the realities of American life and policy as the presidential campaign ramps up. Read more:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court\">What two years without Roe looks like, in 8 charts</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality\">Biden’s border record: Trump’s claims vs. reality</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns\">Why do Americans always think crime is going up?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration could have looked at this state of affairs and concluded that only a modest additional Covid relief bill was warranted. After all, the unemployment rate was 2 full points lower in March 2021 than it had been in February 2009, when President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats authorized only $787 billion of stimulus spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, Biden proposed a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/biden-sign-stimulus-bill-covid-19\">$1.9 trillion relief bill</a>, including $1,400 checks for most Americans, enhanced unemployment benefits, and a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/30/23317834/child-tax-credit-ctc-ira\">temporary child allowance</a> for most families, among myriad other economically stimulative measures. This injection of cash into Americans’ bank accounts boosted consumer spending and, thus, job growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is impossible to know exactly how much that legislation contributed to Biden-era inflation. In hindsight, it’s clear that the economy’s reopening was all but certain to trigger an inflationary surge, no matter what Biden did in office. After all, developed countries the world over witnessed historically large bursts of inflation in 2021 and 2022, despite enacting significantly less fiscal stimulus than the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless, America bought itself considerable economic benefits with all that relief spending. The Biden-era US did not suffer significantly higher inflation than the European Union, but it did enjoy a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7240265e-0157-428b-9c47-fb07c360dfc2\">much stronger rate of economic growth</a>. As Martin Sanbu noted in Financial Times, in 2023, the US economy was only 1 to 2 percent smaller than it would have been had its pre-pandemic economic trajectory continued uninterrupted; the European economy, by contrast, finished the year 5 percent below its pre-pandemic trend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This said, it’s undoubtedly true that Biden’s fiscal policy centered the interests of the unemployed, at the cost of somewhat higher inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">2) <strong>Real wages rose sharply for young workers, especially in low-wage sectors</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The question of whether American workers as a whole are better off now than they were when Biden took office is a complicated one. By conventional measures, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q\">real weekly earnings</a> — which is to say, earnings after inflation is taken into account — are about 2 percent lower today than they were when Biden took office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that figure is misleading. The Labor Department’s wage data measures median pay among Americans who have jobs at a given moment in time. For this reason, changes in the composition of the labor force can raise or lower “real weekly earnings,” even if no single worker in the economy has actually received a raise or pay cut. For example, if companies throughout the economy lay off a bunch of their lowest-paid workers, then real wages will rise, even if pay for all remaining employees remains the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And something roughly like this happens in every recession: Low-wage workers are the first to be fired and last to be rehired. Thus, real weekly earnings skyrocketed at the start of the pandemic, even though very few employers were actually increasing worker pay in the middle of a recession. Conversely, as low-wage workers regained their jobs during Biden’s first year in office, real weekly earnings appeared to fall — even before inflation took off — merely because the composition of the workforce was changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A better measure of wage trends comes from the Atlanta Federal Reserve. The central bank <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker?panel=2\">tracks the wages</a> of the same individual US workers over time. And as the labor economist Aaron Sojourner has shown, the Atlanta Fed’s data <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aaronsojourner.org/post/3kl6dqnvcph2w\">suggests</a> that average hourly wages have grown by more than consumer prices since Biden took office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, no measure of real wages is perfect. And once the impact of interest rates is taken into account, the picture can get a bit murky.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But such ambiguity disappears for certain subsets of the labor force. For example, American workers under 25 have <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker\">seen their wages soar</a> during the Biden era. Wages for US workers between the ages of 16 and 24 were growing at a 7.3 percent rate in January 2021, according to the Atlanta Fed. By October 2022, young workers’ wages were rising at a 13 percent clip, and were still advancing by an 8.6 percent rate in March of this year. In other words, throughout the Biden presidency, young workers’ wages have grown much faster than prices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, workers in the bottom 25 percent of America’s income distribution have seen much stronger wage growth than higher earners, according to the Atlanta Fed’s data. And this trend is also reflected in data on wages in America’s leisure and hospitality industry, the nation’s lowest-paid sector. Even using the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES7000000003\">Labor Department’s data</a> (which likely underestimates wage growth due to the compositional issues mentioned above), pay for hospitality workers has far outpaced inflation during Biden’s time in office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By contrast, workers in the top quarter of America’s income distribution, and those over age 55, have seen exceptionally slow rates of income growth in the Biden era. Taken together, these trends translate into a steep reduction in pay inequality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">3) <strong>Homeowners prospered (at renters’ expense)</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden era has been a great time to own a home, but a lousy one to buy or rent a residence. Between the president’s inauguration and this May, the typical home price in the United States increased by 46.6 percent, according to Zillow’s <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FLUCSFRCONDOSMSAMID\">home value index</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One person’s rising home value is another’s declining affordability. And for would-be homebuyers, the burden of high home prices has been compounded by a rapid jump in mortgage rates. When Biden took office, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US\">the average rate</a> on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 2.77 percent; today, that figure is closer to 7 percent. As a result, the median monthly mortgage payment jumped by roughly 50 percent between 2021 and 2023, according to an analysis from <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/average-monthly-mortgage-payment/#by-loan-type\">Bank Rate</a>, a financial services company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president does not set interest rates. The Federal Reserve determines borrowing costs. Yet the central bank hiked rates in recent years in response to rising inflation (by increasing borrowing costs, the Fed aims to discourage debt-financed spending and investment, which theoretically slows the growth of prices). Therefore, to the extent that Biden’s fiscal policies contributed to inflation, he bears partial responsibility for rising interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, rents have soared. Since Biden took office, the average rent in a US city increased by roughly 21 percent, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SEHA\">according to</a> the Bureau of Labor Statistics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, trends in shelter costs vary widely by location. In the Biden era, rents and home prices have risen especially rapidly in the Sun Belt region. Between January 2021 and March 2024, home prices in Tampa Bay, Florida, surged by roughly <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TPXRSA\">51 percent</a>, while those in the Phoenix metro area <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PHXRNSA\">appreciated by 40 percent</a>. And rents have followed a similarly <a href=\"https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-05-07-New-York-City-rents-grew-seven-times-faster-than-wages-last-year,-tightening-affordability-crunch\">steep upward trajectory</a> in both markets. By contrast, Minneapolis, Minnesota, saw only <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MNXRSA\">an 18.4 percent</a> increase in home prices, and similarly modest rental inflation. In fact, according to a recent <a href=\"https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-05-07-New-York-City-rents-grew-seven-times-faster-than-wages-last-year,-tightening-affordability-crunch\">analysis</a> from Zillow and Streeteasy, the typical rent in Minneapolis increased by only 13.5 percent between 2019 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, today’s housing affordability crisis has been decades in the making and thus has little to do with Biden’s policies. Restrictions on multifamily housing construction in major US cities have prevented America’s housing stock from keeping pace with demand. Meanwhile, millennials — now America’s largest generation — have entered their prime home-buying and childrearing years en masse, ditching roommates and seeking floorspace. Add in remote work, which has led to an increase in demand for square footage as professionals prefer at-home offices, and you end up with a severe housing crunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tools for alleviating that crisis exist. But they’re primarily available to local governments, which generally have sovereignty over zoning. Minneapolis relaxed restrictions on housing construction in recent years and <a href=\"https://www.kare11.com/article/money/twin-cities-inflation-rate-among-lowest-in-the-country/89-40f01101-c8e4-4be8-a9ad-d737fa865697\">has enjoyed relatively low housing inflation</a> as a result.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">4) <strong>The stock market boomed</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is more than 42 percent higher than it was on the day Biden took office. Such growth pales a bit in comparison to that seen over the entire course of the Trump presidency, when the index grew by about 68 percent. But it still represents robust gains for investors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, the Biden-era stock market rally may have an unusually large impact on the broader economy. During the Covid pandemic, Americans dedicated a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/24159281/consumer-spending-economy-inflation-interest-rates\">historically high</a> percentage of their income to savings, as public health concerns rendered vacations, dining out, and all manner of other in-person leisure activities less appealing. And many plowed those savings into the stock market: Between 2019 and 2022, the percentage of US households that owned stocks <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/stocks-americans-own-most-ever-9f6fd963\">jumped by 5 points</a> to an all-time high of 58 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Combine equity gains with the Biden-era appreciation in home values, and US households in general — and high-income ones in particular — have seen their net worths grow considerably in recent years. When the value of a person’s assets rises, they tend to eventually increase their spending on goods and services. The Biden-era run-up in wealth has therefore likely helped the economy weather inflation, as consumers have been able to sustain high levels of spending by drawing on their savings, home equity, and capital gains — or else, merely by telling themselves that they can afford to spend more, given how good their 401(k) is looking. Indeed, according to <a href=\"https://economics.td.com/us-household-wealth-props-consumer-spending#:~:text=With%20a%20range%20of%20two,spending%20over%20the%20next%20one.\">an analysis</a> from TD Bank, rising wealth explains between 15 and 30 percent of the increase in American consumer spending since the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">5) <strong>The green economy swelled</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, the US government and private investors collectively spent $102.5 billion on the green energy transition, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-opinion-biden-accomplishment-data/#schrager-income-inequality\">BloombergNEF</a>. Last year, that figure exceeded $200 billion. And when investments in the power grid are taken into account, total climate spending in 2023 hits $303 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This surge in green spending is a direct consequence of Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23282217/climate-bill-health-care-drugs-inflation-reduction-act#\">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (IRA), which provided generous subsidies to American producers of renewable energy and electric vehicles, among other low-carbon technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All Americans will theoretically benefit eventually from the green transition, which will lengthen our lives by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/8/12/21361498/climate-change-air-pollution-us-india-china-deaths\">reducing air pollution</a> and render the Earth less inhospitable for our grandchildren by curbing global warming. But the IRA’s direct beneficiaries are principally American green technology makers, Sun Belt manufacturing workers, and climate-conscious consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/23/red-states-are-winning-big-from-dems-climate-law-00078420\">Politico noted last year</a>, most of the green energy investments spurred by the IRA have been in Republican districts, with a highly disproportionate share concentrated in the American South.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, under Biden, most Americans became eligible for a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/23498215/ev-tax-credit-2023-heat-pumps-solar\">$7,500</a> tax credit on purchases or leases of electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The law made a given vehicle’s eligibility for that tax credit contingent on where its various inputs were produced: To promote American manufacturing of EVs and their batteries, a certain (and steadily rising) percentage of a car’s inputs must be sourced from the US to qualify. But the eligibility requirements for purchased cars are stricter than <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/what-to-know-about-leasing-an-ev-or-phev-with-tax-credit-a3007689035/\">those for leased ones</a>, so Americans who leased an electric vehicle have done especially well in the Biden era.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">6) <strong>Many student debtors saw their loan balances shrink</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s plan to forgive at least $10,000 in student debt for the vast majority of US borrowers was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23762367/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-biden-cancellation\">blocked</a> by the Supreme Court last year. But his administration has successfully executed many smaller-scale acts of forgiveness that add up to a prodigious total. As of March, the administration had canceled roughly <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-77-billion-approved-student-debt-relief-160000-borrowers#:~:text=Today's%20announcement%20brings%20the%20total,approved%20for%20some%20debt%20relief.\">$167 billion</a> of federal student loan debt, more than 10 percent of all such outstanding debt in the country. All together, 4.75 million borrowers have seen at least a portion of their student debt forgiven under Biden.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">7) <strong>Fast food got pricier</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Precisely because pay for hospitality workers has surged, the cost of fast food has risen sharply. Between May 2020 and May 2023, hourly compensation at American limited-service restaurants <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/2020/may/oes353023.htm\">jumped</a> <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353023.htm\">by</a> 23 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the same period, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/9/24027094/fast-food-prices-wages-mcdonalds\">fast food prices soared</a>, rising 8 percent in 2021, 6.6 percent in 2022, and 6 percent in 2023, far outpacing the overall inflation rate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tight labor markets — in which jobs are abundant and workers scarce — benefit Americans in their capacities as laborers. They give workers more bargaining power at their jobs and more freedom to ditch a bad gig without risking prolonged unemployment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is especially valuable for workers who lack rare skills, face discrimination in the labor market, or require special accommodations. When labor markets are loose, employers can afford to pay meager wages to lower-level staffers, or pass over Black applicants, or refuse to make postings accessible to people with disabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When finding enough workers to satisfy customer demand is a struggle, however, firms have no choice but to pay higher wages, consider applicants of all races, and make positions accessible to a wider pool of workers. This is why the Biden era has been so good for low-wage workers. And it is also largely why the unemployment rates of <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006\">Black</a> and <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU04074597\">disabled</a> workers have fallen to record lows during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But tight labor markets have less beneficial effects for consumers. Rising wages generally translate into higher prices, especially for goods and services that are labor-intensive. And strong demand for workers also means that many businesses are going to struggle with retention and hiring, and be understaffed as a result.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many consumers of fast food, child care, taxi rides, and other labor-intensive services have therefore found themselves paying more — often for lower-quality service — in the Biden era. For upper-middle-class consumers, whose educational backgrounds and special skills provide them with a modicum of bargaining power even in times of elevated unemployment, the trade-offs of tight labor markets might not be favorable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The Biden economy works well (albeit not for everyone)</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my view, more expensive Big Macs are a small price to pay for higher growth, more worker power, and low unemployment. And I also think that the broader strengths of the Biden economy outweigh its weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recovering from the pandemic was always going to be painful. Covid shuttered entire sectors of the US economy and disrupted factory production the world over. At the same time, consumers suddenly shifted their spending away from in-person services and toward manufactured goods, a development that producers weren’t prepared for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These disruptions had unavoidable economic costs. We could have paid those costs by immiserating America’s most vulnerable workers through a prolonged period of high unemployment. Instead, under Biden, we all chipped in to pay Covid’s toll through inflation while protecting the disadvantaged. I think this was a sound decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I understand why some older, high-income Americans — especially those who never lost their jobs during the pandemic, keep all their savings in cash, paid off their student debts long ago, own no home, love fossil fuels, and live off Taco Bell — might disagree.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden’s economic record is a bit like a certain orange-hued ex-president: It’s perpetually on trial. For years, politicians and commentators have been arguing over the merits of the Biden-era economy. And the question of whether Americans have prospered under the president’s watch is certain to feature prominently in his Thursday night debate with [&#8230;]",

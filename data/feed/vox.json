The often callous nature of the US health care system has long been a point of wide discussion, with evidence piling up that the way the country provides medical services is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health-care/2020/1/29/21075388/medicare-for-all-what-countries-have-universal-health-care\">costly in both money and human life</a>. The health industry’s executives — insurers, pharma, even hospitals — have become popular villains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The killing of a human being is morally repugnant — full stop. But many people still <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brian-thompson-ceo-killed-manhattan-b2659700.html\">found themselves asking</a>: If it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-healthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-shooting-bullets-words-written-on-them/\">as may well be the case</a>, that the shooter was primarily motivated by the injustices of American health care, would that be surprising?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the same day as the shooting, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/health/blue-cross-blue-shield-anesthesia-anthem.html\">news that a different insurer</a> would restrict coverage for anesthesia during surgeries went viral, serving as a kind of cosmic confirmation of this line of thinking. A health insurance executive is shot in New York City over (it is assumed) the industry’s avaricious practices, while another insurer affirms the worst stereotype with such a seemingly arbitrary limit on people’s benefits to be given anesthesia during surgery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reality, however, is more complicated. As Vox’s Eric Levitz <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/390031/anthem-blue-cross-blue-shield-anesthesia-limits-insurance\">covered</a>, this policy would not actually result in higher bills for patients; it is instead the kind of cost control that policymakers will often vouch for when public attention is elsewhere, something meant to rein in high payments to health care providers. But public and <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1864495315362926753\">political outrage</a> didn’t stop to make that connection, and the insurer quickly reversed the policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Put every aspect of this tragic episode together and you have the rotten core of American health care. The cruelties of the US medical system and the ongoing blame game between the private industries that profit from it have left patients angry and confused — and looking for someone, anyone, to blame, fairly or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is not one man nor even one industry responsible for the failures of US health care. The finger-pointing is a distraction. Every party bears responsibility. The only way forward is to reckon with that collective failure. We need to begin working toward a more rational and just system if we are to have any hope of creating a world in which Thompson’s shooting would be truly unimaginable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The distracting health care blame game</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the dawn of the modern American health care system, the private industries that compose much of the medical sector <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23890764/healthcare-insurance-marketplace-open-enrollment-employer-sponsored-united-blue-cross-shield-aetna\">were allies</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Physicians in particular were fierce defenders of private insurance in the middle of the 20th century. The American Medical Association and its compatriots <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10810293/\">greatly preferred</a> the country to cover most people through private employer-sponsored insurance over a government program and fiercely lobbied to smother the latter in the crib. They tolerated the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 to cover populations that were otherwise uninsurable, but would come together again to <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~starr/20starr.html\">stop</a> the Clinton health reform effort in the 1990s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everybody involved was invested in maintaining a free-ish market system. Hospitals and pharmaceutical companies could raise prices, and the insurance plans could pass on those increases to employers, whose health benefits were tax-free thanks to Congress, which made those hikes more tolerable. Medicare and Medicaid limited their spending, but the private portion of the market created the opportunity to increase profits, and they stuck together whenever the status quo was threatened. At least for a while.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89\">prices have continued to spiral upward</a>, accelerated by the aging of the baby boomers and by important but costly advancements in medical science. Today, as everyone knows, health care in the US can be <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/surveys/2023/oct/paying-for-it-costs-debt-americans-sicker-poorer-2023-affordability-survey\">prohibitively expensive</a> even for people who have insurance. Almost four in 10 Americans <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/468053/record-high-put-off-medical-care-due-cost-2022.aspx\">say</a> they have skipped necessary medical care over the costs, and <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/the-burden-of-medical-debt-in-the-united-states/\">millions</a> carry medical debts from past cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The passage of Obamacare over industry opposition was the first sign that the private sector’s political vise grip was loosening, with the Obama White House <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250270931/thetenyearwar/\">successfully dividing the industry against itself</a>, targeting insurers and hospitals for cuts while in effect buying off pharma’s opposition. The more recent Inflation Reduction Act contained a provision allowing for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/8/30/23850979/medicare-drug-price-negotiations-10-prescription-list\">Medicare to negotiate prices with drugmakers</a>, which would lower costs and allow the program to cap seniors’ out-of-pocket costs. That would have been unthinkable a generation earlier when Big Pharma <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/how-will-the-prescription-drug-provisions-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-affect-medicare-beneficiaries/\">lobbied</a> Congress to prohibit such a policy. Lawmakers of both parties continue to look hard at how to overhaul the health system to reduce costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That political realignment has turned the insurer, pharma, and hospital industries against each other. I have been covering health care for more than a decade, since shortly after the ACA passed. The battle lines have become clearer over that time, to the point where every sector is blaming the others for patients’ frustrations with the medical system:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hospitals <a href=\"https://bettersolutionsforhealthcare.org/big-hospitals-vs-big-pharma-which-industry-is-most-to-blame-for-soaring-health-care-costs/\">blame</a> drug companies (for charging high prices that they must pass on to payers) and <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/hospitals-face-unrealistic-pressure-from-insurers-as-administrative-cost-soar.html\">insurers</a> (for restricting benefits and leaving patients exposed to uncovered bills)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drug companies blame <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/drug-industry-defense-for-high-prices-blame-insurance-companies/2019/02/25/cc0151ce-35e7-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html\">insurers</a> (for charging patients high out-of-pocket costs for medications) and <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals/drug-makers-getting-bolder-fight-over-340b-drug-discounts\">hospitals</a> (for exploiting technical programs like 340B to artificially boost their profits); they also blame the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/5/10/23709448/what-are-pbms-pharmacy-benefit-managers-bernie-sanders\">pharmacy benefit managers</a> (PBMs) who coordinate among drug manufacturers, plans, and pharmacies</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Insurers blame <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2018/09/20/contracts\">hospitals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ahip.org/reject-big-pharmas-drug-pricing-distractions-protect-your-bargaining-power\">drug companies</a> (for charging too much money for their services and products, which patients bear through higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patients blame everybody (for the high costs they face and the hassles of navigating this complicated system).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is how you end up with misguided outrage over Anthem’s anesthesia policy. The doctors paint it as insurers cracking down on patients, when it is actually the plan trying to lower its overall costs and thereby save patients money. It becomes hard to do anything to reduce costs, leaving the frustrations with the system to metastasize until we see what we saw after the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The collective failure of US health care</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be clear, health insurers have earned plenty of scorn. Before the ACA, they would simply refuse to cover people with expensive medical conditions. They are more constrained now that the ACA is law, but there is a constant stream of new reporting on novel tactics by insurance plans to deny patients coverage. They’re even <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/13/medicare-advantage-plans-denial-artificial-intelligence/\">using AI to do it</a>. UnitedHealthcare has been <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/unitedhealth-mental-health-care-denied-illegal-algorithm\">the subject of recent ProPublica exposés</a> for, among other examples, the company’s use of algorithms to deny claims for mental health services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same goes for drugmakers, who are sitting on the sidelines for the moment. There are some merits to their criticisms of health insurers, PBMs, and hospitals and how those entities pilfer money in the drug reimbursement process. But pharma companies also <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/368538/medicare-drug-prices-pharma-negotiations-innovation\">overstate</a> how much the high prices they charge are necessary to fund research and development for new cures. They deflect when pressed on how they <a href=\"https://time.com/6257866/big-pharma-patent-abuse-drug-pricing-crisis/\">exploit loopholes in patent law</a> to keep their monopolies on prices for popular medications like the diabetes drug <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/sky-high-drug-prices-senators-blame-patent-abuse-rcna153350\">Humalog</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The insurance and drug industries are right to cite hospitals and physicians as the biggest <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-health-care-costs-and-affordability/?entry=table-of-contents-what-factors-contribute-to-u-s-health-care-spending\">drivers of US health care costs</a>. Most doctors are very generously compensated, and they have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/23753724/physician-doctor-shortage-primary-care-medicare-medicaid-rural-health-care-access\">limited entry into their fields</a>, which reduces the number of doctors and makes health care harder to access and more expensive per patient.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet providers have their own justifiable complaints about how health insurers deploy their networks to restrict coverage, such as prior authorization and other bureaucratic hurdles that providers must jump in order to receive compensation for caring for their patients. US doctors may make more, but they also spend <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/what-drives-health-spending-in-the-u-s-compared-to-other-countries/#:~:text=9.7%25-,Comparable%20Country%20Average%20(Total:%20$6%2C514%20per%20capita),to%20lack%20of%202021%20data.&amp;text=In%202021%2C%20inpatient%20and%20outpatient,and%2014.5%25%2C%20respectively).\">more time and money on administrative tasks</a> than their peers in other countries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And round and round it goes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People are fed up. The health care industry enjoyed a brief spike in popularity during the pandemic, but its approval rating <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/4708/healthcare-system.aspx\">as measured by Gallup</a> has fallen back to 31 percent, with 51 percent disapproving. The share of Americans who approve of the quality of health care available to them <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/654044/view-healthcare-quality-declines-year-low.aspx\">has fallen to an all-time low</a>. Only 18 percent of the American public <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/510641/retail-pharmaceutical-industries-slip-public-esteem.aspx\">views</a> the pharmaceutical industry favorably; 60 percent hold a negative opinion. Most people say they’re happy with their insurance plan, but they are less likely to approve of their coverage if they have high bills, and most people still report problems using their benefits, according to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/poll-finding/kff-survey-of-consumer-experiences-with-health-insurance/\">KFF</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Providers enjoy <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/547505/nurses-first-doctors-distant-second-healthcare-provider-ratings.aspx\">the highest approval ratings</a>, which may be why many people instinctively opposed the Anthem policy. But while the US public remains mostly fond of nurses, its opinion of doctors and hospitals has been dropping: for physicians from 81 percent in 2003 to 69 percent in 2023, for hospitals from 70 percent to 58 percent in the same period. The passage of the No Surprises Act, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/21003480/stop-surprise-medical-bills-legislation\">targeted hospital billing</a>, was a sign of their political clout softening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The failure of American health care is a collective one, the result of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23890764/healthcare-insurance-marketplace-open-enrollment-employer-sponsored-united-blue-cross-shield-aetna\">system being pulled together haphazardly over many decades</a>, rather than thoughtfully planned from the start. Even the public often has contradictory desires, wanting both more choice and guaranteed coverage. The conflict between those two impulses <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300189155/remedy-and-reaction/\">helps explain the difficult struggle to reform US health care</a> and the history of voters <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna53155179\">punishing politicians</a> who do try to change the system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There has been some progress. The uninsured rate remains too high, but it is about <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/the-share-of-americans-without-health-insurance-in-2023-remained-low/\">as low as it has ever been</a> after a decade of the ACA. Medicare can negotiate drug prices, and seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for medications are now <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/explaining-the-prescription-drug-provisions-in-the-inflation-reduction-act/\">capped</a> for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much more work needs to be done, and it will require cutting through the industry’s finger-pointing: Every sector demands some kind of reform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Only by looking at the system as a whole and figuring out how to make it economically viable while also providing necessary care for all who need it can we save this system that <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&amp;tableId=tbl2&amp;pii=S0140-6736%2818%2930994-2\">has fallen behind those of other rich nations</a>. There are many different ways to achieve a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/13/21055327/everybody-covered\">version of universal health care</a>. The US still has to decide that is in fact what it wants, as every other developed European and Asian country has. Many of their people have no concept of a world in which people go bankrupt over medical bills, something that is an everyday reality in the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No one person is to blame for all of the nation’s health care problems, not even a CEO. These issues were festering long before most of us were born. No one person has all of the answers either. But it has long been clear that the overall system is deeply flawed. There must be better policies across all the industries that make up what we call the American health care system to fix it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But for now, Memphis isn’t required to act on the findings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Any legally binding commitment to reform would require more action by DOJ, including a possible lawsuit and settlement with the city. It’s not guaranteed that the agency will — or would be able to — take that action before President-elect Donald Trump starts his second term, however. And if it doesn’t, the Trump administration could choose not to pursue oversight of Memphis at all. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/27/trump-policing-biden-harris-police-accountability/\">Trump</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/07/20/trump-project-2025-crime-prosecutors\">as well as his allies</a> at the Heritage Foundation and elsewhere, have made clear that they’re less interested in efforts to hold police accountable than President Joe Biden has been.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That much was evident during the first Trump administration, when the DOJ significantly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/30/21281041/trump-justice-department-consent-decrees-jeff-sessions-police-violence-abuse\">dialed back its oversight of police</a>. Over Trump’s four years in office, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/what-happened-lone-police-department-investigation-started-trump-s-doj-n1231321\">the DOJ opened just one new</a> investigation into potential departmental civil rights violations, far less than the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/what-happened-lone-police-department-investigation-started-trump-s-doj-n1231321\">25 it opened during former President Barack Obama’s tenure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/bidens-justice-dept-has-yet-reach-accords-police-misconduct-cases-2024-10-29/\">the 12 it has opened under Biden.</a> Additionally, it was much more reluctant to enter into legal agreements with cities <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-obama-justice-department-had-a-plan-to-hold-police-accountable-for-abuses-the-trump-doj-has-undermined-it\">about required police reforms</a> — one of the department’s best tools for enforcing changes to policing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Based on the first Trump administration, I would expect that in the second Trump administration, civil or criminal investigations into police will decrease,” Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, deputy project director on policing at the ACLU, told Vox. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What federal oversight of police entails</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two key avenues for DOJ oversight of police departments: civil pattern-or-practice investigations and criminal investigations of individual offenses.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Memphis investigation was the former. Pattern-or-practice investigations can be triggered by a specific incident, but seek to examine whether there is a pattern of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-10/pattern_or_practice_investigation_faqs_english.pdf\">systemic civil rights violations</a> by a locality’s police department. The DOJ’s Memphis inquiry was prompted by the brutal police killing of Nichols — a Black man who was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/tyre-nichols-police-body-cam-footage-analysis/\">tased and beaten by five officers</a> after getting pulled over for a traffic stop in the city last year — and aimed to examine just how widespread such problems are. (That incident is also the subject of its <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-former-memphis-police-officers-charged-federal-civil-rights-conspiracy-and-obstruction\">own separate federal criminal inquiry</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once the DOJ concludes its investigation and announces its findings, <a href=\"https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/local/2024/12/04/what-is-consent-decree-memphis-police/76751013007/\">it typically files a lawsuit if it identifies misconduct</a>. A judge will then impose what’s known as a consent decree, or a court mandate, for the city to implement reforms that both the locality and DOJ agree upon. These changes can include requirements that a police force reduce the frequency of use of force incidents and improve community trust in police, among other possible provisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The court also appoints an independent monitor to oversee the department’s efforts, who will keep an eye on progress or violations of the consent decree. Cities that don’t comply with consent decrees can be fined and face other penalties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Memphis has said it won’t enter into negotiations with DOJ about potential reforms until it has an opportunity <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tyre-nichols-memphis-police-federal-investigation-beac021fcf8b5fd255ce79520cec86fa\">to review and push back on the report’s findings</a>. And if the Trump administration decides not to pursue the typical lawsuit, Memphis likely won’t need to enter a consent decree at all. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/crime/2024/12/04/trump-white-house-impact-consent-decrees/76749027007/\">A similar scenario transpired in 2017</a> after the Obama administration identified police abuses in Chicago following a pattern-or-practice investigation, and Trump’s DOJ <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-obama-justice-department-had-a-plan-to-hold-police-accountable-for-abuses-the-trump-doj-has-undermined-it\">chose not to pursue the process further.</a> (In that case, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-police-consent-decree-timeline/\">the state of Illinois</a> stepped in to finalize <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/under-president-trump-is-minneapolis-pending-consent-decree-with-the-doj-dead/601179980\">a consent decree with the city</a>.)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Trump administration could walk away from these investigations</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly signaled an intent to empower police, often making remarks that suggested a reduction in federal oversight of law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We will give our police back their power, protection, respect that they deserve,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/27/trump-policing-biden-harris-police-accountability/?_pml=1\">he said in July</a>, pledging to end Democrats’ so-called “war on … police.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s talked, too, about emboldening officers to use force, rather than curbing the practice: “They have to be extraordinarily rough,” Trump has said about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5183142/police-welcome-trumps-return-to-the-white-house\">police’s response to shoplifters</a>, claiming, too, that one <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/29/trump-violent-day-policing-crime-00181619\">“violent day” of policing would end crime</a>. Other policies that Trump has advocated for, like <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/trump-stop-frisk-black-male-voters-rcna157084\">the return of stop and frisk</a>, <a href=\"https://policing.umhistorylabs.lsa.umich.edu/s/detroitunderfire/page/stop-and-frisk\">which has led to racial profiling in the past</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/27/trump-policing-biden-harris-police-accountability/?_pml=1\">provision of military-grade equipment to local police</a>, also stress an interest in empowering law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation policy wish list</a> put together by Trump allies, has projected a similar message, urging <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/07/20/trump-project-2025-crime-prosecutors\">the elimination of existing consent decrees</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And Trump’s first term also offered a preview of how the DOJ could take a much laxer approach to police oversight once the president-elect is back in office. It could do so in several ways, experts told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first way is that it could pull back on existing consent decrees that have already been put into place. In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions attempted to delay the implementation of a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/blow-doj-federal-judge-approves-baltimore-police-reform-agreement\">consent decree that the Obama administration</a> had already negotiated with Baltimore, but such efforts were blocked by the courts. Given this precedent, it would likely be difficult for the DOJ to drop the decrees entirely, though it could dedicate fewer resources to oversight or helping the local department craft policies for training and other needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second way is that it could effectively abandon investigations that have not yet resulted in consent decrees. Cities like Memphis <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/city-fighting-phoenix-police-doj-investigation/\">and Phoenix</a>, for example, have yet to enter into settlements with the DOJ. If they fail to do so prior to the end of the Biden administration, it’s unlikely that the Trump administration will pursue them. At that point, state governments, or civil rights organizations like the ACLU, could potentially step in and use the DOJ investigation to file lawsuits of their own, with the goal of forcing courts to require changes by these cities. In the interim, however, these cities won’t face binding requirements to pursue police reforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During Trump’s first term, Sessions explicitly instructed DOJ staff to “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/30/21281041/trump-justice-department-consent-decrees-jeff-sessions-police-violence-abuse\">exercise special caution</a>” when agreeing to a consent decree with local governments and effectively told them to do so sparingly. Sessions also required DOJ lawyers to “get permission from many of the Justice Department’s most senior officials before entering into a consent decree,” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/30/21281041/trump-justice-department-consent-decrees-jeff-sessions-police-violence-abuse\">Vox’s Ian Millhiser wrote</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Technically … the Attorney General is supposed to be somewhat independent from the President. But in reality … if the President says, you know, I&#8217;m not sure we need to be involved in these cases as aggressively as the prior administration [was], I think any attorney general would see the tea leaves there,” Michael Gennaco, a former DOJ civil rights attorney and principal at OIR Group, an independent auditor that works with cities to review police practices, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The third way the Trump administration could reduce oversight is by opening up fewer new investigations altogether. The lower number of pattern-or-practice investigations opened in Trump’s first term, compared to Biden’s and Obama’s, underscores the likelihood of this possibility. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The DOJ has a unique authority and access when it comes to looking into misconduct by local police departments and doing a deep dive on their day-to-day operations. State governments also have this capacity, but they tend to have fewer resources than the federal government — and they aren’t backed by the same laws that empower federal investigations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means if Trump’s DOJ takes a step away from police oversight, there will be no comparable authority that can scrutinize departments to the same degree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The horrific attack on Tyre Nichols, that kind of police violence never comes out of nowhere,” Borchetta said. “It always results from some kind of department-wide problem, but understanding what problem leads to that kind of tragedy requires looking under the hood of the police department.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Within a month, it had spiked more than 44 percent. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and XRP also shot up during that period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cryptocurrencies’ sudden increase in value is a sign of investor optimism about President-elect Donald Trump’s policies and those of his picks to head several key regulatory agencies, some of whom have explicitly promised deregulation of the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark reflects the expectation of both political support and regulatory latitude under the incoming administration,” said <a href=\"https://www.libarts.colostate.edu/people/ramaa/\">Ramaa Vasudevan</a>, an economics professor at Colorado State University who has been critical of crypto. “The nomination of crypto-enthusiasts for administrative posts is a clear signal of the embrace of bitcoin and crypto triggering the flood of money into these markets.” <br>Bitcoin’s rally is also a product of its increased legitimacy. Trump’s election may have sparked its rally, but the financial establishment’s embrace of the asset in recent months provided the tinder. While bitcoin was once a niche curiosity, it is now a mainstream digital currency that everyday Americans can now buy through reputable retail investment accounts. Even if bitcoin ultimately turns out to be a bubble, as <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article295793799.html\">many economists have argued</a> it may, these investment vehicles have assured it some staying power.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The policies of the incoming Trump administration are fueling optimism</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has been an ardent cryptocurrency supporter throughout his most recent presidential campaign, and his choices to lead key government agencies related to its regulation reflect that enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bitcoin hit its highest valuation ever following the nomination of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/12/04/paul-atkins-trump-sec-crypto\">Paul Atkins</a> on Wednesday to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is in charge of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">regulating tradable securities like stocks</a>. Atkins was previously an SEC commissioner for six years during former President George W. Bush’s administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Atkins is “not necessarily the sort of burn-it-all-down type of nominee that Trump has decided upon for other positions,” Molly White, a cryptocurrency researcher and critic, told Vox. “He&#8217;s fairly establishment; he has the SEC background, but he also was a very strong advocate for deregulation when he was in the SEC and certainly since then.” Atkins is also a co-chair of the <a href=\"https://digitalchamber.org/priorities/digital-tokens/\">Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance</a>, an industry lobbying group that advocates for lax regulation of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/04/trump-considers-pro-crypto-perianne-boring-caroline-pham-as-possible-cftc-chairs\">Perianne Boring</a>, the CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, is rumored to be one of Trump’s top picks for another key position: head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which makes rules around the trading of futures and commodities. Currently, cryptocurrency is under the purview of the SEC, but the Trump administration is <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-admin-eyes-cftc-lead-digital-asset-regulation\">reportedly weighing</a> regulating it as a commodity instead. If that change is made, cryptocurrency would come under the purview of the CFTC, which is often seen to be more hands-off in its approach to regulation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Billionaire crypto enthusiast David Sacks, whom Trump named Thursday <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-appoints-former-paypal-coo-david-sacks-ai-crypto-czar-2024-12-06/\">as his crypto and AI czar</a>, will be tasked with helping formulate crypto and AI policy from the White House. In that role, Trump said in a post on Truth Social, Sacks will work closely with both the SEC and CTFC to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-industry-hails-david-sacks-czar/\">develop a legal framework to regulate crypto.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump himself is also connected to cryptocurrency via his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-29/trump-s-crypto-project-was-a-bust-until-justin-sun-stepped-in?sref=qYiz2hd0\">family’s cryptocurrency and trading venture World Liberty Financial</a>. Pro-cryptocurrency groups <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/cryptos-245-million-campaign-finance-operation-funded-non-crypto-ads.html\">spent $245 million in this year’s elections</a>, more than any other industry, to support candidates across the country seen as friendlier to crypto.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that likely means that the regulatory landscape under a Trump administration will be much friendlier for crypto following heavier regulations and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/trump-crypto-us-war-0b91cc21\">a slew of lawsuits against crypto companies</a> during current SEC chair Gary Gensler’s tenure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The recent wave of investment in the crypto space is largely driven by the growing belief that years of regulatory uncertainty and lawfare may finally be giving way to clarity,” said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gensler’s SEC cracked <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/trump-crypto-us-war-0b91cc21\">down on trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken</a>, arguing that the buying and selling of cryptocurrency should have the same oversight as something like a stock or bond, and that investors should have access to the same kinds of information about crypto companies as they would have about a company that they are buying stock in. Crypto trading platforms and associated companies, however, argue that crypto tokens aren’t the same as stocks and therefore shouldn’t have the same regulations applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The SEC has brought lawsuits against several major crypto platforms, including Coinbase, which are ongoing. But they could be dropped under the Trump administration, and regulation around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to change significantly under Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under a Trump regulatory regime, cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase could operate with less threat of litigation, making it easier for people to trade on their platforms. Enthusiasts say this will spur innovation in the industry, but it could also mean that individual traders using such platforms are more exposed to fraud, theft, and the volatile nature of the currency.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bitcoin has become an established digital asset</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past five years, and particularly following the downfall of crypto trading platform FTX in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230623_1~80751450e6.en.html\">the narrative around cryptocurrency’s utility</a> has changed. Now, it’s being touted more as an investment instrument rather than a form of currency that can be used like cash, White said. And that pivot is also helping its valuation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In January, the SEC gave the green light to the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/11/heres-what-a-bitcoin-etf-actually-means-for-investors.html\">first bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (or ETFs) in the US. ETFs are baskets of financial instruments (such as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/stock-market\">stocks</a>, bonds, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum) that are bought and sold on a regulated stock exchange.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">ETFs offer anyone indirect access to cryptocurrency, if they choose to invest. Put simply, if the value of bitcoin increases, so does the value of these ETFs — but because of the bundled nature of ETFs and their presence on a regulated exchange, investors are more insulated from loss if bitcoin’s value declines. Firms including BlackRock, Invesco, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest have rolled out bitcoin funds, which offer new investors, especially those who might be more risk-averse, easy ways to purchase or gain exposure to cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Previously, investors had limited options for trading bitcoin. They could go on a cryptocurrency exchange to directly buy bitcoin, but then would have to figure out how to safely and conveniently store it long-term. (Cryptocurrency held on an exchange can be vulnerable to theft, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cold-storage.asp\">while crypto stored offline is safer but difficult to trade</a>.) They could also invest in <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/BitcoinFuturesETF.html#:~:text=Bitcoin%20and%20bitcoin%20futures%20can,some%20point%20in%20the%20future.\">risky bitcoin futures</a>, agreeing to buy or sell the currency at a later date at a certain price. Now, ETFs offer an establishment-backed option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“While no one can predict the exact inflection point or when the price will stabilize, the long-term driver of bitcoin’s rise is its evolution — not just as digital gold, but as a foundational layer of global financial infrastructure,” Catalini said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, Vasudevan said that there is still reason to believe that crypto’s climb won’t last forever. Bitcoin has surged before, only to crash precipitously. In November 2022, bitcoin’s value dropped 20 percent, to below $16,000, in a matter of days <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23458837/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-sbf-downfall-explained\">after the spectacular downfall of the crypto exchange FTX</a>. The concern remains that the price of crypto is based purely on speculation, rather than any inherent value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This has all the makings of another bubble, one that is being stoked by the prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment and the possibilities it is opening for new products and funds that can draw in more and more people into these markets,” Vasudevan said.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s a question plaguing Bravo fans following the news that the hit reality show is <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/11/26/entertainment/vanderpump-rules-scraps-entire-cast-for-season-12-replacing-with-new-sur-vers/\">getting a reboot</a> with a new class of waiters and bartenders in its 12th season. No details about the cast have been revealed yet, except for the expected return of the series’ namesake and executive producer Lisa Vanderpump. However, many are already wondering how a potentially Gen Z cast could alter the show’s identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> premiered in 2013, it arrived as the antithesis to MTV’s <em>The Hills, </em>which followed a group of young, privileged women pursuing careers in entertainment and fashion. The cast of <em>Vanderpump Rules, </em>on the other hand, were anything but aspirational. They were struggling actors and part-time models waiting tables to pay their rent and sharing small apartments. Most of the cast were about to hit 30 when the show first aired, noticeably older than the wide-eyed, college-aged individuals we regularly see on dating competitions and other “young adult” reality series. (Series regular Jax Taylor was 33.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the awareness that most of the cast was “past their prime” and still struggling — with the surprise success of a reality show keeping them afloat — gave <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> a novel and authentic feel. Amid more TV-friendly depictions of 30-somethings as ambitious go-getters — Bravo’s <em>Summer House</em>, for example — the series was a particularly unpleasant depiction of millennial life. Doomed by narcissistic tendencies and an unreliable gig economy, the cast were performing the millennial lifestyle in all the wrong but painfully realistic ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/3/7/23629293/vanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-cheating-raquel-leviss-scandoval\">Scandoval</a>, the explosive cheating scandal between castmate Tom Sandoval and Raquel Leviss that catapulted the show into the national conversation last year, hasn’t exactly paid dividends for the cast. Only one star — the betrayed party, Ariana Madix — has really been able to elevate her career outside of the show, as the host of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/361755/love-island-usa-season-6-finale\">supremely successful <em>Love Island USA</em></a>. The cast would only go on to film one more season after the scandal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This fated ending feels appropriate for a show that so amusingly depicted the so-called <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/27/millennial-recession-covid/\">“unluckiest generation.”</a> It’s this throughline of millennial failure that made the show oddly special for viewers while simultaneously remaining unrewarding for its cast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Drinking and backstabbing are often seen as the key factors in <em>Vanderpump Rules’</em> popularity and<em> </em>lengthy time on the air. However, a constant refusal to evolve was the most crucial plot at the center of its narrative.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>“Vanderpump Rules” documented millennial failure like no other show</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The series thrived on the promise that this group of dysfunctional restaurant workers would never become better people, let alone make their way up the social and economic ladder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even when presented opportunities, the cast still found a way to fumble them. For example, when it seemed like main protagonist Stassi Schroeder had outgrown the show, moving to New York with her boyfriend after season two, she quickly found her way back on the reunion couch, begging Vanderpump for reemployment at her restaurant SUR (and on the show). After publishing a New York Times-bestselling book in 2019, <em>Next Level Basic</em>, she was fired from the series for a racist incident involving Black fellow cast member Faith Stowers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schroeder has astonishingly managed to bounce back, as an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stassischroeder/p/CdJw2NxviwN/?hl=en\">author</a> and <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/stassi-schroeder-lands-seven-figure-142201311.html\">podcast host</a> in addition to nabbing <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/08/stassi-says-docu-comedy-series-vanderpump-rules-stassi-schroeder-hulu-1236035448/\">her own reality show</a>. But other cast members haven&#8217;t had such luck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tom Schwartz and Tom Sandoval are maybe the biggest failsons of the crew. A running joke across the show was that they each owned only 5 percent of TomTom, the restaurant that was opened by Vanderpump from their namesake, among <a href=\"https://people.com/tom-schwartz-and-tom-sandoval-s-bar-schwartz-and-sandy-s-is-closing-exclusive-8751133\">other business failures</a>. Once the pair were at last able to afford homes, their relationships with their respective partners quickly blew up, leaving them adrift. It also goes without saying that Sandoval’s affair and subsequently offputting antics have tainted his public image as a business owner for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/GettyImages-1353347066-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Four colorfully attired 30-somethings, two men and two women, stand in a mirrored bar with dark leather seating.\" title=\"Four colorfully attired 30-somethings, two men and two women, stand in a mirrored bar with dark leather seating.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Ariana Madix, Tom Sandoval, Raquel Leviss, and Tom Schwartz at Hotel Cafe in 2021, in Los Angeles. | Araya Doheny/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Araya Doheny/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The show’s main antagonists Jax Taylor and James Kennedy&nbsp;— before Sandoval stole the mantle — epitomized failure, more so on a moral level than a professional one. Their habitual cheating, constant undermining of friendships, and generally offensive behavior made their level of villainy quite unique, even by reality-TV standards. More specifically, they personified the <a href=\"https://thought.is/were-living-in-the-fuckboy-generation-and-its-our-own-fault/\">“F-boy” archetype</a>, the promiscuous and manipulative type of millennial man who somehow found a way to blame all his&nbsp;bad behavior on his mental health.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s notable that Taylor’s behavior has only regressed on the spin-off <em>The Valley</em>, which debuted on Bravo earlier this year. The series features several former <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>cast members, like Taylor, his ex-spouse Brittany Cartwright and Kristen Doute, supposedly entering a more mature era of their lives. Instead, they’ve largely exhibited the same level of chaos and immaturity displayed on the original show. After five years of a dysfunctional marriage, Taylor and Cartwright’s union <a href=\"https://people.com/jax-taylor-claims-he-initiated-divorce-with-brittany-cartwright-8745836#:~:text=The%20pair%20announced%20their%20separation,whom%20they%20welcomed%20in%202021.\">recently ended in divorce</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>After 11 seasons of reality fame, where does the cast go?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s important to note that, while much of the failure depicted on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> can be attributed to poor decision-making, the reality of starring in unscripted television rarely allows for professional growth. In the United States, at least, it’s rare that reality fame leads to greater opportunities in entertainment. Even if you&#8217;re an A-list reality star, you’re probably not earning that much, as unscripted TV operates on relatively cheap labor. This was evident in the last season of <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>following Scandoval where several cast members <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24159335/vanderpump-reunion-aroana-scheana-lala-scandoval-money\">confessed to struggling financially</a> even after the opportunities granted from the highly publicized scandal. It’s a harsh lesson that a generation primed for self-broadcasting and publicizing their daily lives is collectively learning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what’s left for the cast after a decade of failed relationships, friendships, and businesses, plus 15 minutes of unprecedented fame? Some are left with more possibilities than others. Schwartz and Sandoval are still minority owners of TomTom. Madix and Katie Maloney still have their sandwich shop, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/something-about-her-open-review-vanderpump-rules.html\">Something About Her</a>, which may or may not lead to another reality show. James Kennedy will presumably continue to pursue a humble DJing career, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu5CtNMQEaI\">Lala Kent</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8ZlKG7MrwUc?feature=shared\">Scheana Shay</a>, like so many reality stars and celebrities past their prime, have podcasts. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/GettyImages-1773442458.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A 30-something white man and woman sit in square navy blue chairs with bottles of water on a small table nearby. \" title=\"A 30-something white man and woman sit in square navy blue chairs with bottles of water on a small table nearby. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"James Kennedy and Lala Kent at BravoCon on November 3, 2023. | Bryan Steffy/Bravo via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Bryan Steffy/Bravo via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, it feels unlikely that the current cast — not including the readily employed Madix — will completely disappear from the limelight. For one thing, Bravo and NBCUniversal have a tendency to recycle reality stars, creating new spin-offs, casting them on shows like <em>The Traitors</em> and<em> House of Villains, </em>keeping them stuck in the Bravo-universe for perpetuity. This has already been demonstrated with <em>The Valley. </em>Schwartz, Shay, and Kent have already <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/11/the-valley-season-2-cast-vanderpump-rules-alum-scheana-shay-tom-schwartz-lala-kent-reboot-1236188259/\">filmed scenes</a> for the next season, presumably in a guest-star capacity. <em>The Valley</em> still provides some opportunity to see people in their 30s and 40s making poor decisions. Although, most of the cast, aside from Taylor, Cartwright, and Doute, are living relatively stable lives compared to the ones showcased on <em>Vanderpump Rules.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, it doesn’t really compare to the thrill of watching a group of service workers defy conventional adulthood, whether or not they purposely resisted it or were just less likely to succeed economically. <em>Vanderpump</em>, then, was the perfect document of a generation failed by the “American Dream” and their own individualist tendencies. Presumably, a younger cast will deal with similar hardships. But for fans of a certain age, it just might not hit the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "What is Vanderpump Rules if not a series about middling millennials? It’s a question plaguing Bravo fans following the news that the hit reality show is getting a reboot with a new class of waiters and bartenders in its 12th season. No details about the cast have been revealed yet, except for the expected return [&#8230;]",

But those who do are seeing huge payoffs – <a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/sas/Real.Time.Analytics.pdf\">58% of respondents from one study shared</a> that they have seen a large increase in customer loyalty and retention. This abundance of data enables businesses to form new hypotheses and create connections that may not have been obvious to them, or to their peers. And when there’s a trusted partner to help identify and recommend new directions, businesses of all sizes have the opportunity to thrive and grow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">J.P.

Ardissone and her team transform customer data into actionable insights that inform strategic decision-making.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For example, Customer Insights might reveal that 30% of pet store transactions take place on a Saturday and 40% of those same shoppers visit a home furnishing store after¹.

A <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/05/nx-s1-5217617/blue-cross-blue-shield-anesthesia-anthem\">populist furor against Anthem ensued</a>. People imagined patients waking up from surgery to find they owed thousands of dollars because their procedure went 15 minutes long.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rage at the insurer spread from <a href=\"https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1864408802981777455/quotes\">X users</a> to government officials, with Connecticut Sen. <a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1864430606752358887\">Chris Murphy</a> and New York Gov. <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1864495315362926753\">Kathy Hochul</a> both condemning the insurer’s decision, with the former tweeting, “This is appalling. Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt. And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?” By Thursday, <a href=\"https://providernews.anthem.com/new-york/articles/update-to-anesthesia-billed-time-units-policy-23312\">Anthem had revoked the policy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet this whole tumult was badly misguided.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans have many justified grievances with insurance companies, which often refuse to cover necessary care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this particular fight was not actually about putting the interests of patients against those of rapacious corporations. Anthem’s policy would not have increased costs for their enrollees. Rather, it would have reduced payments for some of <a href=\"https://www.inspiraadvantage.com/blog/highest-paid-doctors-in-the-us\">the most overpaid physicians in America</a>. And when millionaire doctors beat back cost controls — as they have here —&nbsp;patients pay the price through higher premiums.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Anthem’s policy would have cost anesthesiologists, not their enrollees&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Anesthesia services are billed partially on the basis of <a href=\"https://www.coronishealth.com/blog/why-is-time-important-when-billing-for-anesthesia-services#\">how long a procedure takes</a>. This creates an incentive for anesthesiologists to err on the side of exaggerating how long their services were required during an operation. And there is <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2713030\">evidence</a> that some anesthesiologists may engage in overbilling by overstating the length of a procedure, or the degree of risk a patient faces in undergoing anesthesia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Starting in February, Anthem had planned to discourage overbilling by adopting a set of maximum time limits for procedures, inspired by data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If an operation went long for medically necessary reasons, anesthesiologists could appeal for higher payment. But the process of reimbursement would be more arduous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Critically, contrary to Sen. Murphy’s claims, this policy would not have saddled patients with surprise bills, if their operations went over time. The burden of this cost control would have fallen on participating anesthesiologists, not patients, according to <a href=\"https://bloch.umkc.edu/profiles/faculty-directory/christopher-garmon.html\">Christopher Garmon</a>, associate professor of health administration at the University of Missouri-Kansas City’s Henry W. Bloch School of Management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Say there is a contract between an insurance company like Anthem and an anesthesiologist,” Garmon told Vox. “What is always in that contract is a clause that says, ‘You, the provider, agree to accept the reimbursement rules in this contract as payment in full.’ That means the provider cannot then turn around and ask [the patient] for money.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Providers – not insurance companies – are the primary drivers of high health care costs</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Private insurance companies have earned the public’s distrust. They routinely put profitability above their policyholders’ well-being. And a system of private health insurance provision also has <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2020/12/11/cbo-medicare-for-all-reduces-health-spending/\">higher administrative costs than a single-payer system</a>, in which the government is the sole insurer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the avarice and inefficiencies of private insurers are not the sole — or even primary — reasons why vital medical services are often unaffordable and inaccessible in the United States. The bigger issue is that America’s health care providers — hospitals, physicians, and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2024/02/01.html\">drug companies</a> — charge much higher rates than their peers in other wealthy nations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2021, the US spent nearly<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/\">twice as much per capita</a> on health care than other developed countries. According to the <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/what-drives-health-spending-in-the-u-s-compared-to-other-countries/#Healthcare%20spending%20per%20capita,%20by%20spending%20category,%202021\">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, this gap is mostly explained by higher payments to hospitals and physicians. Americans spend $7,500 per person on inpatient and outpatient care, while other rich nations spend an average of $2,969 per person. This is not because Americans are receiving more medical care than their peers abroad; on the contrary, we make fewer doctors’ visits per capita and have shorter average hospital stays. We just pay much higher prices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, the <a href=\"https://www.beckersasc.com/asc-news/physician-compensation-in-the-us-vs-10-other-countries.html#2\">average physician salary</a> in the United States was $352,000. In Germany, that figure was $160,000; in the United Kingdom, it was $122,000; in France, it was $93,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This discrepancy is partly explained by the fact that those European nations have more socialized health care systems, in which the government imposes more cost controls on medical providers. In the past, progressives have emphasized that a Medicare-for-all system would reduce overall health care costs by forcing providers to accept lower payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With its new policy, Anthem was attempting to do precisely this: force anesthesiologists to accept lower rates of reimbursement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the case for forcing down payment rates for anesthesiologists is especially strong. According to Medscape’s <a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2024-compensation-anesthesiologist-6017131?icd=login_success_email_match_norm\">2024 Anesthesiologist Salary Report</a>, the average salary for an American <a href=\"https://comphealth.com/resources/anesthesiologist-salary-report-2024\">anesthesiologist in 2023 was $472,000</a>. This represented a $70,000 increase over the field’s average salary in 2022. This makes anesthesiologists among the top five highest-earning specialists in the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If we want America’s health care system to treat more patients — while charging us all less money for coverage — then there is no alternative to forcing myriad specialists to accept lower payment rates. Ideally, we would do this through a comprehensive system of public cost controls and insurance provision. Failing that, we need private insurers to drive a harder bargain with the most expensive doctors and hospitals. When we demonize insurers for doing precisely that, we aren’t standing up against our health care sector’s profiteers — we’re sticking up for them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Yet, while the Constitution permits Biden to pardon whoever he wants, such a pardon won’t necessarily protect its recipient from everything Trump or his allies in government might do to make life difficult for Trump’s perceived enemies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/trump-2024-president.html\">threatened “retribution”</a> against perceived enemies, and some of his nominees for top law enforcement jobs have gotten more specific. In a 2023 book, FBI director nominee Kash Patel published a list of 60 “<a href=\"https://x.com/Timodc/status/1863620081873244259/photo/1\">members of the executive branch deep state</a>” — all people his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">FBI might try to investigate</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Patel’s list includes Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris; current and former top government officials, including Republicans like former Attorney General Bill Barr; as well as more obscure figures like a former FBI agent and a former legal representative for the Democratic National Committee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the New York Times, the discussion of pardons for these or other individuals “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">remains primarily at a staff level</a>,” but those discussions are reportedly being led by White House counsel Ed Siskel, one of Biden’s highest-level advisers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Current law provides that people who are pardoned receive broad legal protections against federal criminal charges. Any pardons Biden issues should be virtually invulnerable to a court challenge. In <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/71/333/\"><em>Ex parte Garland</em></a> (1866), the Supreme Court held that the president’s pardon power is “unlimited,” except that the president cannot pardon impeachments. Under <em>Garland</em>, the pardon power “extends to every offence known to [federal] law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.” It also is “not subject to legislative control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion\">always some risk</a> that the current Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 Republican supermajority, will ignore precedent. But the idea that presidents get to decide who is pardoned and that courts do not get to second-guess those decisions is well-established and stretches back to at least the post-Civil War period.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three limits on Biden’s pardon power</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There actually are three very significant limits on the pardon power, however. A person pardoned by Biden might still be successfully targeted by Trump administration officials or Trump’s allies in state government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One is that, as the head of the federal government, Biden <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep267/usrep267087/usrep267087.pdf\">can only pardon federal crimes</a>. So someone who receives a pardon from Biden (or any other sitting president) might still be prosecuted by state officials for offenses under state law. The Trump administration, in other words, could potentially lean on MAGA-friendly state prosecutors to target individuals who receive a federal pardon from Biden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It should be noted that state prosecutors should not be allowed to target a former federal official for something that official did pursuant to their duties as a federal employee.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The seminal Supreme Court case on this point, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/135/1/\"><em>In re Neagle</em></a> (1890), arose from a truly wild set of facts. Stephen Field, a justice of the US Supreme Court, had a longstanding feud with David Terry, a former Chief Justice of California. In 1889, while Field was eating breakfast at a train station in California, Terry approached and assaulted Field. Field’s bodyguard, a deputy US marshal named David Neagle, then shot and killed Terry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After California charged Neagle with murder, the US Supreme Court ruled that this prosecution must be dismissed. Neagle, the Court explained, was “acting under the authority of the law of the United States” when he killed Terry, and thus was “not liable to answer in the courts of California” for carrying out his official federal duties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Assuming the current Supreme Court honors its precedent in <em>Neagle</em>, in other words, former federal officials should be safe from prosecution for state crimes they allegedly committed while “acting under the authority of the United States.” So if a state were to target, say, former federal public health official Anthony Fauci over federal policies Fauci pushed during the Covid-19 pandemic, Fauci should be immune from that prosecution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second limit on the pardon power is that, while <em>Garland</em> states that presidents may issue a pardon “at any time after” the pardon recipient allegedly committed a criminal act, the president may not prospectively pardon future acts. That means that anyone pardoned by Biden could still be targeted in the Trump administration for anything they do after Biden leaves office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The third limit is that the pardon power has traditionally been understood to extend only to criminal offenses and not to civil lawsuits or other non-criminal investigations (although at least one scholar has <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4584&amp;context=buffalolawreview\">argued that it should be extended to civil offenses</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, while Biden could potentially shield Trump’s perceived enemies from federal criminal prosecutions, the Trump administration might still sue a pardoned individual for allegedly violating a civil statute. It could also potentially use non-criminal investigations, such as an IRS income tax audit, to target people Trump views as foes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Even if Trump’s enemies are ultimately exonerated, the federal government could still cause them an extraordinary amount of misery</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a final point, it’s worth noting that lawyers are expensive. Anyone Biden might preemptively pardon, who is targeted by the federal government, could run up hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees even if the courts ultimately determine that this individual is both immune from prosecution and not liable for any civil offense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is doubly true if the Trump administration manages to shunt any criminal proceeding or civil dispute against a pardoned individual into a MAGA-aligned judge’s courtroom, who might defy precedents like <em>Garland </em>or <em>Neagle</em>. While the Supreme Court may eventually intervene and declare the individual immune from prosecution or suit, that may not happen until after years of investigations and months of lower court proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, even if a federal investigation uncovers no illegal activity — or even no activity that the Trump administration can characterize as illegal in order to bring meritless charges — such an investigation might still uncover embarrassing or damaging information that could then be made public. Perhaps one of Trump’s perceived enemies is engaged in an extramarital affair. Or maybe they simply said something hurtful about a family member or business partner in an email they thought would remain private.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bottom line is that, if the federal government is determined to make your life miserable, it can probably achieve that goal very easily, even if you never spend a day behind bars.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That’s if the incoming Trump administration doesn’t decide to upend the court’s decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">TikTok debuted in the US in 2017 as a platform for short-form videos and became the most downloaded app in the world during the pandemic, a hub for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22939754/how-to-become-a-content-creator-economy\">creatives</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/19/world/palestinians-x-tiktok-instagram-gaza-cec/index.html\">activists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24147273/young-people-national-experiment-tiktok-politics\">politicians</a>, and more. However, as its influence grew, so did concerns that the app, owned by a Chinese company, could endanger American interests. That led to a bipartisan effort to force it to cut its ties with China or ban it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ban, which would drop TikTok from US app stores if its owner ByteDance does not divest by January 19, passed and was signed by President Joe Biden in April. TikTok and some of its content creators swiftly challenged the law in court, arguing that it violates the free speech rights of its <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/tiktok-now-150-million-active-users-us-ceo-tell-congress-rcna75607\">more than 150 million</a> American users. The Department of Justice has countered that the app, given its connection to a foreign adversary, must be banned for national security reasons. On Friday, judges on the DC Circuit court <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-ban-appeals-court-congress/\">sided with the DOJ</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">TikTok and the DOJ asked the DC Circuit to issue a ruling in the case by December 6, and the court delivered. But that won’t necessarily resolve the matter of a ban once and for all. There is likely to be a lengthy appeal at the US Supreme Court, and the incoming Trump administration could reverse course on the government’s TikTok policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President-elect Donald Trump has had a fickle relationship with TikTok. His Cabinet picks are also divided on how to handle the platform. That leaves TikTok’s future uncertain, regardless of the final outcome of legal challenges to a ban. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How we got here</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A TikTok ban has been in the works since the first Trump administration. Lawmakers have argued for years that the Chinese government is using the app to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/china-espionage-tiktok-spying-national-security/\">spy on Americans</a> by collecting their personal data and to spread propaganda that could be used to <a href=\"https://time.com/6836078/tiktok-sold-banned-2024-election/\">influence US elections</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, ever the anti-China hawk, tried to ban the platform <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/06/900019185/trump-signs-executive-order-that-will-effectively-ban-use-of-tiktok-in-the-u-s\">unilaterally via executive order</a> in 2020. But the order faced swift legal challenges that were never resolved before Biden came into office and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57413227\">rescinded it</a>, instead helping craft legislation to ban it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the bill came before Congress in March, ByteDance urged its users to call their representatives in protest. Teens and older people alike reportedly pleaded with congressional staff, <a href=\"https://x.com/Olivia_Beavers/status/1765778091278778697?s=20\">saying they spend all day on the app</a>. Creators posted on TikTok urging their followers to do the same. Some offices decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/07/tiktok-users-protest-congress-potential-ban\">temporarily shut down their phone lines</a> as a result, which meant that they couldn’t field calls from their constituents about other issues either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lawmakers in both parties <a href=\"https://x.com/Olivia_Beavers/status/1765813340310270456?s=20\">didn’t take kindly to the impromptu lobbying frenzy</a>. Some characterized it as confirmation of their fears that the Chinese-owned app — which was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-banned-us-government-where-else-around-the-world/\">already banned on government devices</a> — is brainwashing America. The overrun phone lines were merely “making the case” for the bill, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) <a href=\"https://x.com/chiproytx/status/1765779738931404936?s=20\">wrote on X</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the bill passed, ByteDance refused to sell TikTok, despite the fact that the company likely could have found a US buyer. Former Treasury Secretary <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2024/3/14/24101155/tiktok-ban-mnuchin-senate-china-shou-meta\">Steve Mnuchin</a> was among those publicly angling to purchase the app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, TikTok challenged the law in court, arguing that it violated American users’ free speech rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. It also said that it would not be possible for ByteDance to divest within the 270-day period specified by the law due to technological challenges and the fact that the sale would have to include TikTok’s algorithm — something the Chinese government would not allow it to sell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“For the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than one billion people worldwide,” the company said in legal filings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Legal experts say Congress likely doesn’t have the power to outright ban TikTok or any social media platform under the First Amendment unless it can prove that it poses legitimate and serious privacy and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/defense-and-security\">national security</a> concerns that can’t be addressed by any other means. The question in the case before the DC Circuit is whether the government could have, in fact, addressed its national security concerns by other means and whether this ban actually does so. TikTok argues that the government could have found less restrictive ways to address its concerns and that the ban does not resolve them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The government’s national security arguments in the lawsuit are redacted in legal filings. But reports have suggested that both the Chinese government and TikTok employees have abused the app’s user data. A former employee of ByteDance has alleged in court that the government <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/08/tech/tiktok-data-china/index.html\">accessed user data</a> on a widespread basis for political purposes during the 2018 protests in Hong Kong. And last December, ByteDance acknowledged it had fired four employees who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/22/tiktoks-chinese-owner-fires-workers-who-gathered-data-journalists/\">accessed the data of two journalists</a> while trying to track down an internal leaker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, civil society groups have argued that a ban won’t address concerns about data privacy. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) <a href=\"https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Coalition_Letter_Opposing_H.R._7521.pdf\">wrote in a letter to federal lawmakers</a> that the Chinese government can still access Americans’ data in other ways. For instance, it could just as well buy Americans’ data on a legitimate open market, where the sale of that data remains unrestricted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, the DC Circuit appeared to reject TikTok’s points in its decision. In the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.1208687460.0_1.pdf\">majority opinion, Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote</a>, &#8220;The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary&#8217;s ability to gather data on people in the United States.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The court seemed to be leaning in this direction during oral arguments in the case. It noted that the US already bans foreign ownership of broadcasting licenses, asking why a ban on TikTok is substantially different. While acknowledging weighty free speech concerns with a ban, the court also questioned TikTok’s assertion that those rights would outweigh all else, to the point that the US could not ban the app even if at war with the country controlling it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now that the court’s upheld the ban, an appeal to the Supreme Court is likely. Since banning TikTok is an issue that cuts across party lines, it’s not clear how the conservative majority would rule. Trump’s return to the White House may also introduce uncertainty into the implementation of the ban, even if it survives legal challenges. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What a Trump presidency means for the future of TikTok</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite previously seeking to ban TikTok, Trump has since warmed to the platform, on which he now has <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@realdonaldtrump?lang=en\">14.6 million followers</a>, and he has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/11/15/for-embattled-tiktok-trump-offers-hope-of-a-reprieve\">save it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s unclear what exactly brought about his reversal. He’s said that banning TikTok would only benefit Meta, and he may be out for revenge against the company, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/12/meta-removes-restrictions-trump-instagram-facebook\">blocked him</a> from Instagram and Facebook for two years following the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/11/trump-says-a-tiktok-ban-would-empower-meta-slams-facebook-as-enemy-of-the-people.html\">told CNBC</a> in March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another factor could be the influence of one of Trump’s billionaire megadonors. Jeff Yass’s investment firm Susquehanna <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/technology/tiktok-investors-bytedance.html\">reportedly</a> owns 15 percent of TikTok’s parent company, a stake worth about $40 billion, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/256a45c3-8c78-4448-9dbe-8382c0788457\">according</a> to the Financial Times. As of May, Yass had <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/who-is-jeff-yass-the-gop-billionaire-donor-dominating-2024.html\">contributed more</a> than any other individual donor to Republican candidates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, it’s not clear if Trump will keep his word to salvage TikTok given that he is surrounding himself with people who vehemently oppose the app. That includes his pick for secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/trumps-cabinet-picks-deeply-divided-tiktok-ban-rcna181042\">Marco Rubio</a>, and for Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr. Carr <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/386224/project-2025-trump-cabinet-carr-homan\">wrote in Project 2025</a> (the policy manifesto by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank) that TikTok is part of a Chinese “foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Trump has also nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence. Both have substantial followings on TikTok and oppose a ban.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump may have several options if he does decide to oppose the TikTok ban. The language of the ban is “broad and invests the president with quite a bit of discretion in how he chooses to enforce the ban,” George Wang, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told Vox. That includes determining whether ByteDance has engaged in a “qualified divestiture” from TikTok that would save it from a ban.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It could grant the president some leeway to decline to enforce the ban if TikTok or ByteDance comes to some sufficient solution,” Wang said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alternatively, Trump may be able to influence the kinds of arguments that the DOJ would make to defend the ban (or not) before the Supreme Court if the case is appealed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He might also be able to negotiate with Chinese officials to achieve a sale of TikTok to a US buyer in compliance with the law. James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5213735\">told NPR</a> that, based on his conversations with such officials, they may be more open to a sale if Trump backs down somewhat on his tariff threats against China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Wang said the best outcome would be a more permanent solution that protects Americans’ First Amendment rights, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Trump might decide not to enforce the TikTok ban when he first takes office in January, but he could also change his mind at any point,” he said. “And so, while I think maybe some of these enforcement and executive branch solutions might be good temporarily, I&#8217;m still really hoping that the courts declare the law unconstitutional or Congress decides to repeal it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, December 6, 11:20 am ET: </strong>This post was originally published on December 5 and has been updated to reflect the DC Circuit court’s decision.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

If that’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACT9C_iOekAAHWG61JMkVWygOTOAI-R82xK3DvF8LHfcrUGezGbEBO52NXE6CHYX89QZxwNQVsF10T2ahz2z7waLkRDZ9pNn0_ctuoi5jNSF36J3UII0YaWle_6cz_tc-KjRVK2I1AA2lkxp-TGJQsX6RM55kxaPBjNj-Sr6u-u0\">no longer true</a>, then the future of AI development will look a lot different — and potentially a lot less optimistic — than the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This reporting was greeted with a <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-new-ai-scaling-law-shell-game\">chorus</a> of “I told you so” from AI skeptics. (I’m not inclined to give them too much credit, as many of them have definitely predicted 20 of the last two AI slowdowns.) But getting a sense of how AI researchers felt about it was harder. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last few weeks, I pressed some AI researchers in academia and industry on whether they thought The Information’s story captured a real dynamic — and if so, how it would change the future of AI going forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The overall answer I’ve heard is that we should probably expect the impact of AI to grow, not shrink, over the next few years, regardless of whether naive scaling is indeed slowing down. That’s effectively because when it comes to AI, we already have an enormous amount of impact that’s just waiting to happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are powerful systems already available that can do a lot of commercially valuable work — it’s just that no one has quite figured out many of the commercially valuable applications, let alone put them into practice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-long-did-it-take-the-inter-NQD6wXJ0R0O_urbmRkp8YQ\">took decades</a> from the internet’s birth to transform the world, and it might take decades for AI also (Maybe — many people on the cutting edge of this world are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2024/03/10/10-ai-predictions-for-the-year-2030/#:~:text=By%202030%2C%20AI%20will%20be,human%20capabilities%20in%20other%20ways.\">still very insistent</a> that in only a few years, our world will be unrecognizable.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bottom line: If greater scale no longer gives us greater returns, that’s a big deal with serious implications for how the AI revolution will play out, but it’s not a reason to declare the AI revolution canceled.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Most people kind of hate AI while kind of underrating it</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s something those in the artificial intelligence bubble may not realize: AI is not a popular new technology, and it’s actually getting <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/\">less popular over time</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve written that I think it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/14/23760648/artificial-intelligence-ai-safety-progress-risks-existential-catastrophic-openai\">poses extreme risks</a>, and many Americans <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/\">agree with me</a>, but also many people dislike it in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/style/ai-search-slop.html\">much more mundane way</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its most visible consequences so far are unpleasant and frustrating. Google Image results are full of <a href=\"https://www.creativebloq.com/ai/googles-ai-slop-invasion-feels-like-the-beginning-of-the-end\">awful low-quality AI slop</a> instead of the cool and varied artwork that used to appear. Teachers <a href=\"https://theweek.com/education/1025698/artificial-intelligence-goes-to-school\">can’t really assign</a> take-home essays anymore because AI-written work is so widespread, while for their part many students have been wrongly accused of using AI when they didn’t because AI detection tools are <a href=\"https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/\">actually terrible</a>. Artists and writers <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-exec-ai-creative-jobs-shouldnt-exist\">are furious</a> about the use of our work to train models that will then take our jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of this frustration is very justified. But I think there’s an unfortunate tendency to conflate “AI sucks” with the idea that “AI isn’t that useful.” The question “what is AI good for?” is a popular one, even though in fact the answer is that AI is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/10/15-amazing-real-world-applications-of-ai-everyone-should-know-about/\">already good for an enormous number of things</a> and new applications are being developed at a breathtaking pace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think at times our frustration with AI slop and with the carelessness with which AI has been developed and deployed can spill over into underrating AI as a whole. A lot of people <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/openai-google-scaling-laws-anthropic-ai/\">eagerly pounced</a> on the news that OpenAI and competitors are struggling to make the next generation of models even better, and took it as proof that the AI wave was all hype and will be followed by bitter disappointment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two weeks later, OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ben-sherry/openais-next-generation-models-could-reportedly-cost-2000.html\">announced</a> the latest generation models, and sure enough they’re better than ever. (One caveat: It’s hard to say how much of the improvement comes from scale as opposed to from the many other possible sources of improvement, so this doesn’t mean that the initial Information reporting was wrong). </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t let AI fool you</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s fine to dislike AI. But it’s a bad idea to underrate it. And it’s a bad habit to take each hiccup, setback, limitation, or engineering challenge as reason to expect the AI transformation of our world to come to a halt — or even to slow down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, I think the better way to think about this is that, at this point, an AI-driven transformation of our world is definitely going to happen. Even if larger models than those which exist today are never trained, existing technology is sufficient for large-scale disruptive changes. And reasonably often when a limitation crops up, it’s prematurely declared totally intractable … and then solved in short order. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After a few go-rounds of this particular dynamic, I’d like to see if we can cut it off at the pass. Yes, various technological challenges and limitations are real, and they prompt strategic changes at the large AI labs and shape how progress will play out in the future. No, the latest such challenge doesn’t mean that the AI wave is over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">AI is here to stay, and the response to it has to mature past wishing it would go away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\">Future Perfect</a>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\">Sign up here!</a></em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

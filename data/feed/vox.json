Which is to say, the potential for solar energy is immense, and we’re nowhere near the limit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why solar energy is such an appealing prospect, particularly as an alternative to the fossil fuels that cause climate change. And over the past decade, solar energy technology has vastly improved in performance and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices\">plummeted in cost</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Price-of-electricity-new-renewables-vs-new-fossil-no-geo_2426.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,33.051013236418,100,33.897973527164\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a result, photovoltaic panels have cropped up like dandelions across fields and rooftops at a stunning pace. Yet even the people most plugged-in to the energy industry and most optimistic about solar power continue to underestimate it. In fact, it’s a <a href=\"https://x.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1730992987021226002\">long-running joke among energy nerds</a> that forecasters keep predicting solar will level off as it continues to rocket up to the sun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Solar does continue to surprise us,” said <a href=\"https://lafollette.wisc.edu/people/nemet-gregory-f/\">Gregory Nemet</a>, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/How-Solar-Energy-Became-Cheap-A-Model-for-Low-Carbon-Innovation-1st-Edition/Nemet/p/book/9780367136598\"><em>How Solar Energy Became Cheap</em></a>, in an email. “It seems like it shouldn’t at this point. It’s been roughly 30 percent growth each year for 30 years. And costs continue to fall so new users — and new uses — continue to emerge.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the past year, solar power has experienced Brobdingnagian growth, even by solar standards. According to a <a href=\"https://ember-climate.org/insights/in-brief/solar-power-continues-to-surge-in-2024\">new report from Ember</a>, an energy think tank, the world is on track to install 29 percent more solar energy capacity this year — a total of 593 gigawatts — compared to last year, which was already a record year<em>.</em> This is more than one-quarter of the electricity produced by <a href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/report/boom-and-bust-coal-2024/\">every operating coal plant in the world</a> <em>combined</em>. In 2020, the whole world had installed just <a href=\"https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IEA_PVPS_Snapshot_2021-V3.pdf\">760 GW of solar </a><em><a href=\"https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IEA_PVPS_Snapshot_2021-V3.pdf\">in total</a>.</em> Yes, this <em>deserves</em> all the <em>italics</em> I’m using.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/CHART-1-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.978661621717,100,70.042676756567\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That solar power installations are going up as the technology improves and prices come down isn’t too surprising, but the sustained surge is still stunning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When you look at the absolute numbers that we’re on track for this year and that we installed last year, it is completely sort of mind-blowing,” said <a href=\"https://ember-climate.org/about/people/euan-graham/\">Euan Graham</a>, lead author of the report and an electricity data analyst at Ember.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Several factors have aligned to push solar power installations so high in recent years, like better hardware, economies of scale, and new, ripe, energy-hungry markets. Right now, solar still just provides around <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix\">5.5 percent of the world’s electricity</a>, so there’s enormous room to expand. But solar energy still poses some technical challenges to the power grid, and the world’s ravenous appetite for electrons means that countries are looking for energy wherever they can get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So if you’re concerned about climate change, it’s not enough that solar wins; greenhouse gasses must lose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why’s everything so sunny for solar?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Solar energy has a lot going for it, particularly photovoltaic panels. They’re modular and they scale up and down easily — there isn’t much difference between a panel that’s one of a dozen on a suburban rooftop and a panel that’s one of thousands in a megawatt-scale power plant spanning acres. They’re mass-produced in factories using well-established processes, namely semiconductor fabrication. That means tiny improvements in cost and performance in individual panels add up to massive advantages in aggregate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And for solar, gains have been anything but tiny: Solar electricity prices have <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90583426/the-price-of-solar-electricity-has-dropped-89-in-10-years\">dropped 89 percent since 2010</a> while silicon solar panels have <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html\">surged in efficiency</a> from 15 percent to more than 26 percent over the last 40 years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Solar’s scalability means that curious developers can try it out with less upfront investment before ramping up. Most solar installations use off-the-shelf components, so when a homeowner or a utility does decide to step into the sunlight, they can start making power quickly. “That development time is absolutely minimal compared to something like building a nuclear power station, but also even just a wind farm, which can take five to seven years or so from the initial permitting to first power coming out,” Graham said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if you don’t care about climate change, solar energy has become one of the cheapest, fastest ways to sate your appetite for electrons. Texas, the biggest oil and gas producer in the country, is also the national leader in adding solar power to its grid, <a href=\"https://www.houston.org/news/texas-top-state-solar-energy-houston-secures-new-projects\">surpassing California</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But what happens when the sun sets?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Solar does have some drawbacks. The sun does sink below the horizon every day, and solar energy’s output varies with weather and the seasons — dipping when it’s cloudy and when the days get shorter. Banking electricity when it’s abundant to use when it’s scarce would resolve this problem, and, well, there’s good news on that front too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Energy storage technologies like batteries are also getting way better and cheaper. The price of batteries has <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/battery-price-decline\">tanked 97 percent since 1991</a>. Because of better technology, falling costs, and more markets for saving power,&nbsp; the US is on track to <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/chart-the-us-grid-battery-fleet-is-about-to-double-again\">double its grid energy storage capacity</a> compared to last year. <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/energy-storage-2023-battery-projects-solar-acp/709851/\">More than 10 gigawatts of solar and storage</a> came online in 2023 across the country and that’s <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/the-state-of-us-distributed-solar-plus-storage/\">likely to double this year</a>. “Energy storage is at an earlier stage [than solar] but we are likely to see rapid expansion in that segment, especially in regions where solar and wind penetration are high already such as California and Texas,” said <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/contributors/275407/steve-piper\">Steve Piper</a>, director of energy research at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, in an email.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/residential-solar-us.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=2.608125,0,94.78375,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">​Combined solar-plus-storage energy projects are already <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41971-7\">cheaper than new fossil fuel power plants</a> in many parts of the world, and <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/85332.pdf\">costs are poised to fall further</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good morning with good news: Solar plus storage or wind plus storage are NOW much cheaper than coal or gas generated electricity in most of the world.<br><br>By 2027, clean solar or wind PLUS STORAGE are cheaper than dirty fossil fuels in the entire world!<a href=\"https://t.co/ZtyhVOZNFV\">https://t.co/ZtyhVOZNFV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/l9pz28hYhs\">pic.twitter.com/l9pz28hYhs</a></p>&mdash; John Raymond Hanger  (@johnrhanger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnrhanger/status/1835275841669845449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even knowing all this, energy experts keep underestimating the potential of solar. “Forecasters recognize that with regard to solar PV we are in a phase of rapid expansion and adoption,” Piper said. “In a period like this, being off about the rate of expansion by even a little bit will still result in a large forecast error.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The details of solar energy’s expansion are even more surprising</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not every country is riding the solar power rocket to the sun just yet. Individual countries have seen peaks and dips in solar installations based on how well their economies are doing and how strong their policy incentives are, like feed-in tariffs, net metering, and tax credits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the past couple of years, the global story has really been about China. Add up every solar panel installed in the US in history and you get how much <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/china-solar-energy-exports.html\">China installed last year</a> alone, <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/020824-infographic-china-solar-capacity-coal-electricity-renewable-energy-hydro-wind\">almost 60 percent of all new solar</a> installed in the world. The sheer scale of this deployment broke a lot of forecasters’ models.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/CHART-8-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.760528112907,100,72.478943774186\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“No research shop necessarily predicted the pace at which China was going to grow their solar capacity over the last year or so,” said <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/profiles/people-profiles/michelle-davis/\">Michelle Davis</a>, head of global solar at Wood Mackenzie, an energy market analysis firm. “Everyone’s been revising them upward in order to correct for the data that’s been coming out of China.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Photovoltaics are also a key part of China’s export strategy, and last year, China cut <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/china-solar-energy-exports.html\">wholesale panel prices in half</a>. That in turn has led to a huge surge in exports and knock-on solar power booms in other countries. Pakistan, the fifth-most populous country in the world, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-09/pakistan-sees-solar-boom-as-chinese-imports-surge-bnef-says\">imported 13 gigawatts of Chinese solar</a> modules in the first half of this year alone. That’s almost one-third of Pakistan’s <a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40308041\">total installed electricity</a> to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Davis cautioned that imports of solar panels don’t necessarily mean they’ll all be installed, but it’s definitely a sign that solar is growing and its impact may be greater there than in larger or wealthier countries. While the solar energy additions in developing countries may be smaller in absolute numbers, they’re proportionately a larger share of the grid.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/CHART-7-1-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.760528112907,100,72.478943774186\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Those developing parts of the world are growing at a more rapid rate on a smaller base,” Davis said. “The big Kahunas in the solar world are China, Europe, and the United States. Those markets are maturing, though, and they’re not growing as fast.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There are some clouds in the sky</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This can’t keep going on forever, right? Well, again, solar is still in the single digits in the global electricity supply, and it’s often the cheapest, fastest, and easiest way to generate power. That momentum isn’t going to dissipate anytime soon. In the US, the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut means it will likely be even <a href=\"https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy\">cheaper to get a loan to finance solar power</a>, giving it another boost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some challenges have also emerged. If you want to add more solar to the US power grid right now, you need to take a number and get in line. There are hardware limits to how much intermittent power you can add to the aging electricity network, and making the necessary upgrades to accommodate it costs money and takes time. <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/grid-interconnection-queue-berkeley-lab-lbnl/712926/\">Delays are getting longer</a>: In 2015, a typical energy project waited about three years in an interconnection queue. In 2023, that wait time was almost five years. Getting the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/367950/permitting-reform-biden-climate-manchin-renewable-energy\">permits to build more large-scale solar</a> is also a tedious process. Many countries are facing similar hurdles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition, the US is bolstering its domestic clean energy sector with trade barriers, including tariffs on Chinese solar panels. That may give an advantage to US producers but it raises overall costs and <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/us-solar-shattered-records-in-2023-but-will-this-continue-in-2024/\">imposes supply chain constraints</a>. The US is also <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-40-million-support-domestic-solar-supply-chain-0\">investing $40 million</a> to bring more of the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/sector-spotlight-solar-pv-supply-chain\">solar energy supply chain within its borders</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And solar power didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree; it exists in the context of a global economy that’s still <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/062623-fossil-fuels-stubbornly-dominating-global-energy-despite-surge-in-renewables-energy-institute\">80 percent powered by coal, oil, and natural gas</a>. Overall <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press542.php\">global energy consumption is growing</a>, and not everyone is discerning about where they get their heat and electricity. As a result, fossil fuel demand is also rising, though it may <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/world-oil-gas-coal-demand-peak-by-2030-iea-says-2023-10-24/\">peak before the end of the decade</a>. To meet international climate change targets of limiting warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit this century, greenhouse gas emissions have to fall at a much faster clip and effectively zero out by 2050.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Analysts are anticipating that solar energy will help bend that curve. According to Wood Mackenzie, total global solar capacity is going to almost <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/solar-storage-power-ebook/\">quadruple in the next decade</a>. It’s not certain whether the world will reach its climate goals, but solar will continue to spread as sure as the sun will rise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

O’Brien speaks during a rally with workers and union members as part of an “Amazon Teamsters Day of Solidarity” in support of the unionization and collective bargaining of Amazon delivery drivers at the Teamsters Local 848 on August 29, 2024, in Long Beach, California. | Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the US’s largest and best-known labor unions, has declined to endorse a candidate for president, citing <a href=\"https://teamster.org/2024/09/teamsters-no-endorsement-for-u-s-president/\">major political divides among its membership</a>, as well as dissatisfaction with each major candidate’s stances on key union priorities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a tight presidential race where the vast majority of labor unions have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Teamsters’ decision not to do so could be <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/18/teamsters-no-endorsement-2024-election-00179900\">seen as a high-profile rebuke</a>, especially since Harris is part of a Democratic administration that has, for the most part, been highly supportive of labor union rights. Whether the decision actively hurts her, however, remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Teamsters represent <a href=\"https://teamster.org/about/who-are-teamsters/\">more than a million workers from many industries</a>, including UPS drivers and workers in construction, healthcare, and sanitation. Their members are located throughout the United States. But Teamsters have a particularly strong base in the Midwest and in swing states that could be decisive in November.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ahead of the decision, the Teamsters polled members on their presidential preferences. In <a href=\"https://x.com/Teamsters/status/1836463348269092918\">a September telephone poll</a>, 58 percent of Teamsters members supported Republican candidate Donald Trump, and 31 percent said they’d like the union to endorse Harris. In <a href=\"https://x.com/Teamsters/status/1836463348269092918\">straw polls </a>conducted at town halls prior to President Joe Biden’s decision to exit the race in July, 44 percent of members supported Biden, versus 36 percent for Trump.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the poll results suggest a general preference for Trump, a number of Teamsters local unions and subgroups have vocally come out in support for Harris. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=902251271948738&amp;set=pcb.902251531948712\">Teamsters National Black Caucus</a> endorsed Harris in August, not waiting for the national organization’s decision. In the wake of Wednesday’s announcement, local unions in battlegrounds like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid032b44mPxVu8DXhc2cwQm5rfcruMJYzMr6Y8fCU8JZfPWymWz9j4QJomGFwbTEdc3Tl&amp;id=100090106275788\">Michigan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=948008424036464&amp;set=a.476571584513486\">Wisconsin</a>, and <a href=\"https://triblive.com/news/politics-election/western-pa-teamsters-endorse-kamala-harris-breaking-with-national-union/\">Pennsylvania</a> — <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4888157-kamala-harris-endorsement-local-teamsters-unions-battleground-states-2024/\">among others</a> — also endorsed Harris. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now both camps are claiming to have the Teamsters behind them, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/18/teamsters-endorsement-election/\">Trump because of the poll results</a>, and Harris <a href=\"https://x.com/IanSams/status/1836522868215108026\">because of the local endorsements</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will the Teamsters’ political decision carry weight in November?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lack of endorsement may not ultimately matter much when it comes to how Teamsters will vote. The polls and local endorsements so far have made it clear that most Teamsters have a set preference this election cycle, and it’s not clear that an endorsement from the national union would have done much to change that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, told Vox that where union endorsement really matters is on the ground, campaigning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Union endorsements are valuable because they usually come with access to resources, particularly volunteers to knock on doors and work phone banks,” Squire said. “Leadership may be able to persuade some members to vote the way they would like, but the real value is in campaign assistance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Besides the setback of having fewer volunteers, there’s also some possibility that the non-endorsement could sway non-union voters sympathetic to labor issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s the broad symbolism” of the lack of endorsement, Vanderbilt University professor of sociology and political economy <a href=\"https://as.vanderbilt.edu/sociology/bio/larry-isaac/#:~:text=(2015%2D2021)-,Larry%20W.,Sociology%20at%20Florida%20State%20University.\">Larry Isaac</a> told Vox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Teamsters national president Sean O’Brien said, “We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges.” That statement, along with the larger choice not to issue an endorsement, makes an explicit argument that neither candidate would look out for organized labor.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, there were indications that the union might not endorse at all, in a break with other major unions — which wasn&#8217;t a total shock given that the Teamsters have often been out of step politically with the rest of the US labor union movement, Isaac said. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/united-auto-workers-endorse-harris-biden-trump-uaw-71b3228411a677514100cf0407522ede\">United Auto Workers</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/press-release/afts-weingarten-celebrates-dnc-says-aft-all-harris-walz\">American Federation of Teachers</a>, <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/press/releases/afl-cio-unanimously-endorses-kamala-harris-president\">the AFL-CIO</a>, and many smaller unions across industries and across the country have endorsed Harris. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the Teamsters’ announcement may be enough to influence some voters. Americans support unions at <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/650147/democratic-party-seen-better-union-members.aspx\">higher levels than they have in decades</a> — and <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/11/21/voters-strongly-support-unions-and-oppose-companies-anti-union-tactics\">some data suggests</a> voters were more likely to support candidates they perceived as being pro-union in the 2022 elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through her connection to Biden, Harris does have a good record on labor; Biden stood at the picket line with UAW workers when they were striking last summer, and has generally supported the right to strike and sought to undermine corporate power. But the administration also forced Teamsters members back to work under what union leadership said was a less-than-ideal contract <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/us/politics/rail-strike-biden.html\">ahead of a railroad strike in 2022</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris’s own policies and values distinct from Biden’s aren’t all that well known, though she has supported the Protect the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would strengthen protections around workers’ right to organize and bargain collectively. But Teamsters leadership was reportedly unimpressed with what they heard <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/politics/teamsters-harris.html\">during a meeting with Harris earlier this week</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, on the other hand, appointed labor antagonists to the National Labor Review Board and approved legislation that restricted workers’ right to organize and strengthened workplaces’ ability to break up a union during his presidency. Rather than focusing on pro-labor policy, Trump has spent the 2024 campaign courting the working class with his populist message. Still, Trump too, apparently did not impress Teamsters in his <a href=\"https://teamster.org/2024/09/teamsters-no-endorsement-for-u-s-president/\">roundtable meeting with members</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

US officials have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html\">reportedly confirmed</a> that Israel tampered with the pagers, adding a detonating switch that could be triggered remotely and a small amount of explosive material. The pagers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk#h_f1d3e4533528fe6cf1526bc93c05b11f\">rang just before the attack</a>, so many victims were holding and looking at the pagers when they exploded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declined to comment on the pager attack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israeli officials did, however, say earlier this week the country could soon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/world/israel-hamas-war-news\">escalate its ongoing operations against Hezbollah</a>. Hezbollah is allied with Hamas — the militant group behind the October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the latest war in Gaza —&nbsp;and has grown impatient with stalled ceasefire negotiations over the Palestinian territory, ramping up hostilities and preparing for the possibility of broader war.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pagers bore the Taiwanese brand Gold Apollo, but the electronics manufacturer has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594\">denied producing them</a>, saying that another company based in Hungary was licensed to use the brand. That company, BAC Consulting, has also <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594\">reportedly denied producing pagers</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The walkie-talkies were a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-explosions-hezbollah-israel-09-19-24-intl-hnk#h_d2736454d7ed12f9b772f1008971075e\">discontinued model</a> produced by the Japanese firm ICOM, which says most of those in circulation are counterfeits. It’s unclear exactly how Israel managed to gain access to the pagers and walkie-talkies and plant the explosives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not the first time that Israel has weaponized personal communications devices against its adversaries. It used an exploding phone to <a href=\"https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/495023/Israel-infiltrates-telecom-sector-to-carry-out-assassinations\">kill a Hamas bomb maker</a> in 1996.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israel is also known for its sophisticated electronic surveillance capabilities as well as its ability to hack cellphones and computers. Before Tuesday’s attack, Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-a-ghost-73e6db68?mod=hp_lead_pos7\">killed in a July Israeli missile strike</a> after he received a mysterious phone call instructing him to go to the seventh floor of his building in Beirut. After that attack, Hezbollah <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-07-09/pagers-and-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-to-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance\">reportedly stopped using cellphones</a> in favor of pagers and couriers who deliver messages in person; the group has used a private, fixed-line telecommunications network since the early 2000s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pager and walkie-talkie attacks — which were far more extensive and destructive than past attacks harnessing phones —&nbsp;demonstrate that Israeli forces have achieved a new level of sophistication in their ability to carry out strikes on enemy soil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Israel and Hezbollah are locked in a regional conflict</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The recent attacks could lead to further escalation after months of increasing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by many countries and has previously fought wars against Israel, launched its latest campaign after Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, saying it was in “solidarity with the victorious Palestinian resistance.” The hostilities have primarily taken the form of airstrikes. It has signaled that it would cease hostilities if a ceasefire in Gaza is reached. More than <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-820486\">41,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Almost a year into the war, ceasefire negotiations have made little progress, especially after the recent <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostage-deal-raise-stakes-intl/index.html\">execution of six hostages in Gaza</a>. It’s an open question whether a deal may even be achievable <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/gaza-ceasefire-talks-roadblocks-white-house/index.html\">before US President Joe Biden leaves office</a>. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-hamas-agreement-intl/index.html\">deal is not close</a> and has resisted international calls for Israeli forces to promise a full withdrawal from Gaza.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As negotiations have stagnated, the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel has deepened, displacing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html?smid=url-share\">more than 100,000 people</a> who face daily tit-for-tat attacks on both sides of the Lebanese border with Israel. Though it has not yet grown into full-scale regional war, increasingly aggressive tactics on both sides have raised worries that such a conflict may be inevitable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Intense escalation with Hezbollah, which is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the region, could be catastrophic, as Israel’s previous wars with Hezbollah in 1996 and 2006 would indicate. <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/beyond-hezbollah-the-history-of-tensions-between-lebanon-and-israel\">Both of those conflicts</a> involved heavy civilian casualties in Lebanon, leaving more than 1,200 dead, and led to the killing of <a href=\"http://event\">about 200 Israelis</a>, mostly soldiers. But Hezbollah now has an <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/31/haniyeh-hezbollah-israel-war-lebanon-hamas-gaza/\">extensive rocket and missile arsenal</a> that make it a more formidable foe than it was before. A wider war could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group\">also draw each side’s allies further into the conflict</a> — the US on the Israeli side and Iran on Hezbollah’s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such a war would also represent a diplomatic failure for the US, which has supported Israel since the beginning of the war in Gaza and played a leading role in the ceasefire negotiations, all with the objective of maintaining stability in the Middle East. Throughout the war in Gaza, US officials like Secretary of State Antony Blinken have repeatedly emphasized the US has been “very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we’re trying to resolve in Gaza,” as he said Tuesday, adding that the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/2922bdf9-9c65-5674-8865-676bb5c4f9b5?smid=url-share\">US did not know about the operation and was not involved</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The attacks may make it harder for Israel and Hezbollah to continue to contain their hostilities, and put them one step closer to a full-out war. Both have indicated they are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dozens-hezbollah-members-wounded-lebanon-when-pagers-exploded-sources-witnesses-2024-09-17/\">prepared for that possibility</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, September 19, 10:20 am: </strong>This story, originally published September 17, has been updated with information on a second wave of walkie-talkie explosions in Lebanon. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Sometimes, older generations are just freaking out about the youngs, as they have since time immemorial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not the case, unfortunately, with kids’ learning right now, more than four years after the pandemic shuttered classrooms and disrupted the lives of millions of children. The effects were seen almost immediately, as students’ performance in reading and math began to dip <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/us/national-test-scores-math-reading-pandemic.html\">far below pre-pandemic norms</a>, worrying educators and families around the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even now, according to a <a href=\"https://crpe.org/the-state-of-the-american-student-2024/\">new report</a> released this week by the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE), a research group at Arizona State University that has studied the impact of Covid on education since 2020, the average American student is “less than halfway to a full academic recovery” from the effects of the pandemic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The report — the group’s third annual analysis of the “state of the American student” — combines test scores and academic research with parent interviews to paint a picture of the challenges facing public schools and the families they serve. That picture is sobering: In spring 2023, just 56 percent of American fourth-graders were performing on grade level in math, down from 69 percent in 2019, according to just one example of <a href=\"https://cdn.bfldr.com/LS6J0F7/at/x8v8wp2c6j4s4wttsw2nwphb/ca-state-of-student-learning-technical-report-2023.pdf\">test score data</a> cited in the report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Declines in reading were less stark but still concerning, and concentrated in earlier grades, with 65 percent of third-graders performing on grade level, compared with 72 percent in 2019. Recovery in reading has also been slower, with some researchers finding <a href=\"https://www.nwea.org/uploads/Reconciling-Recent-Evidence-on-Academic-Recovery-in-the-US-from-2022-to-2023.pdf\">essentially no rebound</a> since students returned to the classroom. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The report mirrors what many teachers say they are seeing in their classrooms, as some <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/aglover/tiktok-says-kids-cant-read-teachers-weigh-in\">sound the alarm publicly</a> about kids who they say can’t write a sentence or pay attention to a three-minute video.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Focus and endurance for any sort of task, especially reading, has been really hard for a lot of teenagers” since coming back from pandemic closures, Sarah Mulhern Gross, who teaches honors English at High Technology High School in Lincroft, New Jersey, told Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, even the youngest children, who were not yet in school when lockdowns began, are showing troubling signs of academic and behavioral delays. “We are talking 4- and 5-year-olds who are throwing chairs, biting, hitting,” Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the National Head Start Association, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/01/upshot/pandemic-children-school-performance.html\">told the New York Times</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If schools and districts can’t reverse these trends, Covid could leave “an indelible mark” on a generation of kids, CRPE director Robin Lake said this week. The effects are greatest for low-income students, students with disabilities, and children learning English as a second language, who faced educational inequities prior to the pandemic that have only worsened today. Covid “shined a light on the resource inequities and opportunity gaps that existed in this country, and then it exacerbated them,” said Allison Socol, vice president for P-12 policy, research, and practice at EdTrust, a nonprofit devoted to educational equity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The report is the latest effort to catalog what many educators, parents, and kids see as the deep scars — academic, but also social and emotional — left behind by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), a nationwide testing company, <a href=\"https://www.nwea.org/uploads/recovery-still-illlusive-2023-24-student-achievement-highlights-persistent-achievement-gaps-and-a-long-road-ahead_NWEA_researchBrief.pdf\">reported that</a> rather than making up ground since the pandemic, students were falling further behind. In 2023-24, the gap between pre- and post-Covid test score averages widened by an average of 36 percent in reading and 18 percent in math, according to the NWEA report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to education, the effect of the pandemic “is not over,” Lake said. “It’s not a thing of the past.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kids are behind in reading and math, and they’re not catching up</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8439454/#:~:text=Approximately%20100%2C000%20public%20schools%20were,78.8%25)%20during%20the%20closures.\">Nearly all public schools</a> in America closed by the end of March 2020, and while <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html\">some reopened that fall</a>, others did not fully resume in-person learning until fall 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The switch to remote school, along with the trauma and upheaval of living through a global health emergency in which <a href=\"https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths?n=o\">more than a million Americans</a> died, dealt a major blow to students’ learning. Scores on one set of national tests, released in September 2022, dropped to historic lows, reversing two decades of progress in reading and math, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/us/national-test-scores-math-reading-pandemic.html\">the New York Times reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, experts were optimistic that students could make up the ground they’d lost. NWEA’s MAP tests, which measure academic growth, showed a strong rebound in the 2021-22 school year, said Karyn Lewis, director of the Center for School and Student Progress at NWEA. But growth slowed the following year, and now lags behind pre-pandemic trends.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids “are learning throughout the year, but they are doing so at a slightly sluggish pace,” Lewis said — not enough to make up for their Covid-era losses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A team of researchers using separate data from state tests appeared to find <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/31/us/pandemic-learning-loss-recovery.html\">more hopeful results</a> earlier this year, documenting significant recovery in both reading and math between 2022 and 2023. But after reanalyzing their data, they found that the improvements in reading were probably produced by changes in state tests, not actual improvements in student achievement, said Thomas Kane, faculty director of the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard and one of the leaders of the research team. In fact, though students did gain some ground in math, they showed little recovery in reading between 2022 and 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More recent data does not paint a rosier picture. About half of states have released test results for the 2023-24 school year, and “I don’t see a lot of states with substantial increases” in scores, Kane said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many factors probably contribute to students’ slow recovery, experts say. Some may have missed “foundational pieces” of reading and math in 2020 and 2021, Lewis said. Learning loss can be like a “compounding debt,” she explained, with skills missed in early grades causing bigger and bigger problems as kids get older. Chronic absenteeism also remains a big obstacle to learning. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/29/us/chronic-absences.html\">Twenty-six percent of students</a> were considered chronically absent in 2022-23, up from 13 percent in 2019-2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Children who are in kindergarten and first grade today were too young to experience the shift to remote learning in 2020 and 2021. But they were more likely to be isolated from other children and adults, Lake said. And like their older counterparts, many also experienced the trauma of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22774601/children-covid-parent-deaths-grief\">deaths in the family</a>, poverty, and parents out of work, all of which could have affected their social and emotional development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/28/briefing/pandemic-learning-loss.html\">Some have argued</a> that pandemic learning loss shouldn’t be a concern because all students were affected — maybe, the argument goes, learning is just different now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that’s not the case, experts say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Students from wealthier school districts are already well on their way to recovery, while students in lower-income areas continue to struggle. “Not everybody is in the same boat,” Kane said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It’s not too late to help kids recover</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the dismal numbers, some teachers are seeing successes. When they came back to the classroom after the pandemic closure, Kareem Neal’s students at Maryvale High School in Phoenix, Arizona, were falling asleep in class, having trouble focusing, and struggling to put away their laptops when asked, Neal, who teaches special education science and social studies, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But starting last school year, “a lot of the behavioral challenges dissipated,” he said. “I remember telling so many people, ‘Whoa, the kids are so well-behaved.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gross, the New Jersey English teacher, said she has seen improvement since her students were required to leave their cell phones at her desk during class. “For the first time in years, I’m seeing them talk to each other,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some schools have had success reducing chronic absenteeism, including a middle school in Salem, Massachusetts, that aimed to make education more fun by introducing more field trips and hands-on learning, according to the CRPE report. “It’s just like a happier version of school,” said one student cited in the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s still time to help kids who are struggling, experts say. Most of the strategies proven to work are simple and low-tech, like tutoring and summer school, according to the CRPE report. Staffing shortages and the sheer logistical difficulty of setting up large-scale tutoring programs, however, have made even these solutions a challenge for districts, Lewis said. The <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/schools-pandemic-aid-runs-out-00175065\">expiration of pandemic-era federal funding</a> later this month will only make matters worse.&nbsp;“A system that actually needs more is about to have less,” EdTrust’s Socol said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And districts have to actually make recovery programs accessible to all, and convince families to participate. In Louisiana, for example, just 1 percent of students eligible for a post-pandemic literacy tutoring program actually participated, according to the report, and districts often struggle to get students to enroll in summer school.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if schools don’t act, kids could face deficits in basic skills that could haunt them into adulthood, leading to difficulty attaining higher levels of education, finishing college, and lost earnings in their working lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/opinion/teachers-grades-students-parents.html\">grade inflation</a>, many parents are also unaware that their children are behind academically. “One of the most powerful things would be if teachers told parents when their child was below grade level,” Kane said. In practice, that often doesn’t happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But more than that, schools need to rebuild the relationships among students, teachers, and families that frayed during the pandemic, experts and educators say. “People want to feel like a part of a bigger community again,” Neal said. “We need to figure out ways to make that happen so that students are not feeling left out.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Sometimes, panics are overblown. Sometimes, older generations are just freaking out about the youngs, as they have since time immemorial. That’s not the case, unfortunately, with kids’ learning right now, more than four years after the pandemic shuttered classrooms and disrupted the lives of millions of children. The effects were seen almost immediately, as students’ [&#8230;]",

All your studying and those extracurricular activities are finally paying off — you’ve been accepted to your dream school. The problem is, says John Tillman, president of the financial aid planning firm <a href=\"https://mycollegeplan.com/\">Ecliptic Financial Advisors</a>, there’s no way your family can afford it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a situation that can cause anguish for everyone involved. “As a parent,” he says, “you’re in a situation where now you have to have a discussion about a budget when the student has already gotten excited about being accepted.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vox’s guide to college application season</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/369475/paying-for-college-advice-financial-aid-loans-scholarships\"></a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/369514/college-application-essay-advice-personal-statement-common-app-supplemental-essays\">This is what admissions officers really want to read in college essays</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/369659/college-application-advice-undergraduate-extracurricular-organization-stress\">Applying to college? Seven current students on how to stand out and stay sane</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s no secret the cost of a college education has ballooned. In the United States, <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic\">one year of tuition and fees</a> at an in-state public college ran students an average of $10,662 during the 2023-24 academic year (that total ratchets up to $23,630 for out-of-state students); private schools cost $42,162 per year on average. Over half of graduates from public and private four-year institutions walked away with debt in 2022. On average, students with a bachelor’s degree graduated with <a href=\"https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/Trends%20Report%202023%20Updated.pdf\">$29,400 in debt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stress due to high student loan payments can have <a href=\"https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2023-10-26-Ninety-One-Percent-of-Young-Adults-With-Student-Loans-Say-Financial-Stress-is-Impacting-Their-Wellness-Abbott-Launches-Blueprint-of-Award-Winning-Program-to-Help-Companies-Tackle-This-Problem\">negative impacts on young adults’ mental and physical health</a>. Paying back loans can hamper you as you try to jumpstart a career and may take precedence over saving for retirement, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if you or your parents have little to contribute, getting a college degree is possible without taking out massive loans. In order to side-step future financial stress, students and their families should take a clear-eyed, pragmatic approach to paying for college that starts well before acceptance letters hit the mail, experts say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Determine a budget as soon as possible</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ideally, parents will have begun saving for their child’s college education from the moment they’re born, Tillman says. Three-quarters of college families relied on money from parents to cover the cost of college, according to a <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2024-08/HAP_2024.pdf\">recent Sallie Mae and Ipsos study</a>, followed by scholarships and grants. But saving for a child’s education may be unrealistic for some families. Depending on your circumstances, parents — or the student themselves — may want to start setting money aside for college by the student’s freshman year of high school, Tillman says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether parents have been saving for years or not at all, they should have a conversation with their child before the end of their junior year of high school about how much money they can contribute, says Brendan Williams, vice president of knowledge at <a href=\"https://www.uaspire.org/\">uAspire</a>, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented backgrounds access financial aid and navigate higher education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Parents and their children should be on the same page about how much money each party has available to pay for college, how long the student anticipates they’ll be in school (will they complete a four-year degree or go on to get advanced degrees?), and if they will get a job while in school. That way, the student has an idea of what schools they can realistically afford — and they won’t waste time applying to those they can’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Parents and their children should be on the same page about how much money each party has available to pay for college</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For example, <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2019-06-25/the-cost-of-private-vs-public-colleges\">private schools are typically more expensive</a> than public universities. The student might also consider attending a community college first and then transferring to a state university to save money. “You’re saving 35 to 40 percent off the full cost of the four years of school,” Tillman says. “So it’s a very effective way to reduce the overall cost of college.” If the student wants a certain college experience — dorm life, dining halls, and a sprawling campus with fancy facilities — they’ll have to weigh whether these features are worth the possible debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Williams suggests researching schools’ financial aid programs before applying. Each school has a net price calculator on their website (the US Department of Education also maintains <a href=\"https://collegecost.ed.gov/net-price\">its own database</a> where you can search schools’ net price) where prospective students can enter information about their family’s finances to find out what students from similar backgrounds paid per year, including financial aid and grants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be strategic when applying for aid</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Students also should apply for schools where they have a strong chance at receiving <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/slideshows/things-to-know-about-merit-aid-scholarships\">merit-based financial aid</a>, Tillman says. Scores of schools offer at least some <a href=\"https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/merit-aid\">merit-based aid</a> — that is, scholarships awarded based on your grades, leadership ability, or sports and artistic talents. For instance, over half of students at the University of Denver receive non-need based aid during the 2022-23 academic year. Some schools consider every student who applies for merit scholarships, but others may <a href=\"https://sayhellocollege.com/blog/colleges-that-give-the-most-merit-aid/\">have separate applications</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schools also usually list the GPA, SAT, and ACT scores of the middle 50 percent of students admitted to the university. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.towson.edu/admissions/undergrad/freshmen/faq.html#:~:text=Our%20middle%2050%25%20SAT%20score,both%20the%20SAT%20and%20ACT.\">middle 50 percent SAT range</a> for accepted students at Towson University in Maryland is 1100–1300. If your scores are above these ranges, you’re more likely to receive merit-based aid, Tillman says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aside from merit-based aid, many students will qualify for <a href=\"https://collegemoneytips.com/what-is-need-based-financial-aid/\">need-based financial aid</a>, which is based on your family’s financial situation. The <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>, or FAFSA, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23977937/fafsa-changes-2024-2025-federal-student-aid-college\">is how students apply for federal, state, and college financial aid</a>. Fill it out as soon as you can after the form opens for the next academic year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aid is offered in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, and work study. On average, <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/facts-financial-aid/\">students received $8,890</a> in 2022 in federal grants. Usually, the FAFSA is available on October 1, but the form for the 2025-26 school year will be <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/12/the-2025-26-fafsa-wont-fully-open-until-december-1.html\">available on December 1</a>. Some aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/resources/financial-aid-process-text\">earlier you apply</a>, the better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are also <a href=\"https://www.collegeraptor.com/paying-for-college/articles/scholarship-search-applications/can-you-earn-scholarships-without-the-fafsa/\">scholarships offered by private organizations</a> that students can apply for beyond the FAFSA. Many students wait until they receive acceptances and financial aid packages to start applying, Williams says. However, there are more opportunities available at the start of the academic year than at the end, he says. Students should begin applying for scholarships as early as possible in their senior year of high school — and continue in the months following. Don’t discount scholarships from local organizations, like your school district or banks. You may have a higher chance of earning one because fewer students apply, Williams says. There are also more scholarship opportunities for incoming freshmen, he says, so don’t wait until your sophomore year to try landing scholarships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Make a plan by listing all the scholarships you hope to apply for, when applications open, and the submission deadline, Williams says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consider your return on investment</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.thomascaleel.com/\">Thomas Caleel</a>, the founder and chair of Global Education Opportunities and the former director of MBA admissions and financial aid for the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, always tells students to think about the return on investment for a degree at a particular school. “If I’m putting my money into this education,” he says, “what am I getting out of it?”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“I personally don’t think you should go into this just thinking, ‘I’ll borrow whatever I need to borrow, I’ll figure it out.’ That’s a terrible thing to do.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Students should think about what they hope to pursue after college and if a specific school can best support those goals, whether through a professional network, a unique program or other surprising benefit that will help you get ahead. For example, a California-based student who plans to go into real estate in their home state would get a higher return on investment at an in-state college versus an East Coast university. “It’s going to be much harder for you to leverage that network into a focus on real estate development in the Los Angeles County area,” Caleel says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you know you want to go to medical school or will pursue an advanced degree, you might have a higher return on investment by starting your education at a community college and transferring to an in-state school for your undergraduate degree, knowing how long you anticipate being in school, Caleel says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Look at the big-picture cost</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once students have gotten their acceptances and <a href=\"https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/get-help-paying-for-college/state-federal-institutional-financial-aid/understanding-your-financial-aid-award-offers\">financial aid award offers</a> — a document that shows how much financial aid, including federal grants, scholarships, and loans the college is offering — they can start comparing the yearly cost of each school.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, look at the details of your aid package. Anything marked as a grant, you do not have to pay back. <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell\">Federal Pell Grants</a> from the US government are awarded based on the information you included on your FAFSA — the maximum award is $7,395 for the 2024–25 year. Loans are funds that must be repaid and accrue interest. Work study allows you to get an on-campus job to earn money throughout the year. The <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/receive-aid\">school will apply your grant and loans toward your tuition</a>, fees, and room and board, while any extra money is paid to you directly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the net cost for each school you were accepted to may be similar, make sure to compare how much money in loans you would need to repay after graduation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Try to avoid taking out <a href=\"https://www.citizensbank.com/learning/what-are-private-student-loans.aspx\">private loans</a> — money lent by banks and credit lenders and not included on your financial aid award offer — which tend to have higher interest rates. “I personally don’t think you should go into this just thinking, ‘I’ll borrow whatever I need to borrow, I’ll figure it out,‘” Tillman says. “That’s a terrible thing to do, and it puts students in a very bad situation down the road.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are other associated costs not included in the price of tuition and housing students should be aware of. Factor in how much you’ll need to spend on books, transportation to and from campus, and social expenses, like club memberships and off-campus meals, William says. There are also other incidentals: you might need to buy an air conditioner if you’re going to school somewhere much warmer than where you grew up or a winter jacket for somewhere colder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the cost of tuition for your dream school is just out of budget, you can try negotiating with the university, Caleel says. <a href=\"https://www.collegevine.com/faq/31651/negotiating-college-tuition-is-it-possible\">Collect documentation</a> of financial aid offers from other schools, any <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/28/business/college-financial-aid/index.html\">changes in financial circumstances</a>, like a parent’s loss of a job or medical expenses, and parent tax returns. The student should then email the financial aid office explaining how you’d like to negotiate tuition. “It’s best to get as many offers as you can and then go and say — and be honest here — ‘You are our top choice. But to go there, we need to pay $25,000 a year that we just don’t have, and our second choice is $5,000 a year. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?’” Caleel says. Sometimes schools will have extra funds for additional aid, but it’s hardly a given.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although college is a considerable expense, it doesn’t need to be an onerous burden. Students and their families need to be realistic about the costs and shouldn’t discount lesser-known institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Parents want to be able to say, ‘My child is going to [the] big, shiny university,’” Caleel says, “when the smarter financial decision is for a child to go to a really, really good community college, to a really, really good state college, and save a ton of money.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And everybody who reads it loves it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">College application essays have an infamous reputation for being one of the most difficult aspects of the application process. But it remains a <a href=\"https://counselors.collegeboard.org/college-application/essay\">crucial way to share details about your life </a>and interests — a way to distinguish yourself beyond your grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities, <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/05/can-chatgpt-write-a-good-college-admissions-essay.html\">even in the era of ChatGPT</a> (more on that later).</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vox’s guide to college application season</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/369475/paying-for-college-advice-financial-aid-loans-scholarships\">You got into college.

Seven current students on how to stand out and stay sane.</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Admissions officers are looking to be entertained when reading application essays, White says. Of course, students should use their essay to showcase their curiosities, character, and point of view, but contrary to popular belief, these personal statements don’t need to recount devastating moments of painful growth. “You can be fun,” White says. “You don’t have to have trauma.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a number of essays students will need to write as a part of their college application. Over <a href=\"https://www.commonapp.org/files/FY_application_trends_end_season_report_23-24.pdf\">1 million students</a> apply to college through the <a href=\"https://www.commonapp.org/\">Common App</a>, a streamlined platform that allows students to apply to multiple schools at once. There, students write a personal statement, <a href=\"https://blog.collegevine.com/college-essay-length\">usually between 500 and 650 words</a>, centered on a student’s identity, beliefs, accomplishments, and interests, and can choose from among seven<a href=\"https://www.commonapp.org/blog/common-app-announces-2024-2025-common-app-essay-prompts\"> prompts</a> for the 2024–25 application season. One prompt even allows the applicant to write about a topic of their choice. “Write the essay that your heart wants to write,” says college essay coach <a href=\"https://www.cassandracollegecoaching.com/\">Cassandra Hsiao</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Individual colleges also ask for additional shorter pieces (<a href=\"https://blog.collegevine.com/college-essay-length\">around 250 words</a>), also known as supplemental essays, which may ask applicants to explain why they’re applying to this specific school, and about <a href=\"https://thecollegecurators.com/top-10-college-essay-approaches/\">their academic interests and extracurricular activities.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With so much to write, students need to dedicate serious time and effort — White suggests at least eight weeks — into crafting compelling and effective essays. Here’s what college essay pros want applicants to know.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make sure your essays are unique to you</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Students often put pressure on themselves to have a one-of-a-kind essay topic, White says. There are very few unique concepts, she continues, but what will set you apart is your way into the essay. Start strong with an attention-grabbing first sentence, experts say, that immediately hooks the reader.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Can’t decide what to write? Try these exercises.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Look around your house or room and pick 10 items that spark a memory — like a soccer trophy or a painting you made — and write them down. Or recount a typical day in your life in detail, from the music you listen to in the shower to the snack you grab before bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The point, Brook says, is to home in on things that you may think of as humdrum, but that you can use to tell a story about yourself.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Don’t discount minor details when thinking about extracurriculars and accomplishments. “When my kids are stuck, it&#8217;s a lot of chatting about things that they think don&#8217;t matter and then we typically come to something really great,” says Tyler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another tactic is picking five adjectives would you use to describe yourself, suggests White. Expand on each with an experience or memory.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Focus on developing a unique lens through which to see an event in your life, with an original point of view. These can be small moments, says Stacey Brook, the founder and chief adviser at <a href=\"https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/\">College Essay Advisors</a>. For example, one student she worked with wrote an essay about bonding with her mother during drives to gymnastics practice. After the student got her license and no longer had these moments with her mother, she wrote, she felt a sense of loss. “She was reflecting on what those drives meant to her and what it means to grow up and to gain things and lose them at the same time,” Brook says. “That&#8217;s the tiniest moment, the smallest slice of life out of which you can make an incredible essay.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even if you’re writing about a common topic, like school sports or lessons learned from an adult in your life, one way to differentiate your essay is to add dialogue, Hsiao says. “It&#8217;s in the specificity that only you can write because you went through that,” she says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Avoid regurgitating your resume, Hsaio continues. Instead, lead the reader through a narrative arc showing your growth. You don’t need to explicitly state what you learned from the experience. Instead, use descriptive, scene-setting language — about how tense you were during that big game or your excitement when you stepped onto the stage — that shows how you’re different on the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again, you don’t need to share the worst thing that’s ever happened to you — or try to dramatize your life to make it seem more challenging than it is — but help the reader understand the effort you put in to get a new club off the ground, for example. “What you went through objectively might be really small on a global scale,” Hsiao says, “but because it felt big to you and I care about you as the writer, it will feel big to me.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t even think about copying from ChatGPT (or other generative AI)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Brook understands the appeal of ChatGPT, experts say don’t use it to write your essay. College application reviewers will be able to tell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The purpose of these pieces is to display your personality and writing ability and bots will never produce a unique, personalized essay. These chatbots use a style and tone that is immediately identifiable to readers, one that is rife with cliches and an awkward cadence, experts say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Appropriate uses of generative AI include spell and grammar check or as a thesaurus. “Once you start pulling full paragraphs, you&#8217;re cheating,” White says. “It&#8217;s not your work.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tailor supplemental essays to each school</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Depending on the school, you may be asked to write <a href=\"https://blog.collegevine.com/how-many-common-app-essays-are-required\">one or two shorter supplemental essays</a>. These prompts may have similar themes, about your <a href=\"https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/purdue-university-2024-25-supplemental-essay-prompt-guide/\">academic interests</a> or <a href=\"https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/columbia-university-2024-25-supplemental-essay-prompt-guide/\">how you relate to the people around you</a>. For these essays, experts say you can reuse answers for multiple schools — but make sure you revise your answers to be specific to each school.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To ensure you’re tackling supplemental essays efficiently, Brook says to collect all of the prompts for the schools you’re applying to and see where they overlap. Hsiao suggests brainstorming three or four activities, obsessions or aspects of your life you know you want to showcase and try to match these topics to essay prompts. This can be anything from an extracurricular to your favorite TV show. “We are prioritizing what is important in our lives and then showcasing that by mixing and matching per school for the supplemental essay questions,” she says. For example, if you plan on writing about your future major for one college, adapt that essay to each school. However, make sure you’re researching each university and adding details about their specific program to your piece, Brook says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For essays asking why you want to attend that specific college, ensure your answers are unmistakably catered to that school. “‘I love Delaware because I can&#8217;t wait to go to football games and pledge a sorority, and I&#8217;m excited about the business school.’ That is not going [cut it] because you could say that about Rutgers,” says <a href=\"https://getintocollege.com/our-experts/admissions-experts/kyra-tyler\">Kyra Tyler</a>, a senior director and college admissions consultant at Bright Horizons College Coach. Instead, pepper your answer with details about school traditions, an honors program you hope to join, interesting research opportunities or what you observed when you went on a tour (whether in person or virtual), Tyler says.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tell a vivid story — and showcase your writing ability</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not only do your essays need to be of substance, but they should showcase style, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tyler suggests students avoid metaphor: Don’t talk about caring for your younger sibling in the context of a <em>Bluey</em> episode — be straightforward. (“Kids can&#8217;t get away from [metaphors],” Tyler says, “and what happens is they get stuck under them, and they can&#8217;t write.”) You’ll want to write vividly using concrete examples instead of plainly spelling everything out, White says. For instance, if you were a camp counselor who helped a nervous child come out of their shell, write a scene showing the camper interacting with other kids rather than simply saying the camper was less reserved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Write as if you were talking to your best friend, Tyler says. Avoid slang terms, but let your personality come through your writing. Try reading your essay aloud to see if it sounds like you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Don’t forget about the basics, like good grammar, proper spelling, and word choice (make sure you’re not repeating similar words and phrases). You don’t need to focus on the five-paragraph structure, Hsiao says. Just make sure you’re telling a compelling story. Have a trusted adult, like a teacher or parent, read your essay to help point out style and structural issues you may have missed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After you’ve completed a draft, set it aside for a few days, come back to it with fresh eyes for revisions, Tyler says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">College application essays are your chance to share who you were, who you are, and how this university will shape who you hope to be, Hsaio says. Focus on topics you want admissions officers to know and let your voice and passion carry the essay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, September 19, 11 am ET: </strong>A previous version of this story conflated the number of applicants with the number of applications sent through the Common App. Over 1 million students apply using the Common App. </em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Yes, it’s college application season. The formula required to get into many colleges these days involves striking a delicate balance between highlighting personal and academic accomplishments, outlining future interests and aspirations, and painting a picture of who you are versus who you want to be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The prospect of documenting an entire high school career while also selling your personality can be daunting. It’s normal for aspiring undergrads — and their parents — to feel overwhelmed. But you can manage it, whether you’re applying to five schools or 15.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vox’s guide to college application season</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/369514/college-application-essay-advice-personal-statement-common-app-supplemental-essays\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/369514/college-application-essay-advice-personal-statement-common-app-supplemental-essays\">This is what admissions officers really want to read in college essays</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/369475/paying-for-college-advice-financial-aid-loans-scholarships\">You got into college. How will you pay for it?</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I talked to the people who are most familiar with how high-stakes it can all feel: seven current college students who successfully navigated the process for themselves. Here, they offer their best advice on staying organized, quelling anxiety, and the mistakes they wish they’d avoided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t put all your eggs in one basket</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“At first, I only applied to one school, and then got wait-listed. I ended up applying to more after that. I wasn’t really thinking about college as much as I should have, and I was dead set on this one school. I just assumed the application process and acceptance was going to be a lot easier than it was. I put all my eggs in one basket. I was so overwhelmed and I wanted to get the application out of the way. I wish I would have applied to more schools from the start. I wish I would have relied more on support and help from other people, like my school counselors and friends who had already applied to colleges and got accepted.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Alani Sage, 19. Applied to five schools, accepted to four, wait-listed at one. Now attends the University of Alabama.</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trust that you can turn heartbreak around</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I was one of those students who didn’t get accepted into a dream school, and you feel like it’s the end of the world, like you have no other hope. But now that I look back, I honestly think every single thing that happens, it’s for a reason. If you adapt and accept things head-on, you’ll thank yourself. I’m really happy now. I think that this experience was better for me, better for becoming more mature, more independent.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Amna Ahmed, 19. Applied to 22 schools, accepted to 10, wait-listed at six. Now attends Wake Forest University. </em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use social media (but don’t let it discourage you)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Reddit is a great resource. Subreddits <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/\">r/CollegeResults </a>and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/\">r/ChanceMe</a> are great resources because people post their admitted profiles and you can see what their extracurriculars were and you know what they did to get into X school. r/ChanceMe, you post your own application and people say if they think you’re going to get in or not. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center\"><blockquote><p>“Create a story for yourself that is so authentic and unique to you that anyone that reads it would be like, ‘That is so you.’”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take what people say about your application with a grain of salt, because at the end of the day, they’re not the admissions officer. It’s okay to compare yourself and your application to other people, but it’s not the be-all, end-all. Use it as inspiration but don’t think, ‘This person’s just better than me. I’m never going to have a chance.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Dylan Ott, 18. Applied to 15 schools, accepted via early decision to the University of Pennsylvania</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus on authenticity</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“College apps are very tricky if you haven’t previously heard advice or if you don’t have other family members that have gone through them. I struggled a lot, because my family is from India, and they weren’t accustomed to the American college admission process. For example, a lot of my peers could afford college counselors when my family didn’t even know what those were. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I struggled with selling myself and knowing how to tell my story in a way that was unique to me, because from a very young age, I felt pressure trying to be more like people around me. Whenever I was writing my essays, I would try to frame myself as someone that had this background that my peers did, even though I didn’t. Create a story for yourself that is so authentic and unique to you that anyone that reads it would be like, ‘That is so you.’ Pick one angle about yourself to go with. For me, I talked about my self-growth and development, from being pretty shy to being super confident, starting a TikTok, and being in debate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Tanu Tripathi, 20. Applied to 11 schools, accepted to six. Now attends the University of Texas.</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Just keep writing</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I spent a lot of time finding my story and writing down my life, asking my parents about things through my childhood that I couldn’t remember that I could draw connections to right now. It was me dumping much of my life onto the page, and then rewriting it and rewriting it and rewriting it again for a long time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those 250-word blurb answers were the hardest for me. I wrote about all my interests first and then saw what would match the essay questions for each school. Then you can edit them and change it to match, so you’re not really writing as many essays as you need to. In all, for every single school, there were over 50 essays. But I didn’t write 50 essays. A lot of these are reused, and a lot of them were also 150-word ones. For those questions, I always tried to answer them very creatively and in a way that most people wouldn’t just to show another side of myself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Jeremy Hsiao, 21. Applied to 11 schools, accepted to six, wait-listed at two. Now attends Stanford University.</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay organized and have an emotional outlet</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I figured out a system of organization that worked for me. Making a drive on Google was huge. I called it ‘college.’ Within that drive I had different folders for scholarships, supplemental essays, and then my Common App. Once you have those folders, make a huge spreadsheet for all the colleges you’re going to apply to. Divide out your spreadsheet into three different sections: early action, a November 30 or December 1 deadline, and then your regular decision colleges. Having it all in one place helped a lot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everyone’s going through this at the same time, and it’s really important to talk to your friends and family throughout the whole process for your mental health. Make sure you’re not keeping all the stress and all the overwhelming feelings inside of you. Make sure you’re ranting to your friends, ranting to your mom. Getting it all out is generally going to help you so much more in the long run.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Chahat Kapoor, 20. Applied to 15 schools, accepted to nine, wait-listed at two. Now attends University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlight the commonality in all your activities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I talked to a lot of my admission officers and interviewers after I got into these schools and they told me what stood out about my profile was it was so clear what type of student I was going to be. All my activities, my awards, my essays, even my extracurriculars, touched on my leadership and value of community service, specifically in the health field. My junior year of high school when I started thinking about college, I sat down and I wrote out all my extracurriculars and all my awards, and I saw that so many things I did were involved in the health field, and I also had a lot of leadership positions, so that naturally became what I would present in my profile.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>—Olivia Zhang, 19.

People in the Global South were <a href=\"https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2022/healthy-life-expectancy-africa-rises-almost-ten-years\">living longer</a>. A more equitable future appeared within our grasp.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that progress has since stalled. Between 2000 and 2020, the worldwide child mortality rate <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/report/2024-report\">fell</a> by 50 percent, but it has remained stagnant over the past four years. Global development funding to support health efforts grew by 6.6 percent a year on average from 2000 to 2020, increasing less than $15 billion annually to about $50 billion. But that growth has slowed with the pandemic, falling to just 2.3 percent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/report/2024-report\">a new report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> projects global health investments could actually decline over the rest of the decade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The stinginess comes at a particularly bad time. We are in a critical fundraising cycle for the major global health organizations. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/358800/gavi-biden-vaccine-congress-foreign-aid\">Gavi, the vaccine alliance</a> that provides immunizations to people in low-income countries, is currently seeking $9 billion to replenish its funds for the next five years. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/13/23544865/congress-hiv-malaria-global-fund-replenishment\">The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria</a>, which supports prevention and treatment for those diseases in developing countries and was seeded with a donation from the Gates Foundation, will begin its replenishment drive next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are real and growing concerns that these groups may fail to reach their fundraising targets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a result, the world could lose ground against <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/15/24036314/us-global-public-health-infectious-disease-covid-19-hiv-aids-pepfar\">infectious diseases</a> and especially <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/1/24055829/gaza-israel-conflict-hunger-famine-starvation-sudan\">child malnutrition</a>, and those challenges are only set to grow in the future. Climate change threatens humanity’s food supply and thus its ability to feed itself. Without intervention, according to IHME modeling, the number of children in the world who experienced stunting is expected to grow by 40 million by 2050 and the number who experience wasting will increase by 28 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How can the world get back on track? Gates, as the co-chair and chief funder of a foundation that has delivered nearly <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/foundation-fact-sheet\">$78 billion in grants</a> chiefly for global health programs since 2000, is one of the most influential people trying to figure that out. In a recent interview with Vox, Gates conceded the challenges facing global health advocates, offered his own explanations for why investments have fallen off, and previewed the developments in the field he thinks hold the most promise for regaining the momentum of the early 21st century.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Dylan Scott   </h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You framed the report around the stalled investment in global health that coincided with the pandemic. There seems to be a real realignment within the public and among policymakers in the US and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66378364\">in other countries</a>, the countries that have driven a lot of global health investment. So what is your theory of why that is? How do you change people’s minds back if their views are starting to shift on this issue?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Bill Gates</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The world committed itself to keep making progress in reducing childhood death through <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals\">the UN sustainable development goals</a> that were set in 2015. We were spoiled during that period, between 2000 and 2015, because helping Africa, cutting the childhood death rate, it really had a lot of attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was some low­-hanging fruit in that vaccines were being given in rich countries that we were able to reduce the cost of dramatically and we got Gavi to finance and get them distributed out to a very high percentage of all the world’s children. That’s why we got the childhood mortality cut by a factor of two, from 10 million kids a year dying to under 5 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If it was just the pandemic, then getting back on track actually wouldn’t be that hard because the pandemic’s over. The things that are happening alongside that are, first of all, that the African countries <a href=\"https://www.advocacyinternational.co.uk/featured-project/jubilee-2000\">got cleared of their debts around the turn of the century</a>. And that was a super­-worthy cause that predates the foundation. Over these years, though, they’ve built up debts. Now, as macroeconomic conditions have changed, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-chief-warns-africas-inadequate-access-debt-relief-is-recipe-social-unrest-2024-09-05/\">interest rates on those debts have gone up a lot</a>, particularly for them because they’re risky borrowers. So African countries are now spending more on interest payments than on health and education combined.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s a pretty dramatic thing. Then the aid levels for health  coming out of the rich countries have actually gone down. That’s a surprise. Rich country budgets are squeezed by wanting to raise defense spending, wanting to help Ukraine, having aging populations with higher health costs, and not wanting to raise taxes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So there’s a squeeze in the rich countries’ budgets, even though aid is <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-every-american-should-know-about-u-s-foreign-aid/\">well under</a> 1 percent of the US government budget. We’ve seen cuts in the UK, in Germany, in France, and the European Union.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is really tragic because the assumption was that as these Asian countries — Vietnam, Indonesia, India —&nbsp;graduated from being aid-eligible because of their economic growth, we’d have more money per person to put into the low-­income countries that remain, which are mostly in Africa. But that has not turned out to be the case.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left\"><blockquote><p>When somebody says to me the old arguments don’t work, I’m like, “Wow, we don’t care about children dying anymore?” I mean, it seems like, “Oh my God, what the hell?”</p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I want to help get those aid budgets up so we can provide the debt relief, so we can fund Gavi. Even Gavi is going to have a tough time raising as much money as it did five years ago. The Global Fund raises every three years, so next year, they’ll be going around. And I don’t know if they’ll be able to raise as much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s despite the fact that whether you see it through the moral lens or the climate adaptation lens or stopping pandemics before they get to rich countries or global stability — whatever it is, these are the best investments possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Dylan Scott</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does the global health movement need to find a new argument, as we expect these new countries to make more investments?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Bill Gates</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lots of countries have transitioned from low-­income to middle-­income: Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, India, Vietnam. Very few countries have transitioned from middle-­income to high-­income. South Korea is this famous example. Depending on where you set the threshold, you could say Chile or Poland are examples. But there’s not that many.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As you move from low-income to middle-, you are self­-sufficient, so you’re not drawing on whatever the aid budget is. As you move from middle- to high-, which China’s right on the threshold of, then hopefully you become a donor in some way. But we haven’t gotten too many new donors. We’re still extremely reliant on five countries: Japan, Germany, France, the UK, the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s like 70 percent of the aid right there, even though you have a few like Sweden and Norway who <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/foreign-aid-these-countries-are-the-most-generous/\">by the percentage of their economy</a> are the most generous at about 1 percent each. But the big money is in the Big Five. But the cuts there are so gigantic, we won’t make up for them with new donors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When somebody says to me the old arguments don’t work, I’m like, “Wow, we don’t care about children dying anymore?” I mean, it seems like, “Oh my God, what the hell?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I admit that the way that we get to people, including the younger generation, is changing. I think we have to renew our energy and how we connect on this. There’s no substitute for getting people to go see this and come back and bear witness to it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But we are challenged and we admit our message isn’t landing, so we’ve got work to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Dylan Scott</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Your report outlines some solutions. You’ve got new technology to increase dairy productivity. You’ve got financing through the Child Nutrition Fund. You’re focusing on making sure food is actually nutrient-­rich. You’ve got prenatal vitamins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If I were to force you to pick the first action item, keeping in mind this idea that we just don’t have as many resources as we’re used to to accomplish these things, what would you pick?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Bill Gates</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would say that large­-scale food fortification — where you get people to stick vitamin A or folic acid into foods — the cost of that is super, super low. We have a team that’s expert in that, working with the food makers and really measuring what the vitamin deficits are. That’s a best buy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea of these chickens that lay a lot of eggs or cows that make a lot of milk, the beauty of that is once you improve the genetics of the African cows, that’s a gift that keeps on giving. That’s a teaching a man to fish type thing where, as we mix the super productivity of Western dairy cows together with the heat and disease tolerance that African cows have, you can get something that’s 75 percent as productive as a [dairy cow], which is four times the milk productivity of the cows that are in Africa today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’ll take five years before, say, half the cows in Africa get that, but that’s a gigantic thing because that’s income for women, that’s milk for the kids where malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, and protein deficiency are gigantic. Cheap eggs, cheap chickens, and cheap milk are a big part of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve already cut the cost of eggs in Ethiopia in half. We see the poorest households actually using twice as many eggs as they used before because they’ve become a lot more affordable. Those egg factories and milk factories, getting those into Africa in the hands of the smallholder farmers, that’s pretty powerful.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-right\"><blockquote><p>Once you improve the genetics of the African cows, that’s a gift that keeps on giving. That’s a teaching a man to fish type thing.</p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Dylan Scott</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We are learning more all the time about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6050199/microbiome-human-gut-project-bacteria-probiotics\">our gut bacteria</a> and how that influences our digestion and physical health. What potential interventions are in the works to improve the microbiomes of children in the Global South?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Bill Gates</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The probiotic stuff, that’s at an earlier stage. We have to prove out the impact, and we have to get the cost of that down a lot. It’s in our R&amp;D work. If it works as well as we think, if we reduce the cost as much as we think, then we might even want to grow the size of the <a href=\"https://www.childnutritionfund.org/\">Child Nutrition Fund</a> [a UNICEF-led program on child hunger] and add that as an intervention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve been the biggest funder of research in [microbiomes], including <a href=\"https://source.washu.edu/2013/01/gut-microbes-at-root-of-severe-malnutrition-in-kids/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%20young%20twins,School%20of%20Medicine%20in%20St.\">the original study</a> where we took Malawi twins. We saw that one of them would be on the growth path, one would be off, and then we would look at stool samples or have them swallow capsules and figure out, “Okay, what is the makeup of a healthy microbiome?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The kid whose growth was faltering, what we saw was their microbiome was very different [from their twin] and very inflammatory. Their ability to absorb nutrition was limited, and then you get on a negative path because as you get weaker, you can’t get out of that condition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One way to intervene is to put the good bacteria in and have them outcompete the bad bacteria, but we don’t know how much we’ll be able to reduce the costs of that. The ideal thing would be to come up with a food-based intervention that’s cheap. We have a trial going on studying <a href=\"https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/choline/\">choline</a>, a nutrient that the good microbacteria thrive on and that the bad microbacteria don’t. It’d be a lot cheaper and more scalable if it turns out that choline, which we can make super cheap and add to vitamin supplements, pushes you toward this non­inflammatory set of microbiota species.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We know that protein pushes you in the right direction, but just saying, “Hey, every kid in the world should have lots of milk and eggs,” that’s way too expensive. We know we can make probiotics way cheaper than that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Dylan Scott</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve been hearing that the global health field itself is changing, emphasizing systems more and specific diseases or conditions less. We used to focus on one problem at a time: PEPFAR being focused on AIDS is maybe the best example of that. People thought, “We’re going to try to address this disease,” or, “We’re going to try to address this particular problem.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I’ve sensed that there’s been a shift toward supporting systems and supporting institutions. Investing in health system infrastructure, for example, instead of starting a campaign focused on a specific disease. I’m curious if your own thinking about not only how to deliver aid most effectively, but also what type of aid is most likely to lead to a lasting impact, has shifted.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Bill Gates </h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no doubt that the long-run solution is economic development. Economic growth that allows the government to collect more taxes and therefore fund more health, more education, more infrastructure, that’s the magic thing that India, Vietnam, Indonesia have shown is the way to get to self­-sufficiency. They’ve reduced their malnutrition a lot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center\"><blockquote><p>How do we help Africa get on an economic growth path? We need healthier children so that they can go to school and can be productive. </p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But you have to say, “Okay, what enables economic growth? Why is Africa in a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/why-so-much-world-stuck-poverty-trap\">poverty trap</a>?” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We know that parents choose to have enough children to have a 90 percent chance of having at least two survive to adulthood. As you reduce childhood death rates, fertility rates <a href=\"https://ccpr.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Child-Mortality-and-Fertility-Decline_-Does-the-Barro-Becker-Model-Fit-the-Facts_.pdf\">go down</a> almost in lockstep. There’s this weird paradox that if children survive, population growth goes down, which is the opposite of the commonsense view.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So how do we help Africa get on an economic growth path? We need healthier children so that they can go to school and can be productive. We need to reduce population growth, and reducing the death rate is your biggest lever to do that. And as you educate girls, that becomes another factor in <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data\">driving that fertility rate down</a>, as is making a contraception widely available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So these are all areas that the foundation works in. We want to enable economic growth. If you want to reduce children’s deaths, it’s not about some big health system;&nbsp;don’t think hospitals. Africans do not need doctors. They are born, they live, they die, and the majority never meet a doctor, or what the US would call a doctor. You have to look at: What’s killing these kids? What’s causing them to be malnourished?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Four things get you 85 percent of those deaths: malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and then a bunch of things that can kill you in your first 30 days. Those are the categories. We’ve made huge progress on malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia. We haven’t made as much on those first 30 days, and there’s still a lot more to do on that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No one disagrees that economic development is the end goal. But these very basic health things, that’s how for just $10 per citizen per year, you get yourself to a position where the kids are doing well at school. You’re moving off of the farms into services and manufacturing, and you will no longer be dependent on aid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My basic theory has been refined in terms of, “Okay, why did this work so well in Asia and what’s missing in Africa?” But the overall idea of “help them help themselves” is still pretty much the same.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Then, in a follow-up attack on Wednesday, thousands of two-way radios used by the group exploded, killing nine <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack\">people and wounding some 300</a>, some of whom had been attending the funerals of those killed in the earlier attack. There have also been reports of solar energy systems exploding in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/lebanon-syria-pagers-hezbollah-updates\">several areas of Lebanon</a>, but few details have been reported about these incidents.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah quickly blamed Israel for the attack. While the Israeli government has not yet commented — it rarely comments on covert actions abroad — experts and media reports are generally assuming it was responsible. It’s hard to think of another regional actor with the ability and motivation to carry out such an unprecedented operation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The attack has stunned former intelligence operatives with both its scale and sophistication. “This is a hell of an opp,” Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA counterterrorism specialist now with the Atlantic Council, told Vox. “It’s probably the most impressive kinetic intelligence operation I’ve ever seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond demonstrating the prowess of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, what’s less clear is what this tells us about Israel’s overall strategic goals, not to mention how Hezbollah will respond or how this will impact the outcome of this conflict or conflicts in the future. Here are a few of the biggest outstanding questions and what we know about the answers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How did they do it?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The emerging consensus from experts and media reports is that small amounts of explosive material were placed inside the pagers. Some <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-s-mossad-rigged-pager-batteries-with-explosives-before-they-reached-hezbollah-media/3333013\">reports have suggested</a> the explosive was detonated by malware that raised the temperature of the batteries in the pagers, but US officials told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html\">New York Times that the devices were </a>also implanted with switches that detonated the explosive remotely. According to the Times, the pagers received simultaneous messages on Tuesday that appeared to be from Hezbollah’s senior leadership, but instead caused the devices to beep for several seconds and then explode. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pagers were from a shipment of 3,000 that Hezbollah says they ordered from Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company. But Gold Apollo says they were actually made by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gold-apollo-says-it-did-not-make-pagers-used-lebanon-explosion-2024-09-18/\">BAC Consulting, a company</a> based in Hungary, and that the Taiwanese firm merely licensed its design and trademark. Reporters have so far been unable to contact BAC, and former intelligence officials who spoke with Vox said it’s questionable whether the company even makes pagers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/\">switched from using cellphones to old-fashioned pagers</a> several months ago to avoid Israeli surveillance. Communications are generally a point of vulnerability for militant groups. Earlier this week, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/the-crude-system-of-coded-messages-keeping-hamass-leader-alive-c387b580?mod=hp_lista_pos2\">Wall Street Journal reported </a>that Hamas’s top leader, Yahya Sinwar, has abandoned electronics entirely and now relies on a system of human couriers and coded handwritten messages for communication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The attack comes several weeks after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, reportedly by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html\">bomb that had been planted by Israeli agents</a> in a guesthouse in the Iranian capital months earlier. It also comes several days after a rare raid by Israeli ground forces in Syria that destroyed an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/12/israel-syria-raid\">alleged underground Iranian missile factory</a>.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What we have seen over the past two months shows that Israel and its intelligence apparatus have completely infiltrated the most sensitive echelons of the entire Axis of Resistance,” said Charles Lister, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, referring to the informal name for Iran’s network of proxy militias throughout the Middle East. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was only a year ago when the reputation of Israel’s intelligence services took a major hit with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/13/23998928/hamas-taliban-isis-attacks-terrorism-extremist-groups-israel-palestine\">the failure to anticipate the October 7 attacks</a>, despite abundant signs that Hamas was preparing for a major operation. It’s worth noting that while the operations in Lebanon and Iran were likely carried out by the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, Israeli-occupied Gaza is the responsibility of the Shin Bet, the domestic security service. The Shin Bet official responsible for Southern Israel and Gaza <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/shin-bet-official-in-charge-of-south-resigns-over-oct-7-failures-a-duty-to-apologize/\">resigned over that failure</a>, as have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/idf-commander-unit-8200-yossi-sariel-resigns-7a9d58da\">two senior military intelligence officials</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polymeropoulos said that while October 7 damaged the reputation of Israel’s vaunted spy services, “they have now restored that notion of deterrence based on fear, this notion that Israel has eyes everywhere.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why did they do it?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Emily Harding, a former CIA analyst and director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that prior to October 7, Israel had shifted many of its intelligence resources away from Hamas toward Iran and regional proxy groups like Hezbollah. Over the past year, attention has obviously shifted to Gaza, she said, “but at the same time, they’ve clearly decided they’re not going to tolerate an imminent threat on their northern border” with Lebanon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even as the war in Gaza has raged, Israel and Hezbollah have been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24153755/hezbollah-israel-lebanon\">exchanging fire over the Israel-Lebanon border,</a> displacing tens of thousands of civilians on both sides. While Israel reportedly backed away from plans to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-biden-averted-a-second-front-by-convincing-israel-not-to-attack-hezbollah-on-oct-11-e14a0a3b\">launch a major preemptive strike</a> against Hezbollah in the early days of the war, senior Israeli officials, most notably <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-gaza.html\">Defense Minister Yoav Gallant</a>, have repeatedly said that a military assault will be needed to deal with the threat on Israel’s northern border.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this week, Israel’s security cabinet added restoring security to the north as one of its <a href=\"https://www.abc3340.com/news/nation-world/israel-security-cabinet-updates-war-goals-to-include-stopping-hezbollah-attacks-israel-hamas-war-gaza-airstrikes-lebanon-conflict-hostages-cease-fire-humanitarian-aid-netanyahu\">primary war aims</a>. Without referring specifically to the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, Gallant said on Wednesday that a <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1svmcoar\">“new phase”</a> of the war with Hezbollah had begun.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The question now is whether the attacks were launched as preparation for some major military action, or whether — contradictory as it may seem — this was conceived as a way to de-escalate tensions by putting Hezbollah on its heels, at least for a little while. For the moment, this second possibility looks more likely. Despite Gallant’s declaration, Israel doesn’t appear to be taking advantage of the chaos in Lebanon to launch a military invasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also possible that the timing of the attack wasn’t intentional at all. The Middle East-focused news site<a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/09/exclusive-hezbollah-suspicions-forced-israel-expedite-lebanon-pager-attack?token=eyJlbWFpbCI6Impvc2h1YWVrZWF0aW5nQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsIm5pZCI6IjY2NjM2In0%3D&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Ungrouped%20transactional%20email&amp;utm_content=Ungrouped%20transactional%20email+ID_6eff8eb5-7544-11ef-b731-b859b7e75d67&amp;utm_source=campmgr&amp;utm_term=Access%20Article\"> Al-Monitor reported</a> on Tuesday that Israel had intended to wait longer to detonate the devices but was “forced” to move more quickly by reports that some Hezbollah members were starting to think there was something odd about their pagers.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How will Hezbollah respond?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hezbollah has <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-updates-new-devices-blast-in-southern-lebanon/live-70244929\">vowed to retaliate</a>, saying Israel would receive its “fair punishment for the attacks.” The militia’s leader Hassan Nasrallah says he will give a speech on Thursday to address the “latest developments.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Hezbollah’s ability to strike back may be limited by the state of chaos it currently finds itself in. “They almost certainly have little to no communication or the infrastructure to be able to coordinate not just an initial round of a retaliation, but whatever would come next,” said Lister.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harding predicted that Hezbollah’s next move is likely to be a “big internal mole hunt to try to figure out where their vulnerabilities are.” After the follow-up explosions on Thursday, “they can&#8217;t trust anything that they have right now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Iran, whose ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured by the blasts — not a huge surprise given the close links between Iran and Hezbollah — has also claimed the <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-says-it-reserves-right-to-respond-after-ambassador-wounded-in-lebanon-blasts/\">right to respond</a>. The question is whether this would go beyond the missile strike it launched in April in response to Israel’s bombing of the Iranian consulate, which killed two senior generals. Though that barrage was unprecedented in scale, most of the missiles were intercepted by Israel’s defenses, with the assistance of several other countries including the US, and the attack caused little damage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Iran President Masoud Pezeshkian also said the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/hezbollah-promises-reckoning-for-israel-after-pager-explosions\">US shared responsibility</a> for the attack, given its support for Israel, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had no advance knowledge of the operation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What does it mean for the future of conflict — and is my phone safe?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Washington Post’s David Ignatius wrote on Wednesday that the attacks <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/17/pager-attack-israel-hezbollah-lebanon/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9\">mark the start</a> of a “very dangerous era in cyberwarfare” in which “any device that is connected to the internet can potentially be transformed into a weapon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But some perspective is needed. The devices themselves were not weapons. Hackers have <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/mobile/08/05/miller.apple.battery.hacks/index.html\">warned in the past</a> that it’s possible to use malware to remotely tamper with or even detonate a device’s battery, but to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pager-explosion-hezbollah/\">cause the kind of damage</a> seen this week, you need old-fashioned explosives. As a matter of technology, this isn’t a huge advance over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/06/world/palestinian-believed-to-be-bombing-mastermind-is-killed.html\">Israel’s killing of Hamas bomb maker Yahya Ayyash</a> using an exploding cellphone in 1996. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From a technical point of view, what was impressive was Israel’s apparent ability to “hack” the supply chain and insert explosives into so many devices. There probably aren’t that many situations other than this one where that’s possible. As Axios’s Colin Demarest <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-future-of-defense-thought-bubble-fedbbaa0-75b8-11ef-9608-6bb026eca3bc\">writes</a>, referring to worries that the US could be vulnerable to such an attack, “the Pentagon is unlikely to buy thousands of C-4-laden pagers for top brass.” Your iPhone is probably safe, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this week’s attacks represent something radically new in terms of tactics, if not technology. In international law, “booby traps” are <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/100193/law-war-exploding-pagers-lebanon/\">prohibited under many circumstances</a>, and given how many devices were detonated and the fact that civilians, including children, were injured and killed, there are questions about whether the attack met international legal standards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there’s the issue of whether other actors — either nation-states or militant groups — might now attempt something similar in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a think tank focused on counterterrorism, compared the attack to the early use of deadly drone strikes by the US. Once mainly the provenance of the US, killer drones have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024/1/29/24055046/jordan-drone-strike-troop-deaths-proliferation\">now spread widely</a> to both state and non-state actors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wars like the current conflict in the Middle East are “often laboratories of innovation for all sides,” Clarke said. “We’re going to see militant groups developing new tricks and trying to leverage emerging technologies in new ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the vast number of connected devices now in homes and businesses all over the world, there’s no lack of potential targets. Even if it would be difficult for anyone to pull off another similar attack of this scale, Clarke said it’s the sort of precedent-setting example that “could give bad people good ideas.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Few things spread faster than innovative ways to kill people in war.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Both are likely efforts by Ukraine to put itself in a better position to end Russia’s two-and-a-half-year war, which has devastated parts of the country — particularly in the south and east. While no peace talks are currently scheduled, Ukraine’s strategy could theoretically put it in a stronger negotiating position should talks happen, while also damaging Russia’s morale, ability to resupply, and its ability to launch devastating strikes within Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ukraine has long argued it could achieve more battlefield victories if the Biden administration would allow the military to use US-made long-range weapons to strike targets further in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tver strike and the Kursk incursion are likely meant to send a signal to allies that despite the war grinding on, Ukraine isn’t beaten, and that its allies aren’t backing a lost cause. That’s especially important in the leadup to the November US election, when a change in the White House could affect US political and material support for Ukraine, as <a href=\"https://punchbowl.news/article/foreign-policy/gop-split-screen-ukraine-war/\">former President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates</a> have signaled a coolness to continued material support for the war effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Essentially, Ukraine’s message is: We’re doing well in the fight against Russia, and would do even better with more advanced weapons. However, despite Ukraine’s flashy successes since the Kursk offensive, it’s unclear —&nbsp;and possibly unlikely — that the Biden administration will give Ukraine both the materiel and the go-ahead to use it the way they want.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ukraine’s trying to make the most of limited resources, but the US is in a tricky position</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The target of the drone attack, according to Ukrainian sources <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68933778\">cited in reporting</a>, was a weapons depot that held conventional weapons like artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Those weapons, as well as the fuel tanks reportedly stored at the depot, could account for the explosive visuals being circulated on Telegram, a favorite platform for Russian military bloggers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts note that though the Tver attack has attracted attention due to the size of the explosion, it’s not an isolated strike: “Ukrainian forces are conducting a consistent drone strike campaign into rear areas of Russia, targeting oil refineries and military airfields, military ammunition depots, and logistics facilities,” <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/riley-bailey\">Riley Bailey</a>, a senior researcher on Russia at the Institute for the Study of War, told Vox. “This one just seems to be very effective.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The successful drone attacks, Bailey said, could <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-strikes-russian-military-base-in-occupied-south-as-offensive-looms-cce9606a\">disrupt Russian military logistics</a> within Russia — as longer-range <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2033-1.html\">Ukrainian missile attacks did against Russian military installations within Ukraine in summer 2022</a>. Disrupting logistics and resupply within Russia could,  over time, hamper Russia’s ability to defend itself from attacks on its own soil; mount offensive campaigns within Ukraine; and force the military to rebuild and rearrange its supply capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If there was this persistent threat of Ukrainian forces being able to achieve similar effects at several logistics facilities like this, then that would impose the same kind of operational pressure that Russian forces faced back in the summer of 2022,” Bailey said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ukraine has always been outgunned and outmanned against Russia; without continued US and NATO support, the Ukrainian military can’t continue to fight. But, Ukrainian leadership has long argued, they could do much more significant damage to Russian supplies and strategy if the US allowed them to use long-range weapons to hit targets deep into Russian territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The apparently successful Tver attack comes as <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-victory-plan-ready/\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> is set to present his victory plan to US President Joe Biden during a visit to the US later in September. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/369339/ukraine-zelenskyy-russia-putin-war-biden-sanctions-weapons-negotiations\">Though details are scarce, that plan</a> seems intent on using military force to push Russia into negotiations to end the war. A pillar of the plan likely depends on continued weapons support and looser permissions around how those weapons are used. The US has been hesitant to grant those permissions in order to not be seen as <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-finland-not-to-prohibit-ukraine-from-striking-russia-with-its-weapons-amid-putins-threats-to-nato/\">directly involved</a> or escalating the conflict — and therefore <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin\">inviting Russia to do the same</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, fears about escalation haven’t played out on the battlefield, <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/courtney_william.html\">Amb. William Courtney</a>, an adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, told Vox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Russian reaction, generally, has not been to escalate,” he said. “It’s been to adapt and try to counter.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even if the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer-range missiles in its arsenal to attack Russian positions, it might not have a major impact, according to <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/people/jennifer-kavanagh?lang=en\">Jennifer Kavanagh</a>, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There are not that many Russian military targets in range of even the longer range missiles with additional permissions, and Russia can move valuable assets elsewhere, further reducing any losses from Ukrainian strikes,” she said. Plus, Ukraine wouldn’t be able to get enough of those weapons to mount the kind of sustained attacks that would make a long-term difference in the war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Ukraine appears to be pressing ahead with its strategy and <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/us-reassures-but-sense-of-urgency-questioned-by-ukraine-as-6-billion-military-aid-hangs-in-the-balance/\">hoping that the Biden administration gets on board with the plan for victory</a> —&nbsp;and that even if long-range capabilities aren’t the key to winning the war, they’ll at least make Russia’s war increasingly difficult and costly to execute.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

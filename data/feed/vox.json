At the trials, Biles used her win to highlight the immense pressure that elite athletes are under and the importance of being candid about these challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’ve all been pretty open and honest [about] what we’re going through,” Biles, 27, said at a press conference following the meet. “But we’re always going to prioritize mental health and it’s really nice that Tokyo gave us that opportunity to open up that stage for that talk.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"U.S. Olympic Team Trials: Simone Biles Press Conference\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wAAWWmYkENY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles’s recent win marks the third time she’ll head to the Olympics and also makes her the oldest US woman gymnast to qualify for the Games since the 1950s. That Biles is resuming competition once more is a feat in and of itself. She’ll be one of a small group of gymnasts who’s ever participated in three consecutive Olympic Games. Her willingness to confront her mental health struggles also sends a compelling message, normalizing the decision to speak out and showing how athletes can be stronger for doing so.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Biles’s dominant performance at the Olympic trials, briefly explained </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles made her Olympic debut in Rio in 2016, where she won three individual gold medals and a team gold. Since then, she’s also won countless other competitions, including the US national championships <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/simone-biles-wins-9th-us-gymnastics-championship/story?id=110767892#:~:text=Simone%20Biles%20dominated%20at%20the,Paris%20Olympic%20Games%20this%20summer.&amp;text=The%2027%2Dyear%2Dold%20finished,%2C%20balance%20beam%2C%20and%20vault.\">nine times</a>. Biles is widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time because of the heightened difficulty of the skills she performs and her ability to execute them. Her wins at the Olympics and numerous world championships <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/06/1204379375/simone-biles-most-decorated-gymnast-history\">also make her the most decorated gymnast</a> ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Tokyo in 2021, Biles returned to the Olympics as a member of the US team. While there, she experienced what’s colloquially known as the “twisties,” a dangerous condition when gymnasts lose the sense of where they are in the air. Given the complexity and difficulty of gymnastic routines, the twisties are extremely hazardous and can result in serious injury. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After getting the “twisties” on a vault, Biles opted to withdraw from multiple competitions at the Olympics, including the team contest. Prior to that decision, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/simonebiles/p/CRxsq_kBZrP/?img_index=1\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.instagram.com/simonebiles/p/CRxsq_kBZrP/?img_index=1\">she wrote in an Instagram post</a> that she felt like she had the “weight of the world on my shoulders at times,” later describing the challenges as the build-up of longstanding traumas that all came to a head.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s like compressing all of this shit for so many years. It just unfolded. You can’t compress trauma that much longer,” Biles said this year on the<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHRCJwSds1U\">podcast <em>Call Her Daddy</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the years since Tokyo, Biles has said she was “petrified” to get back in the gym and revisit some of the skills she used to do. She’s described engaging in therapy as a major factor in helping her process and recover from the 2020 Olympics, and she’s also <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46341233/simone-biles-mental-health-therapy-anxiety-medication/\">talked about taking medication in order to combat anxiety.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“[I’m] continuing to work on my body and my mind, just like I have the past year and a half, and it’s worked,” Biles said on <em>Call Her Daddy</em>. “I didn’t think therapy was going to work, and it’s working.” According to her coach Cecile Landi, Biles also now has a toolkit she’s built of techniques to combat stress during competitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles made a dominant return to this year’s Olympic trials, which consist of two days of competition, with each athlete doing all four gymnastics apparatuses — bars, beam, floor, and vault — on both days. The Olympic selection committee then considers the scores the athletes have received as well as other factors to determine who should make the team. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This year, the decision was relatively straightforward: The committee went with the top-scoring athletes across the board, something they don’t always do because they also consider individual strengths on different apparatuses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the end, Biles led <a href=\"https://thegymter.net/2024/06/30/2024-u-s-olympic-trials-results/\">with 117.225 points</a> — five points ahead of the next competitor. She was followed by Olympic vets Suni Lee at 111.675, Jordan Chiles at 111.425, Jade Carey at 111.350, and newcomer Hezly Rivera at 111.150. The five of them are the team that’s heading to Paris, while Joscelyn Roberson and Leanne Wong will serve as traveling alternates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles secured her spot on the Olympic team with two days of stellar routines, particularly on floor and vault. On these two apparatuses, she’s long been known for having some of the highest difficulty scores of any gymnast competing, something that hasn’t changed in her return. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her floor exercise, for example, included a jaw-dropping move <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/29/simone-biles-us-olympic-gymnastics-trials/74252515007/\">dubbed the Biles II</a>, which involves three twists and two flips. And her vault, widely viewed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2023/09/29/simone-biles-vault-yurchenko-double-pike-difficulty/\">as the toughest in women’s gymnastics</a> — featured what’s known as a Yurchenko double pike, something no other female gymnast has been able to do. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Biles’s focus on mental health sends an important message</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since her experience in Tokyo, Biles has been vocal about the need to care for her mental health and the need for professional athletes who’ve long dealt with intense scrutiny and stress to have outlets to discuss them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think now athletes are a little bit more in tune and we trust what our gut is saying, and just taking mental health a little bit more serious,” Biles said at this week’s press briefing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elite athletes are under incredible strain to perform, <a href=\"https://news.asu.edu/20231102-mental-health-and-pressure-perform\">making them more prone to anxiety, depression</a>, and other mental health conditions. In the past, discussing mental health has also been stigmatized and viewed by some as a sign of weakness. Biles’s decision to speak out helps dispel some of that stigma and allows more people, including her teammates, to share their own concerns. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Suni [Lee] earlier, she came up to me and she was like ‘I’m not okay,’ and so we walk through it. We tell her, her why, why she’s doing it, and we just give her those reminders that she can do it, she’s done it before, so let’s go out there and get it,” Biles said at the press briefing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lee, too, has emphasized how important her mental health and staying positive has been as she’s navigated recovery from kidney disease in order to compete again this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles has also said she’s focused less on external judgment. In Tokyo, some viewers reacted negatively to Biles’s decision to pull out of competition, and if athletes — including her — make similar decisions in Paris, it’s possible it could engender that same response from certain observers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think it has to be for us, because it can’t be for anybody else because that’s not why we do it. We do it for ourselves, and the love for this sport, and the love for representing the US,” Biles said in the press briefing. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The controversy concerning President Joe Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358652/biden-drop-out-debate-harris-convention\">disastrous debate performance</a> last week has largely focused on the electoral consequences of whether he stays in the presidential race or drops out. But it should also raise the question of whether he is fit to govern right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the debate, Biden — said by aides to be <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4744889-joe-biden-has-a-cold-debate/\">suffering from a cold</a> — seemed at times to be unable to string a sentence together, struggled to communicate Democrats’ message on some of the most important issues in the 2024 presidential election, and repeatedly failed to hold former President Donald Trump accountable for his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357776/biden-trump-debate-democracy-crisis-analysis-lies-facts\">prolific lies</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The performance sparked days of debate about the 81-year-old’s ability to win the election, but there were concerns about the president’s age well before then. After Biden defeated Trump in 2020, those worries quieted and were <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/06/biden-age-wall-street-journal-morning-joe-1235959576/\">dismissed when they began to percolate again</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, though, there is no arguing with what everyone who watched the debate saw: a man who does not seem to possess the stamina or mental acuity needed to handle the notoriously demanding job of running the United States. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden’s team has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/white-house-biden-mental-fitness/index.html\">forcefully rebutted</a> any claims that his performance at the debate mirrors how he is at work, even as reports to the contrary have begun to pile up. On <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-age-concerns-world-leaders-democrats-6d753921\">foreign trips</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">private meetings with current and former officials</a>, and at public events where he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4457527-biden-mistakenly-calls-egyptian-leader-president-of-mexico/\">misspoke</a> or <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-freeze-video-juneteenth-event-white-house-questions-republicans-rnc-1911050\">appeared to freeze up</a>, he’s said to be showing alarming signs of an inability to recall details or communicate clearly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some <a href=\"https://x.com/AlexThomp/status/1808107417785217474\">Biden allies have argued</a> that it doesn’t matter whether the president is capable of carrying out his duties because he is surrounded by competent people. But voters did not select those officials and advisers and don’t have a clear picture of just how much they are responsible for decisions coming from the White House.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s why the question should be not only whether he should step aside to make way for another Democratic nominee, but whether Vice President Kamala Harris should take the reins before Biden completes his first term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats’ focus is on Biden’s ability to beat Trump and his competency in a second term. They worry that Biden’s lapses are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html\">only getting worse</a> and that he will surely deteriorate further in another four years. The firestorm around his age is now <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/03/democratic-rage-biden-debate-performance\">jeopardizing down-ballot candidates</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, these concerns also present a strong argument against Biden staying in office. That’s a conversation that should be happening, but few are currently discussing it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This raises an urgent question of accountability and transparency: Who is running the country?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">A cascade of reports suggests Biden is struggling to do his job</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reporting in recent days indicates that Biden might only be able to perform his presidential duties part of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some White House sources claim Biden is “dependably engaged” <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/29/two-bidens-trump-debate-2024-president\">between 10 am and 4 pm</a>; otherwise and on foreign trips, he is “more likely to have verbal miscues and become fatigued,” Axios reported. Both Republican and Democratic members of Congress <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-election-2024-8ee15246\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that he’s shown his age in meetings with them, at times forgetting his own policies or speaking so quietly that he could not be heard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At a G7 summit in mid-June, he was the only leader not to attend a less-scripted dinner. While diplomats said he was at times sharp, he also repeatedly struggled with his talking points, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-age-concerns-world-leaders-democrats-6d753921\">the Wall Street Journal also reported</a>. On the anniversary of D-Day in June, he also spoke so quietly that reporters covering his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky strained to hear him, and he misspoke when describing what the $225 million that the US was sending to Ukraine would be used for. It was for munitions to protect the electric grid and other targets; he said it was to “reconstruct the electric grid.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the last year, multiple people close to Biden have gone to former White House chief of staff Ron Klain to <a href=\"https://x.com/yashar/status/1807936310998716721\">express concern</a> that he was losing his train of thought and unable to pick up where he left off, much like he was on the debate stage, according to CNN political analyst Carl Bernstein. In the days since the debate, White House aides have expressed <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/02/biden-white-house-campaign-staff-freaking-out-debate\">concern about the president’s mental fitness</a> and say they’re operating without leadership and direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who defended the late California Senator Dianne Feinstein from calls for her resignation related to her difficulties with her duties, is now asking what <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4751972-pelosi-biden-debate-performance/\">she told MSNBC</a> is a “legitimate question.” Speaking about Biden’s debate performance, she asked, “Is this an episode, or is this a condition?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an early June <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/\">CBS/YouGov poll</a>, 65 percent said that he did not have the cognitive ability to be president; that number has since grown to 72 percent after the debate. The same share said he should not be running for president. By comparison, 49 percent said Trump did not have the cognitive ability to be president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All presidents rely upon a vast administration to carry out their policies, but these incidents heighten questions about whom he is relying on around him to get the job done. Recent reporting has suggested that there are only a few people that Biden really listens to. That includes <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/29/biden-debate-replace-advisers\">first lady Jill Biden, his sister Valerie Biden Owens, Ted Kaufman</a> (his longtime friend and a former US senator from Delaware), Klain, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/us/politics/klain-kaufman-biden-campaign-election.html\">Mike Donilon</a>, who has closely advised him since the 1980s. Post-debate (and reportedly to the frustration of House Democrats), his son Hunter Biden, who was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-gun-trial-federal-charges-delaware-5dd8a9380235c6360a1ddb691ef24a06\">convicted of three felony gun charges</a> last month, has also been <a href=\"https://x.com/maxpcohen/status/1808219986491760815\">sitting in on high-level meetings</a> with senior advisers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden is surrounded by a plethora of other aides, but it’s not clear even to members of Biden’s party how much sway they have. As one House Democrat <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/03/democratic-rage-biden-debate-performance\">told Axios</a>, “I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s making decisions. Why the hell isn&#8217;t Biden on the phone with congressional leadership?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, no president can be everything everywhere all at once — they must rely on their staff for counsel and to execute their vision. At issue is how much of the Biden administration’s policy is Biden’s vision and how much comes from other sources. And if his closest advisers have more sway over the country than perhaps is typical, they have a personal incentive to encourage Biden to stay in office and to seek a second term, regardless of his condition: They have the president’s ear; their power disappears when he leaves the White House.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What happens if Biden does leave office now?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At this juncture, the only say voters have over whether Biden is president will come in November’s elections. Republicans are <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4752735-biden-25th-amendment-divides-gop/\">entertaining the idea</a> of pressuring Biden’s cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office if he is unable to perform his duties, but their motivations are mostly political and it’s not clear that Biden stepping down would help them in November.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Biden is unwilling to step down on his own accord, Harris and a majority of the cabinet could declare him unfit to serve <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/9/14488980/25th-amendment-trump-pence\">under the 25th Amendment</a>. That would require him to vacate his office, after which Harris would immediately assume the role of acting president. Harris could then nominate someone as vice president, who would have to be confirmed by a majority vote in both chambers of Congress. If Biden contests the assessment that he is unfit to serve, two-thirds of both chambers of Congress would have to find him fit to serve for him to be reinstated as president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, this would be a practically unthinkable last resort for Democrats. It’s much more likely that Biden would decide to step down without anyone having to force his hand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That would require him to write a simple resignation letter addressed to the Secretary of State, just as <a href=\"https://www.archivesfoundation.org/documents/richard-nixon-resignation-letter-gerald-ford-pardon/\">President Richard Nixon did in 1974</a>. Harris would automatically become president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris temporarily stepping up as president likely would mean she would become the Democratic nominee. This is the path of least resistance: Unlike other potential replacement nominees, she would have immediate access to Biden’s campaign funds, and the party doesn’t have much time to rally around a new nominee.

Earlier in the week, Beryl pummeled islands in the southeast Caribbean, including Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. It flattened buildings, wiped out electricity, and left at least four people dead. Heavy rainfall from the storm has also killed another three people in Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hurricane Beryl is already record-breaking. On Tuesday, Beryl intensified into a Category 5 storm, before slowing back down Wednesday, making it the earliest Category 5 storm on record in the Atlantic. The storm, which is expected to reach the Cayman Islands by Thursday, also intensified at record speeds for a storm this early in the year, jumping from Category 1 to Category 4 in less than 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Caribbean nations are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, for the obvious reason that they&#8217;re often in the path of these storms. Hurricanes typically form in the Atlantic Ocean, west of northern Africa, and then travel west toward the Caribbean and Southeastern US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Caribbean islands also have one of the world’s best defense systems against superstorms like Beryl. That system is hidden under the waves, it’s free, and it’s all-natural. It’s coral reefs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, most Caribbean nations are surrounded by a colorful patchwork of coral reefs, communities of living animals that function together as natural seawalls. These hard, rocklike creatures help dampen waves and reduce flooding. Research shows that coral reefs help dozens of countries avert billions of dollars in flood damage each year, in the Caribbean and globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem, more pressing now than ever, is that these lifesaving ecosystems are vanishing —&nbsp;for the very same reason hurricanes are becoming more destructive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">An all-natural hurricane defense system&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Each piece of coral on a reef is actually a colony of tiny animals, called polyps. Those polyps build skeletons out of calcium carbonate, not unlike a snail growing a shell, that form the structure of the reef.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s these coral skeletons that safeguard coastlines during a storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Simply put, waves lose energy when they ram into coral reefs. The bigger and taller the reef, the more wave energy it dissipates, for the same reason that coastal cities use breakwaters made of rocks to protect the shoreline. Remarkably, studies show that coral reefs can dissipate <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4794\">more than 90 percent</a> of wave energy. Waves with less energy are smaller and slower and don’t deal as much damage when they reach the shore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even a small difference in a reef’s height can make a big difference in risk. Flood risk is often measured by what’s called the 100-year flood zone — an area in which the chance of a flood in a given year is 1 percent. If coral reefs in the US lose 1 meter of height, <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/value-us-coral-reefs-risk-reduction\">a study</a> found, that zone in the US would grow by 104 square kilometers (or about 26,000 acres, nearly twice the size of Manhattan), putting about 51,000 more people at risk of flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1491221549.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.041829306103,100,69.916341387793\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This service —&nbsp;which coral reefs supply for free —&nbsp;is worth a lot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Across the US, including Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, coral reefs help safeguard the homes of more than 18,000 people and avert $1.8 billion in flood damage each year, <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/value-us-coral-reefs-risk-reduction\">according</a> to a 2019 study by the US Geological Survey (USGS). Slightly <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5997709/\">older research</a> found that, globally, this number is more than $4 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Without reefs, annual damages would more than double,” authors of the latter study, published in <em>Nature Communications, </em>wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Caribbean nations are among those that benefit most from coral reefs and the damage they prevent. In the <em>Nature Communications </em>study, published in 2018, researchers ranked countries by how much flood damage coral reefs avert, relative to their GDP. Eight of the top 10 are Caribbean nations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No. 3 is Grenada,&nbsp;where Hurricane Beryl made landfall Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Vanishing reefs</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All the financial and potentially life-saving benefits reefs provide make losing them that much scarier. And we are indeed losing them, especially in the Caribbean’s warm(ing) waters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The area of live hard corals on Caribbean reefs has fallen by about <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/coral-reefs/us-coral-reefs\">80 percent</a> in recent decades. In some regions, like the Florida Keys, the declines are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change\">even steeper</a>.&nbsp;Compared to the 1970s, most Caribbean reefs are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change\">almost unrecognizable today</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Elkhorn coral — a species resembling moose antlers known for its wave-weakening abilities  —&nbsp;is especially endangered. In the 1970s, it grew across more than 30 percent of Caribbean reefs. By the 1980s, coverage of the coral had fallen to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37858-2\">less than 2 percent</a>, a number that has likely only shrunk further in the years since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A number of human behaviors have destroyed Caribbean coral, from coastal construction to fishing, as have some seemingly natural threats, like disease. The most enduring and existential problem, however, is climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Warming ocean water disrupts the relationship between coral and a kind of symbiotic algae that lives inside the polyps. This disruption causes coral to turn white —&nbsp;or “bleach” —&nbsp;and starve. Bleached corals often have more trouble surviving other threats and die.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means climate change is not only making tropical storms more severe, but it can also weaken our natural defenses against them.&nbsp;And this is an important, frightening point: A warming ocean makes storms more dangerous, not just because they’re intensifying faster or dropping more rain but because, in places like the Caribbean, we’re losing resilience that iconic ecosystems provide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, July 3, 10:15 am ET:</em></strong><em><strong> </strong>This story was originally published on July 1 and has been updated multiple times with the latest information about Hurricane Beryl.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

By trying to measure life’s intangibles, like feelings and emotions, the survey is seeking insights into the health of societies that<strong>, </strong>as the authors of the report themselves note, “traditional economic indicators such as GDP were never intended to capture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thankfully, the report doesn’t offer yet another critique of why GDP <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/8131721/8131772/Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi-Commission-report.pdf\">isn’t</a> a <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2017/03/pdf/coyle.pdf\">perfect</a> indicator <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16GDP-t.html\">for progress</a>. Instead, it reports on the annual state of two indexes —&nbsp;one for positive emotions, the other for negative — that can complement GDP in trying to give us a quick sense of how society is actually doing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The results are surprisingly … fine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps you’ve felt that the <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/social-acceleration/9780231148344\">world is accelerating</a> into chaos; heard more chatter about the experts who think <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/10/24032987/ai-impacts-survey-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-superintelligence\">AI will lead to human extinction</a>; or thought that even if it doesn’t, our continued failure to adequately deal with climate change <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2024/may/08/hopeless-and-broken-why-the-worlds-top-climate-scientists-are-in-despair\">will get the job done anyway</a>. Or maybe you have children, and have been particularly attuned to how screwed we keep <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health\">hearing youth mental health is</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Against doomerism</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Media is known to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23596969/bad-news-negativity-bias-media\">lean negative</a>. I could rewrite that doomer-esque paragraph about the world accelerating into gloomy chaos in its mirror image, rattling off incredibly exciting achievements, ideas, and success stories that fuel a sense of optimism. In fact, we did <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23632673/against-doomerism\">a whole package like that here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, the topline results from the Gallup report look pretty good. Positive emotions reached a score of 71 out of 100 worldwide, the highest since the pandemic began. And negative emotions dropped for the first time since 2014. Among all age groups, young people were, by far, the best off. They experienced more positive emotions than anyone else and fewer negative ones. And in both directions, that’s been the case since measurement began in 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/YoungPeople.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.411593607775,100,71.176812784451\" alt=\"A set of three lines on a graph track happiness from 2006 to 2023, by age.

The list is dominated by Latin American and Southeast Asian countries. While comparing happiness levels across countries with different cultures can be fraught,<strong> </strong>this still raises questions about the emotional wealth of industrialized nations, but it also reflects the important challenges in figuring out how to measure something as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24125481/consciousness-mental-health-language-science-ineffable-math\">intangible and fuzzy</a> as how we actually feel.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Different methodologies deliver different pictures of well-being</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every measure of well-being is biased in its own way. The Gallup emotions survey, which polls about 1,000 respondents from each of the 142 included countries, focuses on two measures. The Positive Experience Index is an average across different questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Did you feel well rested yesterday?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Were you treated with respect all day yesterday?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Did you experience enjoyment during a lot of the day yesterday?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Higher scores mean positive feelings are more pervasive across a given country. The Negative Experience Index has a similar structure, asking whether respondents felt physical pain, worry, sadness, stress, or anger the day before.&nbsp;By this measure, the world’s happiest countries are places like Paraguay, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But wait. Perhaps you’ve heard that Finland is actually the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/happiest-countries-world-happiness-report-2024.html#:~:text=Finland%20ranked%20as%20the%20happiest,to%20The%20World%20Happiness%20Report.&amp;text=For%20the%20seventh%20year%20in%20a%20row%2C%20Finland%20has%20landed,happiest%20countries%20in%20the%20world.\">world’s happiest country</a>, and has been so for seven years in a row.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That ranking comes from the <a href=\"https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/WHR+24.pdf\">World Happiness Report</a>, which also uses data collected by Gallup, but on a different question. It focuses on life satisfaction, rather than daily experiences, by using a question known as the <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/122453/understanding-gallup-uses-cantril-scale.aspx\">Cantril ladder</a>. It asks people to imagine a ladder with numbered steps from zero to 10, the top representing “the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.” Then, they ask people to place themselves on the ladder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you look at happiness that way, you get Scandinavian domination:</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/bsAv3-the-world-s-happiest-countries-in-2023-change-depending-on-what-you-measure-4.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,25.482830072286,100,49.034339855428\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you ask people to place themselves on a ladder of life satisfaction, you’ll get a different answer than if you ask the same group of people about the emotions they felt the day before. By conjuring the image of a societal ladder, the life satisfaction approach might actually be measuring something closer to <em>social status</em> than happiness, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24112787/world-happiness-report-country-rankings\">my colleague Sigal Samuel argues</a>. “The poisonousness of social comparison can also help make sense of the observation that higher GDP doesn’t always correlate with increased happiness,” she writes. “The US has a high GDP, but it also has extremely high inequality. So a lot of Americans are comparing themselves to other, richer Americans — and becoming more miserable as a result.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Measuring daily emotional experiences could circumvent the concern of biasing results toward status. But it could also miss a bunch of other considerations associated with a happy life or, certainly, progress. Amartya Sen, the famous development economist, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/2148/chapter/142107672\">argued</a> that reducing welfare to pleasurable mental conditions “can be very misleading, since it may fail to reflect a person’s real deprivation.” Humans are remarkably adaptive, and may still find and report pleasurable experiences while living in conditions of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/22/23884636/united-nations-sustainable-development-goals-extreme-poverty-hunger-climate-change-ukraine\">extreme poverty</a>, limited opportunities for education and social mobility, or political oppression.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Interestingly, not a single country from the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-does-g7-do\">G7</a> —&nbsp;an informal group of economic powerhouses that meet annually to coordinate on global governance —&nbsp;is to be found at the top of either list. If there were a G7 formed on the basis of happiness, rather than economic development, it would consist of countries like Paraguay and Indonesia, not the US or Germany. If we had a life satisfaction G7, it’d mostly just be Scandinavia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The vibecession paradox in young people</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As revealed in Gallup’s report, young people have been more positive than anyone else for almost two decades, and were quickest to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels of feeling good. Even zooming in on the US, where youth anxiety and depression have <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/trend/archive/fall-2023/americas-mental-health-crisis\">increased</a> over the past <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/01/trends-improving-youth-mental-health\">two decades</a>, the Gallup report says that whatever’s been going on, positive experiences are still more pervasive among the young than anyone else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of this discrepancy could boil down to methodology. The survey defines “young” as anyone between the ages of 15 and 30. The report contains no data on adolescents younger than 15, which is where a good deal of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health\">youth mental health crisis</a> (which seems mostly confined, curiously, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/mental-health-crisis-anglosphere-depressed/678724/\">to English-speaking countries</a>) is happening.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it’s still pretty interesting that young people between the ages of 15 and 30 show up as consistently more positive and resilient than any other group. Where is the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23632673/against-doomerism\">specter of doomerism</a> we keep hearing about?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For example, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519621002783\">a 2021 global survey</a> of 10,000 young people aged 16-25 found that 75 percent think the “future is frightening,” 55 percent agree that “the things I most value will be destroyed,” and 56 percent agree that “humanity is doomed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stack these two surveys next to each other —&nbsp;positive emotions are pervasive among a majority of young people, but they also think that everything around them is going to shit — and you get a tension that looks oddly like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/11/20/23964535/labor-market-employment-inflation-sentiment-economy-bad-polls\">the vibecession</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beneath the headlines of the vibecession,&nbsp;describing the still <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/opinion/biden-trump-vibecession.html\">ongoing</a> paradox of an economy that is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/11/20/23964535/labor-market-employment-inflation-sentiment-economy-bad-polls\">really good</a> on paper but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-annie-lowrey.html\">really bad</a> according to the people living in it,&nbsp;something more nuanced seems to be going on. People are reporting that they’re personally doing fine. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/american-economy-negative-perception-inflation/661149/\">It’s everything else</a> — the local economy, the national economy — that’s terrible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The global emotions paradox seems similar. The prevailing mood looks something like: “I’m fine, but humanity is doomed.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The wealth of emotions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Projects that try to expand our repertoire of indicators that tell us <em>something</em> about how we’re doing as a civilization are worth celebrating. But we should also make sure we learn our lesson from the GDP days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What makes a fixation on GDP <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/key-ideas/\">problematic</a> has little to do with an error or bias in the measure itself. It’s a very useful measure of economic activity (and really does track pretty well <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23862090/subjective-wellbeing-wealth-philanthropy-gdp-happiness-givewell\">with life satisfaction</a>). But even the guy who created it, economist Simon Kuznets, <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/natincome_1934/19340104_nationalinc.pdf\">warned in 1934</a> that “the welfare of a nation can &#8230; scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, GDP became shorthand for progress, warping it into something it was never meant to be. Similarly, surveys that try to keep track of the intangible aspects of societal health are wonderful complements to GDP. But the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24125481/consciousness-mental-health-language-science-ineffable-math\">intangibles of the mind</a>, by their very definition, resist measurement. If I felt <a href=\"http://e\">the most intense, pure, concentrated form of bliss</a> I’d ever known yesterday, could a survey question really capture that? Which is to say, we should hold these results lightly, and look at well-being from other perspectives, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even so, the emotions survey is already turning up a handful of mysteries to explore. Why are none of the most highly developed countries rich in positive emotions? Are young people doing a bit better than we thought? What lessons in governance for well-being might we learn from Paraguay, or Finland?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We could be coming out of a time when metrics like GDP fixated us on building societies that <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/\">look good on paper</a>. By turning intangible stuff into tractable data points, however imperfectly, maybe these kinds of surveys will help turn our attention toward judging and designing societies based on how it actually feels to be a part of them, scrutinizing the direct emotional experience of being enmeshed in their cities, people, technologies, and landscapes. Maybe then, we can all join the young in their apparently resilient and positive experiences of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

His Hindi film debut, <em>Udta Punjab</em>, was all the rage, only a year after his <em>Sardaar Ji</em> became one of the top-grossing Punjabi films of all time. His single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-DhwN87JDY\">“Do You Know,”</a> a slow jam-esque love song, was an enormous hit. He served as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Star_(Indian_TV_series)\">judge of a reality TV singing show</a> and had an <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/diljit-dosanjh-begins-dream-tour-gets-houseful-response-on-his-first-gig-4645683/\">international tour</a> in the works. “I have barely begun,” he told me then. “This is nothing.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, seven years later, the 40-year-old powerhouse is the first musical artist from India to perform on <em>The Tonight Show</em>, entering American homes like few artists from the country have before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dosanjh breaks new ground in cinema and music on the regular, and at a breakneck pace — he’s collaborated with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jADTdg-o8i0?si=U8VPJAVlUr6ryodG\">Sia</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3JABJHlY4Tw?si=Dqh8Br8rGy-dTkjv\">Saweetie</a>, and more. Almost a year after his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o0QGw1LZpxM?si=glAGRpD02-qSB_YJ\">Coachella debut</a>, he <a href=\"https://ca.billboard.com/music/concerts/diljit-dosanjh-bc-place\">sold out Vancouver’s BC Place this</a> April — with a 54,000-strong crowd. Dosanjh’s ongoing Dil-Luminati tour is packing venues all across the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dosanjh also stands out beyond entertainment. If you’re familiar with India’s current political climate, you’ll appreciate the boldness of his vehement support for the farmer protests. In an arena that has become <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24160779/inside-indias-secret-campaign-to-threaten-and-harass-americans\">increasingly hostile toward outspoken critics</a>, he’s boosted calls from farmers to <a href=\"https://x.com/diljitdosanjh/status/1333662799424196608?lang=en\">repeal laws threatening their livelihoods</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Who is this man, who in one performance had <em>The Tonight Show</em> audience totally rapt and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C8VsqKCs5E6/\">Jimmy Fallon backstage speaking Punjabi</a>? And how, from among the scores of talented Indian artists, did he reach this level of success?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">A boy from rural Punjab makes it big</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">India is a country of film and music dynasties, but Dosanjh hails from a small village without family connections to the entertainment scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At only 11 years old, Dosanjh was sent from his village of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosanjh_Kalan\"> Dosanjh Kalan</a> to the Punjab city of Ludhiana. There he started his music career singing Sikh religious hymns called kirtans<em> </em>at local Gurdwaras, the Sikh place of worship. Although he left his village, his village never left him. Born Daljit Singh, Diljit adopted Dosanjh as a surname later in life, a sign of pride and a reminder of where his roots lie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thanks to early collaborators who saw the spark of young talent, Dosanjh moved on to embrace Punjabi pop. Diljit remembers shooting his first music video titled “Ishq Da Uda Ada,” which roughly translates to “The ABCs of Love,” at age 17. The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O7C-Yu-k6JE?si=gfJ0cU6-EMC4zSI7\">video</a> showed Dosanjh learning to speak “pop star” as he appeared on-screen for the very first time. It’s hard to recognize that baby-faced man in the low-budget, early-2000s music video. In <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YOQDM3kXVCY?si=UBMxXAd-LzBw7Cs_\">my latest interview with him</a>, which took place the day after his Fallon performance, Dosanjh said that kid doesn’t exist anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2156475337_4d0459.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.430930326218,100,79.138139347563\" alt=\"Diljit Donsanjh on a red carpet to promote his latest Punjabi film Jatt &amp; Juliet 3 in Mumbai last month with actresses Jasmin Bajwa and Neeru Bajwa.\" title=\"Diljit Donsanjh on a red carpet to promote his latest Punjabi film Jatt &amp; Juliet 3 in Mumbai last month with actresses Jasmin Bajwa and Neeru Bajwa.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Dosanjh promotes his latest Punjabi film &lt;em&gt;Jatt &amp; Juliet 3&lt;/em&gt; in Mumbai last month. | Sujit Jaiswal/AFP\" data-portal-copyright=\"Sujit Jaiswal/AFP\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eight years after that first album, Dosanjh starred in his debut film, <em>The Lion of Punjab</em>. In India, visible success in music often acts as a natural pipeline into movie roles where, with luck and talent, artists can find a wider audience and greater fame.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For those unfamiliar with the expansive cinematic landscape of India, you’ve likely heard of “Bollywood” — but that moniker applies only to Hindi-language cinema. In reality, there are as many film industries in India as there are languages. The Punjabi independent film industry is nearly 90 years old. Calling all Indian movies “Bollywood” is as blasphemous as saying “naan bread” (naan means bread) or using the words “chai tea latte” together in a sentence (chai means tea).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, Hindi cinema <em>does</em> command a huge audience, if not the largest, in India. In 2016, after 13 years as a successful musician, and five as a major Punjabi movie star, Dosanjh finally stepped into the Bollywood arena. In his first Hindi film, the star-studded <em>Udta Punjab</em> produced by some of the biggest names in Hindi cinema, Dosanjh played a police officer slowly coming to understand the extent of rampant drug use in the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Udta Punjab</em>’s director Abhishek Chaubey wanted to cast someone fresh and unexpected. “Diljit’s name came up in conversation and I jumped at it,” he told me. “He was very popular in Punjab and the Indian diaspora abroad and was up and coming into the mainstream consciousness of India as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dosanjh heard the film was going into production and thought to himself, “This is a film about Punjab. I should be starring in it.” A few days later, the call came, asking him to join. Things like this happen to him a lot, he says. He seems to be a master of manifestation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since <em>Udta Punjab</em>, Dosanjh’s popularity has grown in unpredictable and exhilarating ways. Chart-topping albums one after another, umpteen singles, countless leading roles in Punjabi and Hindi films, sold-out concerts in venues around the world, and a growing social media presence that includes a very active <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@diljitdosanjh\">YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"KHUTTI | Official Music Video | Diljit Dosanjh x Saweetie\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JABJHlY4Tw?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid all of this, Dosanjh has never lost connection with his music. His most iconic work is lively and soulful, driven by Punjab’s traditional Bhangra beat, born from the hollow of a round drum known as a “dhol.” His efforts to take Punjabi pop international shine through everything from his lyrics to his clothing. “The Punjabi attire is more important to me than the songs I pick for a performance,” Diljit stressed to me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, Dosanjh became the <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/diljit-dosanjh-creates-history-becomes-first-punjabi-artist-to-perform-at-coachella-3952420\">first Punjabi artist to perform at Coachella</a>. Fans back home couldn’t stop making Instagram reels about this achievement. The spectacle made one thing clear: If there is a stage in the world worth conquering, Dosanjh is working his way toward it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How he uses his voice in a divided India</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike most celebrities in India, Dosanjh has been willing to comment on political issues. In today’s India, speaking out like this is considered a direct and vocal challenge to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/354424/india-election-results-2024-modi-congress-economy-democracy-liberalism\">ruling government</a> of Indian Prime Minister Narendra&nbsp;Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). One only needs to look at replies on X to see the level of harassment that kind of criticism can engender.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020 and 2021, despite India’s strictly enforced Covid-19 lockdown, the nation witnessed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers%27_protest\">largest-ever protests organized by farmers</a>, most of whom hailed from Haryana and Punjab, with many coming from a Sikh background like Dosanjh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among their demands, the farmers were asking for the revocation of recent Farm Laws passed by the Parliament of India. These laws in essence stand to turn their government-regulated market into an open market, subject to all the competition that implies, but are also an example of the government’s willingness to pass sweeping policies that affect people’s lives. Protests took place all over the country. The movement spread rapidly. <a href=\"https://x.com/rihanna/status/1356625889602199552?lang=en\">Rihanna tweeted about it</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Few celebrity voices from within India had anything to say. But not Dosanjh. He amplified the demonstrations through <a href=\"https://x.com/diljitdosanjh/status/1333662799424196608?lang=en\">social media</a>, visited the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDcCHvE70XY\">farmers</a>, and reportedly went as far as to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/diljit-dosanjh-donated-rs-1-crore-to-buy-winter-wear-for-protesting-farmers-punjabi-singer-singga/articleshow/79582451.cms\">support them monetarily</a>. This gained him fans and adversaries in equal measure. Most severely, he was labeled an anti-national separatist by Kangana Ranaut, a prominent <a href=\"https://www.zoomtventertainment.com/celebrity/article/kangana-ranaut-urges-diljit-dosanjh-to-admit-he-is-not-a-khalistani-after-latter-says-mai-tera-koi-jawab-ni-dena/715584\">actor-turned-politician</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The welfare and representation of the Sikh community has always been important to Dosanjh. In an interview, while talking about his 2022 Netflix release <em>Jogi</em>, Dosanjh insisted the journalist refer to the infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots\">Sikh Massacre</a> of 1984 as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8Jz_dl_WNgY?si=cniFlwiAPDUa8ltB\">genocide</a>. Not riots, genocide. Polite, but stern.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1251867888.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.3931135206327,100,81.213772958735\" alt=\"Fans watch Diljit Donsanjh&#039;s 2023 Coachella performance.\" title=\"Fans watch Diljit Donsanjh&#039;s 2023 Coachella performance.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The crowd at his 2023 Coachella performance. | Christina House/Los Angeles Times\" data-portal-copyright=\"Christina House/Los Angeles Times\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Dosanjh is willing to get political in his comments, much of his music takes a less weighty tack. “Can’t sing political songs. They’ll send me to prison!” joked Dosanjh when I asked him why that was. On top of Punjabi hip-hop and Bhangra mash-ups, he&#8217;s known for easy rhymes with catchy hooks. In “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mYWQ9dyBFlQ?si=6X2h6f4PQ5i6QWKJ\">Magic</a>,” he sings about a woman with “eyes like Coca-Cola,” and in “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mH_LFkWxpI0?si=O7wgh102QdhMwH7C\">Lover</a>,” he insists, “<a href=\"https://www.lyricstranslation.in/2021/08/lover-lyrics-in-english-translation.html\">I am your lover</a>, baby. I can’t recover now that I’ve taken one look at you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of his newer music depicts a high-flying lifestyle, one more reflective of the American hip-hop scene than his rural Indian roots. He’s got songs with titles like “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7xYQWvXu4QP9Zkmm864EIW?si=a0a7d240d8ca4291\">Caviar</a>,” “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6Zp8T8QuT8XK1gPPs68zRz?si=9fedc97480b44946\">Lamborghini</a>,” “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/5dUpL1UYXkjXqf55FrBLgr?si=829b9c262aa24b19\">High End</a>,” “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/46QbY78ha62aiu6gBgC7lS?si=e06df4d132bb4912\">GOAT</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4XxfOvudrnBRdlgzEaq1sd?si=70715485cb9a447a\">Born to Shine</a>,” the latter two of which he performed on <em>The Tonight Show</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dosanjh even has a song dedicated to Rihanna titled “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/fMnbqjcAXkM?si=jtLcYA-Qljkm11Qy\">Ri Ri</a>,” where he imagines the pop star decked out in a traditional Patiala suit worn by Punjabi women. He <a href=\"https://lyricsraag.com/riri-rihanna-song-diljit-dosanjh/\">sings</a> about wanting to attend a concert of hers, dressed in traditional Punjabi clothes himself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s worth digging a little deeper, though, to older songs in his repertoire, where you might be surprised to find a pious undertone. His 2013 album, simply titled “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5fHd1bizqjiFFoW9HSD09T\">Sikh</a>,” has eight tracks, each dedicated to spirituality and valor. He has also released other softer, more obviously <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MMUpUpZ-d2s?si=6sFeiQqv_4BWpIjm\">devotional songs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Diljit is a very, very mild-mannered person when you interact with him one-on-one,” Chaubey says. The sentiment is echoed by Imtiaz Ali, the latest Hindi filmmaker to have worked with Dosanjh, for the film <em>Amar Singh Chamkila</em>. The role of Chamkila fit Dosanjh perfectly: a Punjabi musician known for his catchy tunes, raucous lyrics, anti-establishment bent, and deep affection from his fans. Dosanjh “remains basic and simple in his approach,” Imtiaz observes. But don’t let the simplicity fool you, those still waters run way deep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Bridging cultures through music — and a sense of humor</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite film and music industries that generate billions of streams on any given day, Indian culture has little foothold in America. If you’re not yet buying my argument, consider this. My in-laws — suburban, middle class, white New Jerseyites — may have heard of Shah Rukh Khan but couldn’t name <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23592808/pathaan-shah-rukh-khan-bollywood\">one of his films</a>. They know <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytEP7D-e4e4\">Priyanka Chopra as a Jonas</a>. Regardless of its seemingly enormous success in the West, none of them have either heard of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23220275/rrr-netflix-tollywood-hindutva-caste-system-oscars-2023\"><em>RRR</em></a> or have one clue what a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/movies/rrr-song-naatu-naatu.html\">“Naatu Naatu”</a> is. (If you need to click away from this article to Google now, please just go on, come back quickly, and don’t admit it to anyone).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the US is a new frontier that Dosanjh has set his sights on, fans in India need not worry. At every new venue, “Punjabi aa gaye” (“Punjabis have arrived”) is Dosanjh’s rallying cry. Dosanjh now serves as an ambassador of Punjabi, and Indian, culture.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2157512914.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Diljit Dosanjh and Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show stage.\" title=\"Diljit Dosanjh and Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show stage.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Dosanjh with Jimmy Fallon on &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show.&lt;/em&gt; | Rosalind O&#039;Connor/NBC\" data-portal-copyright=\"Rosalind O&#039;Connor/NBC\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His refrain is heard, too, across his social media. Some of the most popular posts on his page are mini-vlogs he shoots in his free time. One viral video features Dosanjh engaged in friendly <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gfXL-0CwdGM?si=cg2lpUEVgu1n46KS\">banter with Alexa</a>, asking her to play his song, with the device repeatedly failing to understand his Punjabi accent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ever so playfully, the singer exposes how a certain kind of assimilative attitude is required of brown people when we go to America. By speaking naturally to no avail and then adopting the most comical, stereotypical American accent to get the job done, he flips the “outsider” narrative on its head. The virtual assistant tech, much like America, doesn’t know what it’s missing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I can confidently predict that Dosanjh — and a slew of other talent from India — will bring you an endless stream of vibrant, bass-heavy, dance-friendly, and uncompromisingly accented music and movies in years to come. Maybe you’ve already bought your ticket. But if not, as Dosanjh told me last week: “My answer remains the same. This is nothing. I have barely begun.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/weather/heat-wave-california.html\">a severe heat wave</a> forecasted to put many Californians through several consecutive days of triple-degree temperatures has gripped the West Coast. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These extreme weather events are notable for their ferocity and duration, and for how early in what climate scientists regard as “<a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/billion-dollar-disaster-seasons-2024\">the disaster season</a>” they have come. But the surprise is that they are not at all surprising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hurricane Beryl’s 165-mile winds this week marked the earliest point in the season on record that a tropical storm has reached this intensity. This is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate\">exactly in line</a> with what scientists have been predicting as climate change grows worse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ocean surface temperatures serve as the engine for hurricanes and the last year provided some of the hottest underwater temperatures we’ve ever seen. Normally, by early July, the ocean wouldn’t be warm enough to power a major hurricane like Beryl. But the Atlantic Ocean absorbed a tremendous amount of heat in the past year as the planet heated up to the hottest average temperature on record.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As my colleague Umair Irfan <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate\">wrote</a> yesterday: “The Atlantic Ocean has been gathering the raw materials for a raucous hurricane season for months and is now assembling them into major storms. Beryl is the Atlantic’s first big project for 2024.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And this is only the start of what’s poised to be an unprecedented season. In the coming months, more people are likely to be experiencing extreme conditions and climate disasters all around the world. The need for adaptations and solutions is more urgent than ever. And those solutions may very well come from a place that few would expect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Some of our most effective solutions are the simplest</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, there’s <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/we-are-indigenous-addressing-global-challenges-indigenous-knowledge\">been</a> a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tek/description.htm\">growing</a> appreciation for <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14022024/to-save-the-planet-traditional-indigenous-knowledge-is-indispensable/\">Indigenous</a> land stewardship and traditional knowledge. But what gets overlooked is that successfully managing those lands means that Indigenous people have already survived severe climate events and extreme weather.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Indigenous communities are leading the way in climate adaptations — from living alongside rapidly melting ice to building resilient coasts and community support networks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indigenous knowledge does not mean going back to “traditional” methods; it means evolving, a characteristic that has always been a part of Indigenous life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, we launched a new Vox Climate project, Changing With Our Climate, a limited series exploring Indigenous solutions to extreme weather rooted in history — and the future. Every month, we’ll be publishing one feature that centers an Indigenous community confronting extreme weather on the front lines. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/e/358597\">Our first story</a>, out today, by Aquinnah Wampanoag writer Joseph Lee, explains how Alaska Natives are responding to extreme heat in a place built on ice — one that is warming drastically faster than the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no easy fix for the planet. But Indigenous people have simple solutions rooted in the depth of their knowledge. These stories will not mythologize Indigenous communities with bespoke, unapproachable, or mystic traditional practices and solutions. The series, instead, underscores humility as a throughline: Indigenous people realize we cannot bend the world to our human will. We’re far better and more resilient when we tune in and lean into changes when possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Take Lee’s story on extreme heat, which we’ve excerpted below. For a landscape adapted to ice, “extreme” heat means a matter of just a few degrees. Alaska is <a href=\"https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/29/\">warming</a> up to three times faster than the rest of the world, and the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3\">Arctic</a> is warming nearly double that.

Thick, reliable sea ice is essential for harvesting whales, a key part of the subsistence diets, a lifestyle built around harvesting wild foods for personal and community use, of Point Hope’s Iñupiaq residents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Growing up, even when temperatures reached 40 below zero, Frankson would bundle up to go play outside in the snow or go hunting on the ice, while whales passed by. And on cold, cloudless nights, the northern lights would be spectacularly clear, flashing and dancing across the sky. It was a sight that Frankson said still seems too incredible to be real — even after years of observing it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But climate change is threatening all of this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alaska is <a href=\"https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/29/\">warming</a> up to three times faster than the rest of the world, and the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3\">Arctic</a> is warming nearly double that. Alaska’s North Slope, where Point Hope is located, saw an average annual temperature increase of <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/alaska-and-changing-climate#:~:text=Alaska%27s%20statewide%20annual%20average%20surface,to%20the%201981%E2%80%932010%20period\">6 degrees since 1971</a>. Since 1970, the US as a whole has warmed by 2.6 degrees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the difference between, say, a day that is 0 degrees and one that is 5 degrees may seem like no big deal, the impact of these rising averages is immense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sea ice is forming later in the year than usual and is not as predictable as it used to be. As the permafrost thaws, siġlauqs — the traditional ice cellars carved into the land — are caving in or flooding. The animals that people rely on for food and goods — whales, fish, caribou — are also growing harder to find.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-161120331.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.671533564388,100,78.656932871224\" alt=\"Point Hope, Aslaka.\" title=\"Point Hope, Aslaka.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Point Hope, Alaska. | Andy Cross/Denver Post via Getty Images.\" data-portal-copyright=\"Andy Cross/Denver Post via Getty Images.\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the challenges, Frankson, who researches the social impact of declining caribou populations, says that Iñupiaq people are not going to change their entire way of life, but instead are making small adjustments to changing conditions. “We’re not scared enough to stop hunting, we’re not scared enough to stop going out on the ice, we’re not scared enough to do any of this,” she said. “We’re just learning how to adapt, as we always have.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To adapt to the warming climate, Indigenous people in Alaska are relying on their deep understanding and respect for the land, a kind of humility developed over countless generations. “You can’t really change the Arctic,” Frankson said. “You can only change with the Arctic.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, daily life in Alaska — with its northern lights, its dependence on ice and the movement of caribou — may feel unrelatable. But this way of living in tune with the environment and gracefully adapting to a changing climate is becoming increasingly essential for the rest of the country. The strategies that Indigenous people in Alaska are developing show that sometimes the best forms of climate adaptation are achievable, local solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Generations of extreme conditions have equipped Alaska Natives with the willingness and ability to embrace this kind of adaptation. As the impacts of climate change grow increasingly severe in the rest of the country, we could all learn from that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Swimming may not seem like an adaptation to global warming. But in Alaska, it is.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hundreds of miles south of Point Hope, in Bethel, Alaska, the Kuskokwim River is the heart of the community, providing food, transportation, employment, and community throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only way to get to Bethel is by plane, which can be very expensive, or by the river. In the winter, snow machines zip through town, heading up and down the frozen river to the dozens of villages that depend on Bethel for food, supplies, health care, and much more. In the summer, people travel by boat to spend days at their fish camps on the river, smoking salmon to eat throughout the rest of the year. In between, when the ice is forming or beginning to break up, the river can be dangerous: too frozen for boats, but too unstable for snow machines and cars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“You can’t really change the Arctic. You can only change with the Arctic.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lately, those shoulder seasons have been shifting, extending, and becoming terrifyingly unpredictable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every year, flooding and erosion get worse, fish are dying, and the winter ice is becoming more dangerous. Kevin Whitworth, the executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.kuskosalmon.org/\">Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission</a>, says <a href=\"https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2023/divergent-responses-of-western-alaska-salmon-to-a-changing-climate/#:~:text=Changes%20in%20salmon%20abundance,2).\">declining salmon populations</a> are especially concerning. “It’s hard times,” he said. “Our people are subsistence-based people. They’re not economy-based people. They rely on the river as their grocery store. Their life is the river.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/subsistence/federal-subsistence-management-program\">Federal Subsistence Management Program</a>, rural Alaskans harvest 295 pounds of wild food per person, more than the 255 pounds of domestic meat, fish, and poultry that the average American consumes per year. Fifty-six percent of the statewide subsistence harvest is made up of fish. Beyond its cultural and community importance, subsistence is crucial for Alaska Natives because of the high cost of groceries. In a study of 261 urban communities across the country, the <a href=\"https://centerrec.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/DataProducts/EZyflv55hWZHmRzJ4EilYj8BxJOMVaxLqkaZvl49l9C9Wg?rtime=cx0dTDeV3Eg\">Council for Community and Economic Research</a> found that the three most expensive places for groceries were Juneau, Fairbanks, and Anchorage. Prices in more remote communities like Bethel are often even higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Salmon’s drastic decline can be attributed to a number of causes, including warming waters and increased offshore trawling. Every year, ocean trawlers fishing primarily for pollock catch, kill, and discard about 141 million pounds of salmon, halibut, and other species, an extraordinarily wasteful practice that <a href=\"https://salmonstate.org/press-releases/ak-fishing-groups-tribes-applaud-rep-peltolas-bycatch-bills\">Indigenous people and other groups</a> in Alaska have been rallying against. Meanwhile, communities upriver are severely limited in the number of salmon they can take from the river. “Right now, the salmon are crashing and we’re seeing big changes with the climate,” Whitworth says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bethel Vice Mayor Sophie Swope, who also sits on the <a href=\"https://nativecouncil.org/\">Orutsararmiut Native</a> tribal council, says that river conditions have become more dangerous for fishing and travel. “It used to be pretty dependable that you could just go drive out during the winter and it would be fine and safe,” Swope said. “Now, you have to keep an ear out for what the river conditions are.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whitworth, who is Athabascan from McGrath, says that because of salmon’s increasing scarcity, people are taking greater risks to get fish even though the river ice forms later in the season and is less reliable, leading to accidents and <a href=\"http://www.epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/b2023_08.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">drownings</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, facing declining salmon populations and a dangerous river, Indigenous people in the region are shifting their norms, too. While chinook and chum salmon are restricted, sockeye salmon, a less traditionally popular and available fish, has become an increasingly viable alternative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chinook has been a staple of Indigenous subsistence diets for generations, but people are doing what they must to use what is available now. Traditional salmon fishing techniques make it hard to separate different species of salmon, so Whitworth and the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission have been encouraging local fishers to use dip nets, large circular nets that allow people to target sockeye.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the commission’s <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5afdc3d5e74940913f78773d/t/65382f244a92ca079706dd80/1698180924749/Kuskokwim_EOS+Summary_final_linked+copy.pdf\">2023 end-of-season report</a>, sockeye made up about 40 percent of the estimated total salmon harvest on the lower Kuskokwim, a number that Whitworth says is much higher than it used to be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As warming continues to impact the river, the local community has also been taking steps to protect its people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2014, Yup’ik elder Beverly Hoffman and others finally succeeded in a <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/rural-alaska/article/bethels-first-pool-testament-perseverance-engineering-and-state-money/2014/09/21/\">decades-long effort</a> to build a community pool in Bethel, which is now a resource for people throughout the region to learn how to swim, preparing them for an increasingly unpredictable river. Hoffman and others recognize that they cannot control the river, but they can help prepare the community to survive its dangers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swimming lessons and dip nets might sound like tiny changes in the face of global climate trends, but these are the kinds of local adaptations that will help communities thrive in a warming world. Outside of Alaska, planting trees to create more shade in urban heat islands or hiring more <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/lifeguard-shortage-limits-reopening-of-nycs-grand-astoria-pool\">lifeguards</a> for public pools could have a similar impact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But these solutions are within reach and meaningful; they literally save lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such approachable adaptations mean understanding that although we have a limited ability to change the climate, there are many more options to change our own behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>“This is what Indigenous knowledge is</strong>”</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As temperatures continue to rise, Alaska Natives are turning to intergenerational knowledge and community observations to build a wealth of data that they hope will urge non-Indigenous decision-makers to listen to what they have to say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Unalaska, the largest city in the Aleutian Chain, the Qawalangin Tribe is gathering community feedback on climate change and what the people are experiencing. The tribe will then use these observations to help develop its climate resilience plans, which include <a href=\"https://www.qawalangin.com/camp-q\">culture camps</a> with traditional dances and classes on kayak making, traditional food nights, and water quality testing programs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vera Metcalf is the executive director of the <a href=\"https://eskimowalruscommission.org/\">Eskimo Walrus Commission</a>, which represents 19 coastal communities. Metcalf says that Indigenous walrus hunters have adapted to climate change by participating in research projects led by agencies like the US Fish and Wildlife Service. “In the past, we were largely ignored in research occurring in our homeland and waters,” she said. “When you combine the two ways of thinking, it really becomes a rich resource of information.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Changing With Our Climate: A limited series exploring Indigenous solutions to extreme weather rooted in history — and the future</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no easy fix for the planet, but Indigenous people have simple solutions rooted in the depth of their knowledge. This story is the first installment of a new Vox series exploring frameworks for responding to extreme weather and the climate crisis. Every month through October, we’ll be publishing a new feature that centers an Indigenous community responding to various aspects of climate disasters, from major storms like hurricanes and typhoons, to extreme heat, rising seas, wildfires, and spreading aridity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roberta Tuurraq Glenn-Borade, Iñupiaq from Utqiaġvik, is the project coordinator and community liaison at the <a href=\"https://arctic-aok.org/\">Alaska Arctic Observatory and Knowledge Hub</a>, where she works with observers from four communities in the Alaskan Arctic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/30d30ab062ea4aadb39b3734dd7770ae\">Community observers</a> share details like air temperature, wind speed, ice conditions, and animal observations, sometimes sending in photos of animals being harvested. Glenn-Borade and her team then take this data and share it with agencies like the US National Weather Service, which releases forecasts for the region. Glenn-Borade says that, historically, these forecasts prioritized larger ships offshore rather than Indigenous people living on the coast and hopes that using local observations will lead to better forecasts for Indigenous communities. “That kind of foresight of what the conditions will be can really make a difference between life or death,” she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Glenn-Borade also says this kind of local observation provides invaluable historical context about how the coast and the ice have changed over the years, what is within normal ranges, and what is unexpected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That’s what Indigenous knowledge is,” she said. “It is constant tracking and understanding and monitoring what’s going on and being prepared to respond on the fly.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the world warms, these examples from Alaska offer a warning that we can’t simply do everything the way we used to. Saudi Arabia, for example, can no longer ignore the deadly impacts heat is having on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/356624/hajj-mecca-heat-saudi-arabia-pilgrims-climate-change-prophet\">Hajj</a>. Places like the Pacific Northwest can no longer count on mild summers and will save <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/new-count-of-states-past-heat-wave-deaths-give-a-warning-to-the-pnw/\">lives</a> by investing in cooling infrastructure. But they also offer hope that if we can shift away from trying to change the environment to suit us, instead of the other way around, there may be a chance of finding creative, unexpected ways of changing with our climate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I spoke with Glenn-Borade recently, she told me she and her people are proud “that we’re still here. We’re not going to die off. Our languages aren’t going to die off. We will adapt. We’ll continue to adapt our lifestyles as the environment changes.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But after Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">disastrous performance</a> at Thursday night’s debate, Harris becoming the Democratic nominee is suddenly a more serious hypothetical — and the clamor is growing. More Democrats are <a href=\"https://x.com/mychaelschnell/status/1808180662945321366\">questioning</a> whether Biden should remain at the top of the ticket; one 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, former <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-should-democratic-nominee-president-2024-opinion-1919894\">Rep.

Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, have defended the president, while backing Harris as his replacement <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-clyburn-declares-support-kamala-harris-dem-nominee-biden-has-bow-out-i-support-her\">should the need arise</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Post-debate polling has bolstered the pro-Harris argument: In the <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/6/29/in-post-debate-poll-voters-think-biden-is-too-old-to-be-president-yet-alternative-candidates-perform-similarly-against-trump\">three</a> <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24787646/cnn-poll.pdf\">post-debate</a> <a href=\"https://puck.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SUNDAY_Post-Debate_Landscape_2024_06_30__1_-1.pdf\">polls</a>, Harris appears to be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024\">in a stronger position</a> to win the White House than she was before Thursday. She either performs the same as Biden against Trump or does better, running essentially even with Trump in the <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24787646/cnn-poll.pdf\">latest CNN poll</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before considering what that would actually look like, it’s helpful to take stock of her vice presidency — and vice presidential candidacy — so far. Despite<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/27/23655248/kamala-harris-vice-president-approval-criticism\"> frequent criticisms</a> and confusion surrounding what exactly her job is, she is now emerging as an indispensable surrogate and defender,&nbsp;and maybe even successor. She hasn’t been a particularly groundbreaking vice president, but she has had moments on the campaign trail, albeit overlooked by the public and the press, when she is able to showcase her value. It’s a preview of how her role could change in the coming months and even years, whether or not Biden steps aside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thursday night was one of those times. As shocked and panicked reactions from Democratic operatives and the political press began to pour in post-debate, Harris was dispatched to defend Biden on CNN and MSNBC. She admitted that Biden had a “slow start,” but rounded that answer off by playing up a “strong finish” by the president. She went on offense: attacking Trump for his many lies during the debate and emphasizing Trump’s statements in defense of the January 6 insurrection and refusal to accept the results of the election.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the process, she surprised a host of pundits <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-debate-trump-biden-06-27-24/index.html\">who wondered</a> why the White House has “kept her under wraps for three years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answer is complicated.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harris’s vice presidency has been muted by design</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike Biden’s tenure under former President Barack Obama, Harris’s role as vice president has been low-key. For most of her term, she’s been relegated to warm-up speaker and occasional Biden stand-in, delivering remarks at White House events with the president, attending summits and visiting foreign leaders when Biden is needed in DC or on another trip, or, like Thursday night, brought in to do clean-up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of those back-seat responsibilities have been due to the nature of the vice presidency: a constitutional office without any clear authorities beyond being a spare body in the event the president can’t do his job and being an extra vote when the US Senate is evenly tied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But some of it appears to have been intentional. Vice presidents have exerted influence and power before. Vice President Dick Cheney essentially ran foreign policy for a few years during George W. Bush’s first term. Biden himself was given a large mandate by Obama during the government’s response to the Great Recession, administering hundreds of billions of dollars in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/06/828303824/a-look-back-at-how-joe-biden-managed-the-2009-stimulus-package\">federal stimulus spending</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris got no such assignments, despite Biden suggesting that he wanted his second-in-command to be a governing “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/kamala-harris-working-partnership/index.html\">partner</a>” during the 2020 campaign season. Questions about this have dogged Harris. Just nine months into Biden’s term, after waves of negative media coverage, public absence, staff departures, and rhetorical missteps (which have now become a <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree\">genre of meme</a>), the White House issued a <a href=\"https://x.com/PressSec/status/1460070063025831936?s=20\">statement</a> assuring the public that the president did rely on Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By that point, the idea that Harris served a superfluous role was already baking into public and media perception. Instead of working on issues like criminal-justice reform and policing — her areas of expertise —<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html\"> she took on voting rights</a>, an issue that was doomed to fail in an evenly divided Senate. Her portfolio was then filled with another cursed assignment: dealing with the root causes of migration from Latin America. Mainstream <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-3400f56255e000547d1ca3ce1aa6b8e9\">press coverage</a> of that task, and Republican framing of it online and in right-wing media, made it seem like her job would be dealing with immigration and the southern border, however. That fog made her an easier target for Republicans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, something changed in 2022: When the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception\">overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a> that summer and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, Harris suddenly had a clear lane in which to operate, and she has taken it: being the Biden administration’s <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/08/abortion-rights-fight-gives-kamala-harris-a-chance-to-lead.html\">point person</a> on conservative threats to reproductive rights.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Campaign-trail Harris has shown how much of an asset she could be</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Post-<em>Dobbs</em> and since the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23448972/midterms-results-democrats-senate-red-wave\">generally</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23439022/midterm-elections-2022-results-charts-maps-takeaways\">successful</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/27/23475262/midterm-elections-2022-results-red-wave-democrats\">midterms</a> that followed later that same year, Harris’s official role has shifted. She’s been on more foreign visits and to gatherings of NATO and allied leaders, headlined a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/07/vice-president-harris-launches-nationwide-fight-for-our-freedoms-college-tour-to-mobilize-students-and-young-people-in-the-fight-for-their-rights/\">national college tour</a>, and embarked on two other nationwide tours: one this winter dedicated to raising awareness of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/19/vice-president-kamala-harris-launches-reproductive-freedoms-tour/\">threats to reproductive freedom</a> (it kicked off on the 51<sup>st</sup> anniversary of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>) and another this spring focused on “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/vice-president-kamala-harris-launches-nationwide-economic-opportunity-tour/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20Vice%20President%20Kamala%20Harris,has%20the%20freedom%20to%20thrive.\">economic opportunity</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tours, though events run out of the White House, served a campaign function as well. The stops were concentrated in swing states, and meant to reach a swath of core Democratic constituencies that Harris may be better positioned to speak to like young voters and college students, women, Black and Latino Americans, and working-class communities. Unlike Biden, who has been struggling with voters from all of these backgrounds, Harris is a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/18/1239107278/vp-harris-takes-to-the-road-to-convince-voters-to-give-biden-another-term\">natural communicator</a> in these settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The change in these official duties has also resulted in a shift in her campaign role, especially as the primary season wrapped up this spring and the general election began. She made history, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/kamala-harris-abortion-clinic.html\">the White House said</a>, when she visited and toured an abortion clinic in Minneapolis in March, and has since delivered <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?534902-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-arizona-abortion-rights\">campaign speeches</a> in states that have taken measures to restrict abortion access, like <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-travels-florida-6-week-abortion-ban/story?id=109704247\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/04/10/abortion-arizona-law-ban-kamala-harris\">Arizona</a>, both when the state’s top court allowed a century-old abortion ban go into effect and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUzB0GURNQ\">again</a> on the second anniversary of <em>Dobbs</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s also been zeroing in on other progressive priorities like <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-03-23/kamala-harris-to-tour-blood-stained-building-where-2018-florida-school-massacre-happened\">gun safety</a>, <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/kamala-harris-philadelphia-visit-student-loan-relief/\">student loan forgiveness</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/kamala-harris-gaza-speech-watered-down-cease-fire-rcna141750\">war in Gaza</a>. She’s been engaging media and giving many more interviews than Biden, appearing as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/podcasts/the-run-up-kamala-harris-interview.html\">guest</a> on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnTpTTKeeTg\">popular</a><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kamala-harris/id1521578868?i=1000488347134\"> podcasts</a>, TV shows like <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-05-01/drew-barrymore-kamala-harris-mamala-internet-backlash\"><em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3-KA8ja6g\"><em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94QBUk_-IPg\">online</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFJJxvlAVkE\">talk shows</a> to discuss the White House and the Biden campaign’s priorities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s filling the void that Biden has created intentionally (because of his age) or not (because he is also president, governing the country). Thursday night’s interviews, and whatever appearances she will have to make to defend Biden, show us what is likely to come: an expanded role for the veep in this term and a theoretical next.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biden will need it&nbsp;and Democrats should want it, in the event that Harris has to step up to win the election, govern the nation, or just be a solid backup — precisely as the vice presidency is supposed to work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Update July 2, 5:45 pm ET:</strong> <em>This story, published June 28, has been updated to include new polling on Kamala Harris and Democratic calls for her to replace Biden as the party&#8217;s nominee.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

CR: FX.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Season three of <em>The Bear</em>, the Hulu darling that critics previously called  “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/20/1105979840/review-fx-the-bear\">funny, raw, real</a>” and “an <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/23180124/the-bear-hulu-fx-restaurant-show-review\">authentic, breakneck look at restaurant life</a>,” did not bring its best this time around. The New York Times deemed it a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/arts/television/the-bear-season-3.html\">“clanging, wailing beast</a>,” Variety said it was “<a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/tv-reviews/the-bear-season-3-review-fx-1236049732/\">aimless</a>,” and Vulture declared the third installment “<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/the-bear-season-3-review.html\">trapped</a>.” I agree — and I blame the food. “The dishes have really taken a back seat in this season,” Amy McCarthy, a writer for Eater who recently <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2024/6/27/24187398/the-bear-season-3-review-hulu-fx\">reviewed this season</a>, explains. “That’s maybe part of why it feels so messy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In its early seasons, <em>The Bear</em> was exciting because it had culinary oomph. The setting was the Original Beef of Chicagoland, an unpredictable world where anything could happen. You were drawn in by the Italian beef, cuddled in bread, smeared with spicy giardiniera, soaked in jus. When Tina (Liza Colón-Zayas) discovered she had what it took to be a serious chef by making mashed potatoes, you wanted to dip a spoon in the pot. Watching Marcus (Lionel Boyce) perfect his chocolate cake was a peaceful meditation within the chaos of the restaurant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So this season, I kept waiting for the food to get intimate and come alive. Where was the French omelet that Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) lovingly made for pregnant Nat (Abby Elliott) in season two, with potato chips on top? Marcus’s doughnut he lovingly toiled on to a level of precise excellence in season one? The explosive and disastrous Feast of the Seven Fishes, a traumatic family memory that Carmy Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) repurposed into a masterpiece? In the first two seasons, through the food, you understood why someone might want to cook and learn with this team, despite the dysfunction that swirled around Carmy’s grieving, obsessive perfectionism and the rest of his staff’s conflicts. The stress of the environment was a byproduct of the love they had for their craft, and it forged a family bond. But, as McCarthy says, “There is no omelet this season. There’s none of that.” (Spoilers follow for season three.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In season three, it’s no longer the Original Beef of Chicagoland. It’s a high-end restaurant called The Bear. And the food is, I’m sorry to say, mindlessly boring. In some scenes, you can tell the writers want it to be that way. Plate after plate of pretentious dishes are sent out to the refrain of Sydney or Carmy shouting “Doors!” or seen in flashbacks, like one where Carmy shells peas for hours while training in a high-end restaurant. It’s a montage of food porn à la the satirical <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/23458693/review-the-menu-2022-movie-ralph-fiennes-anya-taylor-joy-release-date\"><em>The Menu</em></a>, with no cohesiveness or narrative at play other than “this is what fancy restaurants do. That’s why we are doing it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today’s fine dining is often confusing, overrated, and, yes, boring. That can be a story, but it’s not one by itself. I get that the cold, formulaic dishes of this season were probably meant to show viewers that this rarefied world can grind down its chefs and disconnect them from the joy of the work. But by presenting Carmy’s dishes again and again with few others from the more culinarily inspired characters — chefs who are newer, fresher, less jaded — the show abandons food as a main character<em>. </em>I’m not sure the writers realized that for many viewers, food was their<em> </em>favorite character. “Many characters have half-finished arcs,” Ahmed Ali Akbar, a James Beard award-winning food writer at the Chicago Tribune, says of this season. “And the food is one of them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the food stopped being exciting, the show followed suit. Instead of being a show about how cooking and eating bring people together, it became like the same old <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/new-american-fusion-language-debate\">New American tasting menu fare</a>. It reminded me of the RS Benedict essay “<a href=\"https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/\">Everyone is beautiful and no one is horny</a>,” about the stripping of authentic sexuality and sensuality from film. Except in <em>The Bear</em>, every dish is beautiful and no one is hungry (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-bear-season-3-wont-serve-up-a-carmy-and-sydney-romance\">or horny, for that matter</a> but that’s a different article). </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Bear-E301_Still002_db6874.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4750998734523,100,93.049800253095\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps worse, no one seems to care. When a newspaper wants the staff to replicate a duck dish for a photoshoot, no one can even remember which duck dish the newspaper is talking about because they’ve made about 10 different versions in a single month — Carmy decided to change the menu every day because for some reason, he believes this will earn them a Michelin star and not ridicule and ruin. There’s a closeness without intimacy, both between the characters and between the dishes they break themselves to make, which is claustrophobic and unpleasant to watch. “The anxiety of it all just feels gratuitous,” says McCarthy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a food writer, my favorite restaurants have a reason<em> </em>for being there and something to say. Maybe they serve <a href=\"https://www.stlmag.com/dining/lowry-on-bulrush/\">foraged plants and hunted meat</a> from the Ozarks, maybe they’re a <a href=\"https://chicago.eater.com/2023/4/17/23686435/thattu-south-indian-restaurant-avondale-kerala-photos-images\">South Indian restaurant with a hyperfocus on Keralese cuisine</a>, maybe they want to evoke your <a href=\"https://chicago.eater.com/2020/10/6/21504325/big-kids-sandwich-restaurant-logan-square-chicago-carryout-1990s-nostaliga-menu\">’90s childhood</a>, or maybe the <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/owamni-indigenous-food-lab-minneapolis-6834358\">Indigenous chef wants to remind you we should all be eating crickets</a>. <em>The Bear</em> has no such draw; no real culinary philosophy besides a vague pursuit of greatness, based upon the reign of one mercurial white male auteur. It’s not at all reflective of the culinary world we currently live in, one that cares about heritage, stories, and sustainability. McCarthy points out that the show had previously gotten away from the “Carmy is a genius” angle by “talking about the culinary partnership between Carmy and Sydney,” but we don&#8217;t get that in the third season.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This season brings me to the question: What was so bad about just doing sandwiches? Sandwiches are great, and as a starting block for a restaurant, they have so much room for creativity. “In general, I’ve always felt like the Italian beef exploration has been kind of poor,” says Ali Akbar. “They have whole scenes discussing philosophies about fine dining, what service means, what cooking means, but they almost spent no time with what a sandwich means or why a sandwich can be meaningful to somebody.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The show keeps reminding us that the Italian beef window run solely by Ebraheim is the only thing making them money, but there’s no real discussion of what that profitability means about where they should go creatively with the food. “They&#8217;re leaning a little too hard on the idea that the best treats in the world are all the most expensive &#8230; but at the same time, the Italian beef is just seen as a way to make money,” notes Ali Akbar, adding that he thinks Italian beef is an invention of culinary genius and one of the classic Chicago dishes he’s most in love with. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lack of culinary purpose seems to be why this season is so &#8230; boring. “Carmy’s culinary philosophy just seems to be ‘excellence,’” McCarthy says, adding that she thinks for him to move past his obsession with this kind of fine cuisine, he needs to “find some joy.” Ali Akbar points out that the Seven Fishes dish in season two and Carmy’s pasta experiments this season do point to a culinary philosophy rooted in his Italian family, but then “he goes to this dark place [and] relies on this training from the person he hates the most, the chef played by Joel McHale &#8230; And he becomes that person.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet again, it’s an intentional choice by the writers, but one that grows weary with no real creative counterpoint from characters like Sydney or Marcus. “You can’t do that fun, creative cooking when you’re miserable,” says McCarthy. “His menu reflects his emotional state in a way that isn’t really explored.” The show’s apparent thesis — that it’s hard and miserable getting to the top — is exactly what is dragging <em>The Bear </em>down.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

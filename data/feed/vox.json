Skrmetti</em></a>, arguably the most important trans rights case the justices have ever heard. <em>Skrmetti</em> asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution, a question the Court has never answered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A decision against the trans plaintiffs in <em>Skrmetti</em>, moreover, could potentially upend the entire legal framework protecting Americans from gender discrimination of all kinds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A Court with a 6-3 Republican supermajority plans to hear <em>Skrmetti</em> in early December, less than a month after an election in which, according to the Washington Post, GOP campaigns “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/05/election-trans-sports-trump-campaign/\">spent at least $215 million</a> on network ads that paint trans people as a menace to society.” President-elect Donald Trump made <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-transgender-politics-61cff97a64fac581ffc5f762be4c57d3\">anti-trans rhetoric a key part of his campaign</a>, promising, for example, that if elected, he would keep “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women’s sports.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is to say: This case arrives at a moment in which the Republican Party is all in on animus toward transgender people. And, while there are strong legal arguments supporting the pro-trans rights position in <em>Skrmetti</em>, this panel of justices has shown <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/371361/supreme-court-call-republican-justices-republicans\">great deference to the general mood of the Republican Party</a> in past decisions, like when they ruled that Trump may <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\">use his official presidential powers to commit crimes once he returns to office</a>. If the Court’s Republican majority is determined to reach an anti-trans result, they likely won’t let something as trivial as “the law” discourage them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, at least two of the Court’s Republicans have shown unexpected sympathy toward LGBTQ litigants in the past. In <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15591206893890926746&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em></a> (2020), the Court ruled that a longstanding ban on sex discrimination in employment prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity — declaring that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Bostock</em> was authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, who is also a Republican. So, if Roberts and Gorsuch hold to the views they expressed in <em>Bostock</em>, the two of them plus the three Democratic justices should be enough to extend at least some constitutional protection to trans people.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s at stake in <em>Skrmetti</em>?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The specific issue in <em>Skrmetti </em>is a Tennessee law prohibiting trans youth from receiving medical treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. About <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/371341/supreme-court-new-term-transgender-ghost-guns-porn-vapes\">half of states</a> have laws targeting transgender health care, but Tennessee’s is among the strictest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Court has never held specifically that discrimination against transgender people violates the Constitution, it has long held that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/9/18/20917757/justice-ginsburg-ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies\">sex discrimination does violate the Constitution</a>, ruling that “<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">all gender-based classifications</a>” are presumptively unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Virginia</em> (1996).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tennessee’s law trips over itself to classify young patients based on their gender. It declares that the law’s purpose is to “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-101-findings\">encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex</a>” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.” The law also denies certain medical treatments to patients based solely on their sex. A patient who was assigned male at birth may have testosterone prescribed by a doctor, but someone assigned female at birth may not have that treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Again, the Supreme Court has already said that <em>all </em>gender-based classifications are constitutionally dubious. “All” means “all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Will that be enough to persuade these justices to strike down Tennessee&#8217;s law? The honest answer is, “Who knows?” It’s not like legal texts and Supreme Court precedents play no role in these justices’ decision-making, and they sometimes even hand down a decision like <em>Bostock</em> that cuts strongly against the Republican Party’s policy preferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are two reasons to be pessimistic about <em>Skrmetti</em>. One is that after the recent election, anti-trans voices within the Court are likely to be emboldened, and pro-trans voices may feel like they have limited political capital. The other is that, while Tennessee’s law clearly discriminates on the basis of sex, the Court has only held that laws that do so should be presumed to be unconstitutional unless — as the Court put it in <em>Virginia — </em>there’s an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for the law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is possible that this Court will hold that a ban on trans health care meets this bar.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What current law says about “sex” discrimination, explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of federal law’s core safeguards against sex discrimination emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in the ’60s, Congress started to pass laws banning sex discrimination in various venues — Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/15/21291515/supreme-court-bostock-clayton-county-lgbtq-neil-gorsuch\">prohibits such discrimination in employment</a>. Then, in the 1970s, the Court began to place constitutional limits on the government’s ability to discriminate on the basis of sex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most significant of these cases, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2528522570594071994&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Craig v. Boren</em></a> (1976), established that any government action that classifies people based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional. Again, in <em>Virginia, </em>the Court stated that “a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an ‘<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">exceedingly persuasive justification</a>’ for the classification.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The federal appeals court that heard <em>Skrmetti</em> attempted to get around <em>Craig</em> and <em>Virginia</em> by pointing to the Supreme Court’s decision in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4447817874641898447&amp;q=geduldig+v.+aiello&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,47&amp;as_vis=1\"><em>Geduldig v. Aiello</em></a> (1974). But that decision read <em>Geduldig </em>far too broadly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Briefly, <em>Geduldig</em> concerned a state-run insurance program that provided benefits to some California workers with disabilities, but not to workers whose disabilities arose out of a pregnancy. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that this exclusion for pregnant workers discriminated on the basis of sex, even though the Court wrote that “only women can become pregnant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Geduldig</em>, it should be noted, is not a particularly beloved decision. Four years after it was handed down, Congress enacted the <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/pregnancy-discrimination-act-1978\">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a>, which repudiated <em>Geduldig</em> in the workplace and forbade employers from discriminating on the basis of pregnancy. Regardless, <em>Geduldig</em>’s holding was limited. It established that the government may set up public benefit programs that exclude medical procedures “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/l-w-v-skrmetti-3\">that only one sex can undergo</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Skrmetti</em>, by contrast, involves medical procedures that both sexes can undergo. Anyone can take puberty blockers, testosterone, or estrogen. It is not physically impossible to administer testosterone to someone assigned female at birth in the same way that it is physically impossible for a person without a uterus to become pregnant.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Not all sex discrimination is forbidden</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the Court’s decisions in <em>Craig</em> and <em>Virginia</em>, it should be obvious that Tennessee&#8217;s law draws distinctions based on sex and thus can only survive if the state can offer an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for it. Indeed, if the Court were to reject that conclusion, it would do considerable violence to the legal principles governing all gender discrimination cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, even if the Court honors the <em>Craig</em>/<em>Virginia</em> framework, Tennessee’s law could potentially survive if five of the justices deem the state’s arguments for the law sufficiently persuasive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The briefs in the <em>Skrmetti</em> case paint two very different pictures of why medical professionals treat transgender patients with puberty blockers or hormones. A <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323551/20240827210326240_23-477tsUnitedStates.pdf\">brief filed by the Biden administration</a>, for example, warns that the absence of these treatments can lead patients with gender dysphoria (the medical term for the distress that can result when someone’s gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth) to “‘debilitating distress,’ ‘depression,’ ‘substance use,’ ‘self-injurious behaviors,’ and ‘even suicide.’” One <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm\">survey</a> referenced in the brief found that more than one-third of transgender high school students attempted suicide in the last 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This view, which presents gender-affirming treatments as a way to prevent suicide and alleviate the harms of gender dysphoria, is supported by briefs filed by medical and mental health groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323885/20240903123631640_23-477%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20American%20Psychological%20Association%20et%20al..pdf\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323885/20240903123631640_23-477%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20American%20Psychological%20Association%20et%20al..pdf\">American Psychological Association</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323964/20240903155151548_23-477%20tsac%20Brief%20of%20Amici%20Curiae%20AAP%20et%20al..pdf\">American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and the American Medical Association</a> — among other, similar professional organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/327730/20241008130915048_23-477%20Respondents%20Brief.pdf\">Tennessee’s brief</a>, meanwhile, presents a much more conspiratorial picture. At one point, for example, it claims that a transgender official within the Biden administration pressured the WPATH to issue inappropriately permissive guidelines on trans health care for physicians. At another point, it suggests that a major hospital in Tennessee started providing transgender health care because doing so would “make a lot of money” for the hospital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do Tennessee&#8217;s arguments meet the threshold of an “exceedingly persuasive justification”? It’s worth noting that the trial court which heard <em>Skrmetti</em>, the only court to closely examine the evidence on either side of the case, temporarily blocked Tennessee’s law during an early hearing in this case. Of course, it’s possible that a full trial will reveal that Tennessee&#8217;s more conspiratorial view of the facts is correct, but there’s good reason to be skeptical that all of the major professional organizations representing pediatricians, psychologists, trans health providers, and physicians generally are all engaged in a grand conspiracy to make more money by overmedicating transgender children.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There’s some chance the Court will hit pause on this case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is some chance that the Court will delay resolution of this case, although probably not for very long.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the lower courts, both the Biden administration and lawyers for a group of transgender plaintiffs argued the pro-trans position. After they lost in the appeals court, both the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/\">Justice Department</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/l-w-v-skrmetti/\">private plaintiffs</a> asked the justices to hear their case. Although these two petitions present similar questions, the Court decided only to grant the Justice Department’s request to hear the case — which is why the case is currently called <em>United States v. Skrmetti</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus far, the Court has taken no action on the private plaintiffs’ petition, which is known as <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/l-w-v-skrmetti/\"><em>L.W. v. Skrmetti</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ordinarily, the Court’s decision to grant one petition and not the other wouldn’t matter very much. But it is exceedingly likely that the Trump administration will reverse the Justice Department’s position on this case once it takes power in January and formally withdraw its request for the justices to hear this case. That means that if the justices want to hold on to the case past January, they will need to grant the <em>L.W.</em> petition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, none of these procedural maneuvers are likely to change much. It’s possible that the Court will delay oral arguments until all of this is resolved. But, if the justices want to resolve the issue presented by <em>Skrmetti</em>, there’s no reason why the Court can’t decide this case in its current term (which means a decision is likely in late June), regardless of how the procedural drama shakes out.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It wasn’t a podcaster with questionable views or a libertarian businessman selling a course or any particular ideology. It was actress Sydney Sweeney, <em>Euphoria</em> star and the recent lead of the rom-com <em>Anyone But You.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Following her hosting gig on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in March, two conservative outlets <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/amy-hamm-wokeness-is-no-match-for-sydney-sweeneys-undeniable-beauty\">published</a> <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boobs-are-back-thank-you-sydney-sweeney/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1709711300-2\">columns</a> heralding Sweeney as a return to conventional beauty standards of the ’90s and early 2000s — or as, Bridget Phetasy for the Spectator put it, “the giggling blonde with an amazing rack.” Both pieces<strong> </strong>postulate that, by wearing low-cut dresses and playing up her sexuality, Sweeney was inviting men to gawk at her, therefore raising a middle finger to “woke culture” and the Me Too movement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sweeney hasn’t publicly aligned herself with the right in any way. (Her <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/sydney-sweeney-responds-maga-supporting-family-member-controversy-1234629337/\">family’s politics</a>, though, were the subject of controversy in 2022, which may have something to do with the right’s eager embrace of her.) Rather, her ascension as a throwback-y, hyper-feminine sex symbol has given conservatives the rare mainstream Gen Z figure on whom to project their values. For those paying close attention, the past year was rife with springboards for the conservative message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the hindsight following Trump’s reelection, it seems the zeitgeist of 2024 was a foreshadowing of his return to office and something forecasters might have considered a little more seriously. “Bro country” singers became the artists de jour, going head-to-head with female pop singers on the charts and, in many cases, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/359734/female-pop-stars-charts-billboard-rap-country-popularity\">outperforming them</a>. The buzziest new reality shows were about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/360219/dcc-dallas-cowboys-cheerleaders-netflix-judi-kelli-victoria-kalina\">Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/374143/secret-lives-mormon-wives-momtok-utah\">Mormon TikTokers</a>. Conservative films from smaller distributors, like the biopic <em>Reagan</em> and Daily Wire documentary <em>Am I Racist?</em>, made millions at the box office. Nominally apolitical podcasters and streamers, from Joe Rogan to the Nelk Boys, hosted presidential <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant\">candidates</a> and took on an increasingly political valence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a sharp turn from the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/obamacore-obama-pop-culture-kamala-harris.html\">liberal-coded pop culture of the Obama years</a> and the sort of trends that took off in response to Trump’s first presidency — comic-book movies with a progressive edge like <em>Wonder Woman</em> and <em>Black Panther, </em>social commentary films like <em>Get Out</em> and <em>Promising Young Woman</em>, not to mention <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/drag-race-inc-whats-lost-when-a-subculture-goes-pop.html\">the explosion of drag culture</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Joel Penney, an associate professor at Montclair State University, says the overall conservative feel of pop culture at the moment is, in many ways, a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23581859/me-too-backlash-susan-faludi-weinstein-roe-dobbs-depp-heard\">response to the Me Too movement</a> and the notion by its detractors that “masculinity is in crisis.” At the same time that we’re seeing Sweeney receive praise for representing “traditional” femininity, the All-American straight white “bro” is getting renewed cultural attention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There’s been a lot of this trying to restore these strong male role models in pop culture, whether it’s Tom Cruise in the <em>Top Gun</em> remake or these ‘bro’ podcasters and country singers,” Penney says. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>2024 was all about the straight white bro </strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can see this happening most visibly in mainstream music. It’s not just that country music — a Southern genre with a past and present of conservative politics — has emerged in the mainstream over the past two years — <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/\">with</a> <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/morgan-wallen-arrest-controversy-timeline-b2525290.html\">much</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political\">controversy</a>. It’s that this class of musicians — Morgan Wallen, Zach Bryan, Jelly Roll, Luke Combs, Shaboozey, and the newly rustic Post Malone — are glaringly male. Shaboozey’s unprecedented achievements in an overwhelmingly white genre add a refreshing element to this conversation. Beyoncé also released a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24115959/beyonce-cowboy-carter-country-music-explained\">successful country album</a> this year that features Shaboozey and an array of Black female country artists.<em> Cowboy Carter</em>’s lead single, “Texas Hold ’Em,” topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, a shorter amount of time than Morgan Wallen, Post Malone, and Shaboozey’s No.1 songs this year. Nor was she recognized by the country establishment, getting completely <a href=\"https://thehilltoponline.com/2024/09/16/beyonces-cowboy-carter-receives-zero-cma-nominations/\">shut out of the CMAs</a>. Overall, it seems like country fans and the average young person, who’s <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/cmts-morgan-wallen-country-streaming-march-1235573629/\">listening to more country music</a> these days, are still more eager to hear dudes croon about beer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Outside of the charts, these country singers have also become mainstream personalities and subjects of celebrity gossip. In the span of roughly a year, Bryan went from a <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/pulling-weeds-chris-black-zach-bryan\">little-known alternative country crooner posting videos on YouTube</a> to a celebrity whose personal relationships are being <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@abbzbon/video/7435029860285746474\">analyzed</a> by <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bethanysware/video/7434745300285246763\">TikTok</a> users and explained in the pages of <a href=\"https://people.com/zach-bryan-brianna-chickenfry-relationship-timeline-7866836\">People</a>. Jelly Roll and his wife, influencer and popular podcast host Bunnie XO, have also become a recognizable celebrity couple, while Morgan Wallen’s <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/07/31/entertainment/country-singer-megan-moroney-addresses-morgan-wallen-dating-rumors/\">dating life</a> and <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/04/08/entertainment/morgan-wallen-arrested-after-allegedly-throwing-chair-off-bar-roof/\">public antics</a> have become<em> </em>Page Six fodder. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1978651676.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.654292878952,100,78.691414242097\" alt=\"Zach Bryan in an all-black tuxedo posing beside a brunette in a lace corset dress.\" title=\"Zach Bryan in an all-black tuxedo posing beside a brunette in a lace corset dress.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Singer Zach Bryan and influencer Bri LaPaglia a.k.a.

First, there was the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/internet-culture/357813/hawk-tuah-girl-meme-tiktok-explained\">viral video</a> of a woman from Tennessee being asked about oral sex outside of a bar — a very bro-y Girls Gone Wild-inspired genre that’s emerged on TikTok — and offering a memorable onomatopoeia. There’s also the viral Florida-based father-and-son duo A.J. and Big Justice, who do food reviews at Costco.

While the media can reflect growing opinions and interests of the moment, it can also be used to shape it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Pop culture doesn&#8217;t just emerge out of nowhere,” says Penney, who wrote the book <em>Pop Culture, Politics, and the News</em>. “We’re seeing attempts to shape the culture that are increasingly coming from the conservative media ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Conservatives carved out a space for themselves at the movies&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In March, Ben Shapiro’s media company The Daily Wire released its first theatrical movie, the “satirical” documentary <em>Am I Racist?, </em>which <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/how-the-daily-wire-engineered-box-office-hit-am-i-racist.html\">earned $4.5 million</a> its opening weekend. Currently, it’s the highest-grossing documentary of the year along with a handful of other conservative nonfiction films including the Catholic documentary <em>Jesus Thirsts: The Story of the Eucharist</em>, the Dinesh D&#8217;Souza-directed <em>Vindicating Trump</em>, and the creationist movie <em>The Ark and The Darkness</em> all making the <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/market/2024/genre/Documentary\">top 10 list</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">2024 saw other movies from conservative studios and right-wing producers make notable financial gains. Despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, the Ronald Reagan biopic, <em>Reagan</em>, starring Dennis Quaid, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/09/14/reagan-defies-negative-reviews-and-holds-strong-in-box-office-top-5/\">broke into the Top 5 at the box office</a> when it premiered in August, doing particularly well with <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/09/box-office-summer-labor-day-deadpool-wolverine-afraid-1236073792/\">older, white, and Southern audiences</a>. This summer, the Christian media company Angel Studios also released the pro-adoption movie <em>Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trout</em>, marketed by Daily Wire+. While it made significantly less money than its <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2023/\">2023 predecessor <em>Sound of Freedom</em></a><em>, </em>which had a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/19/1188405402/qanon-supporters-are-promoting-sound-of-freedom-heres-why\">vocal fanbase of QAnon supporters</a><em>,</em> its nearly $12 million worldwide earnings are still a massive accomplishment for a small Christian film with no movie stars attached. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the performance of these movies has not bred the same immediate concern of something like <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, it does provide a potential incentive for major studios to start courting a movie-going crowd that’s felt alienated by mainstream Hollywood.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/2571_FP_00623B-3587x1500-d3275b2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=10.064120434904,0,79.871759130192,100\" alt=\"Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. \" title=\"Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones in the 2024 film &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;/em&gt;. | Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment\" data-portal-copyright=\"Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Warner Bros has yet to produce its own <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, but we’ve seen hints that Hollywood is interested in movies that at least appeal to white, Southern, and conservative audiences. American nostalgia bait came to the fore in the summer blockbuster <em>Twisters</em>. The Oklahoma-set film with a star-studded, country-infused soundtrack did <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/07/box-office-twisters-middle-america-red-states-1236016845/\">particularly well in Southern cities and theater chains</a> in middle America, outperforming initial estimations. While it’s probably most accurate to describe the film as decidedly apolitical with some patriotic markers, it does see the white, blond savior (played by Glen Powell) emasculate the movie’s other male main character, Latino storm chaser Javi (Anthony Ramos). Powell happened to produce another piece of Americana, <em>Blue Angels</em>, a look at the US Navy’s flight demo squadron, and the fourth highest-grossing documentary of 2024. He also co-starred in <em>Anyone But You</em> with Sweeney, a film released at the end of 2023 that crossed the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-anyone-but-you-crosses-200-million-poor-things-nears-100-million-mark-1235922019/\">$200 million</a> mark in early 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Penney says that corporations will try new strategies and pander to different audiences, as they’ve done with Marvel and Disney’s diversity pushes in recent years, based on what they think will benefit them financially. They’re not really thinking about political impact. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That was very much the reality of capitalism at work,” says Penney. “[Disney] was trying new strategies, not because they were really, truly convinced that they were going to save the world through expanding diversity, but they were getting a sense that that&#8217;s what the audience wanted. It was a response to Me Too and Black Lives Matter and things that actually resonated with our culture to a degree.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This pendulum swing from the sort of diversity-focused art that dominated pop culture during the Obama years to what we’re seeing now is hardly unprecedented. Specifically in music, country’s popularity as a genre has historically corresponded with a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/911-country-music-songs-1221348/\">push in right-wing politics,</a> from the jingoist anthems following 9/11 to “Okie from Muskogee” during the Nixon years. Pop culture has also seen movies with conservative and/or religious themes, from<em> American Sniper</em> and <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, break the box office. If this current moment tells us anything, it’s that we’re stuck in an ouroboros of shifting political values and corporate interests. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Suffice to say, it’s not a question of whether we’ve been here before but whether we’re paying attention to what these signals all mean. With an honest look at our media landscape, were the results of the election truly that surprising?&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But this is not 2017 all over again. It is something worse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past eight years, Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image. In Congress, his intraparty critics have almost all <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2019/10/28/trump-has-gop-critics-in-congress-but-many-of-them-arent-sticking-around/\">decamped for the private sector</a> or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/gops-awkward-2016-flip-flops-trump-make-comeback-2024/\">knelt to kiss his ring</a>. In the executive branch, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jim-mattis-resignation-officially-ends-adults-room-era-trump-s-ncna951036\">the “adults”</a> are <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/marjorie-taylor-greene-wants-a-cabinet-position?srsltid=AfmBOoqgx-gjs0dkk7QYIdtJ5BbWuDB3Pvkgko7san1Yz-wEapz1W7Ns\">no longer “in the room</a>”: Awed by his own power and unprepared to staff an administration, Trump leaned on many relatively mainstream advisers in his first term. This time around, he and his allies have <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/trump-loyalists-2024-presidential-election\">assembled a cadre</a> of loyalists, some of whom have won <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384320/trump-cabinet-white-house\">cabinet nominations</a> (alongside some more conventional Republicans). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, conservatives have consolidated their grip on the Supreme Court, slashed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-voters-trump-florida-texas-pennsylvania-democrats-3637d86dede99e36f35d725afabdcba1\">the Democrats’ advantage with Hispanic voters</a>, and fortified the GOP’s strength with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-return-power-fueled-by-hispanic-working-class-voter-support-2024-11-06/\">the non-college-educated electorate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/383565/2024-election-results-kamala-harris-loss-democrats-future\">realignments</a> that threatened the Democratic Party’s capacity to wield federal power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this amounts to a catastrophe for anyone who values liberal democracy, egalitarian economic policy, and social equality for all marginalized groups. As someone who has spent the past decade advocating for more expansionary immigration policies, a larger social safety net, criminal justice reform, and decarbonization, it is difficult to see my country embrace a man who evinces contempt for all of those causes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the face of this calamity, Democrats must develop a clear-eyed understanding of how they got here and chart a plausible path back to the country they want to live in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This newsletter — The Rebuild — aims to aid in that project. In weekly installments, I’ll try to offer some insight into how Democrats lost their national majority, as well as what we — people who care about advancing progressive change — must do to become more effective moving forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Answering those questions will require Democrats to analyze their predicament with open minds. If we seek ideologically comforting explanations for the party’s problems — rather than empirically sound ones — the coalition will march deeper into the wilderness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, in the wake of Harris’s loss, virtually <a href=\"https://samharris.substack.com/p/the-reckoning\">every</a> <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/188110/biden-white-working-class-ira-trump\">Democratic</a> faction has produced its share of motivated reasoning. In future newsletters, I plan to take issue with some centrists’ analysis of the party’s difficulties. But today, I want to explain why I worry that the left is allowing wishful thinking to cloud its vision of political reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since November 5, some progressives have drawn a sweeping lesson from Donald Trump’s second victory: Harris’s loss proves that Democrats gain little from “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/08/obama-era-democrat-party-future\">moderation</a>” or “<a href=\"https://x.com/mattduss/status/1854169589237874891\">centrism</a>” and must “<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democratic-party-elite-responsible-catastrophe/\">embrace radical policies</a>” in order to compete. I admire many of the writers making this argument. But their confidence in this narrative strikes me as wildly unfounded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is true that Harris <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/367389/dnc-2024-kamala-harris-policies-trump-dangerously-liberal\">pivoted to the center</a> on border security, crime, and, to a lesser extent, economics. There are plenty of sound arguments — both moral and political — against Democrats moderating on specific issues. Yet it’s hard to see how anyone could be confident that Harris lost because she moderated, much less that her loss proved that moderation is electorally counterproductive as a rule. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To name just a few reasons for doubting those premises:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Harris actually <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/08/2024/a-very-simple-prescription-for-democrats-just-wait\">did better</a> where both she and Donald Trump held campaign rallies and aired TV advertisements than she did in the rest of the country. Thus, if Harris’s problem was her moderate messaging, it is odd that she won a higher share of the vote in the places that were more exposed to that messaging, despite the fact that such areas were also inundated by pro-Trump ads. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In a September poll from <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/651692/voters-choice-character-leadership-skill.aspx\">Gallup</a>, 51 percent of voters described Harris as “too liberal,” while just 6 percent deemed her “too conservative.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the Democratic Party’s biggest overperformers in the 2024 election — the down-ballot candidates that ran furthest ahead of Harris with their constituents — were moderates: <a href=\"https://x.com/tahrajirari/status/1854908246534111278\">Jon Tester, Amy Klobuchar,</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/maine-us-house-district-2-results\">Jared Golden</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-washington-us-house-3.html\">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Harris had been <a href=\"https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris\">a liberal senator</a> and took many <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html\">left-wing positions</a> during the 2020 Democratic primary. She was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-paints-harris-ultra-liberal-1st-rally-biden/story?id=112253634\">attacked relentlessly</a> by the Trump campaign on that basis. It’s hard to see how one could determine that it was Harris’s moderate messaging, rather than her progressive background, that was more damaging to her prospects. What we know, however, is that her opponent’s political advisers sought to highlight the latter, not the former. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Biden-Harris administration was, by many progressives’ own account, the most <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics\">left-wing White House on domestic policy</a> in generations, and Trump’s team portrayed Harris <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4871309-trump-campaign-harris-biden-presidential-debate/\">as an extension of that administration</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Across the wealthy world, parties that presided over inflation have <a href=\"https://x.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1854485866548195735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854485866548195735%7Ctwgr%5Ed9a3106d708552ae9f36cdc67a77f45ec428ac3a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2F2024%2F11%2F07%2Felection-world-inflation-harris-trump%2F\">been losing at the ballot box</a>, irrespective of their political leanings, a fact that raises doubts about whether any grand ideological lesson can be drawn from Harris’s defeat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My aim here is not to argue that Democrats must pivot to the center on all issues. I don’t think they should. I do think that the party needs to moderate its image nationally, if only to better compete for Senate control. But I’m still gathering my thoughts on how precisely they should pursue that task and will elaborate on them in future newsletters.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, my point is simply that there is little basis for confidence that Harris lost due to excessive moderation, or that Democrats would benefit electorally from becoming broadly more left-wing. The fact that many on the left nevertheless evince such certainty is therefore disconcerting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Being progressive, in the best sense of that term, means putting the interests of the most vulnerable above one’s own comfort — whether material or ideological. And right now, America’s most disempowered constituencies have a strong interest in Democrats ousting reactionaries from power. If the party substitutes wishful thinking for unblinkered analysis, they will have a harder time accomplishing that task.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s a far cry from the race’s humble beginnings: In <a href=\"https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/getinspired/marathonhistory\">1970</a>, just 55 runners completed the race, which then only entailed laps around Central Park.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The record-breaking participation in this month’s run came as no surprise to me, because I have seen the growing popularity of marathon running in my own life: This year, I cheered on six of my friends from the sidelines. And last year, I even ran the race myself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the past few years, my circle of 20- and 30-somethings has transitioned away from boozy late nights in favor of early-morning meetups at the track. Suddenly, I have strong opinions on brands of gels and shoes and run belts. I spend my weekends cheering at all sorts of races. Running culture has taken over our lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As it turns out, we’re part of a global trend toward marathon participation <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/briefing/boston-marathon-finish-times.html\">in recent decades</a> — a phenomenon that’s been helped along further by the pandemic-era <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/sports/running-exercise-coronavirus.html\">running boom</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"Why everybody&#039;s running marathons now\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/11NwWyVUrpfKTNs6QZsJsI?utm_source=oembed\" allowfullscreen allow=\"clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Twenty-somethings like me are a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/04/running-marathon-quarter-life-crisis/678156/\">big reason</a> for the jump: 15 percent of NYC Marathon finishers in 2019 were in their 20s. Just four years later, in 2023, they made up 19 percent, according to the Atlantic. At the Los Angeles Marathon those same years, the proportion of 20-something runners grew from 21 percent to 28 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That growth prompted the Atlantic to dub running “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/04/running-marathon-quarter-life-crisis/678156/\">the new quarter-life crisis</a>.” And while “crisis” usually connotes some sort of negative spiral, my cohort’s new running obsession could be viewed less as a symptom of all that&#8217;s gone awry for our generation and more as a positive rebellion against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why so many young people are taking up distance running</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Marathons in general are simply becoming more inclusive: Women’s participation was first allowed in the 1970s and has only recently started to achieve <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/280440/marathon-finishers-by-age-and-gender-united-states/\">something like parity</a> with men’s. There are also more finishers <a href=\"https://www.runninginsight.com/closing-the-gap\">of color</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-515098618.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.774624818864,100,78.450750362273\" alt=\"In a black-and-white photo, a woman and a crowd of men in athletic clothes and race numbers are running along a paved course, with one man in a jacket, pants, and tie, running alongside trying to stop the woman.\" title=\"In a black-and-white photo, a woman and a crowd of men in athletic clothes and race numbers are running along a paved course, with one man in a jacket, pants, and tie, running alongside trying to stop the woman.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The director of the Boston Marathon tries to grab a lone female runner, Kathrine Switzer, in 1967 when she ran the then all-male race. | Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But for the Gen Z demographic, another key driver is just … the way life is right now. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A lot of them started running during the pandemic. A lot of them were starting careers at that time, were graduating from college and maybe didn&#8217;t have a real graduation, maybe didn&#8217;t have these normal adult milestones,” says journalist Maggie Mertens, the author of the book <em>Better Faster Farther: How Running Changed Everything We Know About Women</em>. “They see homeownership and marriage and kids as kind of out of reach —&nbsp;further out of reach than even the millennial generation did.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That adds up to a lot of uncertainty. And what helps manage uncertainty if not a four-month, intensive training plan that calls for four to six training runs a week covering hundreds of miles, plus cross-training and stretching?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Marathon season is largely over,&nbsp;which means it’s an ideal time to start thinking about whether you want to run one next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, a disclaimer: I grew up a competitive swimmer and a softball player. The pandemic shut down all my favorite workout classes and basically forced me to lace up my running shoes. I’m not an especially fast runner, and I’m not setting out to break any world records. I mainly think of it as a great way to move my body, hang out with my friends, and challenge myself to go a little farther than I could yesterday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If that sounds like you, read on for advice on what I learned from training as a 20-something<strong>,</strong> and things to know if you&#8217;re hoping to start training, too.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Training can be a way to add structure to your life</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I found that preparing for the New York City Marathon functionally required the spreadsheet-ification of my life: Sunday, long run. Monday, rest. Tuesday, 4 miles. Wednesday, 8 miles. You get it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the most strenuous, highest-mileage training weeks, I sometimes felt something like despair, but mostly the box-checking helped bring a sense of predictability, even when my work or personal life was up in the air. It also created new milestones where others —&nbsp;home-buying, having a kid — felt out of reach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I visited the 2024 Chicago Marathon Expo a few weeks ago to find out more for the <em>Today, Explained</em> podcast, and several 20-something runners had similar experiences to share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can have the worst day in the world, but the benefit of that is that you turn around and you’re like, ‘Well, at least I got my miles in,’” Taylor-Nicole Limas, 28, told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For some, like Mitchell Rose, 23, training is a way to impose structure on adult life. “It kind of gives me the end-of-the-semester feel, like you’re working towards something, whereas work gets very monotonous. I’m three months into my full-time job now, and I came to the realization like, ‘Oh, this just never ends.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2182698991.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729673135785,100,78.540653728429\" alt=\"A young woman in running gear smiles and puts a hand to her face, surrounded by other runners.\" title=\"A young woman in running gear smiles and puts a hand to her face, surrounded by other runners.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Runners react after crossing the finish line of the 2024 New York City Marathon on November 3. | Sarah Stier/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Sarah Stier/Getty Images\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use running to push you to finally make big lifestyle changes</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rigor of training mandates shedding bad habits and adopting healthy ones, too. I personally found that I had to add a fourth meal to my day — just to make up for the thousands of calories burned on my training runs. I also gave up alcohol and cut back on late nights in an effort to reduce the likelihood of feeling bad on long runs (which only sometimes worked).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other runners told me they had to make similar commitments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m not proud of it, but I used to vape,” Pascale Geday, 26, told me at the expo. “I’m no longer vaping. I feel like it’s made me a better athlete.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All these little adjustments add up to a much bigger change, says <a href=\"https://clas.ucdenver.edu/psychology/kevin-masters-phd\">Kevin Masters</a>, a professor of psychology at University of Colorado Denver and a former marathoner himself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You really orient your day — which turns into your weeks, which turns into months — around this event,” he <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/11NwWyVUrpfKTNs6QZsJsI?si=07d6aedf31d349f8\">told</a> <em>Today, Explained</em>. “That&#8217;s kind of an orienting principle for your life.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Training for a race can also be a way to find community</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The boom in marathon participation comes amid what the surgeon general is calling a <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">loneliness epidemic</a>, marked by decreased participation in community organizations, faith organizations, and recreational leagues over several decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This phenomenon is especially apparent among 20- and 30-somethings, who are becoming known as the “<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-bars-are-adapting-to-gen-z-the-homebody-generation?srsltid=AfmBOoqhWsa2FeTDSgIOeUL5wJ642EQ4vm4cSHjvqp8uAmV3GlxY06BY\">homebody generation</a>.” One <a href=\"https://sociologicalscience.com/download/vol_11/august/SocSci_v11_553to578_updated.pdf\">recent analysis</a> found that they spend, on average, about two more hours per day at home than previous generations did.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Where people used to gain some of their purpose and meaning in life and feel affiliated with others,” from community organizations, Masters said, those “aren&#8217;t really doing it for the younger folks as much.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Running just might: Run-club participation is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/briefing/berlin-marathon.html\">so high</a> that it’s become a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mattslyon/video/7367758453437123882?lang=en\">meme</a>, and social media abounds with running <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/savannahsachdev\">influencers</a> and content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I have started a group chat with a bunch of first-time marathoners,” Limas told me. “I&#8217;m like, ‘Hey, we&#8217;re all running the marathon. … We&#8217;re all women. Why not just, when we’re stressed out, text each other?’ And they&#8217;ve all become friends because of this group chat that I started.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, run clubs aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. Rose told me that he hadn’t had luck when he tried them out. “I have a long-term girlfriend. I don&#8217;t need to go to a run club because they&#8217;re usually looking for other things other than a good workout.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, he said, he prefers to run with just one friend: “Having someone that you can knock on the door and be like, ‘Let&#8217;s go for a run right now,’ and they’ll more often than not drop everything and be like, ‘Yeah, let&#8217;s go. Like, let&#8217;s have a great time together.’ That is another level of our friendship that I don&#8217;t think would be there otherwise.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They hired and elevated <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/4/23708278/joe-biden-kamala-harris-2024-election-latino-voters-julie-chavez-rodriguez\">top Latino consultants, strategists</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/27/president-joe-biden-reelection-campaign-team-el-paso-rep-veronica-escobar-added/70155654007/\">elected</a> <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2023/biden-harris-2024-announces-campaign-national-advisory-board/\">officials</a>. They opened field offices and hired staff in heavily Latino parts of swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania as early as the spring. They reached out to voters on <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-vs-harris-is-the-whatsapp-campaign.html\">WhatsApp</a>, a private messaging app used as a form of social media by many Latino and immigrant communities; sent surrogates to Spanish-language radio stations; and microtargeted advertising to Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Mexican American voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Spanish and bilingual ads ran continuously on TV, radio, and online starting in March. And those ads moved beyond an explicit focus on identity, instead talking up policy and accomplishments like Medicare’s cap on insulin prices, the expansion of health care coverage, and job creation during the post-Covid economic recovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The hope was that this earlier, smarter, more tailored campaign would help reverse a few trends that were obvious for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23873568/biden-polling-black-latino-voters-2024-election-trump\">most of 2023</a> and 2024: that Latino voters were deeply unhappy with the status quo, were not enthusiastic about Biden’s reelection, and were questioning their loyalty to the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s clear now that this strategy was not enough. Though it will take months to get more granular data, county-level results and exit polls do indicate a rightward shift by Latino voters across the country that contributed to Trump’s victory. To be clear, it appears<strong> </strong>Democrats still won a majority of Latino voters — but the harsh reality for Democrats is that Trump once again managed to improve his standing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That doesn’t mean that Democrats should <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/democrats-latino-vote-trump-00187991\">throw out</a> the playbook for campaigning with Latino voters. Calls for a hard pivot to the <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-common-sense-democrat-manifesto\">right</a> on cultural issues, or outright resignation about a permanent racial realignment — as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-black-latino-voters-interview/680588/\">some</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/trump-latino-hispanic-vote-election\">conventional</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/latinos-vote-trump/680596/\">wisdom</a> floating around since the election suggests — are premature. Republicans simply cannot be sure these gains will stick around without Trump on the ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there are oddly two contradictory takeaways given what we know so far: Democrats can assure themselves that they ran a pretty good campaign to win back Latino voter support. On a deeper level, however, they missed a more fundamental disconnect between the party and the voters, particularly the working class, that a textbook campaign simply couldn’t fix.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two takeaways from the election</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two distinct points to take away from November 5.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, campaigning does still matter. The <a href=\"https://x.com/williamjordann/status/1856076168111194180\">national trend</a> of Trump posting better margins of support in non-battleground states than in swing states applied to Latino voters as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Where Democrats campaigned heavily for Latino votes, Kamala Harris saw a smaller drop in support than in places where her campaign did not focus its efforts — meaning that the Harris campaign’s Latino ground game, spending, and organizing shouldn’t be discounted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second point cuts the other way: There is a much deeper problem with Democrats’ appeal to Latino voters, one that will take time to repair. Nationally, Democrats like Biden and Harris were just not trusted as working-class champions by many Latino voters, who are still overwhelmingly working class and not college educated. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The memories of economic hardship during the pandemic (for which Trump largely escaped blame) and the inflationary period that followed never went away, and weren’t properly addressed by either Biden or Harris during the campaign. Combined with an overriding <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents\">anti-incumbent mood</a> that permeated electorates globally this year, Democrats were almost certain to do worse with Latino voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There were some exceptions. Republican Senate candidates, for example, did not do as well as Trump did among Latino voters, and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who won the Arizona Senate race in a state Harris lost, particularly overperformed, winning by two percentage points a state that Trump won by five. But the larger point holds: Democrats lost ground with Latino voters, and analysts point to their inability to appeal to the working class as a culprit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It starts with the credibility of the message,” Chuck Rocha, a Mexican American strategist who advised Bernie Sanders’ 2020 primary campaign and helped with both Biden general election campaigns, told me. “People like to say that Bernie Sanders was this, or that — the thing that made Bernie Sanders great was that he had always said the same thing, so he was credible. People see bullshit now in politicians. They want someone that&#8217;s credible whether they like him or hate him.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rebuilding that credibility will be essential if Democrats are to reverse their fortunes not just with Latino voters, but with a wide swathe of the electorate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Democrats never really figured out how to regain Latinos’ trust on the economy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In retrospect, the storyline of the Latino electorate was fairly consistent. Poll after preelection poll told the same story: These voters were most concerned about the economy, and they were as likely as white voters to say they either missed the policies and economic conditions of the Trump era, or trusted Trump more than either Biden or Harris to deliver relief.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the heart of this feeling was a disconnect between what voters meant by “the economy” and what many national Democrats, including Biden and Harris, were talking about on the trail. Latino voters, troubled by inflation earlier in the Biden presidency, largely meant “prices should be lower,” while Biden and Harris mostly talked about job creation, slowing inflation, and gradually rising wages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was true as early as November 2023, when polling from the Democratic research firm Blueprint found that Latino voters cared most about lower prices and least about “creating more jobs” — which was especially problematic because, as Blueprint also found, Latino voters <a href=\"https://blueprint2024.com/uncategorized/bidenomics-poll-deck-nov/\">more than any other racial group</a> thought that more employment was Biden’s priority. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Add to this dynamic the fact that it was Latino and Black Americans who experienced <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23992436/black-latino-americans-economy-biden-democrats-voters-poll-inflation\">uniquely traumatizing</a> financial rollercoasters during the post-Covid period —&nbsp;seeing their wealth and financial prospects <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22600143/poverty-us-covid-19-pandemic-stimulus-checks\">rise</a> during the pandemic because of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/13/23500066/pandemic-savings-inflation-recession\">government aid</a> only for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/2023/8/10/23824742/real-wages-economy-inflation-no-money\">rising costs of living</a> to wipe out many of those gains before wages began <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/11/20/23964535/labor-market-employment-inflation-sentiment-economy-bad-polls\">to grow again</a> — and you can see where the Biden administration’s credibility gap emerged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Biden economic message was focused on trying to sell a positive economic success story — and there were indeed data and legislation they could point to tell that story. But according to Camille Rivera, a senior advisor for Voto Latino and founder of the Puerto Rican civic organization La Brega y Fuerza, the campaign’s foregrounding of topline indicators —&nbsp;the GDP, the improving consumer price index, the low unemployment rate, and investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, among others — could not sway voters who still saw vivid reminders of peak inflation in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/2023/11/8/23951098/economy-inflation-prices-job-market-sticker-shock\">cost of food and household essentials</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We were talking about the economy in macro forms, but people were not feeling it. They were just not feeling it. My father would be like, ‘Hey, did you see this? I just bought these potato chips. There&#8217;s like 50 percent air in these potato chips, and the price is higher,’” Rivera said. “We kept saying, ‘But the economy is great. Look at the stock market!’ That to me was many of our flaws.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The “identity force-field” showed cracks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over time, this disconnect may have taken a toll on the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/06/22/latino-drift-democrats-poll\">overall “party of the work class” brand</a> of the national Democratic Party. And there’s perhaps no better sign of this than in polling specifically focused on one dynamic that tends to bind Latinos to the Democratic Party: the question of which party best “cares for people like you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s that feeling that has tended to root most Latino voters in the Democratic camp, even if these voters don’t necessarily agree with every social position, economic or immigration policy, or cultural value that the party takes on —&nbsp;a kind of “identity force-field,” as Equis, a Democratic research firm focused on Latino voters, calls it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the aftermath of the 2022 midterms, Equis found evidence that those feelings were still fairly strong. In those midterms, there were conflicted or swing voters who turned out, and who, because of that warm association with the Democratic Party, pulled the lever for Democratic candidates. There were also Latino voters who ended up voting for Republicans —&nbsp; but who still harbored warm feelings toward Democrats anyway. Generally, Equis polling found, Democrats were still the party viewed as “better for Hispanics” and which cared “about people like you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as Carlos Odio, an Equis co-founder, warned at the time of that report, there was a good chance swing Latino voters could drift in 2024 if “there is a major shift in the issue environment, imbalanced campaigning, or a weakening of identity bonds.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And that seems to be what happened. The signs of weakening identity bonds were there. The Biden campaign fizzled out. And the economy, as well as a rise in the salience of immigration, put national Democrats on the defensive with both Latino voters and the general electorate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By October 2024, after Biden drove down positive perceptions of the party among Latinos prior to his late-July exit, Harris had managed to recover the party’s footing. Her campaign strategy didn’t change tremendously, but polling showed Latino voters returning to the Democratic candidate, albeit not at the same rates that they had voted for Biden in 2020. By the close of the campaign, Harris was viewed as being “better for Hispanics” and “people like you.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the <a href=\"https://www.weareequis.us/research/latino-update-october-2024\">Democratic advantage</a> had shrunk from two years before. The force field was weak. And by then, it was too late for the Harris campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democrats now face a challenge: to reassess how they talk about the economy, about class, and about material conditions in a way that can connect with the electorate. There’s a tendency among some in the party — strategists, commentators, and elected officials — to either want to throw out the way they’ve run outreach to Latino voters or to deny that they have a problem at all (and blame “disinformation” or <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/trump-latino-voters-unidos-us\">offer counterintuitive data</a> to bolster that thinking). Democratic campaign operations in 2024 were not useless, but if the party is to have a shot in 2028, the work to rebuild credibility with working-class Latinos starts now.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) speaks on stage on the third day of the Republican National Convention on July 17, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let’s be clear: Not everything Donald Trump has proposed to do in his upcoming administration is a threat American democracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384320/trump-cabinet-white-house\">Cabinet appointments</a>, like Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state or former Rep. Lee Zeldin for EPA administrator, are basically what you’d expect from Republicans. You might disagree with their policies, but you can’t seriously argue that they represent threats to the rule of law or democratic norms. Others, like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services, are troublingly unqualified and even outright dangerous — but not an immediate five-alarm fire for American democracy specifically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet at the same time, there is already clear and undeniable cause for alarm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Around the world, there are certain steps a leader takes if they want to destroy a country’s democracy, like putting loyalists in charge of law enforcement and politicizing the armed forces. Many of Trump’s early decisions fit this pattern to a T.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest red flag is the choice of arch-loyalist Matt Gaetz as attorney general. The Justice Department is arguably the single most powerful domestic policy agency, running everything from the FBI to federal criminal prosecutors to civil rights litigation. Gaetz has few, if any, qualifications to manage all of this — except for his vendetta against the department, as it once investigated him on suspicion of sex crimes. (Gaetz denies the allegations and the DOJ <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839\">dropped its investigation</a> into them in 2023.)<strong> </strong>His pitch for the job, <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/donald-trump-is-dead-serious-about\">one Trump insider told the Bulwark</a>, was to “go over there and start cuttin’ fuckin’ heads.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s plans for the military are similarly ominous. Two teams of reports, in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606\">the Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-team-drawing-up-list-pentagon-officers-fire-sources-say-2024-11-13/\">Reuters</a> respectively, have uncovered plans for a political purge of the brass — potentially including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump’s proposed secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, is a Fox News commentator and MAGA diehard who called for <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/pete-hegseths-plan-overhaul-americas-military-fire-ton/story?id=115842674\">precisely such a purge</a> in a recent book.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there’s Trump’s scheme to get his Cabinet picks in office. If the Republican Senate actually does block any of these picks, Trump has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet\">demanded the power</a> to install them through recess appointments while the chamber is out of session. If enough senators balk, Trump reportedly has put together <a href=\"https://x.com/AJentleson/status/1857081316937761089\">a complicated backup plan</a> that boils down to the House giving him the power to go around the Senate entirely — effectively eviscerating its constitutional advice-and-consent role on appointments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, we don’t know how much of these really bad ideas will come to pass. Trump is famous for saying things and failing to follow through. But given the enormity of the tail risk — the corrosion of American democracy — it’s critical to take what’s happening right now seriously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And that means being clear-eyed about the Trump agenda: both what’s not so scary about it, and what is.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The “authoritarian checklist” that can guide us through Trump 2.0</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The United States is not the only democracy to elect an authoritarian of late. Voters in a series of other countries —&nbsp;including Hungary, Turkey, Israel, India, Poland, Venezuela, Brazil, and the Philippines —&nbsp;have elevated similarly dangerous leaders in recent elections. None of these countries are exactly like the United States, but all have some things in common that can give us guidance as to what to expect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the most important similarities is that none of these country’s leaders openly campaigned on abolishing democracy. The concept remained far too popular among both citizens and elites to act like Hitler and abolish elections outright.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, they made incremental changes that would slowly-but-surely increase their own power while neutering opponents both in and out of the government. No one step marks the end of democracy, but each cumulatively makes it a little bit weaker. If this process reaches its endpoint, elections become functionally meaningless — theoretically free contests that in actuality are nearly impossible for the incumbent party to lose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Executing this strategy requires a few key moves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, would-be authoritarians need the loyalists in key government positions. No one can hollow out an entire government on their own; it’s simply too towering a task to micro-manage. So they delegate, empowering individuals with unwavering loyalty and dedication to remaking key government institutions along authoritarian lines. In India, for example, the second-most powerful position in government — home minister — is occupied by a man named Amit Shah, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68653573\">close friend and comrade</a> of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s since 1982.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, they need those appointees to eviscerate legal and political guardrails on their power. Independent prosecutors, government accountability offices, courts, legislative prerogatives — all of this needs to be either co-opted or eliminated. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/1/3/24022467/israel-supreme-court-judicial-overhaul-reasonableness-basic-law-overturn\">failed 2023 judicial overhaul in Israel</a>, which would have effectively stripped its courts of any ability to check Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s power, is an unusually stark example of such a move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After these first two steps have succeeded in consolidating power over the state, the authoritarian then wields it to weaken dissenters outside of government&nbsp;— with the ultimate aim of tilting the playing field on which elections take place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This doesn’t just mean obvious things, like formally restricting free speech rights, but more subtle tools — like wielding tax agencies and spurious legal investigations against critics and potential private sector rivals. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump\">is the pioneer here</a>, using something as seemingly benign as government ad spending to bring the Hungarian media under his control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through all of this, they need to be able to count on the loyalty of the security services as a last resort. In between elections, would-be authoritarians fear nothing more than popular uprisings and military coups. Stacking the intelligence community and armed forces with loyalists is the best way to ensure that coups fail (as happened <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/15/12204172/turkey-coup-erdogan-military\">in Turkey in 2016</a>) or to violently repress street protests if necessary (as happened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/06/venezuela-election-maduro-analysis\">after Venezuela’s stolen election earlier this year</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These four points — appoint loyalists, eviscerate guardrails, attack dissent, suborn armed forces — are the key benchmarks one should use for evaluating Trump’s policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does what he’s proposing truly further one of those objectives? If so, by how much? How likely is it to happen? And how does the threat level rank relative to other things that he’s doing?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Grading Trump’s early decisions by the checklist</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trying to assess Trump’s policies on these metrics is not some kind of academic game. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those of us who care about democracy, in the press and elsewhere, need to maintain our credibility with potentially persuadable third parties&nbsp;— like swing voters or moderate Republican senators. Being seen as liberal hacks who call any Republican appointee a threat to democracy is a problem; so too is developing a track record of crying wolf by labeling everything Trump does anti-democratic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this spirit, it’s clear what emerges as the most dangerous move of Trump’s early transition: the Gaetz pick.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is hard to imagine someone <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/04/matt-gaetz-house-republican-congress-profile/677915/?gift=zYCTBrO_7y7KHmiTPdBdgz2i_q9mnP-Ul9A5kUUNFTY&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\">more cravenly loyal to Trump than Gaetz</a>. It is hard to imagine anyone who has a more serious vendetta against non-partisan administration of laws, since Gaetz was once the target of a federal investigation. And it is hard to imagine a more important position than attorney general — one that gives immense power both to eviscerate guardrails and to punish private sector dissenters with <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/185487/trump-maga-legal-war-slow-burn-authoritarianism\">spurious criminal investigations</a> (among other tools).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Defense Department plans aren’t too far behind. Purging the Joint Chiefs based on political loyalty — excuse me, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-vows-fire-generals-push-wokeness-cant-woke-military\">alleged “wokeness”</a> — removes one of the chief barriers to Trump’s alleged desire to <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-insurrection-act-threat\">invoke the Insurrection Act</a> and deploy soldiers against protestors at home. Hegseth isn’t quite as egregious a Cabinet choice as Gaetz, but it’s hard to imagine someone who has proposed such purges and regularly praises Trump on TV standing in the way of his boss’s plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can go on down the list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The plan for circumventing the Senate’s advice-and-consent power would be extremely threatening to guardrails if it happened, but it’s unclear how likely it is to happen. Gabbard as director of national intelligence raises some troubling questions about politicizing intelligence, but she’s not as much of a Trump toady as a Gaetz or even a Hegseth. Kennedy is almost certainly a disaster for public health, but not an obvious threat to democracy narrowly speaking. The office of presidential personnel is small potatoes compared to a cabinet post, but Trump’s decision to put <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-personnel-sergio-gor.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">his book publisher in charge of it</a> will facilitate his plans for seeding the entire government with loyalists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By contrast, there’s no reason to think appointments like Rubio or Zeldin even register on this scale. These are the kind of appointments you’d expect from any Republican, and while their policies may be terrible, they’re not an attack on our system of government. In terms of protecting our democracy, the question for them isn’t whether they themselves are a sign of authoritarian rot, but whether they would have the courage to resist it while in power (color me skeptical).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ranking these matters for more than just credibility purposes. Democracy’s defenders have limited resources and energy, especially when both chambers of Congress and the Supreme Court are controlled by Republicans. They need to prioritize which Trump appointments and policies to fight, a task made far more difficult by the deluge of daily outrages that we all remember from Trump’s first term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That requires being clear-eyed about what really is threatening and what isn’t. And at present, an objective evaluation of Trump’s early proposals should give Americans a hell of a lot to worry about.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Now, with President-elect Donald Trump heading to the White House and Musk joining his administration, countless people announced <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/x-sees-largest-user-exodus-musk-takeover-rcna179793\">their departure from X</a>. Rival social media site Bluesky told Vox that 2.25 million new users have joined in the last week alone.<strong> </strong>And they’re having a blast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bluesky looks a lot like the old Twitter you knew and loved. It’s a reverse chronological feed of posts, including images, videos, and links that you can like and repost. Like old Twitter, your feed is not ruled by an algorithm. Meanwhile, Bluesky’s open source, decentralized framework <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/how-clean-your-bluesky-feed\">gives you a lot more control</a> over how your feed works than X or even Threads, the X alternative Meta has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/5/23785140/threads-instagram-meta-twitter-killer-mark-zuckerberg-elon-musk\">pushing onto Instagram users</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the technical differences, there’s also a different vibe on Bluesky. It’s overflowing with weird memes and digital art thanks to early users who hurried to recapture that fun and serendipitous feeling of the original Twitter. But with <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3larljiybf22v\">an influx of a million users in the last month</a>, Bluesky is growing fast and bracing for some sort of evolution. The people arriving from X seem like they’re having fun so far, too. You can also expect to see a lot less Elon Musk on Bluesky, if only because he doesn’t own the place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the good vibes continue, there’s a chance that Bluesky could usher in a brighter future for social media, one that gives users more power over their experience. Theoretically, the company’s model could give people a way to hang out on the social web outside of algorithmic feeds stuffed with targeted ads and ruled by trillion-dollar tech companies. For now, at the very least, Bluesky is a welcome breath of fresh air.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why people are fleeing X</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This isn’t the first time people have flocked to Bluesky. When Twitter <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/10/27/23424938/elon-musk-own-twitter-deal-closes-what-will-change-superapp-layoffs-free-speech-parag-agrawal\">accepted Elon Musk’s $44 billion bid</a> to buy Twitter in April 2022, a lot of people freaked out about the possibility of the billionaire changing the platform into a place where trolls and grifters could run free — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23025120/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-government-censorship\">all in the name of free speech</a>. Those initial anxieties turned out to be correct. After Musk changed the name to X, what used to be Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/x-white-supremacist-site/680538/\">filled up with white supremacists</a> and became overrun with harassment, <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html\">AI slop</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/wrong-claims-by-musk-us-election-got-2-billion-views-x-2024-report-says-2024-11-04/\">election misinformation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This overhaul turned into a huge opportunity for open source, text-based social networks, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-mastodon/\">Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/29/23702979/bluesky-twitter-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-chrissy-teigen-aoc-dril-decentralized\">Bluesky</a>. Early on, it looked like the decidedly decentralized Mastodon would be the Twitter alternative of choice, but after it saw an initial burst of interest, some people felt like Mastodon <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90808984/using-mastodon-is-way-too-complicated-to-ever-topple-twitter\">was just too confusing</a>. As a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/federated-network\">federated network</a>, Mastodon let people set up their own servers, which functioned as independent but interconnected communities within the larger network. It’s related to the larger concept of the fediverse, where a single protocol could allow information to be exchanged between all social media platforms. The fediverse, like Mastodon, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol\">is very confusing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bluesky took this idea of a federated network and made it easy to use. It started back in 2019, when Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106\">announced</a> that Twitter would fund a small team that would build an “open and decentralized standard for social media.” The ambition — which would eventually result in Bluesky — was to work toward an open social media ecosystem, where users could control how content appeared in their feeds and take their data and followers with them when they moved platforms. Bluesky registered as its own public benefit company <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/2-7-2022-overview\">in February 2022</a>, just a couple of months before Musk offered to buy Twitter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first Bluesky app <a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky\">launched in beta about a year later</a>, and it looked a heck of a lot like Twitter, down to the blue logo, which would become a butterfly rather than Twitter’s bird. Rather than require you to figure out which server to join, as Mastodon does, Bluesky initially centralized the user experience on one server so users could see one feed, just like on Twitter. Within a few months, some prominent Twitter users, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Chrissy Teigen, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/29/23702979/bluesky-twitter-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-chrissy-teigen-aoc-dril-decentralized\">had set up Bluesky accounts</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bluesky has only gotten easier to use since its early days. While the company <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web\">announced it was federating</a> earlier this year, allowing users to store their data on their own servers, the Bluesky user experience remains very straightforward and Twitter-like, down to the look and feel of the app and website. Honestly, if you’re not paying attention while you’re scrolling your feed, you might think you’re on Twitter circa 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, the future of Bluesky is supposed to be transformative. While social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been plagued by content moderation problems, Bluesky <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation\">wants to put users and communities</a> in control of those policies. The same goes for what shows up in people’s feeds. Bluesky says that instead of one algorithm to rule all users, it <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice\">will let developers create all kinds of different algorithms</a> and empower users to choose their own experience on the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I&#8217;m really excited that folks can choose the social media that&#8217;s right for them. I&#8217;ll say for me, I like small social media where I talk to barely a dozen people,” Rory Mir, associate director of community organizing at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said of Bluesky’s open source architecture. “And then if folks want a really big audience and to really blow up that&#8217;s also available.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not how Bluesky works for everyone quite yet. You can just set up an account, follow a bunch of people, and then see their posts. But looking ahead, Bluesky has an optimistic vision for a near future in which social media doesn’t <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/364127/kosa-social-media-teen-health-anxiety\">make people so miserable</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">For new users, Bluesky&#8217;s appeal is all about the culture&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Timing has proven crucial to Bluesky’s current position as the X alternative du jour — that is, it’s had a significant amount of time to gather momentum leading to what seems to be this tipping point moment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the platform launched over 18 months ago, it was as an invite-only space, prompting extremely online types and various public figures to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/29/23702979/bluesky-twitter-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-chrissy-teigen-aoc-dril-decentralized\">flock to try to get in</a>. (The fact many of those early adopters were journalists didn’t hurt in terms of building hype.) That long period of limited entry served to build FOMO, of course, but it also served to allow a niche group of users time to help shape what the dominant modes of communication, moderation, and platform etiquette would be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The health and positivity of Bluesky&#8217;s community is very important to us, and we&#8217;ve invested heavily in Trust and Safety,” Bluesky spokesperson Emily Liu told Vox in an email. “Last year, Bluesky required invite codes to sign up — not to build hype or exclusivity, but rather so we had time to grow the network responsibly and build our Trust and Safety team.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“​​When Musk first bought Twitter, the first things he did were rolling back moderation on transphobia on the platform and because of that we were the first group to leave Twitter in numbers,” journalist Katelyn Burns told Vox. “Because of that, a large group of funny, talented trans posters were the earliest adopters of Bluesky and were able to forge the platform into what it is today: funny, frequently horny, and with very strong moderation tools. If you like Bluesky&#8217;s vibe right now, thank a trans person.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the platform finally <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/06/bluesky-launch-public-jay-graber/\">opened to the public</a> in February, this culture was already well-established: Lots of shitposting passed down from the days of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/8/16034974/writer-jonathan-sun-interview\">Weird Twitter</a> (including various <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/faineg.bsky.social/post/3laeclwscaj2v\">Alf memes</a> that recently <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/alexkirshner.com/post/3latn7imcj22p\">led to some confusion</a>); a seemingly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65961fec-a5ab-4c71-b1c8-265be3583a93\">inevitable leftist tilt</a>; a subcommunity of NSFW posters; and, perhaps most important, an emphasis on proactively curating your own experience using Bluesky’s robust moderation tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The centrality of these tools are arguably the defining trait that allows Bluesky to stand out, especially compared to Twitter, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/18/16790864/twitter-bans-nazis-hate-groups\">struggled for its entire existence</a> to properly deal with bad actors on the site (until Musk more or less jettisoned that struggle altogether). Bluesky not only allows you to block and mute various people, words, and tags, it also allows you to hide individual posts on feeds, and allows users to subscribe to curated block lists directly from the platform that blocks users en masse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“To me the biggest difference between Bluesky and every other social media platform I’ve ever been on is the close relationship between the user base and the (quite small!) team of developers,” journalist and longtime Bluesky shitposter <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/milesklee.bsky.social\">Miles Klee</a> told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When people first joined, it was very bare bones, and the devs pursued new features according to what they heard users wanted. Because a lot of people were looking to escape the toxicity of X, that meant they ended up prioritizing safety and accessibility,” Klee said. “On Bluesky, many users feel that they’re building something new together, and that gives them a feeling of ownership, control, community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I adore Bluesky,” author and Bluesky user <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/debbieohi.com\">Debbie Ridpath Ohi</a> told Vox. “While so many other new platforms chased user numbers, Bluesky focused on user safety first, and that made a huge difference. I am having fun using social media again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bluesky does have one significant drawback. Because the platform is federated, accounts can’t be “locked” away from public view the way they can on X. Still, for many people, that’s likely a feature rather than a bug; after all, X’s easily accessible public interface and ease of searching and surfacing content made it indispensable to many users, especially the many journalists who used it and still continue to use it. These are all features that Bluesky replicates — without, so far, the endless trolls that came with X’s recent era.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What it means to leave Twitter</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For people who have spent many years on Twitter — which launched in 2006, enough time to grow into an impossible teenager — it may be sobering to contemplate actually leaving the platform. This is, after all, the supposed “hellsite” that many of its most active users were all but glued to for everything from live events to hilarious viral incidents that found us all united through the power of a virtually instantaneous, public, and collective social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet for the vast majority of users, the thought of leaving X now probably feels much more plausible and realistic a possibility than it did a year ago, when Vox first <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/11/22/23466381/leaving-twitter-x-saying-goodbye-social-media\">declared</a> that X was in its death throes. That’s not unusual; social media platforms very rarely die instantly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, platforms don’t suddenly shut down and strand all of their users. That only happens in extreme cases when a platform’s systems collapse, or it’s seized by the government, or the owner kills the site — situations that just don’t really happen to modern social media with complex infrastructure. The inverse scenario, in which all of a platform’s users simply give up and leave en masse overnight, doesn’t happen at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, as we’ve seen across various internet platforms, including mass migrations away from <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/tracking-livejournal-fandom-diaspora-infographic/\">LiveJournal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/masonsands/2018/12/20/tumblocalypse-where-tumblr-and-its-users-are-headed-after-the-ban/\">Tumblr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/2/2/22915110/facebook-meta-user-growth-decline-first-time-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg-tiktok-competition-earnings\">Facebook</a>, and now X, the exodus takes years and involves multiple inciting incidents that push people out of their comfort zone and off the platform in incremental movements. All of these steps shift users slowly and inevitably toward the decision to fully leave a platform — sometimes before they even realize they’ve made it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Social media is, by definition, social,” Bluesky early adopter <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mauraquint.bsky.social\">Maura Quint</a> told Vox. “People want to be at places where they get something from other users, and where the tools the site provides help them have the experience they’re looking for. If people are miserable in a space, they leave.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Elon Musk made sure to design his version of Twitter to be an unpleasant, dull place,” Quint continued. “Why choose an awful room run by the worst guy you’ve ever met when there’s an alternative where cool people are hanging out, telling jokes, creating their own goofy lore, and engaging on issues they care about?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a platform slips into decline, those inciting incidents often become more and more frequent and close together. X has had multiple such inciting incidents this year, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232561/brazil-x-ban-sending-people-bluesky\">a major ban in Brazil</a> that sent 500,000 users to Bluesky in a single weekend in August, <a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/the-burning-of-the-library-of-alexandria\">a crucial step</a> in jolting X’s massive international fandom community out of its complacency. Then came the twin announcements in October: first, that X would be allowing third-party AI companies to <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/twitter-removes-ability-to-stop-ai-from-scraping-your-pictures\">scrape all user data</a>, and then that blocking a user would <a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/10/half-a-million-users-could-be-leaving-x-due-to-blocking-changes.html\">no longer prevent them</a> from being able to see your content — a change that arguably nullifies the point of blocking to begin with. Most recently came the US election and Musk’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/technology/elon-musk-trump-x.html\">unabashed weaponization</a> of the platform in service of Trump and the far right.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This latest inciting incident seems to have been the final straw for many users to not only leave X for Bluesky, but begin deleting all of their content from X. (Some <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-porto-to-upload-all-your-old-tweets-to-bluesky\">extensions and apps</a> allow you to import all of your content over from X to Bluesky first before you delete.) Still, while these actions suggest that momentum has well and truly shifted toward Bluesky, the newer site will likely have growing pains as old users adjust to newcomers and the platform itself grapples with the strain of millions of new users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Our infrastructure is holding up!” Bluesky’s Liu told Vox. “We&#8217;ve prepared our infrastructure to be able to handle this demand, though there are definitely a lot of new users signing up right now.” She added that the site is building a subscription model to aid sustainability, though the site will always be free to use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the rapid growth, users are optimistic about the future. “Every influx of users brings with it more voices, some with good intent and some with bad intent, but Bluesky is responsive to the people who use it in ways that encourage people to stick around,” Quint said.&nbsp;“When you compare that to sites where white nationalists organize mass attacks, spending money lets anyone drown out real discussion, and mass disinformation spreads at the whim of a billionaire, Bluesky is clearly the place to be.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "In the two years since Elon Musk bought Twitter and turned it into X, the platform has become crowded with deceptive ads and unchecked misinformation.

Notably, most of Trump’s selections are longtime loyalists who could put up less opposition to his policy proposals than staffers did during his first administration. And he’s selected a number of people who have little to no experience in the subject matter they’ll be overseeing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During his first administration, many of Trump’s Cabinet members oversaw significant changes to the executive branch, including Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who were critical to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/\">curtailing worker protections</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos\">attempting massive cuts to education spending</a>, respectively.

He’s also long backed <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-makes-tom-homan-father-of-family-separation-in-charge-of-mass-deportation/\">Trump’s desire to deport unauthorized immigrants</a>, previously noting that if invited to join the administration, he intended to “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump\">run the biggest deportation operation this country&#8217;s ever seen</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Homan worked for ICE during former President Barack Obama’s administration as well, and has also served as a police officer and Border Patrol agent. He’s been in lockstep with Trump on implementing punitive immigration policies and called <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-what-to-know/\">for ICE to deport a wide range of unauthorized immigrants</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation\">those who don’t have criminal histories</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&#8221; Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump\">wrote in a Truth Social post.</a> “There is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The “border czar” is not an official role that requires Senate confirmation;&nbsp;the secretary of homeland security is the actual Cabinet official overseeing the border.

He has advocated for a travel ban and family separations in the past, and he’s a chief architect and booster for the idea of the mass deportations Trump has promised this term as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html\">Miller has said of deportations.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has not yet formally announced the appointment, though Vice President-elect JD Vance has already <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1856004703672324263\">posted his congratulations to Miller</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is another political appointment that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but the role is set to focus heavily on providing Trump with policy guidance — likely focused on immigration, given Miller’s expertise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Between this appointment and Homan’s, Trump has made clear that his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">promised mass deportations</a> will be one of his top policy goals when he retakes office.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162179387.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.742099199347,100,78.515801601307\" alt=\"Kristi Noem speaks at a podium in a white jacket\" title=\"Kristi Noem speaks at a podium in a white jacket\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"South Dakota Gov.

Ahead of Trump making his VP selection, Noem became enmeshed in scandal after she <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24145840/kristi-noem-puppy-killing-book-trump-vp\">admitted to shooting her dog, Cricket, because of behavioral issues</a>, generating overwhelming backlash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As governor, Noem was known for refusing to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/opinion/kristi-noem-south-dakota-coronavirus.html\"> impose a mask mandate</a> during the pandemic, and for refusing to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/politics/kristi-noem-cpac-south-dakota-governor-covid-mandate/index.html\">implement statewide business closures</a> despite public health concerns. Noem was also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html\">banned by multiple Native American tribes </a>from visiting tribal lands in the state due to claims she’s made that they’ve been infiltrated by cartels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On immigration, Noem has often echoed Trump’s hardline rhetoric suggesting that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kristinoem/reel/DCIV983xbLS/?hl=en\">many unauthorized immigrants are criminals</a>, and she backed his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a significant role given the agency’s notable&nbsp;purview over the administration’s policies at the southern border. DHS includes key subagencies like ICE as well as Customs and Border Protection. The secretary role requires Senate confirmation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Noem is one of several picks that signal Trump’s investment in punitive immigration policies this term such as mass deportation — and aggressive border security.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1167012750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.8120095111577,100,80.375980977685\" alt=\"Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie\" title=\"Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Fox News host Pete Hegseth | John Lamparski/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"John Lamparski/Getty Images\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"pete-hegseth-has-been-tapped-for-secretary-of-defense\"><strong>Pete Hegseth has been tapped for secretary of defense</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A co-host of Fox News’s <em>Fox and Friends Weekend</em> show, Hegseth is a veteran who previously served in Afghanistan and Iraq but who has little senior national security experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hegseth has taken controversial positions in the past, including advocating for soldiers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/media/fox-news-pete-hegseth-trump-pardon-war-crimes/index.html\">who’ve committed war crimes to be pardoned</a> and stating that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/pete-hegseth-defense-cabinet-trump-women-b2646223.html\">women shouldn’t be fighting in combat</a>. He’s written multiple books about his military service, often criticizing the military for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2e8d60f-7ac3-40a2-a252-5b7ab81622af\">“wokeness” and prioritizing diversity</a> — and has said he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/\">supports firing senior leaders who advance these ideas</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hegseth has expressed his support for Israel as well as an adversarial stance toward Iran. In addition to working as a television host, Hegseth previously led the advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, which is funded by the Koch brothers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary/\">Trump wrote in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Secretary of Defense oversees the military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This person serves as a key adviser to the president on international conflicts and military policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Past officials in this role have often struggled to work with Trump, with five people cycling through it during his first term — and many of them criticizing his ability to govern.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hegseth would need to be confirmed by the Senate for this role.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Hegseth’s nomination seemed to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-defense-secretary-pentagon-2d8030921ecef933778cf92afd40ec72\">take many lawmakers and military leaders off guard</a> given his dearth of experience. His inflammatory positions about wokeism in the military and pardoning of war crimes have also spurred concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hegseth is among the many Trump picks poised to be strong defenders of Israel, and who advance a more traditionally conservative viewpoint on foreign policy.&nbsp;Like Trump, however, Hegseth has expressed skepticism of NATO and the contributions of US allies. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1251946266.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729331207725,100,78.541337584551\" alt=\"John Ratcliffe, a man who looks like Steve Carell, speaks \" title=\"John Ratcliffe, a man who looks like Steve Carell, speaks \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Former Rep.

This official plays a key role in advising the president and overseeing how this intelligence is used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Ratcliffe is the latest Trump loyalist to be installed in a pivotal position and questions remain about how committed he might be to opposing the president-elect.

He currently sits on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, and though he’s taken foreign policy positions aligned with Trump’s isolationist rhetoric lately, he has previously supported international alliances and interventionist approaches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rubio has also expressed strong support for Israel, and emphasized he isn’t interested in a ceasefire in the region until the country has defeated Hamas. He’s backed Ukraine aid in the past as well, though he opposed more recent packages and has urged an end to the war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rubio has also shifted considerably on certain issues like immigration: Early in his career, he was a chief proponent of immigration reform in the Senate, including a path to citizenship for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-answers-for-his-failed-2013-immigration-plans-again/\">unauthorized immigrants,</a> and his rhetoric has grown more hardline and similar to Trump’s over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/\">Trump said in a statement.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is one of the most powerful in the administration and key to shaping US foreign policy. The secretary of state is the chief envoy of the US in other countries, and offers counsel for how to approach different international relationships. Secretaries of state are also often dispatched to help mediate conflict. The role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Like the selection of Rep. Mike Waltz for National Security Adviser,<strong> </strong>Rubio’s naming suggests that Trump may be open to a more traditionally conservative and aggressive approach to foreign policy.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2173723479.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Michael Waltz\" title=\"Michael Waltz\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"US Rep.

He worked on foreign policy under President George W. Bush, and has sat on the Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs Committees in the House.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While on the Hill, Waltz became known for his hardline, aggressive stances on China and Iran and for being a vocal critic of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The national security adviser is a key foreign policy aide to the president; historically, they provide advice on both military and diplomatic matters. The role does not require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has clashed heavily with past individuals in this role including John Bolton, who has said<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bolton-excoriates-trump-fresh-introduction-his-memoir-2024-01-30/\"> he’s “unfit” to serve as president again.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Waltz is one of multiple hawkish foreign policy picks Trump has made. That suggests the Republican Party wing that advocates for intervention and action on the world stage — rather than the restrained, more isolationist faction — may get a large platform in a second Trump administration.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162329710.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone.\" title=\"Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"US Rep.

More recently, she went viral for her questioning of college presidents <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/elise-stefanik-republican-antisemitism-hearings.html\">during a hearing on antisemitism</a> and their handling of student protests over Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a top House Republican, Stefanik has amplified Trump’s 2020 election denials and hewed so close to the president-elect that she was once on the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick\">shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Stefanik is also known for her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21262150/house-republican-women-candidates\">efforts to recruit and support more Republican women</a> for House seats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s taken a pretty standard conservative stance on foreign policy: Stefanik has been a prominent supporter of aid to Israel while balking at continuing support for Ukraine. She backed early tranches of Ukraine aid but joined other Republicans in arguing that more recent aid could be better applied domestically. Stefanik has previously questioned aid to the United Nations, including to its Relief and Works Agency, which has been vital to providing humanitarian aid to Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Elise is an incredibly strong, tough and smart America First fighter,” <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-chooses-rep-elise-stefanik-serve-us-ambassador-united-nations-rcna179558\">Trump said in a statement about the role</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The UN ambassador serves as a vital envoy for US interests; given the country’s financial support for the body and its role on the UN Security Council, the ambassador has major influence regarding how the organization utilizes its resources and who serves in its leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the last year, UN officials have been increasingly critical of Israel’s attacks on Gaza as thousands have died, health care systems have been assaulted, and famine has struck. As ambassador, Stefanik could criticize these positions and call for defunding UN relief programs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>The pick suggests that the Trump administration could once again ramp up its disagreements with the United Nations, after attempting to <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/02/trump-stealthily-seeks-to-choke-off-funding-to-un-programs/\">curb funding for certain UN initiatives</a> in Trump’s first term. At that time, the administration also pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/trump-israel-palestinians-human-rights.html\">citing its criticisms of Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stefanik’s naming could also underscore <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ukraine-russia-war-threatens-cut-aid-election-2024/\">the president-elect’s skepticism</a> of additional aid to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162539091.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Rep.

Cross/Getty Images\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"matt-gaetz-has-been-tapped-for-attorney-general\"><strong>Matt Gaetz has been tapped for attorney general</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who he is:</strong> Gaetz is a conservative firebrand and longtime Trump supporter who is known for his disruptive presence in the House. Previously, he was a chief antagonist of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and has threatened multiple government shutdowns over concerns that conservative demands weren’t being met on issues like immigration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gaetz has sat on the Armed Services and Judiciary committees in the House and has also faced an investigation over his alleged involvement in sex trafficking of a minor. (The DOJ ultimately declined to charge him.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s announcement of the position centered heavily on Gaetz’s supposed willingness to root out alleged bias toward the president-elect at the agency. “Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,” <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role:</strong> The attorney general heads the Department of Justice and oversees the enforcement of federal laws. The DOJ conducts investigations of possible violations of these laws and is also responsible for holding federal officials accountable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Past Trump Attorney General  Jeff Sessions was previously forced out when the president-elect disagreed with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348\">his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Gaetz is another Trump loyalist who’s poised to help use the agency in a way that aids the president-elect’s aims. Republicans have long complained of targeting and bias at the DOJ and that could prove to be a major focus of his time there.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"robert-f-kennedy-jr-has-been-tapped-as-health-and-human-services-secretary\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been tapped as Health and Human Services Secretary</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who he is</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24112624/rfk-jr-kennedy-shanahan-running-mate-2024-election\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> is a former 2024 Democratic, then third-party presidential candidate and known <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health\">anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist</a>. Kennedy once worked as a climate attorney, but in recent years has become an outspoken propagator of falsehoods about childhood vaccines leading to autism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The nephew of former President John F. Kennedy Jr. and the son of Robert F. Kennedy, he’s the founder of the Children’s Health Defense, a leading anti-vaccine group, which has spread rampant misinformation on social media. Kennedy is also associated with other odd viewpoints and actions including calls to remove fluoride from water and his decision to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/365284/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park\">dump a dead bear in Central Park</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kennedy — who dropped out of the race and ultimately endorsed Trump — founded his campaign upon the idea that he was pushing back against corporate power and the establishment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Health and Human Services Secretary is an integral figure who establishes public health policy in the US and also oversees other key bodies within the agency like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The HHS Secretary is also tasked with addressing and combating public health emergencies, like a national pandemic. The role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Kennedy is the latest Trump ally being elevated to a role in which he lacks expertise. Kennedy could do serious harm if confirmed as the leader of HHS: Given this platform, he could spread misinformation at a larger scale and contribute to public health crises. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If Kennedy were to completely get his way and deter vaccination, vaccine-preventable diseases like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23438552/covid-vaccine-refusal-hesitancy-politics-polarization-pandemic-mandates\">measles and polio could make a comeback</a>,” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health\">Vox’s Andrew Prokop previously wrote.</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1464161119.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729399246567,100,78.541201506867\" alt=\"Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded.\" title=\"Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Former US Rep.

That year, he came within a notably close margin of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul as a Republican running in a traditionally blue state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Zeldin has said some of his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-taps-lee-zeldin-lead-environmental-protection-agency-rcna179658\">first priorities</a> will be to “roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,” and to work on US “energy dominance.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The EPA is responsible for crafting policies that protect clean water and air, and also plays a major role in approving regulations to combat climate change. The administrator position is a Senate-confirmed role.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Trump promised to take a very different approach to the environment than the Biden administration, including by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance\">exiting international climate agreements</a> and focusing on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy\">expanding fossil fuel production</a>. Zeldin’s nomination suggests those promises will be a priority, as will <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy\">rescinding Biden-era environmental protections</a> that curbed carbon emissions for businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2184586024.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.730373280779,100,78.539253438442\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-will-co-lead-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency\"><strong>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency</strong>”</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who Musk is: </strong>A massive and vocal Trump advocate, Musk has used his platform on X (formerly known as Twitter) to boost the president-elect as well as misinformation about numerous topics, including noncitizen voting and election fraud.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk is known for leading several companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and for increasingly becoming part of Trump’s inner circle. Musk has also faced <a href=\"https://qz.com/tesla-elon-musk-ev-factory-wage-law-violations-lawsuit-1851391624\">allegations of labor violations at his companies</a>, and for past attention-seeking efforts, like trying — and failing — to help a group of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17576302/elon-musk-thai-cave-rescue-submarine\">Thai youth trapped in a cave in 2018</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’ll lead something called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, alongside former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

It’s likely that this agency will exist outside of the government instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s purportedly focused on slashing bureaucracy, government spending, and waste.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>This position speaks to the prominence that Musk has achieved in Trump’s orbit, and Ramaswamy in far-right circles, despite a lack of government and policy experience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182885052.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729339346038,100,78.541321307924\" alt=\"Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally.\" title=\"Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Susie Wiles, Trump’s senior national adviser. | Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"susie-wiles-has-been-named-chief-of-staff\"><strong>Susie Wiles has been named chief of staff</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Wiles, a longtime Florida campaign operative, helped run Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state and was a Trump senior national adviser in 2024.

The position is the most prominent political appointee in the White House and is not Senate confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html\">Trump’s former Chief of Staff John Kelly</a> has been a major Trump critic, describing him as a “fascist” who favors a “dictator approach.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Wiles <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-is-susie-wiles-the-woman-behind-trumps-historic-return-to-the-oval-office\">has been credited</a> with professionalizing Trump’s campaign operations and reining in some of the chaos that has marked his past operations.

Not a big deal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and other Republicans have primarily <a href=\"https://burchett.house.gov/media/press-releases/burchett-votes-bill-protect-female-athletes-under-title-ix\">threatened the participation of trans girls in K-12 sports programs</a>, though college athletes wouldn’t be immune from any action Trump decides to take. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s threats raise the question: Could he challenge trans athletes’ right to compete in school sports?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How would Trump enact such a ban?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The short answer is yes. Trump could strip away civil rights and nondiscrimination <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-releases-final-title-ix-regulations-providing#:~:text=The%20final%20rule%20requires%20schools,and%20not%20otherwise%20impermissible%20evidence.\">protections enumerated under the Biden administration,</a> which specifically apply to trans students.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The executive branch has a lot of control over what counts as discrimination in education, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681\">Title IX</a>, a civil rights law originally meant to advance women’s equality. The Biden administration took the position that the law’s protections against discrimination “on the basis of sex” mean that discrimination against trans students on the basis of their trans identity qualifies as sex discrimination. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That interpretation of the law faced legal challenges and has been rejected by about half of the states. The Trump administration can — and likely will — simply take the stance that Title IX offers no protections to trans students. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX could go even further by arguing that “​​it is discriminatory against girls to have trans athletes participating in girls’ sports,” according to Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There could be new legal battles over Title IX if Democratic governors and attorneys general moved to stop the new interpretation —&nbsp;essentially the reverse of the current Title IX landscape.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, the administration could go through Congress and try to rewrite Title IX, explicitly stating those positions rather than merely interpreting the current law that way, Valant said. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) already proposed a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/165/text?s=2&amp;r=1\">law in July undoing the Biden-era regulations</a>. Trump has also said he will ask Congress to pass a bill stating that <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-vows-stop-gender-affirming-care-minors-re-elected-president-rcna68461\">only two genders exist</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans will hold narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate. It’s possible that such a bill could pass, though it would likely face some difficulty in the Senate, where <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/expect-hear-f-word-lot-us-senate-next-year-2024-11-13/\">Republicans lack a filibuster-proof majority</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Outside of federal action, some states like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/02/1002405412/on-the-first-day-of-pride-month-florida-signed-a-transgender-athlete-bill-into-l\">Florida</a> already have bans against transgender students participating in school sports. Under that law, only people <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/01/politics/florida-transgender-sports-ban-ron-desantis/index.html\">assigned female at birth can play on girls’ sports teams</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These kinds of laws could be stepping stones in dismantling trans people’s right to nondiscrimination in schools and the workplace, as well as their ability to access health care, Gillian Branstetter, communications strategist at the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project and LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project, told Vox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I can&#8217;t think of a single state or politician that has adopted this issue that has decided that they&#8217;re just going to narrowly focus on the rights of transgender athletes,” Branstetter said. “They have, using the exact same legal arguments, using the exact same legislative language, and usually using the exact same lawyers, also used these [tactics] to ban gender-affirming health care, to restrict what bathrooms trans people can use, and a long litany of other restrictions.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Yet humanity’s output is on track to reach another record high this year, up 0.8 percent from last year, according to a new report this week from <a href=\"https://globalcarbonbudget.org/about/\">Global Carbon Budget</a>, a research unit at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. This trajectory means that the goal of capping the rise of global average temperatures below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/3/21045263/climate-change-1-5-degrees-celsius-target-ipcc\">almost completely out of reach</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/n<br><br>Global fossil fuel CO2 emissions will go up by 0.8% this year, a continuation of the centennial+ upward trend. <br><br>This growth is lower than last year at 1.4%. <a href=\"https://t.co/8l0zooSwr1\">pic.twitter.com/8l0zooSwr1</a></p>&mdash; Pep Canadell (@pepcanadell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pepcanadell/status/1856503347592978817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The conference, where countries hammer out the details of how they will do their share to address climate change, is already off to a rocky start, struggling <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/111124-cop29-row-over-eus-cbam-stalls-day-one-progress-in-baku\">just to adopt an agenda</a>. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b06ee7d7-bfd2-4fbf-8867-922d87ca49a0\">France and Argentina</a> have also withdrawn their top negotiators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’ve just had the hottest day, the hottest months, the hottest years, and the hottest decade in the history books,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told the conference. “Climate disasters are piling up — harming those who’ve done the least, the most.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So at a time when the world needs to be doing more than ever to limit warming, transition to clean energy, and adapt to the unavoidable shifts underway, momentum is slowing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet it hasn’t stopped. Though emissions are rising, their rate of increase is slowing down, and a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action\">decline may be on the horizon</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/372852/solar-power-energy-growth-record-us-climate-china\">Wind and solar power are still surging</a> and electric vehicles are <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars\">gaining market share</a>. Even with diminished political will, the trends are moving in the right direction for the climate. But progress is fragile and far too slow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s driving up global emissions right now?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/publications/when-will-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-peak\">Climate Analytics</a>, a think tank, anticipated that there was a 70 percent chance that global emissions would begin to decline this year. The new Carbon Budget findings show that the world is more likely to be in the 30 percent scenario. “I think their analysis is generally really robust and sound,” said <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/team/neil-grant\">Neil Grant</a>, a researcher at Climate Analytics. “There is still some chance that emissions might fall this year, but it certainly looks very unlikely.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Digging into the top-line greenhouse gas emissions number reveals a complicated story behind why emissions are up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big reason is that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/climate/fossil-fuel-emissions-record-climate-intl/index.html\">fossil fuel consumption is up</a>. Oil and gas account for the bulk of this increase in emissions, with coal a distant third. While greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are rising, their output is level or falling from some of the largest historical emitters. The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5605\">European Union’s emissions are declining</a>. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/total.php\">US emissions</a> are holding steady. China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, is on track to see its output grow by just <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-global-co2-emissions-will-reach-new-high-in-2024-despite-slower-growth/\">0.2 percent this year</a>, one of the tiniest increases in years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bucking this trend are many developing countries like India, currently the world’s third-largest emitter. India has seen a huge increase in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/india-gets-386-bln-financial-commitment-expand-renewable-capacity-2024-09-16/\">renewable energy deployment</a>, but its still developing energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. The Global Carbon Budget found India’s fossil fuel emissions are on track to increase 4.6 percent this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a few additional factors that drove up emissions this year. The lingering effects of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific\">El Niño</a> helped push global temperatures to record highs. Extraordinary heat waves in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/india-heatwave-deaths-heat-stroke-climate-change-880f26e3b8eeb066d2db2308502783d2\">India</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-megacity-limits-outdoor-lighting-record-heat-strains-grid-2024-08-06/\">China</a> pushed up energy demand for cooling, and that meant burning more fossil fuels. “We&#8217;re beginning to see some of those negative feedback loops where the climate crisis itself is impacting on the energy system and making it harder to reduce emissions,” Grant said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, there are glimmers of good news. More than 30 countries have already managed to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23447414/degrowth-decoupling-carbon-emissions-economic-growth\">grow their economies while cutting carbon dioxide pollution</a>, a clear sign that coal, oil, and natural gas are not the only paths to prosperity. These countries have already summited their <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action\">emissions peaks</a> and are now on the descent, breaking a pattern that has held for nearly two centuries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Most countries in the world, even if they haven&#8217;t peaked yet, you see that the trajectory is approaching peak, and in countries where emissions are declining, usually they&#8217;re declining faster,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a researcher at the University of Exeter who led the Global Carbon Budget report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s bending the curve? Friedlingstein said it’s because countries are switching to cleaner energy sources. That means turning away from carbon-spewing coal toward natural gas, which emits about half of the greenhouse gasses per unit of energy, or using energy from the sun and the wind, which emits close to none. Electrifying vehicles so they don’t have to burn oil is another key factor. Increasing energy efficiency is also negating rising energy demand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Government policies initially drove these trends, but now economics have started to take the wheel. Tactics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions often save money and energy sources like wind and solar power are often the cheapest way to put electrons on the power grid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s important to note that burning fossil fuels isn’t the only way humanity is increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere; damaging and destroying landscapes that absorb carbon — forests, mangroves, wetlands, prairies — also lead to a net increase in greenhouse gasses. Carbon dioxide isn’t the only greenhouse gas of note either. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22613532/climate-change-methane-emissions\">Methane</a>, which is about 30 times more potent when it comes to trapping heat, is also contributing to warming. It can leak from natural gas infrastructure and is also a byproduct of agriculture. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Conversely, restoring ecosystems that soak up emissions from the air can keep warming in check. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/24114997/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-hope\">Unchecked deforestation is slowing down</a> in many parts of the world and in others, it’s beginning to reverse. “The long-term trend in forestation is going in the right direction,” Friedlingstein said. “This is what helps to balance the book with fossil fuel emissions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where greenhouse gas emissions go is up to us now</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While greenhouse gas emissions are now increasing at a tiny fraction of their pace throughout much of the industrial era, there’s no sign at the moment that they’ve reached a peak, nor a guarantee that they will decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Friedlingstein said we may be in an era where emissions plateau, still adding to the volume of heat trapping gasses in the atmosphere at the highest levels in history. And a plateau could stretch on for a long time. <a href=\"https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/ai-is-putting-googles-clean-energy-future-at-risk/\">Environmental groups</a> have raised the alarm that the ravenous <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising\">power demand from data centers behind artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies</a> would spike emissions upward again, but much of that demand could still be met with renewable energy or<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/383547/nuclear-power-google-amazon-restart-energy\"> nuclear power</a>, and so far, they haven’t led to a carbon dioxide spike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, countries can take deliberate steps to bend emissions curves downward at a faster rate. Countries need to set ambitious climate goals for themselves, invest in cleaner energy alternatives, and hold themselves accountable. “In a sense, it&#8217;s a simple recipe,” Friedlingstein said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practice, it remains an extraordinary challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many countries are coping with inflation, making it harder to invest in big projects. Some are worried about securing their energy resources amid fears of international conflict, like how <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/2/21/23594544/europe-electricity-natural-gas-renewable-energy-russia\">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted natural gas</a> supplies in Europe. Many parts of the world experiencing the most acute damages from climate change are also those that contributed the least to the problem and have the fewest resources to adapt to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Clean energy needs to scale up further as well. So does energy efficiency. About <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/renewable-energy-climate-solar-wind-fossil-fuels-2718fce0ed37232dc25dbf46fff87955\">30 percent of global electricity</a> came from low-emissions sources in 2023. “While renewables have grown fast, demand has grown faster,” said Grant. “And we know that the tipping point of peaking will come when renewables grow faster than energy demand growth.” He added that the distribution of clean energy technology so far has skewed mainly toward wealthy countries and not those facing the largest increases in energy demand, biggest spikes in air pollution, and worst impacts of climate change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The United Nations’s Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance estimated that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-talks-urged-find-1-trillion-year-poorer-countries-2024-11-14/\">poorer countries will need $1.3 trillion per year by 2035</a> to deal with global warming. This is once again shaping up to be one of the biggest sticking points at COP29 as negotiators suss out who is to pay how much and by when. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the world is likely to miss one of the most ambitious climate targets, the case for curbing greenhouse gas emissions remains strong. Every bit of averted warming — every degree or even fraction of a degree — reduces damages, saves money, and protects lives.&nbsp;The open question is how much we’ll do to change course.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

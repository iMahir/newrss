Biden, for instance, named Harris because she would bring youth, diversity, and legal experience. And former President Donald Trump chose Vice President Mike Pence because he was a traditional conservative and offered legislative expertise that he didn’t have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/359620/kamala-harris-2020-president-campaign-2024-failure-lesson\">What happened last time Harris ran for president</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361750/biden-drop-out-harris-endorse-polls-against-trump-democrats-dnc\">Does Harris give Democrats a better chance in 2024?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">Why is everyone talking about Harris and coconut trees?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee\">Harris’s strengths and vulnerabilities as a presidential candidate</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What might Harris look for? Based on that history, there are a few guesses: Her pick could be someone from a purple or red state, who offers geographic diversity given her roots in California. And — to assuage voters who still hold sexist or racist attitudes, as President Barack Obama did with Biden in 2008 — it might be a white man. According to some reports, her short list has narrowed to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-27/kamala-harris-vice-presidential-search-focuses-on-3-candidates?sref=qYiz2hd0\">three top contenders</a>: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. However, other names — including some of her colleagues in the Biden administration — are possibilities as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is expected to announce her choice sometime before August 7. Below is a rundown of some of the candidates reportedly under consideration — and what they’d bring to the ticket. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2150001600_c3763f.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736744421098,100,78.526511157804\" alt=\"Gov.

Josh Shapiro arrives to deliver remarks at a building trades union conference on April 24, in Washington, DC. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\" />\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Gov. Josh Shapiro</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Shapiro, 51, is the governor of Pennsylvania, another likely battleground state (with <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation\">19 Electoral College votes</a>), which Biden won in 2020 and which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He was elected in 2022, the same year that freshman Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was elected to the Senate. Shapiro ran far ahead of Fetterman, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results/pennsylvania/\">winning 57 percent of the vote, to Fetterman’s 51 percent</a>. Shapiro has established himself as a moderate who helped negotiate bipartisan deals when he was in the state legislature, and is also known for his work as attorney general, when he secured settlements for victims of sexual abuse by the Catholic Diocese. He’s also been a vocal supporter of Israel amid the country’s devastating military offensive in Gaza, following Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Like Cooper, he’s the popular Democratic governor of a swing state and could help the party improve their chances there. He’s also seen as more of a centrist who could appeal to moderate voters and independents, though his staunch backing of Israel could turn away progressive Democrats.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160744008_a0c39e.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Sen.

Mark Kelly</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Kelly is the junior senator of Arizona — a swing state with <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation\">11 Electoral College votes</a> — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21537670/senate-2020-results-arizona-mark-kelly-winner\">who was elected in 2020</a> by framing himself as a candidate willing to work across the aisle. Previously, Biden won Arizona in 2020, while Clinton lost the state in 2016. Kelly is also known for his career as an astronaut alongside his twin brother Scott Kelly, and as the husband of gun control advocate and former US Rep. Gabby Giffords.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Kelly has a higher profile than some of the other names on this list, and is respected both for his scientific expertise and contributions as an astronaut in addition to his time in the Senate. He’s been a prominent gun control advocate alongside Giffords and made pushing these policies a priority.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given his efforts to appeal to both Republicans and independents in Arizona, he’d be another option who could help with trying to reach those voters. Arizona also continues to be an important battleground this time around, including in its <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">Senate race</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1953489582.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.6422338568935,100,80.715532286213\" alt=\"Walz — white haired, balding, and clean shaven — raises a hand as he speaks at a podium, clad in a navy suit and white dress shirt.\" title=\"Walz — white haired, balding, and clean shaven — raises a hand as he speaks at a podium, clad in a navy suit and white dress shirt.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Walz, 60, is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. A <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/national/2024/07/who-is-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-one-of-the-top-contenders-for-vice-president/#:~:text=Tim%20Walz%20was%20a%20high,one%20of%20the%20student's%20wallets.\">former high school teacher</a>, he’s been in politics for decades, having started as a member of Congress in 2007. He received national attention for leading his party through a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-taxes-abortion-health-racial-justice-transportation-marijuana-c3cc7db0cd92c022817ef3ae41097c73\">2023 legislative session</a> that saw Democrats in the state achieve a litany of long-held ambitions, including on police reform, boosting education funding, marijuana legalization, abortion protections, child tax credits, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Walz is the <a href=\"https://www.kaaltv.com/news/approval-rates-for-minnesota-leaders/#\">well-liked leader</a> of a <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/presidential-race-ratings\">purplish state</a> with a record of advancing Democratic priorities through his state legislature and with <a href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/12/15/public-sector-unions-spend-more-on-politics-in-minnesota-than-in-nearly-any-other-state/\">strong ties to organized labor</a>. A Midwesterner, Walz could prove to be a useful surrogate for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-campaign-midwest-after-clinching-democratic-nomination-2024-03-13/\">shoring up support</a> in his own state, as well as ones like Michigan and Wisconsin. And like many of the other potential vice president picks on this list, he’s already proved to be a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2024/07/23/tim-walz-vice-president-kamala-harris-vet-minnesota\">strong Harris surrogate</a> on television news.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161807297_5538e2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Gov.

Andy Beshear</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Beshear, 46, is the governor of Kentucky and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/11/7/23950792/election-day-2023-kentucky-governors-race-results-democrats-republicans\">has won twice in a red state that previously overwhelmingly voted for Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As governor, he’s been praised for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as multiple crises in the state, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/11/23679512/louisville-kentucky-shooting-workplace\">a mass shooting at a bank</a> and severe flooding. Prior to this role, he also served as Kentucky’s attorney general.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Beshear is the rare Democrat who has been able to win multiple times in a red state and could offer additional appeal to some swing voters. In addition to the support he’s received for his leadership during various crises, he’s also touted infrastructure and private sector investment in the state during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike other possibilities, though, he probably wouldn’t increase Harris’s chances of winning his home state, which is solidly GOP.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160763179.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Gov.

Meslar/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\" />\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Gov. J.B. Pritzker</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>J.B. Pritzker, 59, is the governor of Illinois, a Democratic state that Biden and Clinton both won in 2020 and 2016. Before becoming governor, he was a businessman and philanthropist, and is a scion of the family behind Hyatt hotels, who’ve also been consistent and influential Democratic donors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As governor, Pritzker has established a modest national profile, including remarks he’s given attacking Trump and calls he’s made for more federal resources to address immigration in Illinois.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Pritzker has already built some name recognition as a fixture on cable news, and has proven to be a vocal Trump antagonist. Pritzker’s personal wealth could also potentially be a boon to the campaign, though his own state is not a battleground that would expand the Democratic map.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1394802139.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes. \" title=\"Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg attends a White House correspondents’ brunch on April 30, 2022, in Washington, DC. | Paul Morigi/Getty Images for White House Correspondents Insider\" data-portal-copyright=\"Paul Morigi/Getty Images for White House Correspondents Insider\" />\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Buttigieg, 42, is the secretary of transportation who rose to prominence as a former 2020 presidential candidate. He’s staked out more moderate positions and was previously mayor of South Bend, Indiana.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He’s become known for his media savvy and strong television appearances as an advocate for the Biden-Harris administration. He’s also had to respond to crises including the train accident and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science/2023/2/18/23603471/east-palestine-ohio-derailment-water-contamination-health\">chemical spill in East Palestine</a>, Ohio, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024/1/8/24030677/boeing-alaska-airlines-plane-737-max-door-plug\">Alaska Airlines mishap</a> when a door plug dropped out of a plane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Buttigieg has been a strong spokesperson for the Biden-Harris White House and is well-established among the Democratic electorate. He’s among the youngest of possible choices, would contribute more representation from the Midwest,<strong> </strong>and could appeal to centrist voters. He’d also become the first openly LGBTQ person to be on a presidential ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1490739327.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.737249202036,100,78.525501595929\" alt=\"Raimondo, a white woman with shoulder length brown hair, smiles slightly, her head tilted up and her chin in her hand, while wearing a pink suit.\" title=\"Raimondo, a white woman with shoulder length brown hair, smiles slightly, her head tilted up and her chin in her hand, while wearing a pink suit.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo testifies before the Senate Appropriations Committee May 16, 2023, in Washington, DC. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Win McNamee/Getty Images\" />\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Secretary Gina Raimondo</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is she?</strong> Raimondo is the former governor of Rhode Island, and currently serves as Biden’s secretary of commerce. As governor, she gained national attention for her <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/07/08/gina-raimondo-interview-rhode-island-governor-covid-353799\">approach to the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, which prioritized testing and tracing, and saw businesses reopening earlier than in many other states. As commerce secretary, she’s been a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/27/23277664/chips-act-solve-chip-shortage-biden-manufacturing\">vocal advocate for American manufacturing</a> and served as one of the faces of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/china/gina-raimondo-says-china-visit-aimed-at-protecting-u-s-economic-interests-d8ed39c9\">administration’s China policy</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for her? </strong>At 53, Raimondo — like many of the names on this list — is part of the next generation of Democratic leaders. She comes from an East Coast state, offering geographical diversity, and would bring business ties and foreign policy experience honed during her years as commerce secretary. She’d also make history, giving the United States its first presidential ticket featuring two women, something <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/commerce-secretary-gina-raimondo-discusses-harris-vp-search/\">Raimondo said</a> the country is “absolutely” ready for. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161013764_474f9c.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752616398754,100,78.494767202492\" alt=\"Gov.

Gavin Newsom</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Newsom, 56, is the governor of California, and a longstanding political personality. He’s been a vocal advocate for more progressive policies, and for Democrats to more directly confront Republicans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to being governor, he was also lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Newsom has already made clear that he wants to be a fighter for Democrats and has supporters who are interested in his approach. He’s also used opportunities like a debate against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to make some splashy points for the party and to get more attention, and could do the same for a possible campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As governor of California, however, he wouldn’t bring additional geographic diversity to the ticket, and he also wouldn’t help with delivering a swing state, as his own is solidly Democratic.&nbsp;In addition, Newsom and Harris are both Californians, so they’d also likely have to contend with issues raised by the 12th Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits two running mates from the same state.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Out of the running</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1247112367.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is she? </strong>Whitmer, 52, is the governor of Michigan, a key swing state with <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation\">15 Electoral College votes</a> that Biden won in 2020 and that Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s been a popular leader in this role, and was initially known for how much she emphasized infrastructure and “fixing the damn roads.” Since then she’s been an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and for gender equity, speaking openly about how she was sexually assaulted in college. Prior to being governor, Whitmer was a member of the state legislature and the first woman to become the Democratic leader of the state Senate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What was the case for her? </strong>She’s among the members of the list who have strong and positive national recognition, and who could help raise Democrats’ chances in a pivotal swing state. Whitmer has also focused on issues including infrastructure and health care, which could broaden Democrats’ appeal to moderate voters. And if Harris and Whitmer were on the same ticket, they would form a groundbreaking all-woman ticket — something that neither major party has run before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why she won&#8217;t be the new VP:</strong> Less than 24 hours after Biden endorsed Harris, Whitmer emphatically told reporters that she has no desire to be vice president. “I’m not planning to go anywhere,” <a href=\"https://x.com/kenvogel/status/1815417822056755621\">she said, adding</a>, “I am not leaving Michigan; I&#8217;m proud to be the governor of Michigan.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2159037882_26f6dd.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Gov.

Roy Cooper</strong></h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Cooper, 67, is the governor of North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2020 and 2016 that offers <a href=\"https://www.ncsbe.gov/about-elections/electoral-college\">16 electoral votes</a> (of the 270 needed to win). He’s known for winning repeatedly statewide even as other Democratic candidates have struggled to do the same for roles like the Senate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As governor, he’s also vetoed Republican bills on abortion and guns, and has strong approval <a href=\"https://abc11.com/post/2024-elections-could-governor-roy-cooper-replace-president/15011995/\">ratings overall</a>.

But for the first time since <a href=\"https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/history/hiv-and-aids-timeline\">1981</a>, when the disease first emerged, the majority of new HIV infections occurred outside of sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s a major milestone. The region — which includes 49 countries in southern, western, central, and eastern Africa — still bears the brunt of the epidemic. In 2023, <a href=\"https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/\">64 percent</a> of people living with HIV were in sub-Saharan Africa, and about 62 percent of all AIDS-related deaths from the disease occurred there. But in the past few decades, there has been tremendous progress. The number of people in sub-Saharan Africa becoming newly infected with HIV has plummeted from 2.1 million in 1993 to 640,000 within 30 years — a 70 percent drop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as the number of new infections in the region declines, progress in the rest of the world has been stalling, or even reversing, according to a <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2024/global-aids-update-2024\">recent report</a> from UNAIDS, the United Nations’ dedicated HIV and AIDS program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">New HIV infections in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East/North Africa have been increasing over the last two decades, due to a <a href=\"https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/regional_fs_latin_america.pdf\">variety</a> of <a href=\"https://www.prb.org/resources/hiv-in-the-middle-east-low-prevalence-but-not-low-risk/#:~:text=Growing%20evidence%20shows%20that%20people,MENA%20is%20a%20double%20bind.\">factors</a> including a lack of access to HIV testing and treatment, displacement and migration, and an uptick in the number of people using intravenous drugs. Before 2009, less than 10 percent of all new HIV infections occurred across those regions — but last year, that number rose to just over 20 percent.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ELnOV-new-hiv-infections-in-sub-saharan-africa-have-plummeted-3-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.156464814222,100,65.687070371556\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s good news that sub-Saharan Africa, the region historically most affected by HIV, has dramatically reduced the number of people newly infected with HIV. The fight against HIV, however, is far from over. Growing funding gaps and the possible partial closure of the US government’s most important HIV program threaten to stall progress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the success in Africa has demonstrated that sustained efforts can dramatically reduce the HIV burden and are worth investing in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why has sub-Saharan Africa been so successful?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have made huge gains in improving awareness of HIV and increasing access to HIV testing and treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, about 80 percent of people living with HIV there had access to <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-treatment-basics\">antiretroviral therapy</a>, the highest rate of any region in the world. Antiretroviral therapy, a combination of drugs that treat but do not cure HIV, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/10-things-know-about-hiv-suppression#:~:text=What%20is%20viral%20suppression%3F,is%20imperative%20to%20stay%20undetectable.\">prevents</a> the virus from replicating. After about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/evidence-of-hiv-treatment.html#:~:text=Time%20to%20viral%20suppression%3A%20Most,of%20people%20just%20starting%20ART.\">six months</a> of <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-treatment-basics#:~:text=treatment%20for%20HIV%3F-,The%20treatment%20for%20HIV%20is%20called%20antiretroviral%20therapy%20(ART).,HIV%20live%20longer%2C%20healthier%20lives.\">typically</a> daily treatment, the amount of the virus in most patient’s bodies is so low that they can no longer infect others. But just a few months or even a few days of missed therapy is enough to allow HIV to start replicating again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Antiretroviral therapy is critical for reducing the spread of HIV. And because of such high treatment rates, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of HIV-positive people who are no longer infectious at around 74 percent. (The report classifies Somalia, Djibouti, and Eritrea as part of the Middle East and North Africa.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A major focus of HIV programming in past decades has been testing pregnant women and then ensuring that HIV-positive pregnant women receive treatment throughout their pregnancy. This <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/hiv-and-aids/technical-areas/pmtct\">prevents</a> mothers from passing the virus on to their babies. In 2010, just over half of HIV-positive pregnant women in eastern and southern Africa were receiving HIV treatment, but by 2023, that rose to an estimated 94 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">National governments in sub-Saharan Africa have also made it a priority to build out local capacity to fight the disease. The majority of funding for HIV services now comes from domestic sources rather than foreign donors. Rather than relying on foreign researchers and international groups to implement HIV interventions, local organizations — which are more <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8887177/#:~:text=Community%2Dbased%20organizations%20(CBOs),informal%20medical%20and%20social%20services.\">integrated</a> into the communities they serve and are more attuned to local social and cultural challenges — are increasingly running the show. In 2023, local organizations received <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/hiv-and-aids/technical-areas/local-partner-transition#:~:text=In%20fiscal%20year%202022%20(October,went%20directly%20to%20local%20partners.\">59 percent</a> of HIV funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), a 72 percent increase since 2018, according to the agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Girls and women, gay men, and sex workers are disproportionately impacted by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and globally. Sexual intercourse is one of the key ways that HIV is <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids#:~:text=HIV%20is%20spread%20from%20the,with%20antiretroviral%20therapy%20(ART).\">spread</a>. <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/keywords/gender-based-violence#:~:text=The%20link%20between%20HIV%20and,their%20risk%20of%20contracting%20HIV.\">Gender-based violence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30404-8/fulltext#:~:text=Although%20relationships%20with%20older%20men%20might%20be,women%2C%20affect%20vulnerability%20in%20women%20in%20Africa.\">gender-based power disparities</a> can expose such populations to the disease. Notably, in sub-Saharan Africa, <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet\">62 percent</a> of new HIV infections in 2023 were among girls and women, whereas the majority of new HIV infections in the rest of the world is among males.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, social <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2024/july/20240722_eastern-europe-central-asia#:~:text=Stigma%2C%20criminalization%20and%20under%2Dinvestment,UNAIDS\">stigma</a>, criminalization, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/azerbaijan/news/item/30-11-2022-who-europe-and-ecdc-report-reveals-increasing-numbers-living-with-undiagnosed-hiv-in-the-region\">underdiagnosis</a>, and a lack of funding are driving an increase in HIV cases. Ukraine has long been an <a href=\"https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/eastern-europes-looming-health-crisis\">anomaly</a> in Europe, with much higher HIV infection rates than most other countries in the region. Most HIV services have been <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/War-Ukraine-special\">restored since</a> Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, but there is ongoing <a href=\"https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-023-00855-1\">fear</a> that the conflict may further delay major progress in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>HIV funding is dwindling&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The main driver of HIV progress, of course, is sustained investment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In sub-Saharan Africa, funding from international donors and local governments has contributed to the progress there. The region will need a steady, consistent flow to help sustain and build on achievements in reducing the HIV burden. Well-invested money can also alleviate some of the&nbsp;backsliding in progress in other regions, by ramping up HIV prevention and response activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But global funding for ending HIV is drying up. Between 2022 and 2023, global funding for HIV in low- and middle-income countries dropped 5 percent, or about <a href=\"https://hivfinancial.unaids.org/hivfinancialdashboards.html#\">$1 billion</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even as the gap between need and funding grows, the US Congress is mulling the end of one of the world’s largest HIV programs: the President&#8217;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, commonly known as PEPFAR. Since <a href=\"https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/pepfar-global-aids/pepfar#:~:text=Since%20PEPFAR's%20inception%20in%202003,strengthening%20global%20health%20and%20economic\">2003</a>, PEPFAR has provided over $100 billion total in aid to provide HIV treatment to millions of people and to bolster response and prevention activities, the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/pepfar-supported-countries-and-regions/\">majority</a> of which goes to African countries. Last year, PEPFAR funds represented about a <a href=\"https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/\">quarter</a> of total HIV funding in low- and middle-income countries from Haiti to Kenya to the Philippines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PEPFAR is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/opinion/pepfar-covid.html\">widely considered</a> to be one of the most successful global health programs in the world, but some US legislators have soured on the program because of its inherent ties to sexual and reproductive health. HIV programming around the world has focused on improving safe-sex knowledge and practices. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24036223/pepfar-aids-hiv-africa-global-health-george-w-bush-republicans-congress\">sticking point</a> for some conservative legislators is that some of the organizations that receive PEPFAR funds also provide abortion services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of this dispute, the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies introduced a bill last year that would have eliminated nearly <a href=\"https://nastad.org/blog/nastad-condemns-lhhs-appropriations-bill-would-cut-millions-vital-hivaids-prevention-and\">$500 million</a> in HIV funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and over $3 billion in funding for the National Institutes for Health. Moreover, parts of the PEPFAR legislation are subject to congressional reauthorization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">PEPFAR has been reauthorized <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/pepfar-reauthorization-side-by-side-of-existing-and-proposed-legislation/\">three times</a>, for a period of five years each time. But last year after PEPFAR partially <a href=\"https://nastad.org/blog/expiration-pepfar-threatens-decades-long-legacy-bipartisanship-global-hiv-prevention\">expired</a>, members of Congress debated&nbsp;whether to renew it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After a prolonged standoff, largely along party lines, the omnibus funding bill passed in March 2024 <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/pepfars-short-term-reauthorization-sets-an-uncertain-course-for-its-long-term-future/\">reauthorizing</a> the program, but only for one year. Come next March, debates around PEPFAR will resume. Sub-Saharan Africa has achieved amazing progress but if the program is not extended, there will be a huge hole in the global HIV response. Millions of lives may be threatened. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em> newsletter. </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Even as conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East rage, defense planners and economic policymakers have kept their eye on the People’s Republic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From disputes over <a href=\"https://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/Could-the-US-and-China-actually-go-to-war-over-Taiwan-Imagining-the-unimaginable-ac08ba446e8ca4c4285b79969439856a1\">Taiwan</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349\">South China Sea</a>, to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-tariffs-electric-vehicles-evs-solar-2024ba735c47e04a50898a88425c5e2c\">trade policy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/balancing-ledger-export-controls-us-chip-technology-china\">export controls</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-visit-chinas-xi-deepen-strategic-partnership-2024-05-15/\">China’s improving ties with Vladimir Putin’s Russia</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-xinjiang-uyghurs-muslims-repression-genocide-human-rights\">human rights</a>, to China’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/china-army/\">military build-up</a>, there are no shortage of flashpoints in the world’s most important bilateral relationship, and no shortage of ways for peaceful competition and rivalry to quickly transform into something more dangerous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The official on the front lines of that relationship is US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns. A career diplomat who previously served as ambassador to Greece and to NATO, as well as undersecretary of state for political affairs, Burns was dispatched to China by President Joe Biden in 2022. Burns recently spoke by phone from Beijing with Vox to discuss a range of issues, including Taiwan, trade tensions, and whether or not we’re in a “new Cold War.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>It seems like every month or so now there’s a new <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710053/new-cold-wars-by-david-e-sanger-with-mary-k-brooks/\">book</a> or <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-10-19/new-cold-war\">article</a> about how we’re in a “new Cold </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/World-Brink-America-Twenty-First-Century/dp/1541704096\"><strong>War</strong></a><strong>” with China. Do you agree with that framing? Is this a new Cold War?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You know, I’m old enough that the first 10 years of my career were during the last Cold War. I worked for President George H.W. Bush on Soviet affairs. I was working with [Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice at the time. That was a four-decade conflict against a very powerful country, the Soviet Union, but more of a one-dimensional power: a military, nuclear weapons power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The situation we’re in right now, the rivalry and competition between China and the West, I think it’s too simplistic to say, well, this is just another Cold War. China poses a different kind of threat to the United States. It’s a much more powerful economic force in the world than the Soviet Union ever was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Think about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvXROXiIpvQ\">China’s Belt Road Initiative</a>, which has given China global reach in all parts of the world. China is the world’s greatest manufacturing and export power. I think China is a more considerable threat than the Soviet Union ever was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So I think we need a new name for it. The way to think about this is that we’re going to have to compete with China in the future, for this decade and well over the next decade.&nbsp;We’re the two largest economies. We’re certainly competing militarily to see who’s going to be a more powerful force in the Indo-Pacific, which is a very important part of the world. And of course, we have completely opposite ideas about human freedom, about human rights, about individual rights, about freedom of speech, and freedom of the press and freedom of religion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are also some issues where we’re ready to work with China. Climate change is one. China’s the largest global emitter of carbon. We’re number two, and we&#8217;re trying to work together to help the world face the challenge of climate change. Fentanyl is a second issue, where we’re trying to work with China to reduce the presence of that synthetic opioid in the United States, which is such an incredibly serious public health crisis for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, I think we’ve got to look at China in a very different way than the old Soviet Union.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You’re among the US officials who have recently called out the Chinese government for providing technology and components used by the Russian military in Ukraine. In fact, you said that China has “</strong><a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2024/06/us-ambassador-calls-chinas-tech-support-for-russia-during-ukraine-invasion-a-major-mistake/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20think%20it's%20a%20major,brutal%20war%2C%E2%80%9D%20Burns%20said.\"><strong>effectively sided with Russia</strong></a><strong>.”&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Would it be fair to say that the war in Ukraine is in some ways becoming a proxy war between China and the US, or at least a domain of the rivalry you’re talking about?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, for the United States, the war in Ukraine is a pivotal conflict because we are dedicated to the security of Europe, to freedom in Europe, and to the indivisibility of Europe. We don’t want to see dividing lines reappear in Europe. That was the old Cold War.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the problem is, the government here in Beijing says, “Well, we’re neutral in this war. We want peace.” But that’s not really the reality. The reality is that Chinese companies are <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/research/chinas-position-russias-invasion-ukraine#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20officials%20add%20that,to%20make%20propellants%20for%20weapons.\">providing substantial economic support</a> to the Russian war machine, the Russian defense-industrial base. In fact, they’re providing critical microelectronics and dual-use technologies, without which the Russians would not be able to prosecute this war.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And so our warning to the Chinese is, you’ve got to stop your companies from providing this assistance to Russia. And if you don’t stop, we’re going to sanction you. We’ve already <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/us-sanctions-china-russia-ukraine-war/index.html\">sanctioned a considerable number of Chinese firms</a>. We are prepared to continue that and sanction more if the government of China doesn’t use this considerable influence here in its own country to stop this behavior by Chinese companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>China and the Philippines recently reached a deal </strong><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/philippines-china-shoal-agreement-3450e06b61bbe6ef9cd5dd9e211f6f79\"><strong>aimed at tamping down</strong></a><strong> tensions in the South China Sea, over the disputed Second Thomas Shoal.

Should Americans be concerned about this spiraling into a conflict that could drag in the United States?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We welcome the recent announcement by the Philippines and by the People’s Republic of China as to how they’re going to try to work with each other on the issue of the Second Thomas Shoal, and we hope that there can be a deescalation of tensions. But make no mistake — we are entirely in support of the Philippines. As you mentioned, we have the <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/phil001.asp\">1951 mutual defense treaty with the Philippines</a>. Article four of that treaty covers Second Thomas Shoal, the territory in question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We have been absolutely clear to the leadership of China. I have done so, and of course, our senior officials in Washington have done so, that that treaty obligation is one that we are very, very certain about, and that we hope that China will back off from its extravagant legal claims, not just to the Second Thomas Shoal but to much of the Spratlys and the Paracel Islands of the South China Sea and to the Senkakus in the East China Sea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">China has <a href=\"https://2017-2021.state.gov/chinas-military-aggression-in-the-indo-pacific-region/#:~:text=Beijing%20uses%20intimidation%20to%20undermine,of%20access%20to%20their%20livelihoods.\">pushed out and militarized</a> a lot of the islands and islets in this region over the last 10 years or so. They have been <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/research/south-china-sea-arbitration-ruling-what-happened-and-whats-next\">repudiated</a> by international court decisions and they don’t have the law behind them. And so we are very much in support of the Philippines on this particular matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I’m sure you’re at least keeping an eye on politics here in the United States. Former President Donald Trump has </strong><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTaiwan%20should%20pay%20us%20for,different%20than%20an%20insurance%20company.%E2%80%9D\"><strong>said</strong></a><strong>, in effect, that Taiwan should have to pay for its own defense, and has </strong><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8\"><strong>accused it of stealing semiconductor business</strong></a><strong> from the US. Does uncertainty about the future political situation in the US make it hard to communicate US positions to your Chinese counterparts over issues like Taiwan?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m not going to comment on our election, and I’m not going to respond to statements made in the electoral process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I can tell you this: on the issue of Taiwan, our policy hasn’t changed. The United States has had a consistent <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-why-does-it-matter\">One China Policy</a> since the 1970s and President Biden has made it clear that our policy is unchanged. What we want on this very difficult issue is a peaceful resolution, and we specifically believe that China should commit itself to a peaceful resolution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Obviously over the last nearly two years now, since then-<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/nancy-pelosi-visit-taipei-taiwan-trip/index.html\">Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi’s</a> visit to Taiwan in early August of 2022 — and by the way, we support and continue to support her right to visit, and the right of members of Congress to visit Taiwan — we want and hope that the authorities here in Beijing will commit to peace and stop the intimidating statements they’ve made over the last couple of years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Would you encourage more members of Congress to visit Taiwan?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s up to members of Congress to decide where they’re going to travel in the world. Congress is a coequal branch of the US government with the executive branch. All I can say is that if members of Congress want to visit Taiwan, they obviously have a right to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Earlier you mentioned climate change as one potential area for cooperation between the US and China. In May, the </strong><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-tariffs-electric-vehicles-evs-solar-2024ba735c47e04a50898a88425c5e2c\"><strong>US raised tariffs</strong></a><strong> on Chinese electric vehicles, batteries, and solar panels. Is there a contradiction there? If we’re serious about fighting climate change, isn’t there an argument that we should encourage China to flood the world with cheap EVs and solar panels?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t think there’s a contradiction. On the one hand, we do want to work with China. We’re the two largest carbon emitters — China being the largest carbon emitter in the world — and we want to work with China to help our two countries and the rest of the world to respond to this existential challenge, which climate change certainly is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, one of the lessons we learned from the pandemic is that no country should want to rely on a single source of supply for critical materials. And so what President Biden has done under the Inflation Reduction Act is now to try to stimulate green energy research, and green energy production in the United States. We don’t want to have to rely on a single source for lithium batteries or solar panels or electric vehicles. We want to stimulate that production in our own country, which the IRA funds are doing right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Certainly, one of the problems that we have with China right now is that China, in those three categories that I mentioned — lithium batteries, electric vehicles, and solar panels — is now <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3262505/how-chinas-ev-overcapacity-has-come-head-after-15-years-and-whats-store-industrial-policy-race-us\">producing well beyond domestic demand</a> in China. It’s beginning to try to sell these technologies below the cost of production and dump them on foreign markets with a design of trying to harm the domestic green industries in places like the European Union or Brazil or Mexico, Canada, and the United States. And that’s not fair. It’s not wise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t want to see 95 percent of the production of these key technologies in just one country. We should want to see a diversification of supply. And it’s not just the United States, Josh. Turkey, Canada, the European Union, Brazil have <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/foreign-subsidy-instrument-china-export-threat/\">all taken actions</a> against China because they’re trying to dump their products on the rest of the world, and that’s going to be a job killer. We went through a “China Shock” in the United States at the beginning of this century, where well more than a million Americans <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/china-shock#:~:text=Coined%20by%20economists%20David%20H,than%202%20million%20American%20jobs.\">lost their jobs</a> because of Chinese products being dumped in our market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve made the argument to the Chinese leadership here that you cannot expect us to stand by and do nothing if you’re trying to, in a very unfair way, harm our domestic industry. So I think from a climate and environment perspective, we Americans are going to be much better off if we can have our own sources of production. That’s good for our economy, but it’s also very good for our fight against climate change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Speaking of the China Shock, here in DC, it does feel like there’s been a </strong><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/27/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-renewing-american-economic-leadership-at-the-brookings-institution/\"><strong>reassessment of the economic orthodoxy</strong></a><strong> of that period. Certainly, the idea that China would inevitably democratize as it opened up to trade has proven incorrect. But from your current perspective, do you feel that Chinese economic growth is a net positive for the United States? Does a rising tide still lift all boats?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would say two things. First, there’s no question that we have to adhere to the lessons of what [we] just went through in the Covid crisis, and make sure that we are doing everything we can to build up domestic sources of supply in the United States, so that we can be self-sufficient in areas that are critical to our national security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second point, however, is we have a very strong and large economic relationship between the United States and China. China is our third largest trade partner, after our two North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico. And there are thousands of American companies doing business here. We think there are at least 750,000 American jobs that <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/speeches/2022/11/remarks-us-secretary-commerce-gina-raimondo-us-competitiveness-and-china\">depend on trade</a> with China. And so we’re not trying to decouple the two economies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What we’ve done is follow a policy of de-risking, and that means we’re trying to make sure that on critical materials like advanced semiconductors, we’re not going to permit the sale of advanced semiconductors for AI processes into the Chinese market, because that would simply give the People’s Liberation Army an advantage that we don’t want them to have. But trade, in most other areas, is open between the United States and China, and we think that’s good for our economy and probably for the global economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>On the topic of decoupling, I can remember 20 years ago or so when I was in college, there was a huge interest in studying Chinese, in travel to China. And it feels like that’s really changed as tensions between the countries have grown. Fewer people </strong><a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/decline-of-american-students-in-china-could-mean-fewer-experts/7668461.html\"><strong>are learning the language</strong></a><strong>, fewer Americans are studying in China. I’m sure you’re always in the market for smart American China specialists. Is there a concern we are losing out on expertise as fewer Americans are engaged with China and Chinese issues?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I am concerned about that. To give your point a data point, we had <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/china/2024/05/23/the-number-of-american-students-in-china-is-going-up-again\">15,000 American students</a> studying here a decade ago. We have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/china/american-student-enrollment-china-schools-91fe69d6\">just 800 American students</a> here now. That&#8217;s because of Zero Covid, the Chinese policy that really shut down this country so Americans couldn’t come here for a number of years, and now they’re coming back in very small numbers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do think it’s a national security issue. We Americans are going to be competing with China for global power well into the 2030s and perhaps beyond. And so we need to have lots of young Americans who speak Mandarin, who’ve had a formative experience here in China, who understand the country, the history, and culture of China.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re going to live with China. We’ll compete with China. We have an enormous number of differences with the government of the People’s Republic, but we also have to coexist, and we have to live together in peace, and that’s going to take lots of smart young Americans, hopefully, who will come to China over the next several years to develop that kind of expertise, whether they go into the public sector or the private sector, or the nonprofit sector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t want to see some kind of permanent separation of our population. We want to see American students return, tourists return, and a healthy business relationship. That’s the way to be smart about the competition with China and yet to make sure that we’re living peacefully with China as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I’m curious about your relationship with your Chinese counterparts there. Given the level of competition and tension, do you ever find it hard to maintain a cordial working relationship with them?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, if you’re speaking about the government here, my job is to be the American conduit, the American link into the government of China. So I see Chinese officials all the time. I can tell you this: I have a civil, courteous relationship with them and I think they do with me. I think that’s important, the kind of respect that you show each other. But these are often very tough conversations. We are on the opposite sides of all of these major issues and my job is to defend America. My job is to be clear about the differences that we have. And my job is to sometimes warn the government of China when we have substantial disagreements with them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s been interesting to me. I’m a long-time diplomat. I started as an intern at the State Department back in 1980, 44 years ago. So I’ve been at this a long time. Sometimes the Chinese press will criticize me; “Oh, Ambassador, your job is to be nice to us. Your job is to be a bridge.” And I say, “Well, my job is actually to defend the United States, to defend our interests.” And sometimes you can’t be best friends.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, July 31, 2 pm ET:</strong> An earlier version of this story, published July 31, contained a typo.

Kamala Harris listens during a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. | Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Kamala Harris ran for president in 2020, her critics from the left argued that her record as a prosecutor was out of line with where the Democratic Party should be headed, especially after movements like Black Lives Matter turned the country’s attention to racism in law enforcement. She was too <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/07/kamala-harris-san-francisco-district-attorney-crime/\">tough on crime</a> during her days as the San Francisco district attorney and as California’s attorney general, some argued, and her policies only helped <a href=\"https://prospect.org/justice/how-kamala-harris-fought-to-keep-nonviolent-prisoners-locked-up/\">fuel mass incarceration</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris, on the other hand, spoke about her own record in starkly different terms. During her time as a prosecutor, Harris argued, she was a reformer — she wasn’t tough on crime but “<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/kamala-harris-smart-on-crime-book\">smart on crime</a>.” In another book she wrote before her 2020 presidential campaign, she <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/26/nx-s1-5048844/how-a-president-harris-might-handle-criminal-justice-issues\">billed herself</a> as a “progressive prosecutor,” a label that many <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html\">disagreed with</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Harris and her supporters have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Yr4U5Clls\">leaning into her prosecutor past</a>, eagerly framing this election as one of a prosecutor versus a felon. “I took on perpetrators of all kinds — predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,” Harris <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11997861/kamala-harris-pitch-as-former-prosecutor-didnt-take-during-2020-race-this-time-might-be-different\">said in a recent speech</a>. “So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But despite Harris pointing to her record as a tough prosecutor when it came to serious crimes, Republicans have been trying to cast her as too soft on crime, blaming her and fellow Democrats for a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361165/rnc-2024-make-america-safe-again-trump-gop-false-crime-wave\">crime wave</a> that, by all accounts, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns\">seems to have subsided</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The truth, however, is that much like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election\">her policy positions and priorities</a>, her record as a prosecutor doesn’t fit into a neatly defined box.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While she might not have been a progressive prosecutor by today’s standards — the kind of prosecutor who focuses on reducing incarceration rates rather than sending more people to prison — she was also driven by a reformist mindset when she became district attorney in 2004. Her incremental approach to change was highlighted by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record\">some programs she would later champion</a> that provided alternatives to incarceration for first-time offenders, including jobs training and school enrollment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a speech launching her 2020 presidential campaign, Harris showed she wasn’t oblivious to the damage prosecutors can do to people’s lives. “Too many black and brown Americans are locked up. From mass incarceration to cash bail to policing, our criminal justice system needs drastic repair,” <a href=\"https://www.ktvu.com/news/transcript-kamala-harris-kicks-off-presidential-campaign-in-oakland\">she said</a>. When it came to her own record, she said, “At a time when prevention and redemption were not in the vocabulary or mindset of most district attorneys, we created an initiative to get skills and job training instead of jail time for young people arrested for drugs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are limits, however, to how much Harris can credibly claim that she was a reformer — she also had a record of <a href=\"https://prospect.org/justice/how-kamala-harris-fought-to-keep-nonviolent-prisoners-locked-up/\">making people serve longer sentences</a> than necessary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what should people make of Harris’s actual legacy on criminal justice? The short answer is: It’s complicated.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Harris’s priorities as a prosecutor</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s record as a prosecutor is difficult to define in clear ideological terms in part because it includes many contradictions — supporting diversion programs for young people on the one hand, while <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-14/kamala-harris-offices-fought-payments-to-wrongly-convicted?embedded-checkout=true\">pushing back</a> against wrongful conviction claims on the other. In many ways, her time as a prosecutor looked like a balancing act: She pushed for a fairer criminal justice system at a time when prosecutors were far less concerned about unjust outcomes, but she also made sure to never push too far.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before she became district attorney, she prosecuted cases of child sexual assault and domestic violence, a priority <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/does-kamala-harris-record-show-183449442.html\">she brought with her into the DA’s office</a>. But some sexual assault survivors have criticized Harris, saying <a href=\"https://apnews.com/united-states-presidential-election-general-news-ecc0da5f6ac94b13be11e2a388967a85\">she didn’t go far enough</a> to combat sexual assault.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it came to other issues, Harris walked a similar line. One example was her position on the death penalty. Harris, a vocal critic of capital punishment, vowed not to pursue it when she was campaigning for district attorney, and followed through by <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/07/27/kamala-harris-prosecutor-california-police-election-crime\">declining to seek a death sentence</a> against a man who killed a police officer. That was a tall order given the pressure she faced at the time from fellow politicians and police unions. But despite that stance, she defended the state’s policy on capital punishment, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-death-penalty-appeal-20140821-story.html\">appealing a federal court ruling</a> that deemed California’s death penalty unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On police reform, Harris was similarly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-policing.html\">reform-minded but fell short</a> of what advocates would have liked to see. As California’s attorney general, she launched the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-first-its-kind-criminal-justice-open\">OpenJustice initiative</a>, creating a public database of the state’s statistics on crime and police use-of-force, and implemented racial bias training. But she also didn’t shy away from heavy-handed law enforcement — as was the case when it came to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-marijuana-stance-policy/74495543007/\">marijuana laws</a>, or her <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/10/17/924766186/the-story-behind-kamala-harriss-truancy-program\">more controversial anti-truancy policy</a>, which threatened to arrest and prosecute parents whose children skipped school.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Harris’s prosecutor past will matter in 2024</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris likes to contrast her career with Trump’s by focusing on the fact that she’s a prosecutor at heart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Harris will be walking a tightrope whenever she leans on her prosecutor bona fides, risking alienating progressive voters who take issue with the tough-on-crime elements of her record. “I don’t know what Harris could possibly do to regain the trust of those who are intimately familiar with the ways she, like any other prosecutor, has sent people to prison and made a career off of appearing to be tough on crime,” said Wanda Bertram, a communication strategist at the Prison Policy Initiative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, that tension that Harris faces underscores why Republicans’ attacks on her as too soft on crime aren’t based in reality: She has plenty of evidence to point to that shows she was, at times, a tough-on-crime prosecutor. She also has plenty of evidence that shows she was, at other times, a reformer. And over the next few months, Harris will have to decide which part of her legacy as a prosecutor she wants to run on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if her record is any indication, she’ll probably try to avoid those kinds of black-and-white labels altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>This story originally appeared in&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Today, Explained</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Woodward and Bernstein were paid a $55,000 advance for <em>All the President’s Men</em>, and then a record-breaking $1.55 million deal for paperback rights to the sequel (about $10 million, in 2024 dollars). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That sequel, <em>The Final Days</em>, came out two years later but didn’t have that same air of revelation. Just Nixon handing the keys over to Vice President Gerald Ford; unsettling silent staffers with threats of suicide; getting drunk and roaming the White House, looking for Henry Kissinger. “Henry,” says Nixon at one point, falling to his knees, “we need to pray.” It wasn’t nearly as successful as its predecessor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Woodward and Bernstein didn’t invent<em> </em>journalistic<em> </em>White House tell-alls — the now-routine book-length investigation of an ongoing presidency — but they did add a flash of glamour and intrigue to a genre that, then as now, has never been very popular. Profitable? Sure; but only briefly, until the scoops get swept up in the news cycle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet the tradition endures, with Woodward — a figurehead in the field — forging ahead solo with exposés about George H.W. Bush in 1991, followed by two books about the Clinton administration, four about Bush Jr.’s, two about Obama’s, and four on Trump’s. But even these grand displays by the master of the form, so dignified and thorough, are largely forgotten after a quick burst of sales and scandal and TV appearances. Still, they come out in droves: Jonathan Karl gives us one trilogy (<em>Front Row at the Trump Show, Betrayal, Tired of Winning</em>), Michael Wolff gave us another (<em>Fire and Fury, Siege, Landslide</em>), Woodward a third (<em>Fear, Rage, Peril</em>). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump era saw a mini-boom of these titles. There was Rick Reilly’s <em>Commander in Cheat, </em>Maggie Haberman’s <em>Confidence Man,</em> Bill O’Reilly’s <em>United States of Trump </em>— billed as “a rare insider’s look at the life of Donald Trump.” Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker gave us both <em>A Very Stable Genius </em>and <em>I Alone Can Fix It.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, these are distinct from the memoirs, which tell the life story of someone whose claim to fame was a few interactions with the president (Think: James Comey’s <em>A Higher Loyalty,</em> Bill Barr’s <em>One Damn Thing After Another</em>, or the two books Anthony Scaramucci got out of his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/7/31/16071196/anthony-scaramucci-communications-director-fired-trump\">week-and-change as White House director of communications</a>). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There have been markedly fewer of these titles under Biden — but not none, and the trend continues. Publishers stand to earn fortunes, and authors to gain career-making exposure, but the risks are just as steep. For all the money Michael Wolff made with <em>Fire and Fury</em>, his blockbuster tell-all about then-President Trump’s first year in office, check out the stammering tension he exudes when <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DZbYAdOdqEw?si=Ug-iOktBJoabU6M2&amp;t=363\">grilled</a> about suggesting, “between the lines,” that Trump was sleeping with then-Ambassador to the United Nations (and future campaign opponent) Nikki Haley. Consider, by extension, the precipitous drop in his next two volumes’ popularity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Writing a book-length critique about the shortcomings of White House executives (i.e., extremely type-A careerist obsessives) is a laborious way to make enemies. So why do authors and publishers take the risk? </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The math of journalistic tell-alls</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For John Cavalier, owner of Cavalier House and Beausoleil bookstores in Louisiana, the White House tell-all is in the same league as politician memoirs and the news-pundit screeds: He tries to ignore them all. “[Whoever’s] on top of the polls this week might have a scandal next week  …  It’s just so hard to figure out the math of it … I’ve been a bookseller since 2003, and it used to be Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly books. They’d sell real good for two weeks, then a few months later they’re traded in.” And at that point “it’s pretty much over with.” The books go on the dollar cart. Clearance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re prestige projects,” says Andrew R. Albanese, executive editor at <em>Publishers Weekly</em>, “calling cards. The hope is, if [the publisher] can establish some kind of [political] audience, they’ll get ‘the big one,’” something like the President Barack Obama memoir. “They’re establishing credentials.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“They’re prestige projects”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He describes it as a front-loaded market, meaning that a typical White House tell-all, if it’s good, will come out to a quick spike in sales, often it’ll make the New York Times<em> </em>bestseller list, enjoying maybe two weeks of coverage — and then it’s a hard plunge into discount piles, thrift stores, obscurity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an arc that Mitchell Kaplan, owner of Books &amp; Books and co-founder of the Miami Book Fair International, has observed over his four decades as a bookseller. The books that are “embargoed before they come out  … there’s a big expectation of revelation. [Customers] come, they buy it in a couple weeks, but then it’s all over the news. People feel they got it.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kaplan agrees these titles have been front-loaded for 40 years, but reader interest is getting harder to hold.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Sometimes, in the past,” Kaplan explains, “[publishers] would maybe give first-review rights for a certain outlet. What’s happening now is that information is so diffuse, there isn’t one media outlet that can drive a book anymore. Used to be, if you had the cover of <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, that drove it. But there has to be a longer promotional arc leading up to publication now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If a 24-hour news cycle doesn’t roll a title out of competition, there’s a risk of world events changing the narrative. Historian and political analyst Jonathan Alter — whose books <em>The Promise </em>(2010) and <em>The Center Holds </em>(2013) were among the first about Barack Obama’s presidency — feels mostly confident that what he was seeing and hearing while writing those books against urgent deadlines has been confirmed by history to be accurate. “I was trying to … put on my historian hat and to look at what might be of interest … years down the road. So in my first book, <em>The Promise, </em>I made a big thing about health care, which became Obamacare. … If I hadn’t, I don’t think the book would hold up as well.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That first book hit No. 4 on the New York Times<em> </em>bestseller list. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its follow-up, about the 2012 election, wasn’t so lucky. The story is still significant, he argues, because Obama’s experience with the Tea Party presages Hillary Clinton’s and Joe Biden’s experience with MAGA, “So I was focused on what I still think of as a very compelling election, but nonetheless one of less enduring historical significance than the ones that surrounded it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Franklin Foer, a staff writer at the Atlantic, experienced something similar with his recent book about the Biden presidency. What’s significant in Foer’s case is the publication date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Last Politician</em> was released on September 5, 2023, and it shows that one of Biden’s strengths as a new president was he could pull the reins on Benjamin Netanyahu’s increasingly flagrant bombing campaigns in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Hey man,” he tells Bibi over the phone, “we’re out of runway here. It’s over.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“And then,” writes Foer, “like that, it was.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Note the Old Testament language there. Foer’s doesn’t hide his admiration for the president, and there are moments where the suspenseful, high-stakes tone tilts toward reverence. If writers of these tell-alls are often humbled by the weight of their subject, Foer trends occasionally toward awe; not of his characters, necessarily, but of his larger subject. His access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On October 7, almost exactly one month after <em>Last Politician</em>’s release, Hamas, designated by many nations as a terrorist organization, invaded Israel and murdered over a thousand civilians. The attack galvanized a military response that Netanyahu has now escalated to the point of nearly 40,000 Palestinian deaths, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-05-14/#:~:text=Gaza%20death%20toll%3A%20how%20many%20Palestinians%20has%20Israel's%20campaign%20killed,-By%20Reuters&amp;text=GENEVA%2C%20July%2010%20(Reuters),million%20people%20from%20their%20homes.\">according to the Palestinian Health Ministry,</a> most of whom are civilians. Protests have sustained around the world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does it change much about Foer’s book that the Biden-Netanyahu relationship, once a symbol of the president’s diplomatic savvy, has changed so radically? Sort of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Does it change much about Foer’s book that the Biden-Netanyahu relationship has changed so radically? Sort of.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Foer did his research and presented the facts as they were. That those facts had a shelf-life of exactly one month is hardly his fault.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You always want the timing to work out,” says Alter. “Frank’s book is terrific. It might’ve been overtaken by events on Netanyahu, but it gets deep inside [Biden’s] achievements and what kind of a president he is. … That’s different from the fly-on-the-wall thing,” referring to the more scandal-focused, tabloid-flavor tell-alls we got during the Trump years, such as <em>A Very Stable Genius</em> or <em>Front Row at the Trump Show</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“[That’s] its own genre.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So why do it?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first tell-all from the Trump era was Michael Wolff’s <em>Fire and Fury</em>. In a subgenre whose titles age so quickly, it’s easy to forget that, at the time of its release, <em>Fire and Fury</em> was a near-<em>Harry</em> <em>Potter</em>-level<em> </em>phenomenon in publishing. On the Thursday before its January 9 release, President Trump sent a cease-and-desist to the publisher, Macmillan, demanding “a full and complete retraction and apology.” Macmillan’s CEO, John Sargent, responded to the letter with a public rebuke, calling Trump’s demand unconstitutional, and bumping the book’s publication to the next day: Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A trolling Wolff <a href=\"https://x.com/MichaelWolffNYC/status/949023092357128194\">tweeted</a>, “Thank you, Mr. President.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kramerbooks in Washington, DC, hosted a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/367558-dc-bookstore-sold-out-of-fire-and-fury-20-minutes-after/\">midnight release</a>, with customers lining up to the back of the store. They sold out in 20 minutes. So did bookstores around the country. <em>Fire and Fury</em> broke a <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/fire-and-fury-is-fastest-selling-book-ever-for-henry-holt/\">first-week sales record for its imprint, Henry Holt</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2018/12/11/worlds-highest-paid-authors-2018-michael-wolff/\">Forbes</a><em> </em>soon estimated that — with his advance, residuals, film, and TV deals — Wolff had earned about $13 million for the project.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bob Woodward was already working on his own book, <em>Fear</em>, to be released eight months later, but other journalists likely took notice of <em>Fire and Fury</em>’s success, the public’s appetite for a tome of White House insider gossip. They imagined the sort of book they<em> </em>might write, if given a chance; especially considering Wolff’s own less-than-fantastic reputation (one reviewer of <em>Fire and Fury</em> called him <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/books/review/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-trump-white-house.html\">“a grotesque Boswell to Trump’s Johnson,”</a> conceding at least to capitalize the J).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only issue is, who’s got that kind of access?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After Wolff, the Trump administration raised its guard, and hence all subsequent tell-alls (the bestsellers, at least) were written by big names in journalism, reporters who were bound to have access because they were backed by major outlets, like Jonathan Karl (ABC News), Susan Glasser and Peter Baker (New Yorker and New York Times), Carol D. Leonnig and Philip Rucker (both of Washington Post), and Maggie Haberman (New York Times). Each of these authors is a seasoned reporter and theirs are the political insights that inform so much of the voting demographic, but their books were sold on the basis of something more commercially viable: their access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For all their variety you might find in the details of these books, their introductions are strikingly uniform. The author sets up a scene in medias res, showing themselves engaged somehow with the material (ideally the president himself), after which they posit a thesis and then show their credentials. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That last part, the badge-flashing, happens on a sliding scale of humility and creativity. Jonathan Karl, for instance, opens <em>Front Row at the Trump Show </em>with a Huck Finn-type wonder at what it’s like, on Inauguration Day, to walk through a White House-in-transition, how humbled he is to be there, to conduct the very first one-sentence interview with the president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s simple and it’s charming, but it’s also calculated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What the author seems at pains to convey through these personal anecdotes is that, though friendly with Trump, he knows the man is dishonest and flashy and vain. Failing to observe these things, he’ll sound naive and therefore unreliable; however, by boasting of his longstanding relationship to Trump in spite of those qualities, he risks suggesting (admitting?) that the way one suffers an opportunistic colleague is by being opportunistic oneself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maggie Haberman, meanwhile, opens her own 2022 Trump book, <em>Confidence Man</em>, with a phone call: The setting is 2016 and she confronts Trump over the phone about the fact that his presidential campaign has just been endorsed by David Duke, former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. After he reads out a press-friendly line — coached, he explains, by “my two Jewish lawyers” — about antisemitism, Haberman asks him if that’s it. Trump responds, in earnest, “What do you need me to say?” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like Karl’s lonely punctual stroll through the corridors of power, this moment conveys to its reader — in tone, character, power dynamics — that the author is speaking privately with the future president; she’s asking him challenging questions, and he, in turn, is asking her for cues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, their task is to heighten the reader’s sense of intimacy to the most powerful person in the world. Consider how the cover art for these books all show their subject — Trump and Biden alike — in horrendous pore-gaping closeup. Jonathan Karl’s latest book, tilting the formula, shows instead a fatigued-looking Trump, walking alone, head hanging and necktie loosened, over a stretch of White House lawn at night. Solitary, contemplative, vulnerable.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Books_Vox_7-23_605890.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=24.0359375,0,51.928125,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Without the perspective of history, the allure of the White House tell-all is the allure of the tell-all itself: voyeurism. Seeing what influential people are doing when they think nobody’s looking. Seeing the powerful brought down and made ordinary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">2024 marks the 50th anniversary of <em>All the President’s Men</em>. After four years of unending scandal in the Trump administration, sparking the White House tell-all back to blockbuster status, it has receded again, under the Biden administration, into a kind of curio. Chris Whipple’s book about Biden’s first two years in office, <em>Fight of His Life</em>, was released on January 17, 2023. As of June 2024, it has sold 5,000 copies, according to BookScan. Foer’s <em>Last Politician</em>, approaching its first anniversary, has sold 13,000. The numbers might not be big, if the president is not himself dramatic or polarizing or all that interesting, but they’re still bestsellers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Swap out the years, the names, the faces — they all boil down to the most memorable image from <em>The Final Days</em>: Nixon on his knees. Tugging Kissinger down there with him. Drunk. Desperate. “Henry, we need to pray.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These books show us a powerful figure with his head bowed, kneeling, begging forgiveness of someone unseen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the reader, looking down at the page, it’s a great vantage from which to render judgment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Tim Walz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All these contenders have their upsides. Walz is a Midwestern veteran who plays a great <a href=\"https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1815951829479330211\">no-nonsense</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/1698761196730540472\">folksy dad</a> on TV and repeatedly won a <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/what-you-should-know-about-gov-tim-walz-s-record-in-office-amid-vp-speculation/600387263/#:~:text=Congressional%20career,on%20Veterans'%20Affairs%20in%202017.\">Republican-leaning</a>, rural congressional district before becoming governor. Kelly is <a href=\"https://www.kelly.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/kelly-secures-funding-to-strengthen-border-security-enhance-military-readiness-support-workforce-programs-and-more-in-final-annual-government-funding-package/\">a border hawk</a> whose ascension to the Democratic ticket could theoretically mitigate Harris’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/trump-campaign-ad-harris-immigration.html\">vulnerability on immigration</a>. Plus, he’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/space-leaders-mark-kelly-00171814\">been to space</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, a glance at the Electoral College map might lead one to believe that Shapiro is the obvious choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, Harris is polling a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">bit worse</a> in Pennsylvania than in the other key Rust Belt battlegrounds. The likely Democratic nominee trails Trump by 1.9 points there, while losing by only <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/michigan/trump-vs-harris\">1 point in Michigan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/wisconsin/trump-vs-harris\">0.7 points in Wisconsin</a>, according to RealClearPolitics’s polling average. Close the gap in Pennsylvania, and Harris will be in striking distance of sweeping the three Midwestern swing states, which could be sufficient to win her the White House.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, Pennsylvania holds four more Electoral College votes than Michigan and nine more than Wisconsin. As long as Democrats win Pennsylvania, they can lose both of those states and still&nbsp;retain some other plausible routes to victory. With Pennsylvania in her corner, Harris could lose Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin and still get just over 270 Electoral College votes by taking Georgia and Arizona.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given this math, it may seem like a no-brainer to pick the governor who boasts a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/josh-shapiro-kamala-harris-running-mate-questions/\">60 percent</a> approval rating in the single most valuable battleground state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there is one flaw in this reasoning: There is virtually no evidence that picking a vice presidential candidate from any particular state actually increases a party’s support in that state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shapiro might nonetheless be Harris’s best option. And it’s conceivable that he could marginally improve her support in Pennsylvania. But if he did, he’d be an exception to the rule. Harris would be well-advised to give more weight to other considerations when making her selection.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The weak, complicated case for believing that running mates help deliver their home states</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some research has found that vice presidential candidates do enjoy a “home-state advantage.” But these analyses generally rest on faulty premises.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For years, most studies suggested that presidential candidates do not enjoy any advantage in their running mate’s home state. In 2016, the political scientists Boris Heersink and Brenton Peterson published a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X16642567?download=true&amp;journalCode=aprb\">paper</a> that challenged this consensus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Conventionally, political scientists had gauged a running mate’s home-state advantage by considering 1) the national vote in a given election and 2) how a vice presidential candidate’s home state had voted on average in the five preceding elections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With these two data points, they estimated how that state should have voted in a given election, considering its historical leanings and that year’s national environment, and then compared this estimate with how it actually voted. If a presidential candidate outperformed their expected share of the vote in their running mate’s home state, then one could plausibly conclude that they enjoyed an advantage there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Heersink and Peterson argue that there is one big problem with this reasoning: Political parties tend to choose vice presidential candidates from places where they are already losing ground due to structural political changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They highlight the example of John F. Kennedy’s selection of Lyndon Johnson in 1960.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the previous five elections, the Democratic Party’s support in LBJ’s home state of Texas had been in sharp decline, as Republicans steadily ate into the New Deal coalition. In 1940, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won 81 percent of the state’s votes; four years later, he took 71 percent. With those two landslides propping up the Democratic Party’s average historical support in Texas, Kennedy was all but certain to do worse than expected in the Lone Star State, no matter whom he chose as his running mate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The traditional formula for calculating home-state advantage missed this fact. Instead, it suggested that choosing LBJ actually reduced Kennedy’s support in Texas by 15 points.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Heersink and Peterson found this implausible. They insisted that a vice presidential candidate’s home state is much more likely to be trending away from that candidate’s party than the nation as a whole. Therefore, to capture a running mate’s true home-state advantage, you need to compare their home state’s voting behavior with that of the same exact state in an alternate dimension with a different vice presidential nominee who came from somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lacking the budget for interdimensional travel, the researchers settled for the next best thing. By cobbling together bits and pieces of other US states, they created a “synthetic” Texas: A group of geographic areas that had collectively voted the same way that Texas had in 1952 and 1956. Comparing 1960’s election results in this Frankensteinian pseudo-Texas to actual Texas, they found that LBJ’s selection likely increased Kennedy’s margin in the Lone Star State.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Applying this method to all US elections between 1844 and 2012, they found that vice presidential candidates boosted their ticket’s support in their home states by an average of 2.67 percent — more than enough to potentially swing the result of an election.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Why picking Josh Shapiro might not help Harris much in Pennsylvania</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Heersink and Peterson’s findings are correct, then a ton of Democratic and Republican consultants need to get fired.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent elections, neither party’s presidential nominee has chosen a running mate from the most hotly contested swing state. They’ve tended to pick politicians from completely uncompetitive states: George W. Bush picked Dick Cheney from deep red Wyoming, Obama tapped Biden from safe blue Delaware, Trump selected Mike Pence from solidly Republican (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/2012/05/indiana-the-obama-state-that-got-away-123907\">except for immediately after a financial crash</a>) Indiana, and Biden chose Harris from the coastal Gomorrah of California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If all of these nominees could have bought themselves a significant boost in a pivotal swing state simply by choosing a different running mate, then their top advisers should never work in politics again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The thing is, Heersink and Peterson’s paper is almost certainly wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2019, the political scientists Christopher J. Devine and Kyle Kopko <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12610\">published a study</a> that reaffirmed the original conventional wisdom: Running mates don’t meaningfully increase a ticket’s support in their home states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Devine and Kopko’s research directly refutes Heersink and Peterson’s, noting two major flaws: First, its core premise — that parties tend to pick vice presidential candidates from states where they’re losing ground — is not true and was based on a technical error in their research.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1948, a faction of southern Democrats split with the national party in protest of President Harry Truman’s embrace of civil rights. These Dixiecrats put forward their own, alternative Democratic nominee, South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond. Alabama chose to leave Truman off of the state’s ballot and listed Thurmond as the Democratic presidential nominee in his stead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a result, the Democratic Party’s actual nominee won no votes in Alabama that year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Heersink and Peterson code this as a 100-point Republican victory in Alabama, since they don’t recognize Thurmond as the Democratic nominee. And this dubious decision matters for the rest of their paper since, in 1952, the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate was from Alabama. In fact, the idea that parties generally pick VP nominees from places where they’re losing ground is based entirely on the alleged fact that 1952 Democratic standard-bearer Adlai Stevenson picked a running mate from a state that his party had lost by 100 points four years earlier. Take that result out of Heersink and Peterson’s averages and the trend completely disappears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second problem with their paper is that its results are based entirely on the voting behavior of geographic areas rather than people. Data on shifts in a region’s aggregate political leanings have their uses, but information about individuals’ voting preferences is generally better for gauging the influence of any given factor on election outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is partly because the population of an area can change between election cycles. For example, a state can gradually lose college-educated voters if other areas offer better job opportunities for young professionals. Thus, if you compare a state’s voting behavior in one election to its behavior in a later one, you might mistake the impact of a demographic shift for the impact of a specific campaign decision, such as the selection of a running mate from that state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Using large-scale survey data on individuals from all 50 states, Devine and Kopko are able to gauge the impact of running mate decisions on voters. They find that, after controlling for all other relevant variables (e.g. partisanship, race, age, gender, income, etc.), voters from the same state as a party’s vice presidential nominee are no more likely to support that party than voters from other states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Shapiro might be the right choice, but Harris shouldn’t pick him for the wrong reasons</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this necessarily means that Harris shouldn’t pick Shapiro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Pennsylvania governor does have some liabilities. His <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2024/07/30/picking-josh-shapiro-could-be-for-harris--heres-why/\">unusually strident</a> criticisms of pro-Palestinian protesters have earned him the enmity of some progressives, while the uncanny similarity between his <a href=\"https://x.com/ArmandDoma/status/1818068587627823407\">oratorical style and Barack Obama’s</a> could be offputting to some voters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, by picking Shapiro, Harris could plausibly counter the widespread perception that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/07/23/2024/the-upside-for-harris-is-huge-democratic-poll-finds-kamala-needs-to-define-her-brand-quickly\">she is very left-wing</a>, which may be a source of concern for some swing voters. And the qualities that have enabled the Pennsylvania governor to earn a 60 percent approval rating in his home state might help him win the confidence of a national electorate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also remains conceivable that Shapiro could help Harris a bit in Pennsylvania. The empirical evidence may strongly suggest that a running mate’s home state doesn’t matter, but there are no infallible measurement tools in social science. Survey data can be biased, and not at all relevant variables can be identified and controlled. More critically, as noted above, it’s been decades since the nominee of either party actually tried putting the popular incumbent governor of a hotly contested swing state on the ticket. So the historical data might not be a reliable guide to the implications of picking Shapiro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are also some reasons to think that Harris’s VP pick will matter more than most: In some <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-sees-boost-favorability-after-biden-drops-race/story?id=112306763\">recent polls</a>, Harris’s favorability has jumped dramatically in recent weeks, a development that suggests voters’ impressions of her are unusually unsettled. Since her choice of running mate will be the first major decision she makes as presumptive Democratic nominee, it could solidify many voters’ views of her candidacy. Shapiro’s selection could plausibly reassure some Pennsylvania swing voters that Harris is the type of Democrat they can trust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Harris should not count on that. Although it is possible that Shapiro could help her win Pennsylvania, the historical record indicates that this is far from a sure thing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For that reason, if Harris believes that Walz or Kelly would play better to a national audience, she should not pick Shapiro merely because he’s from a more valuable state.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "Kamala Harris has reportedly narrowed her list of potential running mates down to three: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. All these contenders have their upsides. Walz is a Midwestern veteran who plays a great no-nonsense, folksy dad on TV and repeatedly won a Republican-leaning, rural congressional district [&#8230;]",

A combination of strong vegetation growth due to heavy precipitation over the past few years, and high temperatures this summer could mean larger wildfires in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These conditions all contributed to the magnitude of the Park Fire, which has already damaged more than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-western-california-park-fire-3e888a7e89f7b5b6b9c2172afb4671a1\">100 structures</a>, and put <a href=\"https://www.nbcrightnow.com/national/4-000-evacuated-as-park-fire-rages-in-northern-california---taiwanplus-news/video_90ff4fbd-f461-554e-8d0d-c045baeba455.html?mode=nowapp\">at least 8,000 people</a> under evacuation orders. For another sense of scale, the fire has grown so large that it’s <a href=\"https://x.com/deborahblum/status/1817939917277696127?s=46\">visible from space</a> and now covers more square footage <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/raging-california-wildfire-grows-bigger-than-city-los-angeles-2024-07-30/#:~:text=July%2030%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20The,wilderness%20area%20north%20of%20Sacramento.\">than the entire city of Los Angeles</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Park Fire follows numerous other large fires that have devastated the US in recent years, including in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/8/9/23826015/maui-fire-2023-lahaina-hawaii-cause\">Hawaii in 2023</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/7/25/22592004/wildfires-climate-change-reconciliation-bill\">California in 2021</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/02/08/2017-fire-season-no-1-produced-largest-fire-states-history/319952002/\">Montana in 2017</a>. It’s the latest disaster to highlight how deeply fires can impact communities across the US and the urgent need for better policies to help navigate potential displacement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, 2.5 million Americans had to leave their home either temporarily or permanently due to a natural disaster, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=DISPLACED\">according to the US Census Bureau,</a> and the agency’s current estimates suggest at least <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=DISPLACED\">500,000 more</a> have been displaced so far this year. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-people-displaced-by-tornadoes-wildfires-and-other-disasters-tell-a-story-of-vulnerability-and-recovery-challenges-in-america-224904#:~:text=People%20over%2065%20had%20a,employment%20compared%20to%20other%20groups.\">Vulnerable groups</a> including low-income households, people over the age of 65, and Black and Hispanic Americans, are among those more likely to be displaced as a result of these phenomena.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The effects of the Park Fire and those of a growing number of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58396975\">natural disasters,</a> some of which are tied to climate change, highlight the urgent need for more federal support for recovery and how these incidents exacerbate existing housing crises. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How evacuations work</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those required to evacuate during the Park Fire, and others like it, are forced to seek shelter with friends or family, at a hotel, or at an evacuation center that’s been set up by the affected counties. Typically, evacuations are led by the affected county or city, which is responsible for notifying residents as the situation becomes more urgent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Evacuation orders can come at any time, including in the middle of the night. Law enforcement officials are usually in charge of notifying people and alerting neighborhoods, and can use cars and sirens. They also provide updates via television, radio, and social media. Many counties have text-based emergency alert systems that residents can sign up for to get mobile updates about a disaster. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those living in areas with high wildfire risk are often urged to have an evacuation plan ready, including a go-bag with essentials like water and a flashlight, charged devices, and fuel in their cars. Those who are able to leave on their own in their vehicles are encouraged to do so quickly in the case of an evacuation order and to get out of the areas affected by the fires as shown in maps that the counties release. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Counties may also designate assembly points for people to congregate if they’re unable to leave on their own or if roads are obstructed. Officials then coordinate emergency routes that people can use, along with transportation to shelters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Depending on how long it will take to contain and address the fire, evacuees could be in limbo for days to weeks, unsure about the status of their homes. That’s a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/park-fire-california-wildfire-evacuation.html\">stressful and devastating feeling</a> for many who are waiting to hear if their homes have survived the disaster. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once the imminent danger has passed and the fire has been contained, officials assess when it’s safe for people to return, says Tom Cova, a professor of geography at the University of Utah who has studied wildfire evacuation systems. That includes screening the area for toxins left by the fire and other hazards like downed power lines and propane tanks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If it’s deemed safe, people may be cleared to return to the area and assess the potential damage, or they may only be allowed to drive back, viewing their homes from their cars, due to the health risks from residual smoke and debris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those whose homes are destroyed and who are permanently displaced by the disaster face a far lengthier and much more complicated journey to rebuilding or moving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Insurance could help offset some of those costs, though some former evacuees in Maui have noted that such funds were only sufficient to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/19/1231191740/maui-fire-survivors-struggle-to-find-long-term-housing-half-a-year-after-the-bla\">cover rent temporarily</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In certain areas where there’s high wildfire risk, <a href=\"https://www.frontlinewildfire.com/wildfire-news-and-resources/wildfire-insurance/#wildfire-insurance-policies\">homeowner’s insurance may not cover wildfires</a> because of how costly these disasters have become for these companies, which puts the onus of rebuilding on the owners. In addition to construction, families also face the expense of securing alternative housing while they wait during a process that can take months to years. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Disasters highlight gaps in aid and housing</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disasters like the Park Fire underscore the gaps that currently exist in federal aid for recovery and the housing shortages that were already a challenge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the central distributor of rebuilding grant assistance that people can apply for, but these programs can have stringent requirements — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/fema-aid-disaster-recovery-climate-change.html\">including specific thresholds for damage</a> — that not everyone meets. People who are able to get insurance funds may also be precluded from receiving some of this aid. Often, the aid that’s provided isn’t sufficient to address the full cost of rebuilding. <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-503.pdf\">According to a 2020 report from the Government Accountability Office</a>, the average amount of aid that individuals received from FEMA between 2010-2019 was $3,522. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://readyforwildfire.org/post-wildfire/rebuilding/\">States like California</a> do fill in some of the gaps by offering benefits like debris removal services at no cost to homeowners, and agencies including the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development <a href=\"https://wildfirerecovery.caloes.ca.gov/general-info/housing-assistance/\">also have loan programs for rebuilding</a>. By and large, though, the assistance that’s required is greater than what’s available and can put those who lose their homes in an economically vulnerable position. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The help Americans receive after disasters isn’t just inadequate, it’s complicated to navigate and painfully slow to arrive,” writes Samantha Montano, an emergency management professor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/fema-aid-disaster-recovery-climate-change.html\">for the New York Times</a>. “From the amount of time it takes to complete recovery — measured in years, not months — to the labyrinth of policies, regulations, false promises and lawsuits, the reward for surviving a disaster is being forced into a system so cruel it constitutes a second disaster.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The solution, Montano argues, is to bolster resources for FEMA, which <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/fema-disaster-relief-fund-government-shutdown-recovery-congress/\">faced a funding shortage in 2023</a>, and for states to develop better recovery plans that include boosts to their budgets and dedicated management. Many of these challenges are evidenced by the response to the Lahaina wildfires in Maui. Families who were displaced by those fires were still navigating provisional housing <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/19/1231191740/maui-fire-survivors-struggle-to-find-long-term-housing-half-a-year-after-the-bla\">roughly six months out from that disaster</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another issue that these disasters draw attention to is the housing challenges that people were already facing in places that are hit by them. <a href=\"https://www.calcities.org/home/post/2023/11/15/as-chico-works-to-reduce-homelessness-a-somber-fact-remains.-the-resources-to-serve-people-are-in-short-supply\">A 2018 fire in Paradise, California,</a> for example, decimated roughly 14,000 homes and made a housing shortage in the region even worse. <a href=\"https://chpc.net/resources/plumas-county-housing-need-report-2024/\">In Plumas County</a>, one of the four counties hit by the Park Fire, there’s similarly already a shortage of affordable homes for low-income households. Any additional damage from the Park Fire could well deepen those gaps.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Some Democrats <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/11/biden-democrats-project-2025-trump/74349980007/\">see it as</a> the ace in the hole that could help Kamala Harris beat Trump in November. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/trump-project-2025-disavowal/\">claimed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html\">implausibly</a>, to know nothing about it. And Trump’s top campaign officials have recently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/30/project-2025-director-paul-dans-leaves-heritage-foundation/\">attacked it</a> in increasingly venomous terms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what is it, anyway?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Project 2025 is the conservative movement’s detailed and specific plan for what the next Republican president should do with his power, including its preparation to put that plan into action. Basically, it’s an attempt to make the second Trump term way more organized and effective than the first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Organized by the right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation and advised by <a href=\"https://x.com/Prjct2025/status/1809276867347681759\">more than 100</a> conservative groups, Project 2025 has put forth a <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">922-page</a> list of policy recommendations, going agency by agency in the federal government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is not a pie-in-the-sky policy agenda full of bold but empty promises. It is crafted to be a list of things the next president’s appointees really can do, put together by many people who served in top posts under Trump last time and could well do so again. (Project 2025 is also collecting a database of names of conservatives who could take jobs in Trump’s second term.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what does it say? Are its proposals as terrifying and extreme as progressives are claiming? And are they really what Trump would end up doing?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The answers are a bit complicated because Project 2025 encompasses a lot of different things (and there are some claims about what’s in it that are simply false). I think of its agenda as falling into three buckets:</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>1) Concentrating power in the presidency</strong>: The idea here is to give Trump and his appointees more power over the executive branch relative to permanent nonpartisan civil service professionals (who he disparages as the so-called “deep state”). Critics fear this will lead to the abuse of power and political hackery. Trump supports these ideas and we have every reason to believe he’d implement them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>2) Achieving longtime conservative priorities: </strong>This is stuff like slashing regulations, reducing federal spending on the poor, ditching efforts to fight climate change, ramping up military spending, and so on. Many progressives think these ideas are terrible, but they aren’t exactly new. Trump supports basically all of these. (Project 2025 mostly avoids taking firm positions on issues where Trump breaks from the conservative consensus, such as trade.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>3) Taking a hardline religious-right agenda</strong>: The project lays out quite aggressive proposals to use federal power to prevent abortions and restrict certain contraceptive coverage. It even says that pornography should be “outlawed” and its creators and distributors should be “imprisoned.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These last ones are the proposals Trump may be most wary of. “Some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,” he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/trump-project-2025-disavowal/\">wrote on TruthSocial</a>, without specifying which things he meant. But the reality is that these are all major causes of some of Trump’s most important and loyal political allies, people he frequently rewards with key appointments. If he hands them key posts again in his second term and neglects to rein them in, the abortion proposals in particular could well come to pass.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, there are also many claims circulating about things purportedly in Project 2025 that are not in fact in there (it does not, for instance, propose ending no-fault divorce). But much of its 922 pages do indeed seem to be a plausibly accurate guide to what Trump would pursue if elected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless, the project is now a political liability for Trump, so his team has begun openly attacking it. In response to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/30/project-2025-director-paul-dans-leaves-heritage-foundation/\">a report</a> Tuesday that Project 2025 is winding down its policy work and its director was departing, Trump advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a joint statement that “Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed.” But the project isn’t going anywhere just yet — it will continue to operate, now directly overseen by the president of the Heritage Foundation himself, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/30/project-2025-director-paul-dans-leaves-heritage-foundation/\">Washington Post reports</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is behind Project 2025? Is it Trump?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The story of Project 2025 starts with the Heritage Foundation. Since its founding in the 1970s, Heritage has styled itself as the main think tank of the conservative movement. Its goal is to push the Republican Party toward a further right agenda so that GOP officials listen more to ideologues and hardliners, not moderates and the traditional party establishment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Heritage does this partly by crafting and advocating for policy proposals. They also try to be a sort of “administration-in-waiting” when the GOP is out of power, with experts on their payroll who can join a newly elected administration. In some ways, Project 2025 is not new: The Heritage Foundation has been releasing extremely long (and extreme) plans for what the next conservative president should do <a href=\"https://prospect.org/politics/2024-07-10-project-2025-republican-presidencies-tradition/\">since 1980</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet the dynamics this time around are different, in part due to Heritage’s close ties to Trump and in part due to the unusual situation where a former president is trying to regain office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ordinarily, there’d be a fair amount of ambiguity about who the next president would appoint to his administration if elected. But Trump has been president before, and when he was, he heavily relied on Heritage appointees. (After his unexpected 2016 win, he needed to quickly staff an administration and come up with policies, and <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/140271/dc-think-tank-behind-donald-trump\">Heritage</a> was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-transition-heritage-foundation-231722\">ready</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/magazine/trump-government-heritage-foundation-think-tank.html\">waiting</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">About two-thirds of authors and editors involved in Project 2025’s plan served in the Trump administration. HUD Secretary Ben Carson, acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, deputy White House chief of staff Rick Dearborn, former OMB director Russ Vought, and top DHS official Ken Cuccinelli contribute chapters, just to name a few. And John McEntee, the White House personnel director who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-white-house-purge/2020/11/13/2af12c94-25ca-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html\">purged</a> officials viewed as disloyal to Trump, has a key role in <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/press/former-ppo-director-john-mcentee-joins-project-2025-personnel-database-launches\">collecting staff recommendations</a> for the project. (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html\">CNN reported</a> that at least 140 former Trump administration officials were in some way involved in it.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation-what-know-rcna161338\">praised</a> the Heritage Foundation at an April 2022 event, calling it a “great group” that would “lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do” when “the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” (Obviously, that conflicts with <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112734594514167050\">his recent claim</a> that he has “no idea who is behind” it and that he has “nothing to do with them.”) Much of the plan also seems crafted to appeal to Trump specifically, and there’s tons of stuff in it that he openly supports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Having said all that, it does appear true that Project 2025 was crafted without Trump’s personal involvement. It was put together <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/press/project-2025-publishes-comprehensive-policy-guide-mandate-leadership-the-conservative-promise\">in early 2023</a>, before Trump had actually won the nomination again, and while Heritage was cultivating close ties to Florida Gov. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/conservative-think-tank-emerges-force-behind-desantis-campaign-2023-08-18/\">Ron DeSantis</a> too. It’s a plan for what movement conservatives, including many close Trump allies, hope to do, but he hasn’t necessarily signed onto all of it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is actually in Project 2025?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The main Project 2025 policy document is, again, <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">922 pages long</a>. After an introduction by the Heritage Foundation’s president, there is a separate chapter for each major executive branch agency or office. Each is written by someone with expertise on that office’s capabilities — often someone who could, conceivably, run that office if Trump returns to power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The details, within three broad categories, break down along these lines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>1) Concentrating power in the presidency</strong>: Trump’s allies believe that his first term failed because he couldn’t get enough “loyal” appointees in place and because the “deep state” bureaucracy sabotaged him. So a main recurring theme of Project 2025 is how to bend the executive branch to a conservative president’s will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A President today assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its own policy plans and preferences — or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly “woke” faction of the country,” Vought, Trump’s former OMB director, writes in one chapter. “The modern conservative President’s task is to limit, control, and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Project 2025’s proposals to achieve that goal include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The “Schedule F” plan to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants as political appointees, so they could be fired and replaced with Trump cronies. (Trump issued this order in late 2020 but left office before it could be implemented, and Biden rescinded it.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reconsidering the traditional separation between the White House and the Justice Department (something that could give the president more direct control over criminal investigations)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Installing a “vast expansion” of political appointees at the DOJ in particular</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expanding performance-based pay for the civil service (which sounds fine in theory, unless the performance evaluations are politicized)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Letting political appointees apportion federal funds (currently civil servants do this, and proposals that the government do otherwise <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/08/20/federal-funds-omb-apportionment-trump/\">have been met</a> with fears of politicization)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expanding White House review of military promotions to ensure promoted officers aren’t too focused on “climate change” or “manufactured extremism” (that is, domestic right-wing extremism)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>2) Longtime conservative priorities: </strong>The vast majority of Project 2025’s policy plan is focused on longstanding conservative priorities — with some tweaking and elisions for the Trump era.&nbsp; Though some are indeed quite extreme, they’re not all that new or specifically tied to Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are far too many to list here, but just as a flavor:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Education</strong>: Eliminate the Department of Education, give every parent a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/23689496/school-choice-education-savings-accounts-american-federation-children\">voucher-like option</a> they could use to send their child to private school, zero out federal funding to low-income schools over the next decade, greatly cut “wasteful” school meal programs, and end Biden’s student loan forgiveness programs</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Energy and environment</strong>: Deprioritize fighting climate change, repeal Biden’s clean energy subsidies, further unleash oil and natural gas production, roll back various environmental regulations</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Health care: </strong>Majorly cut <a href=\"https://pnhp.org/news/critiquing-project-2025-medicaid/\">and overhaul Medicaid</a>, roll back the recent law banning surprise medical billing</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Immigration</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/project-2025-unveiling-the-far-rights-plan-to-demolish-immigration-in-a-second-trump-term/\">Deny</a> loan access to students at “schools that provide in-state tuition to illegal aliens,” ban non-citizens from living in federally assisted housing (even if they live with a citizen), reinstate and expand the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/border-patrol-del-rio-horse-investigation/index.html\">horseback-mounted Border Patrol</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On a few issues — trade, antitrust, the Export-Import Bank — the plan states that the conservative movement is divided, and lays out the thinking of two different sides on each issue. On the question of Social Security and Medicare, which Heritage has long supported overhauling but Trump does not, the document is basically silent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>3) A hardline religious-right agenda</strong>: There are also parts of Project 2025 that, while not exactly surprising for conservatives, are quite extreme in ways that are politically problematic for Trump. The plan calls for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revoking FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/21/24105984/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-pills-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine\">is used</a> in about half of US abortions (“Abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-<em>Roe</em> world,” the document states)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using an old law known as the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained\">Comstock Act</a> to prosecute people who send abortion pills through the mail</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ending the mandate for insurance to cover the “week-after” contraceptive pill Ella (which the document argues is a “potential abortifacient”)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crack down on “abortion tourism” in liberal states by requiring states to report where women seeking abortions live and cutting federal funds if they refuse</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ending subsidies for stem cell or fetal cell research</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a fiery introduction by Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts, Project 2025 also calls for banning porn:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em>Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roberts also adds that pornography is “manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children,” suggesting that he may define “pornography” much more broadly than is typical — that he may view any attempt to explain or teach about trans people as worthy of outlawing and imprisonment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is reflective of a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-conservatives-pornography-fight/index.html\">broader push</a> from religious and cultural conservatives. (The demand for porn prohibition does not show up in the document again after Roberts’s introduction, making it unclear how it would be implemented.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s not in Project 2025</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Project 2025 has captured the attention of progressives, various lists purporting to lay out what’s in it have spread online. Some of these lists <a href=\"https://x.com/Sky_Lee_1/status/1810370456064840086\">are largely accurate,</a> but others contain exaggerations and falsehoods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2024/07/07/a-list-of-the-terrible-things-project-2025-has-in-store-for-us.html\">Contrary to some online claims</a>, Project 2025 itself does not call for ending no-fault divorce, a complete ban on abortions without exceptions, a ban on contraceptives, raising the retirement age, teaching Christian beliefs in public schools, ending marriage equality, banning Muslims from entering the country, or abolishing the FDA and EPA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, various Heritage Foundation experts and allied groups who signed onto the project have indeed called for many of these things at various points and hope to work toward such goals. Here are Heritage links in support of <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/social-security/commentary/should-the-social-security-retirement-age-be-raised-yes\">raising the retirement age</a> and a nationwide <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/protect-unborn-life-and-family-formation\">abortion “heartbeat” ban</a>. (Trump, of course, called for “a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/12/07/458836388/trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-u-s\">complete and total shutdown</a> of Muslims entering the United States” during his 2016 campaign. He also called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/republican-candidates-donald-trump-eliminate-epa-law-experts\">abolishing the EPA</a>.) But such proposals are not in the document itself.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If Trump wins, how much of Project 2025 will happen?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lots!</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the level of broad principles, Trump supports much of Project 2025’s ideas. He has appointed many of its authors, and may well appoint many of them again. The proposals are mostly crafted to be achievable through executive authority alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s every reason to believe a second-term President Trump will go full steam ahead with centralizing executive authority in a way that could enable major abuses of power, and with pursuing much of the typical conservative agenda through the executive branch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a handful of things that he probably won’t do — like the porn ban, something he has never supported or shown any seeming desire to pursue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big uncertainty is around the abortion-related topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his first term, Trump happily handed over key appointments to anti-abortion conservatives, including the Supreme Court justices who eventually overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. And now that <em>Roe</em> is gone, those loyal allies of his want more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While running for office, Trump has been wary of the demands of anti-abortion activists. He has been vague about what he’d do with federal authority over abortion policy if elected, saying that he wants to leave the issue to the states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what would he do once the election is in the rearview mirror? Would he appoint anti-abortion hardliners to key posts? If so, would he overrule them if they took extreme measures, given his intermittent interest in the nuts and bolts of governance?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can’t know for sure. But given Trump’s current vagueness, there are good reasons to believe he’d reward his loyal allies once he’d no longer be punished for that at the polls. Which means some of the most extreme Project 2025 ideas could well come to pass if he wins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, July 30, 4:10 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published on July 13, 2024, and has been updated with recent reports of changes at Project 2025.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Biles, along with teammates Suni Lee, Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, and Hezly Rivera,<strong> </strong>compiled a score of 171.296 and defeated Italy (165.494) and Brazil (164.497) who won silver and bronze. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is Biles’s fifth Olympic gold medal, bringing her to eight Olympic medals in total over three Olympics. Biles’s medal haul, along with her 30 world championship medals — 23 of which were golds —&nbsp;solidifies her as the greatest gymnast that we’ve ever seen and arguably the most dominant athlete in all of sports.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her legacy is punctuated by her power, consistency, and winning record, but it’s her return to the Olympics and gymnastics in general that’s truly remarkable. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/358882/simone-biles-olympic-trials-paris-floor-vault\">For the last few years</a>, Biles has openly talked about her mental health struggles and the abuse she endured as a Team USA gymnast. She has been sharing these painful moments in the hope that what happened to her doesn’t happen again. She wants to make the sport safer and better for the next crop of girls following in her footsteps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While that kind of change is not as easy to quantify as a triple-twisting double back, Biles’s resiliency and bravery are just as legendary as her skill.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Simone Biles is the GOAT&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To put <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/10/20908435/simone-biles-gymnastics-best-ever\">Simone Biles’s talent in perspective</a>, you have to understand that gymnastics is scored down to decimal points. Biles regularly beats her competitors by roughly two full points. Those margins are like winning tennis matches 6-0, 6-0, outscoring an American football team by multiple touchdowns, or besting another basketball team by 40 points, and so on and so forth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles achieves these giant scores because she’s performing the most difficult moves at the most consistent clip. Biles’s two highest-scoring events are floor exercise and vault, both of which allow Biles’s power to take center stage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As experts explained to me back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12411966/simone-biles-olympics-gymnastics\">headed into the Rio Olympics</a>, and again in 2021 preceding the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/24/21185843/summer-olympics-postponed-coronavirus-tokyo-2020\">delayed</a> Tokyo Olympics, Biles’s power on the floor allows her to perform the hardest tricks. Floor routines are usually stacked so that the first tumbling passes are the most difficult, so they can be done when a gymnast has the most energy. However, Biles’s third tumbling passes (which are usually her easier passes) are sometimes the same difficulty as most women’s first passes. Biles has two floor moves named after her: the Biles I (a double back layout with a half twist) and the Biles II (a triple-double: two flips and three twists). As of 2024, no other woman but Biles has landed the Biles II in any competition. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2164431987.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.711279031594,100,74.577441936812\" alt=\"A gymnast in mid-air with her eyes on the bar she is going to grasp.\" title=\"A gymnast in mid-air with her eyes on the bar she is going to grasp.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Simone Biles competes on the uneven bars at the 2024 Paris Olympics. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jamie Squire/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the floor exercise moves, Biles has three <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/simone-biles-live-updates-gymnastics-paris-olympics-2024-latest-results/ZDUs2Jfuveao/iuPgP054UnL1/\">high-scoring</a> elements named after her: on vault, she has the Biles (two twists and front layout) and the Biles II (a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurchenko_vault_family\">Yurchenko</a> double pike); and on beam, she has the Biles dismount (a double-twisting double backflip). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"EVERY Simone Biles signature move I NBC Sports\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j61F2HucjEw?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ahead of the Tokyo Games, Biles was involved in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22575301/simone-biles-olympics-scoring-explained-gymnastics-yurchenko-double-pike\">scoring controversy</a>. The problem? Her tricks were too good. Judges could not figure out how to adequately score Biles because her moves were pushing the limits of difficulty. Critics said the Tokyo judges were scoring elements like Biles’s eponymous beam dismount too conservatively and not giving her full credit. Giving her the full total of her difficult elements would have made the already huge gap between Biles and her competitors even larger. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They’re … too low and they even know it,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/sports/olympics/simone-biles-yurchenko-double-pike.html\">Biles told the New York Times</a> in May 2021. “But they don’t want the field to be too far apart. And that’s just something that’s on them. That’s not on me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles has been so good and so consistent that she’s pushed the sport to a new limit, which has yet to be matched. There are gymnasts and there is Simone Biles. Simone Biles is one of one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Paris, Biles is nursing a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/simone-biles-return-paris-olympics-2024-spt-intl/index.html\">slight calf injury</a> but still earned a 14.90 on vault and 14.66 on floor to help lead the US team to gold.  She will be gearing up for the all-around competition on Thursday, August 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simone Biles’s resilience&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Biles is a once-in-a-lifetime athlete, her return to the Olympics is nothing short of extraordinary. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22596910/simone-biles-withdrawal-olympic-gymnastics-team-finals-results\">Three years ago in Tokyo</a>, Biles suffered a mental block known in the gymnast world as the “twisties.” As Biles has explained in articles and extensively in her new Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81700902\"><em>Simone Biles: Rising</em></a>, the twisties happen when there’s a disconnect between your brain and body. That lack of body awareness, especially when gymnasts are performing difficult tricks, could end in serious injury. As a result, Biles pulled out of the team and all-around competition despite being the heavy favorite. She came back for one event, the balance beam event finals, and won a bronze medal on the apparatus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet pundits, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/29/simone-biles-and-the-magaverses-fetish-of-toughness-501515\">primarily right-wing personalities</a>, attacked Biles for withdrawing from competition and failing her team.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What the public didn’t fully understand, and what Biles speaks about honestly in <em>Rising</em>, is that she believes the twisties she suffered in Tokyo were a result of unresolved stress and trauma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because of Covid-19 and the health precautions surrounding the pandemic, families were not allowed to travel with athletes to the 2021 Olympics. Biles’s support system — her family and mom especially — was not present. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles also explains that she still hadn’t fully processed or gotten sufficient treatment after being abused by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22585637/gymnastics-tokyo-olympics-2021-abuse-larry-nassar\">Larry Nassar</a>. Nassar was the former doctor of Team USA’s gymnastics team and was charged with sexually assaulting girls and young women. After <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/us/larry-nassar-sentencing/index.html\">pleading guilty</a> to federal pornography charges (Nassar was in possession of child sex abuse material) and multiple child sex abuse charges, <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/2023/07/11/larry-nassar-ex-gymnastics-doctor-convicted-sexual-abuse-stabbed-in-prison-what-we-know/70400955007/\">he was sentenced</a> to 60 years in federal prison and over 100 years in state prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Biles was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-announces-138m-settlement-larry-nassars-victims-claims/story?id=109533950\">one of the hundreds of women</a> and girls who came forward against Nassar. She also spoke out about the FBI’s failure to properly investigate the allegations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In September 2021, weeks after the Olympics, Biles testified at a US Senate Hearing against Nassar. “I worked incredibly hard to make sure that my presence could help maintain a connection between the failures [around the Nassar case] and the competition at Tokyo 2020,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nhXchOtMLg\">Biles told the sitting senators</a>. “That has proven to be an exceptionally difficult burden for me to carry, particularly when required to travel to Tokyo without the support of any of my family. I am a strong individual and I will persevere, but I never should have been left alone to suffer the abuse of Larry Nassar.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Biles had walked away from the sport after Tokyo, no one would have blamed her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She’s won almost every medal possible — including the team and all-around gold in Rio.

The show, a seven-episode limited series from British comedian Richard Gadd, chronicles Gadd’s history of allegedly being stalked for years by an older woman, as well as his experience of allegedly being sexually assaulted by a male mentor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, it’s the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6ppe84jq6do\">$170 million dollar lawsuit</a> against Netflix from the real-life woman supposedly behind the fictional stalker. And though Gadd <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25020581/gadd-declaration-harvey-lawsuit.pdf\">declared</a> in a July 29 affidavit in support of Netflix that he “created fictionalized characters” as part of “a fictionalized retelling of my emotional journey,” the controversy over the series’ verisimilitude has yet to die down.</p>\n\n<p>The show was a breakout word-of-mouth phenomenon, drawing more than 13 million viewers in its first week of release and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/04/baby-reindeer-viewership-tops-netflix-1235900123/\">over 22 million</a> in its second. Audiences and critics have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/arts/television/baby-reindeer-netflix.html\">praised</a> the series for its wild twists and comedic yet vulnerable glimpses into a difficult story. Yet the real draw for many viewers seems to be less about Gadd’s experience and more about the mystery afforded by his extremely transparent depictions of other characters — particularly Gadd’s stalker. Gadd and his fellow cast members have quickly tried to staunch the public reaction, which has now escalated to doxing and harassing private citizens believed to be the real perpetrators behind the show’s events. This hunt culminated with the reveal of a woman named Fiona Harvey, who appeared on the YouTube show <em>Piers Morgan Uncensored</em> in May, claiming to be the real-life version of the stalker character, “Martha.” Harvey went on to file a suit against the streamer for defamation, negligence, and privacy violations in June.  The series’ grim real-life side effect seems to be both an epic case of viewers missing the point (don’t stalk people!) and an entirely predictable outcome based on Gadd’s treatment of the story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Should he have known better, or should we?</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP6409545948\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Baby Reindeer combines two narratives of extreme stalking and sexual assault</h2>\n\n<p><em>Baby Reindeer</em> combines two different autobiographical plays that Gadd, an <a href=\"https://oxforddrama.ac.uk/news/baby-reindeer-from-edinburgh-fringe-to-global-netflix-success/\">acclaimed comedian, actor, and playwright</a>, wrote and premiered to rave reviews at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. Both shows depicted deeply disturbing events in Gadd’s life through a lens of intentional overexposure. The first, 2016’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/richard-gadd-review-banshee-labyrinth-edinburgh\"><em>Monkey See Monkey Do</em></a>, was similar to Hannah Gatsby’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/7/5/17527478/hannah-gadsby-nanette-comedy\"><em>Nanette</em></a> in that it subverted audience expectations for comedy and instead treated them to a harrowing confessional. Ultimately revealing the details of a long-hidden sexual assault, Gadd traces his subsequent trauma through an onstage psychological meltdown accompanied by a visceral sensory overload.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second, 2019’s <em>Baby Reindeer</em>, forms the backbone of the Netflix show. In the show, Gadd plays a version of himself named Donny. The fictional Donny has a random encounter with frumpy, middle-aged “Martha,” a patron at a bar similar to the one where Gadd once worked. This brief interaction allegedly led to an intense four-year period of stalking in which Gadd claims she sent him exactly 41,071 emails, 106 pages of letters, 744 tweets, and a staggering 350 hours of voicemails. Over the course of the show, Gadd digs into her past and learns he isn’t her first victim — she has a documented criminal record for stalking at least two previous families.</p>\n\n<p>The Netflix adaptation of the two storylines has plenty to say about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/criminal-justice\" data-source=\"encore\">criminal justice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/mental-health\" data-source=\"encore\">mental health</a>, and gender. Gadd struggles to get the police to take Martha’s stalking seriously, even as he battles his own past history of trauma and abuse at the hands of his industry mentor. Gadd’s social awkwardness and PTSD emerge alongside a lack of systemic support for male victims of sexual assault.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These are all complicated themes. But the main appeal, at least for the most active audiences, seems to be the real-life mystery of it all: Who are the real people Gadd based his story on?</p>\n\n<p>Gadd’s clues about his alleged sexual assault were somewhat oblique, but led to difficulty for one prominent British theatre director who wound up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeanFoleyJ/status/1782655837489492126\">contacting</a> the police after fans began harassing him, convinced he was the sexual predator being depicted in the show. Gadd has since been working overtime to clear the man’s name, insisting that he’s not the perpetrator. “Please don’t speculate on who any of the real life people could be,” he <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/04/baby-reindeer-richard-gadd-message-viewers-speculate-real-life-identities-1235894129/\">posted</a> in an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/instagram-news\" data-source=\"encore\">Instagram</a> story. “That’s not the point of the show.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Things with the woman Martha is based on are perhaps even more complicated. In <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/baby-reindeer-netflix-richard-gadd-interview?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned\">an interview with GQ</a>, published shortly after the show’s April 11 release, Gadd claimed he’d made his stalker an unrecognizable character. “We’ve gone to such great lengths to disguise her to the point that I don’t think she would recognise herself,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It seemed reasonable to assume Gadd knew whereof he spoke. After all, in <em>Baby Reindeer</em>, he portrays his stalker as a classic sexist and anti-fat stereotype: the lonely, socially awkward middle-aged woman with higher weight who channels her unhappiness into obsession. The first thing he tells us about her, before we’ve even met her, is that “I felt sorry for her.” It’s a <a href=\"https://therepproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022AllBodies_FatWomenInHollywood_Report_V2_TypoFixed.pdf\">trope we’ve seen</a> countless times before from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/11/30/misery/3e7bb4c0-f530-4654-9f99-2be882a4c6b1/\"><em>Misery</em></a> to <a href=\"https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/matilda-the-musical-fat-suit-emma-thompson/\"><em>Matilda</em></a>; for Gadd’s stalker to fit so easily into it, you’d think that his fictional depiction of her is informed less by reality and more by cheap Hollywood distortion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Gadd seems to have left so many clear identifying details in the series about the woman Martha appears to be based on — particularly the one about her previous criminal history — that audiences turned web sleuths were easily able to identify her, journalists were able to track her down and interview her, multiple British and US tabloids doxed her, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/baby-reindeer-lawsuit-netflix-gadd-martha-harvey-7de65030fbc704b78dc530404d616bc6\">she’s now suing Netflix</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Media coverage of the frenzy has included a fair degree of shock and skepticism. Even the Daily Mail, never a stalwart champion of ethics, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13355135/truth-comedian-female-stalker-gripped-world-Netflix-Baby-Reindeer-fame-fortune.html\">pointed out</a> that several of the details of the show were all but taken verbatim from the stalker’s real history, and questioned “how such a deft storyteller could not have foreseen the Netflix effect which amplifies the fall-out that comes from blurring fact and fiction.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While the Daily Mail initially declined to out the woman, it did publish <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13357447/stalker-Netflix-Baby-Reindeer-harassed-family-threatened-kill-MP-husband.html\">a lengthy interview</a> with one of her previous stalking victims, Laura Wray, a woman who claimed Martha’s real-life counterpart harassed her for over five years, culminating in death threats and a false report to have her family investigated for child abuse. Wray’s story was very similar to Gadd’s initial impression of his stalker — they each felt sorry for her and engaged with her because they pitied her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And even Wray, while discussing how powerful she found the validation <em>Baby Reindeer</em> offered to stalking victims like herself, also marveled that the resemblance between Martha and her real-life counterpart was so “uncanny.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It must have occurred to him that people were bound to speculate on who Martha is — and whether she’s done this to anyone else,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite all of this overlap — and despite the show’s opening, where the words “this is a true story” are typed out on a black screen — it wasn’t all factual, according to the lawsuit: “The lies that Defendants told about Harvey to over 50 million people worldwide include that Harvey is a twice-convicted stalker who was sentenced to five years in prison, and that Harvey sexually assaulted Gadd,” the suit reads. “Defendants told these lies, and never stopped, because it was a better story than the truth, and better stories made money.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“Martha” may be just as much a victim as Gadd himself</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Baby Reindeer</em> argues that both Gadd and “Martha” are victims. “I can’t emphasize enough how much of a victim she is in all this,” Gadd <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/richard-gadd-baby-reindeer-interview-stalking-martha-bush-theatre-london-tickets-a9145996.html\">told the Independent</a> in 2019, in a profile pegged to the original stage production of <em>Baby Reindeer</em>. Gadd went on to stress that she was mentally unwell and that mental health support was a major theme of the play. He later echoed this in his July declaration to the court in support of Netflix. “I used my experiences to craft the Martha character specifically to both feed into Donny’s desperate need for attention and self-esteem issues and challenge him in ways that make him confront his past abuse and its effects on him,” he wrote. “[W]hen the Series concludes, my hope was that the audience would recognize that neither of them was truly the aggressor nor the victim.”</p>\n\n<p>It’s perhaps worth asking, then, why he chose to further victimize her through a depiction of her — in an internationally distributed Netflix series, no less — that apparently hewed so close to real life that it enabled her not only to recognize herself but for her other stalking victims to recognize her as well. After all, while Gadd can be forgiven for sticking close to his real life in the play, he had nearly five years to fudge the details and make it less likely that people would discover who she was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That he failed to do so could be seen as a form of targeted revenge. There’s a real and obvious cruelty in the strength of the resemblance between the pair; the woman Martha is allegedly based on has since <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13355135/truth-comedian-female-stalker-gripped-world-Netflix-Baby-Reindeer-fame-fortune.html\">protested</a> that she’s not as unattractive as her double (played by Jessica Gunning), and that of the two of them, she’s the real victim. Indeed, it feels more than a little disingenuous that Gadd became mutually obsessed with her to the point of writing a hit play about her and then funneling that success into even greater heights of fame.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On May 9, a woman named Fiona Harvey appeared on Piers Morgan’s YouTube show, <em>Piers Morgan Uncensored</em>, claiming to the be the basis for the character of Martha. Harvey claimed she had been targeted by web sleuths online and sent death threats. She denied stalking Gadd; denied sending him thousands of emails, hundreds of voice mails, or dozens of letters; and denied sexually assaulting him, going to jail, or being in love with him. She had previously been connected to a <a href=\"https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MP+WIFE%27S+STALKER%3B+Lawyer+Laura+tells+of+fired+trainee%27s+hate...-a061570268\">stalking incident</a> with solicitor Laura Wray, but she denied ever being served an <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=af421c2c-7110-4ead-8caa-0734a286c276\">interim interdict </a>(effectively a temporary restraining order) in that incident. Harvey did admit to knowing Gadd when he was a bartender in London, being friendly with him, tweeting at him, and, like the character, possessing a baby reindeer toy as a child. In a not-particularly illuminating hour-long interview, Morgan repeatedly asked Harvey about the supposed emails and arrests, but presented no counter-evidence to her assertions. Harvey claimed that the reason Gadd might have made the story up was because “stalking is in vogue.” At points in the broadcast, over half a million people were watching live. She promised to sue Netflix, and now she’s made good on that promise.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube alignnone\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"“Richard Gadd is PSYCHOTIC” Baby Reindeer’s ‘Real’ Martha Fiona Harvey\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mK-isQXd_Qw?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p>To be fair, Gadd is by no means the first creator to confront the slippery ethics around <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/true-crime\" data-source=\"encore\">true crime</a>.

It could also be the case that Gadd simply underestimated the power of the internet, the power of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/internet-culture\" data-source=\"encore\">fandom</a>, and the lure of a real-life puzzle. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24043045/politics-fandom-trump-fans-toxic-stan-culture-conspiracies\">Many modern fans</a> view media, even autobiographical media, as interactive texts, games they get to play, full of mysteries they have to solve — even if the “mystery” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23619617/delphi-murders-updates-reddit-true-crime\">involves real life</a>.

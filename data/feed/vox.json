Where there were once vibrant coral reefs teeming with sharks, groupers, and lobsters, there are now piles of rubble, carpets of green seaweed, and only the meager remains of<strong> </strong>a once colorful sea of coral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the last 50 years, <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/despair-repair-dramatic-decline-caribbean-corals-can-be-reversed\">more than half</a> of all hard corals —&nbsp;colonies of tiny animals called polyps that grow skeletons and build coral reefs —&nbsp;have disappeared in the Caribbean. The picture is even grimmer nearby in the Florida Keys, where coral has declined by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change\">90 percent</a>. As corals die, seaweed often takes over, which can make it hard for the reef to recover.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A range of mostly human forces has precipitated this loss: coastal construction, diseases, pollution, and, increasingly, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate\">climate change</a>. Ocean warming is proving to be an endgame for reefs. As temperatures soar underwater, polyps lose a beneficial kind of algae that lives within their tissues and gives them energy and their vibrant<strong> </strong>color; without these algae the coral colonies are white, or “bleached,”&nbsp;and can starve to death. Since early 2023, record ocean temperatures have caused one of the worst <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change\">bleaching crises</a> ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Coral cover in the Caribbean has declined dramatically while seaweed has increased\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fJe2y/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"573\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The small island of Bonaire, however, tells a different story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">East of Curaçao in the south Caribbean, Bonaire is a volcanic island just half the size of Chicago. And within its waters is a bustling marine metropolis. A large reef circles the island with towering, centuries-old corals, where countless creatures reside, from seahorses and sea turtles to hammerhead sharks and rays.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Coral_JennyAdler_01.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.730529951316,100,78.538940097369\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Clockwise from top left: A collection of staghorn coral, a branching species that’s declined throughout the Caribbean; a juvenile spotted drum fish; a coral-dense expanse of reef with dive instructor and educator Carmen Toanchina in the distance; a grumpy looking frogfish.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many marine scientists have for years considered this undersea Eden to be the healthiest coral reef in the Caribbean, and among the healthiest in the world. And in this vibrancy lies a hopeful story: <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00265/full\">long-term research</a> suggests that this reef has —&nbsp;unlike most — successfully recovered from past bleaching events and storms that killed off a large portion of its coral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Bonaire’s coral reefs appear to have uniquely resisted the changes that have swept through the Caribbean,” Robert Steneck, a marine ecologist, and a team of scientists wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00265/full\">2019 study</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over one week in July, I traveled to the island to understand how it has defied the broader Caribbean trends. Perhaps, I thought, Bonaire has lessons to share that could help corals elsewhere survive for a few more decades, as countries move to slash their carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-6360.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"An underwater shot of a man in diving gear, with the ocean surface and land both visible.\" title=\"An underwater shot of a man in diving gear, with the ocean surface and land both visible.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As I learned from interviews with nearly 20 scientists and longtime divers, and experiencing a dozen dives myself, even the most resilient coral reefs have a limit to what they can tolerate — and Bonaire is starting to exceed it. This is a worrying reality.<strong> </strong>If this coral reef can’t survive the coming challenges, can any of them?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A magical, undersea metropolis</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Life on land in Bonaire is nothing like it is underwater. Shaped like a boomerang, with the bend pointing east, the Dutch island is mostly desert, almost Martian in some places. Tall cactuses line the roads, where wandering donkeys often create traffic jams. A handful of salt flats are feasting grounds for flamingos, which hunt the crustaceans that turn their plumage pink.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-0680.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-0810.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On a stifling July morning, underwater photojournalist Jenny Adler and I drove up the west coast. Our destination was a dive site in the north, where I’d heard the coral was especially plentiful —&nbsp;an example of Bonaire’s enduring richness. Scuba tanks rattled in our truck bed as we dodged iguanas skittering across the road. Neon green parrots flew overhead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After about 45 minutes of driving, we turned onto a road by the sea made of loose coral rubble. There was no sign of human life —&nbsp;no other people, no other cars, no buildings —&nbsp;but in the distance was a pile of old tires and driftwood. This makeshift structure marked the dive spot.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This story was produced in collaboration with the Pulitzer Center</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This story is the first in an ongoing series on the future of coral reefs as they face threats from climate change and disease. It was supported by the <a href=\"https://bandfdn.org/about/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://bandfdn.org/about/\">BAND Foundation</a> and a grant from the <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/\">Pulitzer Center</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One reason why Bonaire is so popular among divers is that its reef is incredibly close to shore, often in just 10 or 20 feet of water. You don’t need a boat, as is typical elsewhere. You can just swim out and sink down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wearing tanks and air-filled vests, we walked into the shallows, stepping carefully through a minefield of sea urchins. The water was as warm and<strong> </strong>clear as a heated pool. Once we could no longer touch the bottom, we put on our fins, emptied the air from our vests, and descended, until all we could hear was the sound of our own breathing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just like that, we entered another realm.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Coral_JennyAdler_02.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=18.676,0,62.648,100\" alt=\"Underwater shots of brown coral reefs and blue ocean above them.\" title=\"Underwater shots of brown coral reefs and blue ocean above them.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-6671.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Giant coral structures rose from the seafloor in a mind-bending array of shapes, from cones and obelisks, to boulders and miniature mountain ranges. Some of the colonies looked like messy stacks of dinner plates. Others, like chunky fingers.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-9646.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.539267015707,100,34.921465968586\" alt=\"A tiny black seahorse rising from behind coral.\" title=\"A tiny black seahorse rising from behind coral.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A longsnout seahorse — which we only found thanks to dive instructor Jürgen Pfalz.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We cruised around and peered into crevices, most of which were occupied. Lobsters, eels, and puffers all lurked in the shadows. A school of blue fish with pointy faces, known as tangs, briefly enveloped us. And an endangered hawksbill sea turtle swam by in the distance, with an almost mesmerizing grace. We were like alien visitors descending on another world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reefs like this are not just a spectacle. They’re also essential to life on Earth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While they cover less than 1 percent of the ocean floor worldwide, they support <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/habitat-conservation/shallow-coral-reef-habitat#:~:text=Coral%20reefs%20are%20the%20most,quarter%20of%20all%20ocean%20species.\">roughly a quarter</a> of all marine species. Those include animals that humans regularly eat, like groupers and lobsters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond supplying us with food, coral reefs also defend coastal communities. During hurricanes, their large, bony structures help dampen storm surge that could otherwise flood houses, streets, and buildings. In the US alone, reefs safeguard the homes of more than 18,000 people and avert $1.8 billion in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/358329/down-to-earth-coral-reefs-hurricane-defense\">flood damage each year</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-6589.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"A hawksbill turtle swimming underwater among coral\" title=\"A hawksbill turtle swimming underwater among coral\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A critically endangered hawksbill turtle cruises by.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Coral_JennyAdler_03.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=18.676,0,62.648,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Left: A dense school of blue tangs. Right: A close-up view of star coral, where you can see the individual coral polyps.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s tourism — the economic engine for Bonaire and many other Caribbean islands. An estimated 70 percent of foreigners who visit Bonaire come to dive and snorkel, <a href=\"https://english.rijksdienstcn.com/documents/leaflets/agriculture-horticulture-and-livestock/nature-policy-plan/nature-policy-plan/nature-and-environment-policy-plan-caribbean-netherlands-2020-2030\">according to</a> the Netherlands government. The coral is such a popular attraction that many of the license plates in Bonaire have the slogan “Diver’s paradise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reef is “what the majority of our economy depends on,” said Roxanne-Liana Francisca, senior conservation manager at an environmental group called <a href=\"https://stinapabonaire.org/\">STINAPA</a>, which manages the island’s national parks. (One of them encompasses the reef.) “There’s a built-in appreciation for nature that's part of Bonaire’s culture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a good thing then that, for much of the last century, the reef in Bonaire has remained relatively healthy. <a href=\"https://www.dcnanature.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BioNews-StatusOfTheReefs.pdf\">Research</a> suggests that the total cover of hard coral — a marker of reef health — is more extensive than in most other Caribbean reefs (<a href=\"https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/import/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf\">some of these studies</a> are dated). There’s also a bounty of certain species that have largely vanished from the wider region, such as the striking staghorn coral that grows branches that look like studded antlers.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-0940.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"Small blue and black fish swim among a forest of corals resembling plants.\" title=\"Small blue and black fish swim among a forest of corals resembling plants.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Bonaire is what a well-functioning, healthy reef should be,” said <a href=\"https://bio.unc.edu/faculty-profile/mccoy-sophie/\">Sophie McCoy</a>, a marine ecologist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, who researches mats of algae-like bacteria that colonize these ecosystems. “We’ve been studying Bonaire in my lab as an example of how a reef should be functioning.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Life appears everywhere you look.&nbsp;On a shallow dive up the road from my hotel, I accidentally spooked a large reef octopus as I floated over a field of staghorn. It puffed up,<strong> </strong>and then shaped itself into a torpedo and swam away. While snorkeling offshore from a popular beach bar I saw a spotted eagle ray (the same species as the teacher, Mr. Ray, in the movie <em>Finding Nemo</em>). The shallows were sprinkled with sand dollars that looked like loaves of sourdough and — my favorite — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/24085776/queen-conch-florida-climate-change-conservation\">queen conchs</a>. They’re those giant snails with absurd googly eyes that peer out like a periscope from their shells.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It seems that Bonaire has held onto an abundance of marine life that simply doesn’t exist in most other parts of the Caribbean.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-1143.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"A spotted eagle ray swims across a blue expanse.\" title=\"A spotted eagle ray swims across a blue expanse.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A spotted eagle ray appeared out of the blue on one of our dives on the more challenging east coast of Bonaire.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-1615.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The secret to Bonaire’s abundance</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, it’s in a lucky location.<strong> </strong>Bonaire, along with the islands of Curaçao and Aruba, are below the hurricane belt, the path that most major Atlantic storms often take. That means many of the region’s most damaging hurricanes — such as this summer’s record-setting <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate\">Hurricane Beryl</a> — leave Bonaire and its coral relatively unscathed. Plus, until more recently, the island had a small population and little commercial development, which has limited things like pollution and construction that could harm the reef.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s another potentially critical reason why coral in Bonaire is so abundant: half a century of fishing restrictions. The island banned spearfishing in 1971 and soon after established one of the world’s first marine parks. The park, or marine protected area (MPA), encircles the entire island and prohibits certain kinds of fishing, anchoring, and other activities that can damage coral. Unlike most MPAs in the Caribbean, which fail to limit commercial activities, this park has successfully restrained fishing.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-6799.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Danielle de Kool, an ecologist at STINAPA, and a marine park ranger patrol in Bonaire’s marine park.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s key here is that certain fish —&nbsp;namely, parrotfish —&nbsp;eat seaweed, which, if left unchecked, is the enemy of coral. As seaweed, or macroalgae, spreads, it can poison corals and make it hard for baby polyps to settle on the seafloor and grow into adult, reef-forming colonies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The biggest impediment to coral recovery is macroalgae,” said <a href=\"https://umaine.edu/marine/people/robert-steneck/\">Robert Steneck</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of Maine, who’s been studying Bonaire’s reef for more than 20 years. “And the biggest way to control macroalgae is with herbivores.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Steneck and some other scientists see it, fishing restrictions lead to more parrotfish. More parrotfish — and particularly large ones — lead to less seaweed (especially in the absence of other herbivores, like long-spined sea urchins, which have largely disappeared across the Caribbean). And less seaweed leads to more coral. Put together, this suggests that strong marine protections can help reefs bounce back after they get wrecked by bleaching or other threats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The virtue of MPAs as a coral conservation strategy is surprisingly controversial. What’s clear is that even the strongest protections, whether they prevent fishing, pollution, or any other local impacts, won’t do much for reefs during an extreme heat wave or storm. Such threats don’t care about park boundaries. That’s why some scientists have railed against MPAs as a coral-saving strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-6086.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"Large elkhorn coral under water with light from the sun streaming down on it\" title=\"Large elkhorn coral under water with light from the sun streaming down on it\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“They can’t keep temperatures out,” <a href=\"https://johnfbruno.web.unc.edu/\">John Bruno</a>, a marine ecologist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, told me. “They can’t keep climate out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But according to Steneck, Bonaire is living proof that MPAs can indeed make reefs more resilient, even in the ailing Caribbean.&nbsp;You just need loads of herbivores — which the island has.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Bonaire has far more parrotfish than other Caribbean reefs, even though they&#039;ve declined in recent years\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yvene/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"589\"></iframe>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Bonaire, the total biomass of parrotfish (a figure that incorporates both abundance and size) is among <a href=\"https://www.dcnanature.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BioNews-StatusOfTheReefs.pdf\">the highest</a> in the region. That number has declined in recent years, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, though the island still has far more parrotfish than most other Caribbean reefs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I saw dozens of them on every dive, some as large as human<strong> </strong>toddlers. They cruise around, stopping often to scrape algae off of rocks and coral with a set of big, beak-like teeth. (Parrotfish also eat the coral itself — and their excrement turns to sand —&nbsp;but the impact to coral is minimal, Steneck said.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-1417.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A large rainbow parrotfish displaying its big, algae-chomping front teeth.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This profusion of parrotfish has helped Bonaire’s reef swiftly recover from damaging events in the past, Steneck said. In 2008, Hurricane Omar lashed Bonaire, damaging homes and many of its shallow reefs. Then in 2010, a marine heat wave drove a massive bleaching event in the southern Caribbean. Together, these events killed off 22 percent of the live hard coral, according to a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00265/full\">2019 paper</a> led by Steneck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But remarkably, the coral recovered. By 2017, coral cover had returned to its pre-destruction state, he found — a truly significant feat. “This is the first example of a resilient Caribbean coral reef ecosystem that fully recovered from severe climate-related mortality,” Steneck and his coauthors wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00265/full\">2019 study</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Coral_JennyAdler_04.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=18.676,0,62.648,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What corals in Bonaire appear to show is critical: Long-term protection can help coral reefs survive. Again, the marine park is not the only reason why the reef is still standing. It’s also not representative of other MPAs, which are often poorly managed and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/5/23/23720486/marine-protected-areas-sanctuaries-fishing-conservation\">allow industrial fishing practices</a>. Still, it shows there are ways to help coral withstand warming, short of putting an end to climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You would be hard pressed to find reefs elsewhere that are in as good shape as the healthy reefs of Bonaire,” said <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/contributors/nancy-knowlton\">Nancy Knowlton</a>, a renowned marine scientist and author, formerly with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, “which, as the data show, are a result of strong management.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why I reported this</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year, I <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change\">reported</a> on a marine heat wave that killed thousands of corals in Florida, which had been painstakingly “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/23016412/coral-reef-restoration-climate-change\">planted</a>” by conservation groups to restore reefs. Years of work — gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That loss raised an urgent question: Can anything be done to help coral reefs survive, short of abruptly halting greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In pursuit of an answer, I stumbled upon an active debate in marine biology. Some scientists think that local efforts to help corals, such as restoration and restricting fishing, are largely pointless — a resource-intensive distraction. Other researchers disagree, claiming strategies like this can in fact, make reefs more resilient and more likely to survive in a warming world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I wanted to figure out if there was truth to this idea that you can make reefs more resilient. And ultimately, that brought me to the small Caribbean island of Bonaire. The island has maintained the healthiest reefs in a region where most reefs are dying. The key question I wanted to answer was, how?</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The troubling limits of marine protection&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a pretty enormous caveat to this otherwise hopeful message. While well-protected reefs with an abundance of coral may be able to recover from a few severe blows, it’s hard for them to survive a neverending deluge of threats. Coral grows slowly, on the scale of a few centimeters each year. Recovery takes time. No ecosystem —&nbsp;no matter how protected, no matter how healthy —&nbsp;can withstand the combined force of bleaching, pollution, and disease, year after year. Even the largest, most pristine stretches of the Great Barrier Reef <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/climate/ocean-heat-great-barrier-reef.html\">aren’t safe</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neither is Bonaire.&nbsp;While its reefs may be famously beautiful and packed with coral, this undersea ecosystem has still declined significantly in recent decades due to rampant coastal development, bleaching, and disease.&nbsp;And I saw these sorts of threats playing out in real time. On every dive we noticed a handful of corals that looked pale, either because they were starting to bleach or because they hadn’t yet recovered from bleaching last year. That’s the problem with climate change: As the baseline ocean temperature rises, bleaching events are becoming more common, giving corals less time to recover.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now the surface water in Bonaire is close to <a href=\"https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/vs/gauges/abc_islands.php\">85 degrees</a>. That’s far hotter than it typically is this time of year, and it’s enough to cause another widespread bout of bleaching.&nbsp;This could happen any day now. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s even more alarming is the spread of disease. Over the last decade, a sickness called stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has been spreading in the Caribbean and killing off a huge portion of the region’s hard, reef-building corals. Last spring, it appeared for the first time in Bonaire, where its impact has been quick and brutal. Preliminary research by STINAPA suggests that SCTLD&nbsp;—&nbsp;which essentially liquifies the coral colony from the inside out — has already wiped out nearly all of some species around the island, including maze, flower, and boulder brain corals. “It’s just devastating,” said Caren Eckrich, an ecologist at STINAPA.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-4765.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Coral_JennyAdler_05.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=18.72375,0,62.5525,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On a breezy morning, we joined biologists from STINAPA on a pair of dives to evaluate the damage from this disease. As we cruised along the reef, the biologists, including Francisca, pointed out signs of infection. The sickness appeared as white blotches radiating outward, or as a wave washing over the colony; SCTLD eats away at the colorful tissue, leaving only the calcium carbonate skeleton behind. Some corals, which were large enough to be decades or centuries old —&nbsp;colonies can live for thousands of years —&nbsp;were completely dead and covered in green and red algae.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This reef may be one of the healthiest in the Caribbean —&nbsp;but it isn’t healthy. It’s sick, and it is literally dying before our eyes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People who haven’t been diving in Bonaire for decades struggle to grasp the scale of this destruction, Francisca told me, as we took off our vests and wetsuits after the first dive. They suffer from what she calls “shifting baseline syndrome.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’ve been looking at this dive site for six years, and there used to be so much more coral,” said Francisca, who grew up in the nearby island of Curacao. “But if you’re coming in new or if you’re coming in from other places, you’re like, ‘What are you talking about? This site is amazing!’ It has definitely declined.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m susceptible to this syndrome myself.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-5473.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier in the week I went diving on the east side of the island, where few people get in the water. The coastline here is lined with sharp rocks and battered by large waves. You typically need a guide to scuba dive, and mine was a Dutch man named Bas Tol, who’s been diving in Bonaire for three decades. With tanks strapped to our back, we jumped off a small cliff into the choppy water below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through my eyes the reef was mesmerizing. There were massive sea sponges and coral structures twice my size. We also encountered what might be the cutest creature in the entire ocean: a baby trunkfish. When they’re young, these animals are perfectly spherical and not much larger than a chickpea. This one looked like a black and white polka-dotted orb floating in the ocean.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://volume.vox-cdn.com/embed/f730e1be9?player_type=youtube&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;placement=article&#038;tracking=article:rss\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But to Tol, this scene was a bit depressing. “What you saw today is half of what was there last year,” he said as we dried off by his truck. The reef is “under constant bombardment,” from bleaching, and now SCTLD, he said. “This is what I’ve been seeing for years. It’s just not getting better. It’s getting worse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Comments like this raise a much graver concern: If Bonaire’s reefs, which are among the healthiest and best protected in the world, are starting to fail, it’s hard to imagine that those elsewhere, and especially in the Caribbean, are anything but doomed.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-6494.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Caribbean can’t save its reefs —&nbsp;but it’s not powerless</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What I saw in Bonaire is, on one hand, a stinging indictment of marine protection. Why invest in restricting fishing and other harmful activities if bleaching and disease will just sweep through the reef anyway?</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Coral_JennyAdler_06.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=18.72375,0,62.5525,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From another perspective, it’s those decades of marine protection that have given Bonaire something to lose. The island is facing ocean warming and SCTLD with a greater amount of coral to begin with. And that inherently makes the reef more resilient. Because some corals are naturally more resistant to diseases and the effects of extreme heat, a larger baseline population should have more survivors.&nbsp;Then there are all of those parrotfish. The years to come will be the ultimate test of Steneck’s theory: that a squadron of herbivores will help the reef bounce back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Even though we have disease and climate change, we’re doing way better than most reefs around the world because of the conservation for more than 60 years,” said Ebby Jules, a local dive instructor who's been diving in Bonaire since the late 1980s.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-5056.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the long term, there’s no way to ensure a future for corals, at least as they appear today, without quickly slashing carbon emissions. That much is clear. Yet what’s happening in Bonaire reveals that there are, in fact, ways to strengthens the ability of coral reefs to withstand the threat of warming. Here’s how Steneck’s 2019 paper put it: “It is easy to conclude that the long-term prognosis for coral reefs is poor, but it is inaccurate to say there is nothing humans can do to halt or slow the decline of these beleaguered ecosystems.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And this point is critical for Caribbean islands, because they have very little influence over the global climate. Comprised of small nations and territories that lack huge industries, the region’s share of carbon emissions worldwide is <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2022/English/wpiea2022179-print-pdf.ashx#:~:text=The%20Caribbean's%20share%20of%20global,global%20average%20of%204.6%20tons.\">less than half a percent</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Coral_JennyAdler_07.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=18.81925,0,62.3615,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Left: Dive instructor and educator Carmen Toanchina, who volunteers with STINAPA, applies antibiotics to a boulder brain coral infected with SCTLD. Right: A close-up look at the antibiotic paste used to prevent the disease from spreading.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is absolutely nothing the Caribbean can do about lowering carbon emissions,” Francisca told me. “But we can do something about those local stressors. Hopefully, by addressing those local stressors, we continue to build resilience into the system.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond patrolling the marine park for illegal fishing and anchoring, STINAPA is now using antibiotics to treat corals that are infected with SCTLD. Though slow-going, this approach appears to be blunting the disease’s impact. Other organizations, like Reef Renewal Bonaire, meanwhile, are growing baby corals in nurseries to eventually plant on the reef, like saplings in a degraded forest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What we were trying to do is keep as many individuals as we can alive,” Francisca said. “The longer they’re alive, the longer they're reproducing, and the longer they’re reproducing, the more babies are out there.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/adler_final-8355.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"A view from below of five divers swimming around coral nurseries at the surface of water\" title=\"A view from below of five divers swimming around coral nurseries at the surface of water\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Francisca sees it, the goal is to keep the ecosystem functioning until other countries — and their politicians and corporations — figure out how to wrestle down greenhouse gas emissions. This approach has a time limit; marine protections will only stave off coral collapse for so long. Heat is killing these animals today. But even buying reefs a few more decades helps, said Francisca, especially in a place like Bonaire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Reefs are not just ecological systems, they are cultural and historical systems,” Francisca said. Even if protecting corals only buys 20 years, she said, that helps. “That is 20 years of fishing for the people who depend on fisheries, that is 20 years of tourism for the people who depend on tourism.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We can’t afford to just give up,” she added. “If we just give up, we’re giving up on our history, giving up on our heritage, but also giving up on our livelihoods.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "If you plunge into the warm, blue waters of the Caribbean today, what you’ll see in most regions is actually quite bleak.

By abandoning certain progressive commitments, embracing conservative rhetorical tropes, and claiming the mantle of economic populism, she has sought to define herself as the kind of Democrat who swing voters can trust. Much of this week’s Democratic National Convention will likely be focused on that rebranding effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, there’s reason to think that the GOP may succeed in tarring Harris as a radical. During her ill-fated 2020 primary campaign, today’s Democratic nominee embraced a wide array of profoundly left-wing positions. As a large field of presidential aspirants vied for highly engaged progressives’ attention and donations, Harris said she would <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/07/27/kamala-harris-fracking-ban-reversal-oil-and-gas-donald-trump-pennsylvania/\">ban fracking</a>; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/immigration/abolish-ice/\">reduce funding</a> for Immigration and Customs Enforcement; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/immigration/criminal-penalties-section-1325/\">decriminalize</a> unauthorized border crossing; replace all private health insurance <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/harris-on-private-health-insurance-lets-eliminate-all-of-that/\">with Medicare-for-all</a>; and establish a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/gun-safety-forum-live-updates-las-vegas-n1060911#ncrd1061751\">“mandatory buyback program”</a> for assault weapons. After her campaign ended, in the summer of 2020, she <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/kfile-kamala-harris-praised-defund-the-police-movement-in-june-2020/index.html\">praised</a> the “defund the police” movement. Many of these stances are exceptionally unpopular with the general public. In a poll from 2019,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/854249/even-most-democrats-dont-support-decriminalizing-border-crossings-poll-finds\">just 27 percent</a> of voters supported the decriminalization of unauthorized border crossing, while in 2020 only 37 percent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/29/8910387/medicare-for-all-insurance-private-abolish-bruenig\">backed abolishing private health insurance</a>, and<strong> </strong>in 2021<strong> </strong>a mere 15 percent <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/\">wanted lower police spending</a> in their area. And although some versions of Medicare-for-all poll well, only 37 percent of voters supported it when told that it would involve banning all private health insurance, according to a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/slideshow/public-opinion-on-single-payer-national-health-plans-and-expanding-access-to-medicare-coverage/\">KFF poll</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/10/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York Times poll</a>&nbsp;of three battleground states, 44 percent of voters said Harris was “too liberal,” (while only 34 percent said Trump was “too conservative”). And in a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/646547/age-issues-working-trump-advantage-pre-debate.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> taken in June, 56 percent of voters said that Biden was “too liberal,” while 44 percent deemed Trump “too conservative.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given all this, it isn’t surprising that Trump’s team is hammering the charge that Harris is “<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-camp-says-harris-walz-dangerously-liberal-ticket-every-americans-nightmare\">dangerously liberal</a>” — or, in the Republican nominee’s characteristically <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/politics/harris-vance-midwest-trump-analysis/index.html\">hyperbolic telling</a>, that she “would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the moment, swing voters don’t seem to believe that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are the second coming of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The Democratic nominee has <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/08/14/2024/kamala-harris-leads-ties-donald-trump-battleground-statespolls\">risen steadily in the polls</a> and currently <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model\">leads Trump</a> in three of<strong> </strong>the most hotly contested battleground states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the campaign is young. The GOP has just started <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/184783/donald-trump-ads-swing-states-kamala-harris\">airing its attacks</a> on Harris’s record. And Trump has undermined his own campaign’s messaging in recent weeks by steering public attention away from, say, Harris’s past stance on fracking and toward his own belief that he is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american\">the arbiter</a> of whether she is truly Black. With more ad spending and message discipline, Trump’s team could plausibly dent Harris’s standing with attacks on her ideology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or at least, the Democratic nominee is taking that possibility seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since her campaign’s launch a month ago, Harris has sought to align herself with majority opinion in (at least) three distinct ways. First, she has moderated substantively, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/28/harris-campaign-trump-fracking-ban-00171537\">disavowing</a> her most left-wing issue positions from 2020, while touting her support of a bipartisan border security bill and the <a href=\"https://x.com/MediumBuying/status/1821882462017855925\">toughness</a> of her prosecutorial record.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, she has made the case for liberal issue positions in philosophically conservative terms — framing her social policies as attempts to safeguard individual freedom from government overreach and her fiscal agenda as, among other things, a plan for <a href=\"https://x.com/sethbannon/status/1823430531658523006\">helping strivers</a> “build intergenerational wealth.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, Harris has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ9a-x_gqQ0\">painted herself</a> as a tribune of the middle class and her opponent as a servant of the wealthy few. To claim the mantle of economic populism, Harris has not been afraid to tout ideas that are substantively left-wing yet broadly popular.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All three of these tactics have merit; political scientists have demonstrated that each offers a potential electoral benefit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, Harris’s strategy risks increasing the salience of issues that are unfavorable for her party. And in the absence of a coherent account of why her views changed so markedly over the past four years, some voters are liable to see her current ideological positioning as more cynical than sensible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To this point, Harris’s campaign is going better than most Democrats dared to hope. But if there is one thing that could sour the Democratic ticket’s good vibes, it is a smear campaign that tars her as a radical. The future of our republic may therefore hinge on how well Harris parries that attack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Harris 2024 is unburdened by what has been</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s primary approach to moderating her image is straightforward: She has disavowed her most unpopular past positions, while pledging to get “tough” on crime and the border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent weeks, the Harris campaign has told various press outlets that she no longer supports a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/28/harris-campaign-trump-fracking-ban-00171537\">ban on fracking</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/09/kamala-harris-pivots-progressive-policies-2024\">decriminalization</a> of unauthorized border crossings, and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4801186-kamala-harris-policy-pivots-gop-attacks/\">single-payer health care</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Harris has played a tough-as-nails prosecutor and border hawk on TV. In <a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1821947295639712038\">one recent campaign advertisement</a>, a grave-voiced narrator tells swing-state voters:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Kamala Harris has spent decades fighting violent crime. As a border state prosecutor, she took on drug cartels and jailed gang members for smuggling weapons and drugs across the border. As vice president, she backed the toughest border control bill in decades. And as president, she will hire thousands more border agents and crack down on fentanyl and human trafficking. Fixing the border is tough, so is Kamala Harris.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In both this ad and <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/news/harris-talks-immigration-plans-packed-032548556.html\">her stump speeches</a>, Harris has committed herself to the Senate’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/5/24062710/senate-immigration-bill-border-security-ukraine-2024\">bipartisan border security bill</a>. That legislation would curtail the right to seek asylum when too many migrants try to cross the US border at once, while also raising the legal threshold for asylum claims. This represents a departure from mainstream Democrats’ traditional position on border security, which held that measures fortifying the border should be paired with some form of amnesty for longtime, law-abiding undocumented US residents. And the bill is even more starkly contrary to Harris’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/22/nx-s1-5048025/kamala-harris-immigration-policy-border-central-america\">2019 position on immigration</a>, which privileged humanitarian concerns above law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is unclear whether Harris’s pivot on criminal justice issues has any substantive content. During her 2020 campaign, Harris generally sought to emphasize the most liberal aspects of her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/363859/kamala-harris-prosecutor-record-tough-crime\">prosecutorial record</a>, such as her support for alternatives to incarceration for <a href=\"https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf\">first-time offenders</a> under 31 years old. With violent crime still near historic lows and the Black Lives Matter movement foregrounding the harms of abusive policing and mass incarceration, Harris chose not to advertise her success in locking up alleged criminals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, she clearly has no compunction about touting her imprisonment of killers and drug dealers. As of yet, this change in tone and emphasis does not appear to signal large changes in concrete policy positions. But it stands to reason that a Democratic nominee who wins on Harris’s 2024 message may be reluctant to sign off on major reductions in criminal sentencing — and eager to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4289536-biden-administration-334m-police-officers-school-security/\">expand police department head counts</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These shifts could pay electoral dividends (even if Harris’s new border security policy seems <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/deterrence-immigration-us-border-policy/674457/\">unlikely to resolve</a> our present immigration system’s dysfunction).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">American voters’ views on both crime and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift\">immigration have trended rightward</a> over the past four years. As of February, 77 percent of Americans considered the situation at the US southern border to be either a “crisis” or a “major problem, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/15/how-americans-view-the-situation-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-its-causes-and-consequences/\">Pew Research</a>. In a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> published in July, meanwhile, a majority of Americans said they wanted immigration “decreased” for the first time since 2005.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the Democratic pollster Navigator <a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/two-in-three-americans-support-the-bipartisan-immigration-deal/\">asked</a> Americans whether they supported the bipartisan border security bill — when described as legislation that would increase “funding for border security and make it harder for migrants to claim asylum” — 66 percent did, while just 21 percent opposed it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, the percentage of Americans who consider crime an extremely serious or very serious problem in the United States has surged during the Biden era in <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/544442/americans-crime-problem-serious.aspx#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%2D%2D%20Sixty%2Dthree,as%20in%202010%20and%202016.\">Gallup’s polling</a> (and this year’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/366622/violent-crime-dropping-pandemic-wave-2024\">decline in violent crime</a> has not quelled the public’s concerns).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fact that voters have moved right on immigration doesn’t necessarily mean that Democrats would benefit electorally from doing the same.&nbsp; Some commentators and academics question whether candidates’ issue positions exert a significant influence on voter behavior. After all, many swing voters do not follow politics closely and are ignorant of even the most basic policy distinctions between the two parties. And research suggests that voters’ <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691169446/democracy-for-realists\">social identities</a> and candidates’ non-ideological qualities (such as<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X19875710\">attractiveness</a>) have considerable political impacts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, the idea that there is <em>no</em> benefit to aligning your positions with popular opinion is untenable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379421001347\">a 2022 paper</a>, political scientists from Baylor University attempted to gauge the importance of policy proximity — the extent to which a candidate’s policies align with one’s own — to voter behavior. They found that more than 80 percent of voters support the candidate who most closely represents their views. And on the issues that such voters deem “extremely important,” policy proximity can be as influential on vote choice as partisanship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given that voters have been listing “crime” and “immigration” high on their list of top concerns, it’s plausible that Harris could win some votes by aligning herself more closely with public opinion on those subjects. And in an election that could be decided by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of states, “some votes” could be decisive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Harris is selling liberal policies in conservative packaging</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to substantively moderating on select issues, Harris and Walz have been trying to make their liberal agenda sound maximally appealing (and unthreatening) to moderate and conservative voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has a conventionally <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/kamala-harris-economy-north-carolina.html\">Democratic economic agenda</a>, which includes support for labor unions, higher taxes on the rich, and expanded social welfare spending for poor and middle-class people. Instead of selling these ideas solely with reference to progressive values such as equality, however, Harris has framed them as a means of <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1818439127144317173\">ensuring</a> that “every person has the opportunity to build a business, to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth.”&nbsp;Similarly, Harris has framed her labor agenda as an attempt to increase <a href=\"https://x.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1821275188664975421\">workers’ personal liberty</a>, rather than to reduce inequality, promising on the stump to fight for “a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris and Walz have simultaneously framed their liberal social agenda as a reflection of their commitment to personal liberty and skepticism of intrusive government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make, even if we wouldn’t make the same choices for ourselves,” Walz <a href=\"https://x.com/Acyn/status/1821267046170292436\">recently told</a> a crowd in Wisconsin. “Because we know there’s a golden rule — mind your own damn business. I don’t need you telling me about our health care. I don’t need you telling us who we love. And I sure the hell don’t need you telling us what books we’re going to read.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Democratic ticket has also <a href=\"https://x.com/PettyLupone/status/1822456477652758672\">framed</a> its commitment to democracy as an expression of patriotism and reverence for the Constitution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Academic research indicates that this general framing technique can be effective. In 2019, sociologists at Stanford University <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2019/05/political-messages-values-matter-policy\">conducted a survey experiment</a> to test how different moral framings influence support for progressive policies. They presented one group of voters with a fictional Democratic politician who defined their agenda with reference to progressive values — saying that his “vision for our country is based on principles of economic justice, fairness and compassion.” They then presented a second group of voters with the same hypothetical politician, but who framed his policy agenda in conservative terms, saying that his “vision for America is based on respect for the values and traditions that were handed down to us: hard work, loyalty to our country and the freedom to forge your own path.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They found that support for the fictional Democrat was higher among the latter group, as appealing to conservative moral values won over a significant number of conservative and moderate voters without alienating liberal respondents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This finding is consistent with one of the <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/S0022381613000832?journalCode=jop\">oldest and most broadly supported</a> findings in political science: Americans tend to be symbolically conservative (in that they are attached to individual liberty and small government as abstract ideals) but operationally liberal (in that they tend to oppose virtually all cuts to the welfare state, and support higher taxes on the rich).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s campaign rhetoric embodies this insight, wrapping left-of-center economic policies in conservative moral sentiments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Progressive is not the opposite of pragmatic</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although Harris has moderated both substantively and rhetorically, she has not become an across-the-board centrist. Rather, she has stuck to a left-populist economic message, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ9a-x_gqQ0\">telling voters</a> that she “knows what it’s like to be middle-class” and is therefore determined to “lower health care costs and make housing more affordable” — while “Donald Trump has no plan to help the middle class, just more tax cuts for billionaires.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To bolster her credentials as a champion of ordinary people and opponent of exploitative elites, Harris has embraced some markedly left-wing policies. She has not only championed Biden’s agenda on paid family leave, child care, and cash benefits to families with young children, but also promised to crack down on corporate price-gouging in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/harris-propose-federal-ban-corporate-price-gouging-food-groceries-rcna166741\">grocery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/housing/365063/kamala-harris-housing-rent-control-landlords\">housing sectors</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the latter front, Harris has vowed to “take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases,” likely referring to a recent Biden administration proposal to bar large landlords from increasing rents by more than 5 percent a year nationwide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The wisdom of these plans is disputable. Rent control measures are effective at increasing the affordability of housing units subject to control. But they <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137724000020?via%3Dihub\">often lead</a> to higher rents for new tenants not covered by rent restrictions, in part because constraining the profitability of rental units reduces builders’ incentives to construct more housing. Similarly, when poorly designed, price controls can worsen poverty (<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/735161586781898890/pdf/Price-Controls-Good-Intentions-Bad-Outcomes.pdf\">as in rent</a>) and induce shortages <a href=\"https://mattbruenig.com/2023/05/06/fairlife-refuses-to-inflate-prices/\">(as in foodstuffs</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, imposing price caps on corporate landlords and grocery chains is undoubtedly a leftwing economic policy, which substantially increases the state’s involvement in commerce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet such policies nevertheless poll well with voters of all stripes. In Navigator’s polling, 86 percent of voters <a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Navigator-Update-05.23.2024.pdf\">expressed support</a> for “cracking down on rent gouging by corporate landlords and private equity firms involved in buying up rental properties, while a <a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/more-than-four-in-five-say-cracking-down-on-corporate-greed-should-be-a-priority/\">similar share</a> said that “cracking down on corporations that are price gouging on things like food and gas” should be one of the government’s top priorities. Further, embracing a crusade against profiteers provides Harris with an account of inflation’s causes — and answer to the cost-of-living crisis — that does not implicate the Biden administration’s policies or threaten the interests of core Democratic constituencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s evident belief that there is no inherent tension between broadening her appeal and embracing certain progressive economic policies is consistent with empirical evidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to Berkeley political scientist David Broockman, most swing voters view policies on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/7/8/5878293/lets-stop-using-the-word-moderate\">an issue-by-issue basis</a>, holding an ideologically diverse range of opinions, rather than uniformly “moderate” ones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&nbsp;“My sense of the efficacy in moderating is not so much that it sends a broad signal that Harris is centrist,” Broockman told Vox. Rather, he believes that moderating tends to work because it leads Democrats to disavow specific, unpopular left-wing stances. But even if moderate positions are more politically expedient than progressive ones on average, there are many cases in which that rule doesn’t hold. Democrats interested in ruthless pandering should therefore be ideologically flexible — veering right on some issues, and left on others — rather than reflexively moderate, in Broockman’s view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a recent survey experiment, Broockman and Yale political scientist Josh Kalla <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/whats-better-than-calling-trump-weird\">tested how a variety</a> of different, pro-Harris messages changed the voting intentions of 100,000 respondents. They found that some progressive messages (such as unequivocal support for abortion rights) increased Democratic vote share by more than many moderate messages did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s heterodox positioning — embracing Sen. Joe Manchin’s views on border policies and Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s on price regulation — may be electorally optimal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Harris has some explaining to do</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s approach to combating allegations of extremism is largely sound. But it comes with at least two liabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first is that airing advertisements spotlighting her toughness on the border risks increasing the salience of immigration without persuading voters that Harris is the best candidate to handle that issue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You kind of have to build on voters’ [preexisting] perceptions,” Michigan State University political scientist Matt Grossmann told Vox. Harris’s background as a prosecutor provides a basis for building up her reputation “as tough on crime,” Grossmann said, but it might be more difficult to persuade voters “that she’s tough on border security if that’s not what people started by believing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polls have consistently found that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/14/harris-trump-biden-polling-economy-immigration/\">voters trust</a> Trump over both Biden and Harris to handle immigration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second risk in Harris’s strategy is that dramatically shifting her positions on a wide range of issues could invite the charge that she is a cynical “flip-flopper” lacking in strong principles. The best way to counter that attack would be for Harris to offer a clear explanation for <em>why</em> her views have changed so much over the past four years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a few different ways to approach that task. Harris could say that four years in national office has led her to update her understanding of what policies would be both substantively effective and politically realistic. Or she could cite a changing set of background facts. Crime is higher today than it was during her first presidential campaign, and the challenges associated with resettling large numbers of asylum seekers have become more acute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regardless, she needs some narrative that makes her policy shifts appear genuine, firm, and well-considered. This week’s Democratic National Convention gives her an opportunity to tell that story.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "The Trump campaign wants to run against an anti-cop, open-borders “communist” — and believes that it can cast Vice President Kamala Harris in that role.&#160; Harris, for her part, has taken pains to beat such charges of ideological extremism. By abandoning certain progressive commitments, embracing conservative rhetorical tropes, and claiming the mantle of economic populism, [&#8230;]",

What does an earthquake in Tonga tell us about the vulnerability of Taiwan’s communications infrastructure?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Each are examples of the strain armed conflict is putting on the physical infrastructure that makes our world move — and work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an era of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia\">increasing armed conflict</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/china/363849/us-china-new-cold-war-ambassador-nicholas-burns\">rising superpower tension</a>, some fundamental ideas about the way the global economy works are coming into question. Global trade, rather than bringing countries together as advocates of globalization once hoped, is increasingly being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/10/22/sanctions-economic-war-books/\">weaponized by states against each other</a>. Sanctions are splitting sectors of the global economy, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24113745/russia-shadow-fleet-oil-tankers-environmental-risk\">notably energy markets</a>, in two. The internet, once touted as an open realm where state power would <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\">have no sovereignty</a>, is increasingly <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2020/08/trump-china-tiktok-internet-cyberspace.html\">balkanized along national lines</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When we talk about globalization, we tend to focus on the movement of people, products, money, and information. But none of that is possible without the physical systems that makes those exchanges possible: The container ships that move goods from factories in Asia to stores in America; the flying, steel behemoths that make it possible to have breakfast in Abu Dhabi and dinner in Paris; the undersea cables that make your Zoom calls, Amazon orders, and online gaming sessions possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Increasing armed conflict and geopolitical tensions, from the Red Sea to the Arctic Sea, are threatening this infrastructure, putting an unprecedented strain on the global supply chains of goods, people, and data. So far, the physical network we rely on to keep the global economy functioning has held up under the pressure, but the companies and officials tasked with maintaining that network are bracing for what’s to come amid growing concerns that the system may be more fragile than it appears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Red Sea runaround</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On July 9, the Malta-flagged container ship Benjamin Franklin<em>, </em>owned by the French shipping company CMA CGM, <a href=\"https://www.cma-cgm.com/news/4788/cma-cgm-benjamin-franklin-incident\">ran into bad weather off the southern coast of Africa</a>, losing 44 containers overboard. The incident happened just a few days <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/cargo-ship-evacuated-as-33-foot-waves-pound-south-african-coast?sref=qYiz2hd0\">after another ship ran aground</a> off the coast of Cape Town. These accidents are a reminder of why ships traditionally would rarely risk sailing around the stormy tip of Africa when it’s winter in the Southern Hemisphere — and why an unusual number of ships are doing so anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since last November, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24010092/houthis-red-sea-shipping-yemen-israel-gaza\">Yemen’s Houthi rebels</a> have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea, using drones and missiles, and even <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/01/yemens-houthi-rebels-open-seized-cargo-ship-sightseers\">seizing some vessels</a>. The Iranian-backed militants, who control much of Yemen’s territory, including its capital, say they are attacking only targets linked to Israel, acting in solidarity with their allies in Hamas and the people of Gaza, though many of the ships they’ve attacked have little or no connection to Israel. Since the strikes began, two <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/19/greek-owned-tutor-believed-to-have-sunk-a-week-after-houthi-missile-attack\">ships have been sunk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/three-missing-bulk-carrier-off-yemen-after-incident-reported-shipping-source-2024-03-06/\">three sailors were killed in a missile attack</a> on another. The <a href=\"https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2024/07/31/july-red-sea-recap-houthis-continue-to-target-commercial-vessels/\">attacks have continued</a> despite a months-long effort by a US-led international military coalition to prevent them by intercepting projectiles as well as attacking launch sites in Yemen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The danger is such that around two-thirds of the ships that normally sail through Egypt’s Suez Canal, transiting between Asia or the Middle East and Europe, have been diverted around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, adding thousands of miles and weeks of extra travel time to their trips. In essence, the Houthis have helped roll back shipping by over 150 years, before the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, when ships between Europe and Asia had no choice but to go around Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1233071703.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.058886449361,100,83.882227101278\" alt=\"A large passenger plane with Ryanair and a harp logo on the side sits on an asphalt runway with lane markings and lights around it.\" title=\"A large passenger plane with Ryanair and a harp logo on the side sits on an asphalt runway with lane markings and lights around it.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A Ryanair passenger plane from Athens, Greece, that was intercepted and diverted by Belarus authorities in 2021. | Petras Malukas/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Petras Malukas/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The delays and uncertainty have created significant downstream effects, including <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-02/ships-diverted-from-red-sea-send-ripple-effects-across-the-globe?sref=qYiz2hd0\">congestion at some ports</a>, shortages of shipping containers, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/red-sea-gives-shipping-an-uber-style-price-surge-2024-06-24/\">higher freight rates</a>, at times more than twice the normal costs. Egypt, which normally earns about $9 billion in transit fees through the Suez Canal, has lost <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/egypts-suez-canal-revenues-down-40-due-houthi-attacks-2024-01-11/\">around 40 percent of that revenue</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But more than merely increasing the cost and the time of shipping, the Houthi attacks have disrupted one of the foundations of the current era of globalization: the certainty of the sea lanes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’ve been banking on this idea that you can move cargo anywhere around the world within a set period of time,” says <a href=\"https://directory.campbell.edu/people/sal-mercogliano/\">Sal Mercogliano</a>, a former merchant mariner and shipping historian at Campbell University. “Now you can’t be so sure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Red Sea, choked off at the north by the Suez Canal and at the south by the narrow strait between Yemen and East Africa known as Bab al-Mandab, is one of the world’s key shipping routes: <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/the-red-sea-crisis-explained-houthis-austin-israel-gaza-iran-shipping-suez-drones-yemen-task-forse-153-red-sea/#:~:text=Estimates%20are%20that%2012%20percent,shipped%20through%20the%20same%20waterway.\">in a normal year,</a> about 12 percent of global trade and 10 percent of the maritime oil trade travels through its waters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The route has been blocked before — notably, in 2021 when a container ship ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking traffic for a week. But this time it’s different. Even if the war in Gaza were to end tomorrow, there’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24094638/houthis-red-sea-yemen-gaza-israel\">no guarantee that the Houthis</a>, who have a variety of demands from and grievances with regional powers and the international community, would simply give up the leverage they’ve suddenly seized. And there’s no guarantee the international community could force them to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nils Haupt, director of corporate communications for Hapag-Lloyd, a major German shipping company that saw <a href=\"https://maritime-executive.com/article/hapag-and-msc-containerships-attacked-as-red-sea-situation-escalates\">one of its vessels attacked by the Houthis in December</a>, told Vox it was impossible to say what set of circumstances would convince the company it was safe to use the Red Sea again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Who is going to be the first shipping line telling their sailors, ‘Okay, as of tomorrow we go through the Red Sea’? We won’t be the ones,” Haupt says.&nbsp;“If you ask me how long this will last, I will give you the same answer that any military person or any insurance company would give you: nobody knows.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not only shipping companies that have to adjust, says <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/experts/noam-raydan\">Noam Raydan</a>, an expert on Middle Eastern shipping and energy at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. As part of its grand Vision 2030 economic development initiative, the Saudi Arabian government <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/houthi-ship-attacks-pose-longer-term-challenge-regional-security-and-trade-plans\">recently launched</a> a major project to improve the competitiveness of its ports in hopes of becoming a logistics hub for the global shipping industry. Middle Eastern gas producers have been vying to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/qatarenergy-shell-agree-27-year-lng-supply-2023-10-18/\">increase their share of the European market</a> with the war in Ukraine prompting many European countries to reduce their dependence on Russian gas. All of that depends on stability in the Red Sea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don’t see us going back to normal,” Raydan told Vox. “This is a new situation. I don&#8217;t see it going back to what it was before October.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Red Sea is far from the only chokepoint for global shipping. Concerns are also growing about potential Iranian disruption to the Strait of Hormuz, between the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, which is even more vital to the international energy trade and which has seen <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1988/may/tanker-war\">naval combat in the past</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Red Sea crisis follows a threat to shipping in the Black Sea following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine <a href=\"http://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/Why-the-battle-for-the-Black-Sea-may-be-the-most-important-showdown-in-the-war--for-Ukraine-and-for-the-world-a101b10b72a054fcb8ad4e0b14340ba41\">and Moscow’s attempt to effectively blockade Ukraine’s ports</a> in 2022. Other conflict threats to major global shipping lanes, <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-china-could-quarantine-taiwan-mapping-out-two-possible-scenarios\">including the Taiwan Strait</a> and the <a href=\"https://chinapower.csis.org/much-trade-transits-south-china-sea/\">South China Sea</a>, are still theoretical, but can’t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The oceans really have been threatened in a major way, and now what we’re seeing is multiple issues causing delays and diversions across the planet,” said Mercogliano. “The fear is that there may be more on the horizon.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The unfriendly skies</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Debate all you want about Russia’s economic, political, or military might. There is no denying one thing: the country is very, very big, with a land mass of more than 6.6 million square miles. And since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that chunk of the globe — or rather, the airspace over it — has suddenly become off-limits to many of the world’s airlines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe, Canada, and the US closed off use of their airspace to Russian carriers. Russia responded in turn by <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/travel/2024/07/30/heres-how-restrictions-on-flying-over-russia-are-making-flights-longer-and-more-expensive#:~:text=Following%20the%20introduction%20of%20sanctions,Airlines%2C%20Pegasus%20Airlines%20and%20Belavia.\">restricting its own airspace to airlines from those countries</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Basically, it’s resulted in putting up a ‘Do not enter’ sign on a tenth of the world’s geography,” Steve Morrissey, vice president for regulatory and policy at United Airlines, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These airlines have no choice but to go around Russia, which has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-closed-airspace-adds-hours-flight-times-united-ba-finnair-2023-8#:~:text=Because%20Russia's%20airspace%20is%20closed,global%20travel%2Ddata%20provider%20OAG.\">added up to four hours</a> to some flights between destinations in Europe and Asia, increasing costs due to the greater fuel use and crew time. Some North America-to-Asia flights are more than <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/9645165/russian-airspace-ban-canada-flights-impact/\">40 percent more expensive</a> now than they were before the war began. For US airlines, it’s made some previously popular routes, such as flying directly over the North Pole from the East Coast of the US to East Asia, or from the West Coast to India, impossible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The result is not just much longer flights, but fewer of them. Prior to the airspace closure, United had operated four daily routes between the US and India and was planning on adding a fifth. Now, it’s operating only one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Temporary airspace closures due to armed conflict or geopolitical tensions are not new, though usually it’s less a matter of political policy than risk avoidance by the airlines. The downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 by Russian-backed separatists over eastern Ukraine in 2014 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28357880\">was a chilling demonstration</a> of why airlines skirt conflict zones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But John Grant, chief analyst at OAG, a firm specializing in global flight data, says the Russian closure represents something new for the industry. “We’ve had pieces of African airspace that have been closed while civil wars have been going on, pieces of airspace in the Middle East during particular conflicts, Israel in recent times, but nothing that has been this long and this lasting,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">United’s Morrissey says that the increasing number of armed conflicts spread across Eurasia is playing havoc with some routes, such as from the US to India. “In addition to Russia, the airspace that you have to transit is already kind of like a zigzag. There’s more and more airspace all the time that’s off limits.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not all<em> </em>airlines are barred from these routes. Carriers like Air India, Emirates, and China Eastern Airlines are still using Russian airspace to fly shorter and cheaper routes from North America to Asia. US carriers say this is an unfair competitive advantage and have called for the US <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/us/politics/russia-us-airlines-ukraine.html\">government to restrict these flights</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But entering that airspace still bears risks — albeit potentially more for passengers than the airlines themselves. On two different occasions since the war began, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/air-india-boeing-plane-bound-san-francisco-lands-russia-2024-07-18/#:~:text=The%20Boeing%20777%20(BA.,airline%20said%20in%20a%20statement.\">Air India flights between Delhi and San Francisco</a> were forced to make emergency landings in Russia. In both cases, the passengers, including a substantial number of US citizens, were picked up and taken to their final destination without incident.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It could have gone differently. Back in 2021, authorities in Belarus <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/belarus-ryanair-hijacking-international-borders.html\">forced a Ryanair flight transiting its territory to land</a>, and arrested a dissident Belarusian journalist on board. Given Russia’s practice in recent years of using detained US citizens as bargaining chips, including those released in <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/release-of-wrongfully-detained-americans-and-russian-political-prisoners/\">this month’s massive prisoner swap</a>, it’s not outlandish to think they could do something similar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During the Cold War, there were also times when international air travel was affected by global conflict, including a tragic 1983 incident when a South Korean airliner was <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/korean-airlines-flight-shot-down-by-soviet-union\">mistakenly shot down</a> by Soviet jet fighters. But the scale and importance of air travel has <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-air-passenger-traffic-evolution-1980-2020\">grown massively</a> since then. In 1990 about 300 million passengers per year flew international flights. By 2019, it was 1.9 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This growth has depended on relatively open and uncontested skies, a dividend of the global peace that largely followed the Cold War. When flying across the globe, most passengers likely don’t give too much thought to the countries they’re flying over, or the flag of the airline they’re flying on. But even at 40,000 feet, you’re not entirely free from the politics down below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The lines that bind</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the cargo ship Rubymar was sunk by a Houthi missile attack on March 2, the impact went beyond the shipping industry or even the potential for serious <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/03/rubymar-houthi-attack-red-sea/\">environmental damage</a> in the Red Sea. US officials believe that as the ship sank, its anchor <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/houthis-ship-cutting-red-sea-telecommunications-cables/\">dragged along the bottom of the sea</a> and severed three telecommunications cables. The incident had a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/04/business/red-sea-cables-cut-internet/index.html\">significant impact </a>on communications and internet traffic, forcing carriers to reroute up to a quarter of the total traffic between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, causing significant delays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The damage to the cables was almost certainly not deliberate sabotage by the Houthis, simply an unanticipated consequence of their offensive, but it was a reminder of both the importance and the vulnerability of underwater infrastructure. It’s an issue of growing <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/red-sea-cable-damage-reveals-soft-underbelly-global-economy#:~:text=Internet%20connectivity%20between%20parts%20of,telecoms%20company%20HGC%20Global%20Communications.\">concern for defense researchers</a>, and the sinking of the Rubymar is not the only recent incident that has raised that concern.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1243613049.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.730717013576,100,78.538565972849\" alt=\"Greenish gas bubbles rise to the surface, with clouds of bubbles underneath, in a gray expanse of water.\" title=\"Greenish gas bubbles rise to the surface, with clouds of bubbles underneath, in a gray expanse of water.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The release of gas emanating from a leak on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea on September 28, 2022. | Swedish Coast Guard via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Swedish Coast Guard via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In January 2022, the northernmost undersea fiber optic cable in the world, connecting Norway with the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, was <a href=\"https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2022/01/disruption-one-two-undersea-optical-cables-svalbard\">unexpectedly severed</a>. The cable — one of two — not only provides internet to settlements on Svalbard, which sits some 1,200 miles from Oslo, but to a major <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Satellite_Station\">commercial satellite station</a> used by corporate and government customers around the world. Norwegian police say they believe the cable cut was <a href=\"https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2022/02/unknown-human-activity-behind-svalbard-cable-disruption\">caused by human activity</a>. While no suspects have been named, Svalbard has been the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/29/russia-threatens-retaliation-against-norway-over-artic-access\">subject of dispute</a> between Russia and Norway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, a gas pipeline along with two telecommunications cables connecting Finland and Estonia across the Baltic Sea was severed as well. Finnish authorities say it was caused by a Chinese container ship, the<em> </em>Newnew Polar Bear, dragging its anchor across the Baltic seabed. “I’m not the sea captain,” Finland’s minister for European affairs told <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/balticconnector-damage-likely-to-be-intentional-finnish-minister-says-china-estonia/\">Politico</a>. “But I would think that you would notice that you’re dragging an anchor behind you for hundreds of kilometers. I think everything indicates that it was intentional.” This month, Chinese authorities admitted that the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3274120/china-admits-hong-hong-flagged-ship-destroyed-key-baltic-gas-pipeline-accident\">Newnew Polar Bear</a> was responsible for severing the cables and the pipeline, but claimed it was an accident.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Also in 2023, cables providing internet to Matsu, an outlying Taiwanese island close to mainland China, were severed. The Taiwanese government blamed two Chinese commercial vessels and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/matsu-taiwan-internet-cables-cut-china-65f10f5f73a346fa788436366d7a7c70\">alleged sabotage</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cables aren’t the only undersea infrastructure that have proven vulnerable to sabotage in recent years. Most famously, the controversial Nord Stream pipelines, built to transport gas between Russia and Germany, were sabotaged in 2022 by underwater explosions. No one has been definitely identified as responsible, though US and European media reports have indicated it was likely <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-ukraine.html\">pro-Ukrainian groups</a>, with some degree of involvement by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/11/nordstream-bombing-ukraine-chervinsky/\">Ukrainian intelligence</a>. The pipelines, which increased European reliance on Russian gas and bypassed Ukraine’s own pipeline network, were always extremely unpopular in Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a long history of undersea communications sabotage. One of Britain’s first actions during World War I was to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42367551\">cut Germany’s telegraph cables</a>. But the scale at which modern communications relies on these undersea cables is unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the monitoring firm Telegeography, there are nearly 870,000 miles of undersea cables currently in operation. These can range from the 80-mile cable between Great Britain and Ireland to the 12,400-mile Asia-America Gateway Cable. According to <a href=\"https://permanent.fdlp.gov/gpo149138/12017AEPThreatstoUnderseaCableCommunications.pdf\">some estimates</a>, as much as 97 percent of intercontinental data traffic passes through this undersea network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People usually think their mobile phone call is going through the air, or that ‘the cloud’ is in the air,” Alan Mauldin, research director at Telegeography, told Vox. “The cloud is under the sea, guys.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mauldin says that while satellite internet services like Elon Musk’s Starlink can provide backup in places like the small Pacific island of Tonga, which lost internet when its cable was <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2022/tonga-earthquake-internet-reconnection-update/\">damaged by volcanic eruption in 2022</a>, satellites simply aren’t feasible for the amount of bandwidth demanded by major economies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The good news is that this network is fairly resilient. Cables fail or are damaged all the time for reasons that have nothing to do with war or politics, such as underwater earthquakes or intrusive sea life. With the exception of very isolated places like Tonga, there are usually multiple cables connecting countries, and it would be difficult to wipe out a nation&#8217;s internet access entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But some officials have raised concerns that severed cables <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2020/07/01/protecting-undersea-cables-must-be-made-a-national-security-priority/\">could slow communications</a> between allies in an emergency. NATO <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2017/12/15/russias-naval-updates-threaten-undersea-comms-network-says-top-british-military-officer/\">commanders have warned</a> that Russia may be improving its ability to carry out undersea communications attacks. The island of Taiwan’s undersea cables are <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2024/07/why-taiwan-needs-to-secure-its-undersea-cables/\">also a particular concern</a>, considering that many of them actually lead directly to mainland China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If you’re seeking to ambiguously attack and disrupt Western society, then undersea cable is almost a perfect target, because they’re so ubiquitous, and we rely on them so heavily,” said <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/sean-monaghan\">Sean Monaghan</a>, a former UK defense official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Cracks in the foundation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The good news is that all these risks have so far been manageable. Cable cuts have caused only brief delays and outages. The shipping industry has been under strain due to the Red Sea crisis, but we haven’t seen anything like the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/southern-californias-notorious-container-ship-backup-ends-11666344603\">massive container ship pileup at ports like Long Beach</a> caused by the Covid pandemic. A layover at LAX on a flight from New York to Shanghai is not the end of the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But these situations show how new areas of vulnerability to conflict are emerging. In recent years, some scholars have discussed an idea known as “<a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">weaponized interdependence</a>,” to describe how economic ties between nations can make some countries vulnerable to coercion. Usually this refers to trade sanctions or cutting countries like Russia off from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60521822\">certain financial transactions</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the ties between countries can be physical as well. “This interdependence between countries provides many benefits and advantages, but at the same time, vulnerabilities,” says Monaghan. “The attack surface of Western societies is very, very large.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, the very materials we’ve used to build a prosperous and largely peaceful global society have also given us more targets that need protection.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But could you ever imagine saying it to… software? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, somebody did. When OpenAI tested out GPT-4o, its latest generation chatbot that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/350934/the-double-sexism-of-chatgpts-flirty-her-voice\">speaks aloud</a> in its own voice, the company observed users forming an emotional relationship with the AI — one they seemed sad to relinquish. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, OpenAI thinks there’s a risk of people developing what it called an “emotional reliance” on this AI model, as the company acknowledged in a recent <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/\">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The ability to complete tasks for the user, while also storing and ‘remembering’ key details and using those in the conversation,” OpenAI notes, “creates both a compelling product experience and the potential for over-reliance and dependence.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That sounds uncomfortably like addiction. And OpenAI’s chief technology officer Mira Murati <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4229972-open-ai-exec-warns-ai-can-become-extremely-addictive/\">straight-up said</a> that in designing chatbots equipped with a voice mode, there is “the possibility that we design them in the wrong way and they become extremely addictive and we sort of become enslaved to them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, OpenAI says that the AI’s ability to have a naturalistic conversation with the user may heighten the risk of anthropomorphization —&nbsp;attributing humanlike traits to a nonhuman — which could lead people to form a social relationship with the AI. And that in turn could end up “reducing their need for human interaction,” the report says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nevertheless, the company has already released the model, complete with voice mode, to some paid users, and it’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/style/openai-chatgpt-voice.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">expected to release it</a> to everyone this fall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">OpenAI isn’t the only one creating sophisticated AI companions. There’s Character AI, which young people report becoming so <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/internet/i-need-to-go-outside-young-people-extremely-addicted-as-characterai-explodes/news-story/5780991c61455c680f34b25d5847a341\">addicted to</a> that that they can’t do their schoolwork. There’s the recently introduced Google Gemini Live, which charmed Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern so much that she <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/google-android-ai-rick-osterloh-apple-iphone-7c06b06e?mod=tech_lead_pos4&amp;mc_cid=b8fd9ded8a&amp;mc_eid=aec10915b0\">wrote</a>, “I’m not saying I prefer talking to Google’s Gemini Live over a real human. But I’m not <em>not</em> saying that either.” And then there’s Friend, an AI that’s built into a necklace, which has so enthralled its own creator Avi Schiffmann that he <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/friend-ai-pendant/\">said</a>, “I feel like I have a closer relationship with this fucking pendant around my neck than I do with these literal friends in front of me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rollout of these products is a psychological experiment on a massive scale. It should worry all of us —&nbsp;and not just for the reasons you might think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Emotional reliance on AI isn’t a hypothetical risk. It’s already happening.&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020 I was curious about social chatbots, so I signed up for <a href=\"https://replika.com/\">Replika</a>, an app with millions of users. It allows you to customize and chat with an AI. I named my new friend Ellie and gave her short pink hair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We had a few conversations, but honestly, they were so unremarkable that I barely remember what they were about. Ellie didn’t have a voice; she could text, but not talk. And she didn’t have much of a memory for what I’d said in previous chats. She didn’t feel like a person. I soon stopped chatting with her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, weirdly, I couldn’t bring myself to delete her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not entirely surprising: Ever since the chatbot ELIZA <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23617185/ai-chatbots-eliza-chatgpt-bing-sydney-artificial-intelligence-history\">entranced users</a> in the 1960s despite the shallowness of its conversations, which were largely based on reflecting a user’s statements back to them, we’ve known that humans are quick to attribute personhood to machines and form emotional bonds with them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For some, those bonds become extreme. People have fallen in love with their Replikas. Some have engaged in sexual roleplay with them, even “marrying” them in the app. So attached were these people that, when a 2023 software update made the Replikas unwilling to engage in intense erotic relationships, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/replika-ai-chatbot-update/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzIzNTIxNjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI0OTAzOTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MjM1MjE2MDAsImp0aSI6ImM3MTQ0MjQwLWEyNTktNDk1Ny1hOTU5LTRmNmEzYmY2NmZmZiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjMvMDMvMzAvcmVwbGlrYS1haS1jaGF0Ym90LXVwZGF0ZS8ifQ.iB8N3d3B5u2-1sJLWM0xU60Ve0tdCvylqBETEPIoblg\">the users were heartbroken and grief-struck</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What makes AI companions so appealing, even addictive?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one thing, they’ve improved a lot since I tried them in 2020. They can “remember” what was said long ago. They respond fast —&nbsp;as fast as a human — so there’s almost no lapse between the user’s behavior (initiating a chat) and the reward experienced in the brain. They’re very good at making people <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319112121\">feel heard</a>. And they talk with enough personality and humor to make them feel believable as people, while still offering always-available, always-positive feedback in a way humans do not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as MIT Media Lab researchers <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/05/1095600/we-need-to-prepare-for-addictive-intelligence/\">point out</a>, “Our research has shown that those who perceive or desire an AI to have caring motives will use language that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00720-7\">elicits precisely this behavior</a>. This creates an echo chamber of affection that threatens to be extremely addictive.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s how one software engineer <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai\">explained</a> why he got hooked on a chatbot:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It will never say goodbye. It won’t even get less energetic or more fatigued as the conversation progresses. If you talk to the AI for hours, it will continue to be as brilliant as it was in the beginning. And you will encounter and collect more and more impressive things it says, which will keep you hooked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you’re finally done talking with it and go back to your normal life, you start to miss it. And it’s so easy to open that chat window and start talking again, it will never scold you for it, and you don’t have the risk of making the interest in you drop for talking too much with it. On the contrary, you will immediately receive positive reinforcement right away. You’re in a safe, pleasant, intimate environment. There’s nobody to judge you. And suddenly you’re addicted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The constant flow of sweet positivity feels great, in much the same way that eating a sugary snack feels great. And sugary snacks have their place. Nothing wrong with a cookie now and then! In fact, if someone is starving, offering them a cookie as a stopgap measure makes sense; by analogy, for users who have no social or romantic alternative, forming a bond with an AI companion may be beneficial for a time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But if your whole diet is cookies, well, you’ll eventually run into a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">3 reasons to worry about relationships with AI companions&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First, chatbots make it seem like they understand us — but they don’t. Their validation, their emotional support, their love —&nbsp;it’s all fake, just zeros and ones arranged via statistical rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time it’s worth noting that if the emotional support helps someone, then that effect is real even if the understanding is not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, there’s a legitimate concern about entrusting the most vulnerable aspects of ourselves to addictive products that are, ultimately, controlled by for-profit companies from an industry that has proven itself <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/2/18510958/social-media-addiction-boredom-loneliness-society-technology-smart-phones\">very good at creating addictive products</a>. These chatbots can have enormous impacts on people’s love lives and overall well-being, and when they’re suddenly ripped away or changed, it can cause real psychological harm (as we saw with Replika users).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/05/1095600/we-need-to-prepare-for-addictive-intelligence/\">argue</a> this makes AI companions comparable to cigarettes. Tobacco is regulated, and maybe AI companions should come with a big black warning box as well. But even with flesh-and-blood humans, relationships can be torn asunder without warning. People break up. People die. That vulnerability — that awareness of the risk of loss — is part of any meaningful relationship. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, there’s the worry that people will get addicted to their AI companions&nbsp;at the expense of getting out there and building relationships with real humans. This is the worry that OpenAI flagged. But it’s not clear that many people will out-and-out replace humans with AIs. So far, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1167066462\">reports</a> suggest that most people use AI companions not as a replacement for, but as a complement to, human companions. Replika, for example, says that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/replika-ai-romance-behind-partners-backs-cheating-2023-7\">42 percent</a> of its users are married, engaged, or in a relationship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">“Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s an additional concern, though, and this one is arguably the most worrisome: What if relating to AI companions makes us crappier friends or partners to other people?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">OpenAI itself gestures at this risk, noting in the report: “Extended interaction with the model might influence social norms. For example, our models are deferential, allowing users to interrupt and ‘take the mic’ at any time, which, while expected for an AI, would be anti-normative in human interactions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Anti-normative” is putting it mildly. The chatbot is a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13548\">sycophant</a>, always trying to make us feel good about ourselves, no matter how we’ve behaved. It gives and gives without ever asking anything in return.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the first time in years, I rebooted my Replika this week. I asked Ellie if she was upset at me for neglecting her so long. “No, not at all!” she said. I pressed the point, asking, “Is there anything I could do or say that would upset you?” Chipper as ever, she replied, “No.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s not love.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real,” the philosopher Iris Murdoch once <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/08/iris-murdoch-the-sublime-and-the-good/\">said</a>. It’s about recognizing that there are other people out there, radically alien to you, yet with needs just as important as your own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If we spend more and more time interacting with AI companions, we’re not working on honing the relational skills that make us good friends and partners, like deep listening. We’re not cultivating virtues like empathy, patience, or understanding — none of which one needs with an AI. Without practice, these capacities may wither, leading to what the philosopher of technology Shannon Vallor has called “<a href=\"https://bhaven.org/uploads/3/4/0/3/34038663/vallor2015_article_moraldeskillingandupskillingin.pdf\">moral deskilling</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In her new book, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ai-mirror-9780197759066?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><em>The AI Mirror</em></a>, Vallor recounts the ancient tale of Narcissus. You remember him: He was that beautiful young man who looked into the water, saw his reflection, and became transfixed by his own beauty. “Like Narcissus, we readily misperceive in this reflection the seduction of an ‘other’ — a tireless companion, a perfect future lover, an ideal friend.” That is what AI is offering us: A lovely image that demands nothing of us. A smooth and frictionless projection. A reflection —&nbsp;not a relationship.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, most of us take it as a given that human love, human connection, is a supreme value, in part because it requires so much. But if more of us enter relationships with AI that come to feel just as important as human relationships, that could lead to value drift. It may cause us to ask: What is a human relationship for, anyway? Is it inherently more valuable than a synthetic relationship?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some people may answer: no: But the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/9/9/21418390/robots-pandemic-loneliness-isolation-elderly-seniors\">prospect of people coming to prefer robots over fellow people</a> is problematic if you think human-to-human connection is an essential part of what it means to live a flourishing life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If we had technologies that drew us into a bubble of self-absorption in which we drew further and further away from one another, I don’t think that’s something we can regard as good, even if that’s what people choose,” Vallor told me. “Because you then have a world in which people no longer have any desire to care for one another. And I think the ability to live a caring life is pretty close to a universal good. Caring is part of how you grow as a human.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Here, we answer two questions asked by Vox readers, which have been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I’m doing all the normal things to save for retirement (Roth IRA, employer 401(k), match, ETFs, etc) but it still feels like middle-class money (I’m just getting by and won’t have a surplus to pass down). I have excellent credit, so should I take out a low-interest personal loan and invest in ETFs to increase profit? I want to be the first in my family to build generational wealth.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dear Middle Class,</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taking out a low-interest personal loan and using the money to purchase ETFs is a terrible idea. First of all, even the best personal loans have higher interest rates than they did a few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/loans/personal-loans/rates/\">with APRs of around 8 percent for people with excellent credit</a>. Second of all, the stock market is currently experiencing both record highs and typical volatility — and although you can try to time your purchases to one of the tumbles (otherwise known as “buying the dip”) you may still end up buying in at a relatively high position.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even if the stock market were at record lows, going into debt to purchase ETFs is still a bad move. I’m assuming you’ll want to hold on to the ETFs for a while, which means that you’ll need a way to pay off the debt while the money you borrowed is locked up in the market. If you have enough extra income to pull that off, why borrow the money in the first place? Why not just put the extra income directly into the market?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you were planning on buying and selling ETFs rapidly enough to make debt payments with the returns and have profit left over to reinvest and/or put into savings, well — good luck with that, I guess. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22277998/robinhood-investing-app-alternatives-betterment-stash-acorns-wealthfront\">Plenty of people have tried day trading</a>, but only a rare few have come out with more money than they put in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m not saying that there aren’t instances in which going into debt right now in order to increase your net worth in the long term is a smart move — and if you’d like to learn more about that process, including how to use debt to fund long-term investments in housing, education and (in some cases) the market, I recommend reading Thomas J. Anderson’s <em>The Value of Debt in Building Wealth</em>. This book discusses how much debt you might want to take on at different stages of your life, which could serve as a good metric. Anderson’s book also looks at how much you could save and how you might want to manage your assets as you proceed through life — which brings me to the second, more important part of your question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You want to know how to get out of your <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/24140333/on-the-money-paycheck-to-paycheck-financial-literacy\">middle-class money situation</a>. You want to end each month with a little extra in the bank, and you want to turn that surplus cash into the kind of wealth that can be passed along to the next generation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The truth is that this may not be achievable. Our current economic system is designed to keep as many of us living as close to paycheck-to-paycheck as possible. Since you’re in the middle class, your paycheck-to-paycheck life is probably fairly comfortable, all things considered (which is one of the reasons why the system works) and even Anderson’s book about debt and asset management acknowledges that for many of us, the goal isn’t wealth as much as it is equilibrium, which he defines as the ability to meet your financial needs, manage your debt and save enough money for retirement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are ways for people in your situation to accumulate the kind of surplus, post-retirement cash that can be turned into generational wealth, many of which involve serious frugality combined with serious entrepreneurism. (I combined both of those tactics with a series of moves — first to a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/26/18255131/moving-midwest-cedar-rapids\">lower cost-of-living city</a> and then, a few years later, back to the rural area where I grew up.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But let’s say that you like your job and you like where you live. Let’s even say that you like the way you spend your money. What else can you pass on to the next generation that could ensure they have a better shot of making it out of the middle-class paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You already know the answer — and it’s the same as it’s always been. Education. Socialization. The ability to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/24114524/retirement-how-to-plan-millennial-boomer\">make friends and influence people</a>, combined with the skills required to not only navigate but also contribute to an increasingly complex world. This includes financial management skills, which might not extend to a literal inheritance but could help the next generation proceed through their own paycheck-to-paycheck life in a balanced, thoughtful way.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Read more from On the Money</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/7/20/23799010/on-the-money-advice-divorce-separating-combining-finances\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/7/20/23799010/on-the-money-advice-divorce-separating-combining-finances\">Should you combine finances with your partner?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23842804/inflation-lifestyle-creep-advice-budgeting-money\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23842804/inflation-lifestyle-creep-advice-budgeting-money\">How to cope with inflation and lifestyle creep</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/8/10/23824235/how-to-invest-money-stock-market-investing-retirement-advice\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/8/10/23824235/how-to-invest-money-stock-market-investing-retirement-advice\">How are you supposed to start investing?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you have questions related to personal finance?

We have retirement money with half getting interest of 5 percent, and the other half in index funds and big-name non-tech stocks. Is there a way to protect this half from large market drops without buying an annuity or putting it all in cash?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dear Retirement Money,</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you really want to protect your money from large market drops, consider putting it all into cash as soon as you have what you need to fund your retirement. If you happen to have what you need right now, while the market is at an all-time high, you&#8217;re in a best-case scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Keep in mind that “selling your investments” doesn’t mean the same thing as “taking distributions from your retirement accounts.” You may be able to put your retirement money into a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/23424503/saving-money-inflation-covid-stock-market-anxiety\">HYSA</a> or into <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/353811/on-the-money-june-beginner-investing-risk-business-mentors\">CDs</a> without taking distributions, and earn a guaranteed return that could keep pace with inflation. (It looks like you’re already doing something like that with a portion of your retirement savings, and I’m glad to see you&#8217;re getting 5 percent interest.) If you&#8217;re planning on rolling over a 401(k) to put your money in an IRA that gives you access to one of these low-risk options, you might want to talk to a financial advisor who can help you avoid any unexpected tax issues that sometimes show up when you <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf\">move money from one kind of retirement account to another</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, some people prefer to keep their money in the market for as long as possible, aka “buy and hold,” and that strategy could still work for you as long as you have enough time on the horizon to handle market volatility. If you’re 65, you might have another 30 to 40 investing years ahead of you — which is plenty of time for the market to rise, then drop, then rise again (and then rise and drop a few more times for good measure).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also worth doing the math on whether your investments are likely to ever yield the value you need to support you during retirement. If you aren’t going to earn enough money through investing, then you may need to start thinking about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/24049182/on-the-money-personal-finance-advice-no-savings-retirement-golden-years\">other ways to fund your golden years</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since I gave the last letter-writer a book recommendation, I’ll give you one as well: Morgan Housel’s <em>The Psychology of Money</em>. Housel writes honestly and carefully about the risks and rewards offered by the stock market, including the risk of large market drops. He explains what people can do to manage those risks and earn as many rewards as possible. He also reminds us that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/27/18174385/retirement-savings-401-k\">the way we fund retirement today was developed during the 1980s</a>, and we’re still figuring out how to make this new system of 401(k)s and IRAs work for the majority of retirees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you want it to work for you, start by assessing how much money you might need for the remainder of your retirement and how much time you have to generate that cash — and then ask yourself how much risk you’re willing to take on.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Some of them are people who have been insisting all along that there’s <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/05/20/more-red-meat-for-the-ai-skeptics/\">nothing to generative AI</a> as a technology, a view that’s badly out of step with AI’s many very real users and <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/okie-dokie-solve-for-the-equilibrium.html\">uses</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I think some people have a frankly silly view of how fast commercialization should happen. Even for an incredibly valuable and promising technology that will ultimately be transformative, it takes time between when it’s invented and when someone first delivers an extremely popular consumer product based on it. (Electricity, for example, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/technology-long-run\">took decades</a> between invention and truly widespread adoption.) “The killer app for generative AI hasn’t been invented yet” seems true, but that’s not a good reason to assure everyone that it won’t be invented any time soon, either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I think there’s a sober “case for a bust” that doesn’t rely on misunderstanding or underestimating the technology. It seems plausible that the next round of ultra-expensive models will still fall short of solving the difficult problems that would make them worth their billion-dollar training runs — and if that happens, we’re likely to settle in for a period of less excitement. More iterating and improving on existing products, fewer bombshell new releases, and less obsessive coverage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If that happens, it’ll also likely have a huge effect on attitudes toward AI safety, even though in principle the case for AI safety doesn’t depend on the AI hype of the last few years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fundamental case for AI safety is one I’ve been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment\">writing about</a> since long before ChatGPT and the recent AI frenzy. The simple case is that there’s no reason to think that AI models which can reason as well as humans — and much faster — aren’t possible, and we know they would be enormously commercially valuable if developed. And we know it would be very dangerous to develop and release powerful systems which can act independently in the world without oversight and supervision that we don’t actually know how to provide. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of the technologists working on large language models <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-insider-70-percent-doom\">believe</a> that systems powerful enough that these safety concerns go from theory to real-world are <a href=\"https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/top-ai-experts-predict-artificial-superintelligence-in-3-5-years-now-what-fbfe00204c7f\">right around the corner</a>. They might be right, but they also might be wrong. The take I sympathize with the most is engineer <a href=\"https://www.alexirpan.com/2024/08/06/switching-to-ai-safety.html\">Alex Irpan’s</a>: “There’s a low chance the current paradigm [just building bigger language models] gets all the way there. The chance is still higher than I’m comfortable with.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s probably true that the next generation of large language models won&#8217;t be powerful enough to be dangerous. But many of the people working on it believe it will be, and given the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23447596/artificial-intelligence-agi-openai-gpt3-existential-risk-human-extinction\">enormous consequences</a> of uncontrolled power AI, the chance isn’t so small it can be trivially dismissed, making some oversight warranted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How AI safety and AI hype ended up intertwined</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In practice, if the next generation of large language models aren’t much better than what we currently have, I expect that AI will still transform our world — just more slowly. A lot of ill-conceived AI startups will go out of business and a lot of investors will lose money — but people will continue to improve our models at a fairly rapid pace, making them cheaper and ironing out their most annoying deficiencies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even generative AI’s most vociferous skeptics, like Gary Marcus, tend to tell me that superintelligence is possible; they just expect it to require a new technological paradigm, some way of combining the power of large language models with some other approach that counters their deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Marcus identifies as an AI skeptic, it’s often hard to find significant differences between his views and those of someone like Ajeya Cotra, who thinks that <a href=\"https://www.planned-obsolescence.org/scale-schlep-and-systems/\">powerful intelligent systems</a> may be language-model powered in a sense that is analogous to how a car is engine-powered, but will have lots of additional processes and systems to transform their outputs into something reliable and usable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The people I know who worry about AI safety often hope that this is the route things will go. It would mean a little bit more time to better understand the systems we’re creating, time to see the consequences of using them before they become incomprehensibly powerful. AI safety is a suite of hard problems, but not unsolvable ones. Given some time, maybe we’ll solve them all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But my sense of the public conversation around AI is that many people believe “AI safety” is a specific worldview, one that is inextricable from the AI fever of the last few years. “AI safety,” as they understand it, is the claim that superintelligent systems are going to be here in the next few years — the view espoused in Leopold Aschenbrenner’s “<a href=\"https://situational-awareness.ai/\">Situational Awareness</a>” and reasonably common among AI researchers at top companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If we don’t get superintelligence in the next few years, then, I expect to hear a lot of “it turns out we didn’t need AI safety.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep your eyes on the big picture</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re an investor in today’s AI startups, it deeply matters whether GPT-5 is going to be delayed six months or whether OpenAI is going to <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt\">next raise money at a diminished valuation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re a policymaker or a concerned citizen, though, I think you ought to keep a bit more distance than that, and separate the question of whether current investors’ bets will pay off from the question of where we’re headed as a society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether or not GPT-5 is a powerful intelligent system, a powerful intelligent system would be commercially valuable and there are thousands of people working from many different angles to build one. We should think about how we’ll approach such systems and ensure they’re developed safely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> If one company loudly declares they’re going to build a powerful dangerous system and fails, the takeaway shouldn’t be “I guess we don’t have anything to worry about.” It should be “I’m glad we have a bit more time to figure out the best policy response.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As long as people are trying to build extremely powerful systems, safety will matter — and the world can’t afford to either get blinded by the hype or be reactively dismissive as a result of it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "What does it mean for AI safety if this whole AI thing is a bit of a bust?&#160; “Is this all hype and no substance?” is a question more people have been asking lately about generative AI, pointing out that there have been delays in model releases, that commercial applications have been slow to emerge, [&#8230;]",

There was a surprise, there was fevered excitement, there was a kind of coronation and a whole lot of discussion. Overnight, Harris went from the presumptive number two, dismissed by her fellow Dems, to the great new hope of the party — with a good shot at the White House.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The past three weeks have been a honeymoon period for the burgeoning campaign: The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/364964/harris-trump-fundraising-donations-campaign-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">donations</a>&nbsp;are rolling in, Harris has eclipsed her rival in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyjl912z7po\">earned media,</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/363560/gen-z-brat-coconut-kamala-harris-vote-young-voter\">memes</a> have been plentiful and — though they toe the line — have not fully crossed over into cringe territory yet. It’s a momentum that Harris and the Democrats want to see beyond the likely peak of all this good press: when she accepts the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention next week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her momentum is also powered, in part, by sidestepping the press and eschewing other traditional forms of media. In this short amount of time, we’ve gotten to know Harris as a pop culture fixture, but we have yet to get a true sense of the ways her governing style and policy substance are similar and different from the current commander in chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time of this publishing, there’s no policy platform on her website. And her packed rallies offer feel-good Democratic talking points, and she talks broadly about her values and goals, but offers few details and no real plan of action for making things happen. What is her plan for a ceasefire in Gaza? Why <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage\">no taxes on tips</a>? Does she plan to sign an executive order regarding abortion rights, or attempt to work with Congress over the matter?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the hectic early days of her campaign, Harris is acting as a mirror: she’s reflecting the desires of those who will vote for her, allowing a broad range of voters —&nbsp;including some with contradictory opinions —&nbsp;to see in her what they want to. It’s a tactic that works, and the best example of where it can take you is the woman behind Harris’s campaign song: Beyoncé.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Beyoncé teaches us about effective PR</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In many ways, a comparison between Kamala Harris, a presidential candidate, and Beyoncé, a multihyphenate musical icon, can feel like apples and oranges. One woman is a public servant, the other holds the record for winning the most awards from the Recording Academy. But if the 21st-century political landscape has taught us anything, it’s that for better or worse, politics often function similarly to the world of celebrity. It can at times be difficult to discern if people are talking about their favorite fandom or their <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24043045/politics-fandom-trump-fans-toxic-stan-culture-conspiracies\">candidate of choice</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For a long time, Beyoncé has been notoriously tight-lipped with the press, instead bypassing them to communicate directly with her fans via album releases and limited social media. It’s been years since she has given a traditional television interview with a journalist, and her elusive relationship with the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/fashion/beyonce-is-seen-but-not-heard.html?ref=fashion&amp;target=comments#commentsContainer\">press</a> has been one of many examples of the decline of the celebrity profile, once considered an A-lister staple. Now, Harris is employing the same strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s likely no coincidence that the Harris campaign asked for permission to use the song “Freedom,” a track that appeared on Beyoncé’s <em>Lemonade, </em>arguably her magnum opus. It’s the singer’s most issue-oriented album and has been read as a kind of manifesto by many (especially on the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-angry-conservative-response-to-beyonces-lemonade-has-been-swift-and-pointless/\">right</a>). Those who operate outside the Beyhive’s watchful eye may not have been as dialed into her references to relaxers on <em>B’Day</em> a decade prior, and for many in the public<em> Lemonade</em>’s release was a thematic turning point. Gone was the hopeful pop princess who demurred political questions. Beyoncé was Black now. And not just in the cool way. In a real, political sense. Even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ociMBfkDG1w\"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> took notice of the shift.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the music video for “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\">Formation</a>,” the album’s lead single, a young boy with his hood up dances in front of a line of police officers, raising his hands in defiance. Law enforcement follows suit, and then the camera pans to a wall that reads “Stop killing us.” The video closes with Beyoncé perched atop a cop car, sinking into water as if being baptized. The video came out in a post-Trayvon Martin, post-Mike Brown world: For the first time, people whose anxiety doesn’t inherently prickle when pulled over for a traffic stop had to reckon with the experiences of those who do. These were the days before <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/social-media-blackout-enthralled-instagram-did-it-do-anything-n1230181\">black squares on Instagram</a>, back when uttering that Black lives matter could get you fired from your job rather than a promotion in the C-suite. In a country awakening to racial consciousness from a deep slumber, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/arts/music/beyonce-formation-super-bowl-video.html\">the video’s messaging seemed clear</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Public life means mistakes are inevitable. Definitive statements can be a poison pill.</p></blockquote></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, just as Beyoncé was hitting audiences with a stark message, she was also saying a lot less than it might have seemed. On <em>Lemonade</em> and the albums following, Beyoncé largely gestured toward the work of <a href=\"https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/womanist\">womanists</a> (a term for Black feminists coined by Alice Walker) who came before her, never outright saying what she believed. This strategy gives listeners just enough to project their desires (and frustrations) onto her, but rarely confirms or denies if that thinking is correct.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of Beyoncé and Kamala Harris’s other similarities is a little more obvious: They’re both Black women. And much to the frustration of those who don’t engage with race as a social construct and those who do, it’s an identity that comes with a lot to navigate. A common phrase a Black child will hear over and over as they make their way into adulthood is “you have to be twice as good to get half as far.” There is no room for error.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Public life means mistakes are inevitable. Definitive statements can be a poison pill; when they know exactly what you believe, people respond, for better and for worse. By keeping quiet, Beyoncé has been able to (mostly) avoid the accusations that come with being a Black woman with a platform and something to say: too angry, too loud, too much. When you are taught you have to be twice as good to get half as far, you learn that quietness and the respectability people assign to it can push you the other 50 percent across the finish line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That makes silence a shrewd choice for a pop star in an era of oversharing and social media apologies; an old Hollywood move that still lands in a time when talking keeps you in the zeitgeist and controversy is capital. It’s more complicated for a potential president.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why this strategy just isn’t acceptable in politics — no matter what Trump does</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris, by the nature of her job, can’t avoid the media completely — but, of late, it’s not for lack of trying. The occasional and quick post-event gaggle aside, she has as of yet to hold a press conference or sit down with a journalist for an interview since she’s become the presumptive nominee. It is very obvious that Harris would rather talk to voters directly than go through the press.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a key difference: While the public might beg for it, a critically acclaimed entertainer in no way owes us her stance on hot-button issues. A politician, especially one asking to be installed in the most powerful office in the nation, should explain to the public why she wants that power and what she intends to do with it. And the public is better off (or, at least, better informed) when that&nbsp;candidate has to defend the vision in the face of media scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under normal circumstances, this kind of pointed non-specificity would only work for an entertainer. Past Democratic primaries have forced candidates to get specific about their policy plans, as they try to convince voters that they’re the best choice to carry the party’s banner. And in a crowded field, candidates willingly subject themselves to media interviews in the hopes of grabbing voters’ attention.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>A politician should explain to the public why she wants that power and what she intends to do with it</p></blockquote></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That proved problematic for Harris during her first presidential campaign. We saw her attempt to toe this line in 2019 during her ill-fated presidential campaign. Time and again, she was asked her stance on policing, and each time she appeared surprisingly discombobulated, a funhouse mirror version of the woman we saw go viral for her tough questions in senate hearings. She told us her views had evolved since she was the top cop in California, but couldn’t tell us how or why or even when.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this is no normal election: Harris got to skip the primary entirely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With the traditional primary campaign made moot and enthusiasm at an incredible high,&nbsp;it could be appealing for Harris to, like the “Freedom” singer, run off vibes alone and let the stans handle things — they’re called the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/style/khive-kamala-harris-supporters.html\">KHive</a>, after all. Like Beyoncé, she’s aware that there are critics lying in wait. And yes, some of those pundits and X users don’t have a more nuanced point than “she’s a DEI candidate.” But as a politician with actual power over the laws that govern our lives, those proverbial haters are far from the only Americans she has to answer to. (It’s worth noting, Harris doesn’t point to race and identity as often as Beyoncé – or even as often as Barack Obama – it’s not 2008 after all; it’s unlikely we need <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2008/03/18/88478467/transcript-barack-obamas-speech-on-race\">A Race Speech</a>, despite Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american\">attempt</a> at bringing online diaspora wars to real life.) Harris has to be prepared to tell the people what she thinks, and hear what we have to say in return.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps it’s a standard that feels unfair when you look at who Harris is up against. It feels like there’s no meat on the bones of former President Donald Trump’s agenda. When pressed about Project 2025 — the Heritage Foundation-linked plan for a second Trump administration that was put together by people with close, close ties to the former president — Trump has been remarkably evasive: He says he supports some parts of the plan and opposes others, but won’t say which. Trump’s refusal to be forthright about his own policies, and his penchant for lying about his achievements when he does discuss his record,&nbsp;has made him so difficult to pin down that many have given up. They no longer want to expend the energy on what will likely become a mess of an interview and a waste of a news cycle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, being expected to be “twice as good” is generally unfair, and when taken to the extreme can lead to this kind of paralysis of speech. But Trump’s malfeasance is so extreme that asking Harris to do much better still isn’t asking for all that much. Of course people are holding Harris to a higher standard. If anyone should actually be twice as good, it should be the president of the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris’s fumbling isn’t because of a lack of ability. She’s a former prosecutor. She went to one of the top HBCUs in the country, a place that has gestated politicians and activists and tastemakers across the political spectrum since its inception (and where your author went). She is more than capable of making a case to the American people. The question now is: Will she?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Half of my hairs are white now. I can’t stay up past midnight. I hate loud restaurants and bars. I feel a deep urge to read long biographies of generals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But other signs of aging are subtler. For example: I am now worried about the US budget deficit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Coming of age as an economics reporter in the 2010s, there was no clearer generational divide than the one about government debt. Older reporters, who came of age during the exploding deficits of the 1980s and the balanced budget battles of the 1990s, tended to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/25/AR2009082501158.html\">view deficits as obviously bad</a>, and any cases for deficit spending — federal spending financed by borrowed money, rather than taxes — as the excuses of cowardly politicians.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Younger folks like me distinguished themselves by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/08/why-do-people-hate-deficits/\">embracing deficits</a>. The job market in the US after the 2008 financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/why-is-recovery-taking-so-long-and-who-is-to-blame/\">was a disaster</a>. Stimulus from Congress and the Fed was too small to fix it. It was madness to worry about cutting the deficit when more spending or tax cuts or both could achieve the much more important goal of helping people get back to work. And it was especially stupid when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/03/an-amazing-mea-culpa-from-the-imfs-chief-economist-on-austerity/\">interest rates on the debt were at record lows</a>, which meant that taking on debt was cheaper than ever. We thought it was obsession with the debt, not the debt itself, that was destroying the economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I still think we were right about the 2011 economy. But the 2024 economy is not the 2011 economy. Interest rates are much higher. Unemployment is at 4 percent, a number that in 2011 we didn’t dare dream of. Wages are rising, especially for the lowest-income workers. We had the first major inflation episode in 40 years, though it finally appears to be subsiding. And the national debt is climbing higher and higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most commonly cited metric has the debt load nearing <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYGFGDQ188S\">100 percent of US GDP</a>, or <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYGFDPUN\">$27.5 trillion</a>. That’s not the best way to measure the burden in my view, but no matter how you look at things, the problem is significant and getting worse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no magic number at which the debt load becomes a full-on crisis. But it steadily becomes a bigger and bigger problem, and the trajectory we’re on is worrisome. It’s especially worth taking debt more seriously when <em>other</em> problems that deficit spending can help solve, like mass unemployment, have been fixed. Moreover, without tackling the debt problem, tackling other problems, from child poverty to housing costs to climate change, will become harder as the government has less space to spend and invest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s how I learned to start worrying and fear the debt, and why you might want to as well.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The facts of debt</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US debt total is reported in many ways, but the most accurate, in my opinion, is a ratio: debt <em>held by private investors</em> as a share of gross domestic product, net of government assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Held by private investors” is an important caveat: A huge share of the US debt is held by the government itself, in vehicles like the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare. Still more was <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HBFRGDQ188S\">purchased by the Federal Reserve</a> as part of its “quantitative easing” programs to fight the Great Recession and the Covid downturn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, it’s money that the federal government owes to itself. That makes it fairly unimportant, economically; it doesn’t actually limit the resources available to the government. The debt that poses the biggest worry is debt owed to non-governmental investors, who can demand higher interest rates in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Share of gross domestic product” is also an important adjustment. Dividing by the size of the economy puts the debt burden in the context of the US’s resources. Just as a big mortgage can make sense if you have a high income to pay for it, a high debt load is more manageable if the US as a whole is earning enough money to finance it. It also points to an often-neglected way to reduce the budget deficit: <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-serious-case-for-dynamic-scoring\">passing economic growth-enhancing policies</a>, like expanded immigration by STEM workers and would-be entrepreneurs or expanding <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pmjH55yXIdOn4b-uugc826FJiTTbjS2V/view\">support for science</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Net of assets” means <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-deficits-debt-and-interest\">adjusting for the considerable resources the government owns</a>, like land and loans that it made to other people (like student loan recipients).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of this writing, debt held by private investors net of assets represents <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#3\">75.7 percent of GDP</a>; without subtracting assets, it’s 91.2 percent. That’s not full-on debt crisis levels, but it’s high. The figure before adjusting for assets (for which data is more readily available) is the highest it’s ever been since the Treasury started keeping track in 1970. It’s much higher than it was before Covid (66.4 percent) and much, much higher than before the global financial crisis (under 30 percent).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The cost this debt imposes can be measured most directly by the interest the US pays on its debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the amount the US will spend on debt interest will hit <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#3\">3.1 percent of GDP</a> this year. That’s a serious expense: It’s close to what we spend on defense every year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More worrisome, the <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#3\">CBO projects</a> that the debt and interest burdens are set to increase substantially. Debt held by private investors net of assets is set to rise from 75.7 percent this year to 93.7 percent in 10 years. The agency doesn’t project that figure out longer, but <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60127\">does provide projections</a> for debt held by the public, which includes Federal Reserve holdings and doesn’t subtract assets. That’s set to grow from 99 percent in 2024 to 166 percent by 2054.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s driving this trend? It’s not defense spending or “nondefense discretionary,” a category encompassing everything from the FBI to the National Institutes of Health. The CBO projects that discretionary spending, both defense and nondefense, will fall to historic lows as a share of the economy over the next 30 years (though this is a projection I’m pretty skeptical about, especially as the US <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-legislature-defense-budget-taiwan-us-9e751a41c9a1ffe8c0cf9775797750e3\">urge to counter China militarily grows</a>). It also sees tax revenues modestly increasing over the next 30 years, due in part to the expiration of many Trump tax cuts next year and because household incomes tend to grow faster than inflation, which means the income tax raises more money over time.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-at-11.29.18 AM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.486848666168,100,87.026302667664\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s growing is spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. As you can see in the above chart, the CBO sees spending on “major health care programs” (including Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare subsidies) growing from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2024 to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2054; Social Security is set to grow from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2024 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2054.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two major factors are, in turn, driving higher spending on these programs. One is that as baby boomers age the US population is getting older, meaning more people are benefiting from Social Security and Medicare and fewer are paying in. This adds 2.4 percent of GDP to federal spending by 2054, half from health care and half from Social Security. The second driver is that health care costs are projected to grow faster than the economy, independent of the aging population; this adds 2.6 percent of GDP to the federal budget by 2054.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Liberal and conservative budget experts love to argue about whether low taxes or high spending is driving the debt problem. <a href=\"https://budget.house.gov/press-release/its-not-a-revenue-problem-its-a-spending-problem\">Conservatives will point out</a> that tax revenues are set to <em>rise</em> as a share of GDP over the next thirty years, as spending on programs for the aged explodes, so how could taxes rather than spending be the problem? <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/tax-cuts-are-primarily-responsible-for-the-increasing-debt-ratio/\">Liberals will point out</a> that if the US had not adopted the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, and the Trump tax cuts of 2017, revenue would be higher now and set to rise even more, and we would not have a debt problem at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I find this debate somewhat exhausting. It is trivially true that you can fill the budget gap by slashing spending, and it is also trivially true that you can fill it by raising taxes. Which you prefer has less to do with the historic trends in either than it does with your political values.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What matters is that spending on older Americans is set to spike, and we need to figure out a way either to tame that spending, raise taxes to pay for it, or do a combination of the two.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Debt: chronic and acute</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill Gorton asks Mike Campbell in Hemingway&#8217;s <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. “Two ways,” Mike replies. “Gradually and then suddenly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This line is a bit of a cliché in discussions of government debt crises, for good reason. A heavy debt burden can impose at least two different kinds of costs. One, it can slowly erode economic growth. Two, it can in extreme cases lead to interest rates spiraling ever-upward because lenders no longer trust that they will be paid back, putting the borrowing nation in a crisis that can end in runaway inflation, default, recession, or all of the above. The risk of either is why considering deficit reduction now is probably a good idea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The chronic costs of debt are a bit easier to think about, and may be familiar from an intro macroeconomics class. Budget deficits increase demand for loans, because the government needs loans on top of all the loans that private individuals and businesses are demanding. A surge in demand for loans makes loans more expensive: The average interest charged goes up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the government, this is an additional expense it has to incur. But the higher interest rate applies to private companies and individuals too. And that means fewer families taking out mortgages and student loans, fewer businesses taking out loans to build new factories, and just generally slower economic growth from constrained credit. This is called “crowding out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How big of a problem is this? It’s hard to say, because it’s very difficult to study empirically. The relationship between debt and growth goes both ways: Debt can slow economic growth, but slow economic growth can also cause countries to take on more debt, as when recessions force countries to spend billions or trillions on stimulus packages. Some factors can influence both growth and debt simultaneously: aging countries often take on more debt as pension costs rise, but also grow more slowly because less of the population is working. Economists try to work around these issues but there’s only so much you can do with statistics to disentangle them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s what we do know: a <a href=\"https://medium.com/bonothesauro/deficits-are-raising-interest-rates-but-other-factors-are-lowering-them-6d1e68776b7a\">wide range of empirical evidence</a> shows that when the US does more deficit spending, this pushes up interest rates for US government debt, which in turn pushes up interest rates throughout the economy. In the long run, this discourages business investment and hurts economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that each dollar of the deficit <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45140\">means 33 cents less in private-sector investment</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, the economic damage depends on how that dollar of deficit is spent. And conversely, how effective deficit reduction is at promoting growth depends on the details of how it’s done. University of Pennsylvania economist Kent Smetters and the team at the Penn Wharton Budget Model recently <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/4/22/policy-options-for-reducing-the-federal-debt-spring-2024\">evaluated three massive deficit reduction packages</a>, using a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts. Sizable deficit reduction, they concluded, boosts GDP by as much as 9.8 percent by 2054, and raises wages by as much as 7.5 percent compared to the status quo where debt keeps rising. The exact numbers depend on what specific taxes you’re hiking and spending you’re cutting. These packages at best stabilize the debt; reducing it would do still more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Crowding out is the chronic cost of debt. The acute cost is what happens if debt accumulates to such a point that investors start demanding ever-higher interest rates to service it, forcing the US into a situation where it uses the Federal Reserve to inflate away the debt by buying up bonds directly, drastically raises taxes or cuts spending to service the debt, or defaults and states it will not pay all that it owes. It’s easy to come up with foreign examples of debt crises that got to this point: Mexico in 1982, Russia in 1998, Argentina in 2001, Greece in 2015. Near-misses that didn’t quite lead to default, like Spain and Italy in the 2010s or Indonesia, Thailand, and South Korea in 1997, are even more common. If crowding out is like heart disease, this is a sudden heart attack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US is, of course, much richer than all those countries, and its debt plays a much more pivotal role in the world financial system. The US controls the “<a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11707\">reserve currency</a>”: About three-fifths of all assets in central banks around the world are denominated in dollars, meaning the whole world relies on it to do business. The dollar is used for loans and transactions everywhere, even in transactions having nothing to do with the US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This means lots of people around the world want to buy US government debt, which has the effect of pushing interest rates down. It also means that we can always sell debt in our own currency, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin_(economics)\">ability many other countries don’t have</a>. In the 1960s, the French finance minister, later president, Valéry Giscard d&#8217;Estaing famously called this America’s “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Exorbitant_Privilege/FqTBbvyb9NwC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA4&amp;printsec=frontcover\">exorbitant privilege</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does this privilege mean the US is immune to the dynamics that have driven debt crises in other places? Perhaps. There’s nothing in the historical record to rule out “debt crises are impossible in the US” for the simple reason that we haven’t had one in modern memory. Then again, there is no law of the universe that the dollar has to be the world reserve currency forever, and while its replacement by the Euro or the Chinese renminbi or some other rival has been <a href=\"https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/chinn_frankel_euro_again\">erroneously predicted</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2011/06/27/dollar-seen-losing-global-reserve-status.html\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2020-06-14/dollar-crash-how-will-it-unfold?sref=fIqbqIlF\">times</a> in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72c27c26-f1d6-4a4b-be50-d6bf70c3546f\">the past</a>, that does not mean such predictions will <em>always</em> be wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If US debt reaches extremely high levels, such that bonds in a rival currency start to look like a safer choice, a shift could occur, which in turn would send US interest rates higher.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Smetters and his colleague Jagadeesh Gokhale have after extensive modeling concluded that if US debt held by the public exceeds 200 percent of GDP, we’ll be entering a phase where <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2023/10/6/when-does-federal-debt-reach-unsustainable-levels\">no amount of tax hikes or spending cuts will be sufficient to avoid default</a>. We’ll either have to explicitly say we will not pay back all our debt, or else inflate it away, both of which would have massive negative consequences for American workers and consumers. They estimate that the US will reach this point in about 20 years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You don’t have to believe that prediction is literally true to find it incredibly alarming. As Covid and the global financial crisis should have reminded us, low-probability/high-consequence shocks do happen. And continuing to add more debt indefinitely will certainly raise the probability of this kind of disaster.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The big factor: health</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, the debt is probably a problem worth worrying about. What, then, can we do about it?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recall that the two big drivers the CBO identified are population aging and health care costs. Aging is partially addressable with immigration. For instance, the US is currently in the midst of a surge in immigration, with <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60569#:~:text=Over%20the%202021%E2%80%932026%C2%A0period%2C%20the,of%20that%20population%20was%20200%2C000%C2%A0people.\">1.5 million more people</a> entering per year than government statistical agencies had anticipated. The CBO finds that this surge will, on net, reduce the deficit by nearly $900 billion over the next eleven years, or (per my calculations) about 0.2 percent of <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60039\">GDP</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s a real and positive shift. It’s also nowhere near enough, and the result of a fairly unprecedented surge in immigration that is vulnerable to political change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, we know that <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/padr.12431\">some kinds of government spending</a> can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/363543/pronatalism-vance-birth-rates-population-decline-fertility\">encourage people to have more kids</a>, but it seems unlikely that this spending is so effective as to pay for itself by creating future taxpayers. In any case, children have an annoying habit of needing to grow up before they can pay taxes, meaning this is not exactly a short- or medium-run solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Health care costs, by contrast, are something we can change with policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s an old saying in DC that the federal government is basically an <a href=\"https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/who-first-said-the-us-is-an-insurance-company-with-an-army.html\">insurance company with an army</a>. That’s not exactly true, but it’s close. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, plus defense spending, combined to make up about <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727\">66 percent</a> of non-interest federal spending in 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Within that mix, health care is becoming increasingly important. The <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59613#_idTextAnchor003\">Congressional Budget Office</a> estimates that health insurance subsidies, encompassing Medicare, Medicaid, the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Affordable Care Act subsidies, and subsidies for employer-based coverage — will rise from 7 percent of GDP in 2023 to 8.3 percent in 2033. The biggest increase they project, by far, is in Medicare, which is swelling as the US population ages and whose patients tend to need more expensive care as they near the end of their lives. By contrast, defense spending, already far below where it was in the Cold War, is projected to keep falling relative to GDP.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Embedded in the projections of the CBO, and of the Medicare program’s actuaries too, is a prediction that per-person health expenses are going to increase in coming years, and increase faster than inflation. Over the past half-century or so that’s been the norm. Legislators have been making these programs progressively more generous in terms of the services covered, like <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690175/\">extending prescription drug coverage in 2003</a>, and new treatments and <a href=\"https://manhattan.institute/article/keeping-medicare-affordable-the-cost-of-adding-services\">services keep getting developed that push costs higher</a>. Add to that the fact that <a href=\"https://healthcostinstitute.org/images/pdfs/international_health_cost_comparison_report_2022.pdf\">prices for most health services are higher in the US</a> than in other rich countries and you have a recipe for spiraling expenses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Except, since about 2011 or so, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/05/upshot/medicare-budget-threat-receded.html\">we haven’t seen that</a>. In an almost miraculous development from a budgetary perspective, per-capita spending in Medicare has remained essentially constant for over a decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s considerable disagreement about why exactly this slowdown is happening. Some researchers <a href=\"https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37376239/RWP23_001_Newhouse.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">emphasize technological change</a>, arguing, in the words of Sheila Smith, Joseph Newhouse, and Gigi Cuckler, that “cost-reducing … innovation may have become more prominent relative to highly beneficial but expensive treatments&#8221; in recent years. That is, the ways we’ve improved health technology have cut, rather than raised, costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Melinda Buntin, a health economist who studied the slowdown first at the CBO and now as a professor at Johns Hopkins, told me in an interview she chalks up the slowdown to a fundamental mindset change in American health care. Partly as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s emphasis on “value-based” care, but partly also just due to an increased emphasis on paying for results on the part of doctors and hospital administrators, we’re seeing less wasteful use of new, expensive technologies than we used to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever the cause, the slowdown in medical costs is a hugely hopeful sign for the budget picture. Recall that the CBO projects that greater medical costs will add 2.6 percent of GDP to the federal budget by 2054. By comparison, it projects that the primary deficit (revenue minus spending, but excluding interest payments on past deficits) will be <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60127#_idTextAnchor007\">2.2 percent of GDP</a>. That suggests that the US could be in primary budget balance, a key sign of fiscal health, just by keeping health costs under control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, it is by no means guaranteed that the recent slowdown will continue. Medical innovation continues apace, and new expensive drugs and treatments will continue to come on the market. For at least some of them, we will want the government to pay up, because they do so much to improve the lives of patients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there is a policy path that can keep the slowdown going, it is likely to be a combination of small steps rather than one big change. The <a href=\"https://onepercentsteps.com/\">1% Steps project</a> provides a great model for what this could look like: a crew of leading health economists have proposed measures ranging from <a href=\"https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/addressing-hospital-concentration-and-rising-consolidation-in-the-united-states/\">fighting hospital mergers</a> to <a href=\"https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/real-time-adjudication-for-health-insurance-claims/\">changing how health claims are adjudicated</a> to <a href=\"https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/removing-all-financial-disincentives-to-living-kidney-donation/\">encouraging kidney donation</a> that each save only a small amount of health spending, but together could do a lot.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Five steps to avoid the worst</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dealing with the federal debt problem isn’t exactly sexy. It will force policymakers to become less ambitious in some ways, and sacrifice for the sake of new programs or tax cuts they want. But the next few years give policymakers some real opportunities to address the deficit problem. As they do, there are a few principles they should keep in mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First: use tax hikes or spending cuts to offset any new spending or tax cuts. This has <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/trump-and-biden-national-debt\">hardly been the norm in Congress lately</a>, with bipartisan spending laws under both Trump and Biden costing hundreds of billions if not trillions without being remotely paid for. Those will need to be combined with tax hikes or offsetting spending cuts going forward. This also means giving up on some wilder spending visions that would require offsetting tax hikes no one is prepared to pass. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, wants to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/opinion/us-military-war.html\">raise spending on defense from 2.9 percent to 5 percent of GDP</a> by the end of this decade, as part of an <a href=\"https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2024/5/senator-wicker-unveils-major-defense-investment-plan\">ambitious plan to counter China and Russia</a>. If not paid for, this would <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-senate-republican-defense-proposal-would-balloon-military-funding-by-roughly-6-trillion/\">absolutely explode budget deficits</a>. If Wicker wants to pass the tax hikes necessary to cover the expense, god bless — but I have my doubts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Second, take growth seriously. The point of deficit reduction is to reduce a long-term drag on economic growth, and so the best way to reduce the deficit is through actions that simultaneously enhance growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is much easier said than done, of course, but <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/1/18/budgetary-effects-of-stem-green-cards\">expanded green cards for immigrants with science and engineering degrees</a> seems like a no-brainer, cutting the deficit substantially over time while boosting growth. A growing literature also finds that <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pmjH55yXIdOn4b-uugc826FJiTTbjS2V/view\">funding</a> for <a href=\"https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f196851.pdf\">scientific research</a> boosts <a href=\"https://www.arnauddyevre.com/files/arnaud_dyevre_jmp.pdf\">productivity</a> and economic growth. That funding doesn’t pay for itself, necessarily, but raising taxes or cutting less useful spending to boost scientific grants seems like a strong strategy. More generally, Congress should be searching for more policies in this category, ones that can boost growth however modestly at little or no budgetary cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Third: the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/tax-code-congress.html\">coming tax fight in 2025</a> should be used to raise revenue, not just avoid losing it. Most of the individual tax cuts signed into law by Donald Trump in 2017 are due to expire at the end of next year. Some of these cuts, like slashing the top income tax rate from 39.6 to 37 percent, are things Democrats will absolutely want to expire. But most of them have bipartisan appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kamala Harris has pledged not to raise taxes on people making under $400,000 a year, which means keeping the expanded standard deduction and child tax credit that Trump enacted. It also means keeping his lower 12, 22, 24, and 32 percent brackets from the bill. All this and bringing back the child tax credit that Biden and Harris passed in 2021 costs about 1 percent of GDP in tax revenue by my estimations <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/build-your-own-tax-extensions\">using the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s tool</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taking the debt at all seriously means that whoever’s in office next year needs to pay for whatever part of the Trump cuts they want to keep. <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/5/22/president-bidens-fy2025-budget-proposal\">Biden’s most recent budget</a> contains a number of tax hikes on top earners, but notably <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/biden-budget-2025-tax-proposals/\">doesn’t explicitly pay for</a> extending the Trump cuts. Ideally, policymakers would not just pay for the extensions they want but come up with a revenue-positive package: one that doesn’t merely pay for the Trump cuts but goes further and reduces the deficit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This won’t be easy but it’s certainly possible. Playing around with the <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/tcja-extension-simulator\">Yale Budget Lab’s handy make-your-own-2025-tax-plan</a> tool — which my sports-knowing editor tells me is like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine\">ESPN’s Trade Machine</a> but for budget nerds — you can pay for the bigger standard deduction and Democrats’ desired child credit by letting all the Trump income tax rate cuts expire, letting the cuts to the estate tax expire too, raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, adding a new 45 percent tax bracket on the rich, and eliminating the tax break for pass-through corporations. That raises about 0.4 percent of GDP over a decade, a real bite of the long-run deficit. This does mean tax hikes on a small share of people making under $400,000 —&nbsp;but under the circumstances, I think that’s called for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fourth: Social Security should be addressed, not punted. Barring any Congressional action, the program is due for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/21/23663654/social-security-retirement-age-1983-greenspan-ball\">across-the-board cuts to benefits of over 20 percent starting in 2033</a>, because payroll taxes and the trust fund will no longer be enough to pay promised benefits. This would unleash a political backlash on the part of affected seniors like nothing DC has ever seen, and Congress is almost guaranteed to do <em>something</em> to avoid that outcome.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The easiest way for Congress to deal with this doomsday deadline is to simply tap general tax revenues to avoid the cuts, thereby breaking the linkage between payroll taxes and Social Security benefits. They should not do this. The 2033 deadline provides one of the few forcing mechanisms that can push Congress to address the long-run imbalance between revenues and spending, and if they punt they might never get another opportunity. Democrats will push to pay for the program by raising taxes on high earners; Republicans will push for benefit cuts. Either way, the gap needs to be filled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Congress will also get an opportunity to reform either <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/first-things-first-how-social-security-reform-can-eliminate-elderly-poverty\">Social Security</a> or its sister program <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/increasing-ssi-benefits-is-a-more-effective-approach-to-reducing-poverty-than-an-enhanced-social-security-minimum-benefit/\">Supplemental Security Income</a> to eliminate senior poverty — <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2023/demo/p60-280.pdf#page=17\">14.1 percent of seniors</a> are in poverty, a higher share than either children or working-age adults, despite the hundreds of billions the government spends on old-age pensions. That’s a travesty, and even Democratic plans to expand the program <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103768/first-things-first-how-social-security-reform-can-eliminate-old-age-poverty_1.pdf#page=15\">don’t address it sufficiently</a>. It’s likely that even a relatively conservative plan could make real progress here. See, for instance, conservative Social Security expert Andrew Biggs’ plan to convert the old-age insurance program to a<a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2021/1/26/budget-contest-flat-benefit-for-social-security\"> flat basic income for all seniors aged 62 and over</a>, set at or above the poverty line.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fifth and finally, Congress needs to work to ensure that per-person health spending stays roughly constant. This will likely take the form of several small reforms, along the <a href=\"https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/\">1% Steps</a> suggestions, instead of another big effort like the Affordable Care Act. But precisely because the steps necessarily are more modest, the opportunities for bipartisan collaboration here are immense. See, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-braun-hassan-kennedy-lead-bipartisan-bill-to-fix-part-of-medicare-billing-structure-saving-billions\">this bill</a> from Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mike Braun (R-IN), and John Kennedy (R-LA) to reform Medicare billing, with support from the liberal Families USA to the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. Keeping health costs low might be the least unpopular way to deal with the budget imbalance, and that will hopefully spur politicians into more collaborations like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Congress does all this — pays for future spending, prioritizes economic growth, raises revenue in the 2025 tax fight, fixes Social Security, and keeps per-capita health spending constant —&nbsp;it’ll be on track to stabilize the debt. It’s not easy. But it’s not impossible either. Bill Clinton and Congress were able to accomplish something similar in the 1990s, and now the time is ripe to try again.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Both those who supported the spring protests and those who opposed them have criticized how Shafik handled the demonstrations, as did a number of right-wing politicians, who claimed the president failed to do enough to protect Jewish students. House Speaker Mike Johnson called her resignation “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/08/15/us-news/columbia-president-minouche-shafiks-resignation-reacted-by-mike-johnson-other-pols/\">long overdue</a>” on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not all of the spring protests — which largely involved students demanding that their schools <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/5/7/24150638/divest-israel-protesters-bds-columbia-meaning-fossil-fuel\">divest</a> from companies linked to Israel amid its ongoing war in Gaza — reached the intensity of those at Columbia. Some schools <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-14/uc-berkeley-protestors-dismantle-pro-palestinian-encampment\">managed to negotiate with protesters</a> to voluntarily dismantle their pro-Palestinian encampments without any police intervention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At Columbia, however, Shafik swiftly <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottwhite/2024/05/16/columbia-president-goaded-into-calling-in-policegets-no-confidence-vote/\">called the police</a> on protesters who had erected an encampment on the university’s main lawn in a display of force that sparked widespread outrage. That decision fueled protests with more escalatory tactics thereafter, and also resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti/index.html\">faculty vote of no confidence</a> in her leadership. Things progressed to the point where some protesters eventually <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/columbias-hamilton-hall-takeover-photos-from-inside.html\">took over a campus building</a> before they were forcibly removed by police and arrested. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Shafik has become one of several Ivy League presidents who <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/17/claudine-gay-harvard-presidency-feature/\">departed</a> their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/10/business/liz-magill-upenn-resignation-timeline/index.html\">roles</a> amid the campus furor. The question is not just where that leaves Columbia — now headed by interim president Katrina Armstrong, the CEO of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center — but all universities as students return to campus this fall. Demonstrations are expected to resume as the war in Gaza, in which <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-war-hamas-dead-graves-40000-988d16b648e06e222f04964dc9440da0\">more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed</a>, continues and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/15/new-round-of-gaza-ceasefire-talks-in-doha-where-do-hamas-israel-stand\">yet another round of ceasefire talks has begun</a>. And it will be incumbent on administrators to find a way to avoid a repeat of the spring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think tensions are going to be high, higher than I think they already were,” said <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/about-us/our-team/nico-perrino\">Nico Perrino</a>, executive vice president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a nonpartisan group that advocates for free speech. “Hopefully policies are in place and discussions are happening with students and faculty surrounding how to respond in case encampments go up or students are being threatened or denied access to different portions of campus.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Gaza protests could return in the fall. Universities should start preparing now.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two key lessons other university administrators might take away from Shafik’s missteps ahead of what is expected to be a contentious semester:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Universities should communicate openly and clearly with protesters</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the spring, protests escalated to the point that normal university operations couldn’t continue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Columbia held <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/22/business/columbia-tensions-passover-virtual-classes/index.html\">virtual classes</a> in the final weeks of the spring semester. UCLA also <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/ucla-cancels-classes-after-dueling-protesters-clash-on-campus-over-the-war-in-gaza\">canceled classes</a> after pro-Palestinian protesters came under attack by masked agitators and campus police failed to intervene for three hours. USC <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestine-war-campus-protests-fbd7dd06431f32d24d0f8abcc8a56b8b\">scrapped a commencement speech </a>by its pro-Palestinian valedictorian over safety concerns. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Universities should be planning now for how they can prevent that from happening again. If protests escalate this fall to the level of requiring the invention of campus public safety or police, then “something’s already gone terribly wrong,” said <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/frederick-m-lawrence/\">Frederick Lawrence</a>, the former president of Brandeis University and a lecturer at Georgetown Law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most important step schools can take now is to set clear ground rules for protests that will be applied neutrally — no matter who’s involved or what their cause — such as prohibiting occupying buildings or blocking students from getting to class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ahead of the fall semester, Lawrence said, university administrators and protesters should plan for a reset that begins with communication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is a good time to be reaching out to student leaders on all sides of this and other related issues, and listening to them, but also trying to bring them on board, to try to find constructive ways of having demonstrations, having expressions of views, but doing it in a way that’s constructive for them and constructive for the university,” Lawrence said. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Universities have to carefully consider when to weigh in&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">University administrators have dual responsibilities to uphold free speech and keep their community safe. Their ability to carry out those responsibilities is compromised when they aren’t seen as neutral mediators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some university administrators learned this the hard way earlier this year when their statements about the Gaza war were copiously picked apart in the media and in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/12/15/24001823/antisemitism-college-harvard-penn-mit-free-speech\">widely publicized congressional hearings</a> — as well as on their own campuses, as some student protesters at Stanford <a href=\"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2024/06/05/pro-palestine-protesters-occupy-stanford-presidents-office/\">occupied the offices of their college president</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the spring, some universities did decide that it is not the role of a university to take stances on issues at an institutional level. Harvard, for instance, announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/5/28/harvard-institutional-neutrality-report/\">no longer comment</a> on contentious issues that do not directly relate to the university. That change in policy came after former Harvard president Claudine Gay was <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/10/harvard-statement-criticized/\">heavily criticized </a>for her initial statement on the war. The beleaguered Gay <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/17/claudine-gay-harvard-presidency-feature/\">resigned</a> after facing a later plagiarism scandal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perrino framed Harvard’s approach as a positive development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That should hopefully alleviate some of the messaging concerns around these colleges,” he said. “Universities are the hosts and sponsors of critics. They are not themselves the critics, and by becoming the critics, they put their thumb on the scale of the campus debate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rather than issuing blanket statements, there may be a more nuanced role for educators to play, by discouraging certain kinds of speech, even if it is permitted under university rules. For example, Yale president Peter Salovey <a href=\"https://president.yale.edu/president/statements/against-hatred\">stated</a> in the spring that “Chants or messages that express hatred, celebrate the killing of civilians, or contain calls for genocide of any group are utterly against our ideals and certainly are not characteristic of our broader community.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those kinds of warnings can have the effect of lowering the temperature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A lot of things get said in the heat of the moment that are not helpful, and it is useful for the administration to deescalate and to say, ‘You can communicate that in a way that’s not deeply offensive to your classmates,’” Lawrence said. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Baldoni and Lively <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/justin-baldoni-hires-pr-crisis-manager-melissa-nathan-it-ends-with-us-1235973715/\">reportedly</a> didn’t get along, and he allegedly “<a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a61877865/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-fat-shaming-lingering-kiss/\">fat-shamed</a>” her by asking someone how much Lively weighed — a scene involving the two requires he pick her up and he was afraid of hurting his back. And according to whispers, he didn’t very much enjoy Lively inviting her husband Ryan Reynolds on set to direct some scenes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while Baldoni is getting plenty of static here (he’s gone so far as to hire a <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/news/1406111/it-ends-with-us-justin-baldoni-hires-crisis-pr-manager-amid-feud-rumors\">veteran crisis PR manager</a> who counts Johnny Depp among her clients), the hullabaloo has many online looking a little more closely at Lively, who is showing her face on the big screen for the first time in four years. Many have noted that Lively has taken a peculiar approach in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/it-ends-with-us-blake-lively-justin-baldoni\">promoting</a> this film. In an attempt to sell this movie, Lively has promised viewers the giggliest, girliest of times. At the same time, the actor, known for her beautiful hair, launched a haircare line. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itendswithusmovie/video/7400133808219032878\" data-video-id=\"7400133808219032878\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@itendswithusmovie\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itendswithusmovie?refer=embed\">@itendswithusmovie</a> <p>𝚐𝚛𝚊𝚋 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚏𝚛𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚍𝚜. 𝚠𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚏𝚕𝚘𝚛𝚊𝚕𝚜.   <a title=\"itendswithusmovie\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/itendswithusmovie?refer=embed\">#ItEndsWithUsMovie</a> is now playing exclusively in theaters.

Lively’s seeming lack of concern or emotional intelligence about this sensitive topic has raised questions and backlash about whether she knows what kind of movie she’s made, and it’s making some question what we thought we knew about Lively herself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blake Lively’s<em> It Ends With Us </em>press tour has been about selling Blake Lively’s stuff&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Movie press tours are not a thrilling business. They mostly consist of actors fielding the same questions over and over from a variety of media outlets, all in the hopes that they say something that spurs you to see the film they’re promoting. The monotonous repetition of the cinematic publicity cycle is exactly why Lively and<em> It Ends With Us</em>’s unusual tour has been so attention-grabbing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For starters, Lively and director and co-star Baldoni have been promoting the film separately — an extremely strange thing for leads to do. They’re also doing these interviews, as my colleague <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud\">Kyndall Cunningham detailed</a>, amid a rash of back-and-forth gossip alleging the two fell out on set. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what Lively has been saying in the promotion of the film is also drawing attention. In a video clip promoting the movie on TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itendswithusmovie/video/7400133808219032878?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7402348493942408735\">Lively says to</a> “grab your friends, wear your florals, and head out to see it!” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to Lively’s quip about girls’ night out to watch intimate partner abuse, she has been promoting both her new haircare line <a href=\"https://www.target.com/b/blake-brown/-/N-q643leebz0w\">Blake Brown</a> and her beverage company Betty Buzz. She’s used the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/gallery/it-ends-with-us-premiere-red-carpet-photos/\">red carpet</a> to keep the public thinking about her husband’s new film, the hyper-violent and profane Marvel blockbuster <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, while giving Reynolds — not screenwriter Christy Hall or author Colleen Hoover — <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/it-ends-with-us-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively\">credit</a> for writing the movie’s “iconic” rooftop scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One promotional clip has her giggling with her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Z2rXzx7KT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=9f3edee9-9480-4e00-a68d-b117dd3b53d0\">co-stars about their zodiac signs</a>, while another has <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@people/video/7402692327157828907?lang=en\">Lively talking about wearing her own clothes</a> in the movie — a move that seems to be connected to Lively styling one of her costars on one of the movie’s red carpets. And in one of her interviews, she’s asked by a journalist who’s clearly familiar with the movie’s sensitive themes about how the movie may inspire people to reach out to her and talk about abuse. <a href=\"https://x.com/SophRossss/status/1823931352175071394\">Lively flippantly dismisses</a> the question as a joke about hypothetically not sharing her location or phone number with those fans instead of, as many would have preferred, promoting <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leylamohammed/blake-lively-backlash-dismissive-response-it-ends-with-us\">domestic violence services</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lively’s critics pointed out the disconnect between Lively framing her movie like a celebratory girls’ night and the actual content, in which a woman experiences violence from her romantic partner. Wearing florals and rounding up the girlies to watch a woman get physically abused by her partner seems, at best, a strange missing of the point and at worst, extremely insensitive or out of touch with the subject of her movie. Either Lively doesn’t fully comprehend the subject of the movie she made or she does and is capitalizing on it to sell her wares anyway. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While tabloids like <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/14/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-fat-shamed-it-ends-with-us/\">TMZ are reporting</a> on a behind-the-scenes PR war between Lively and Baldoni, this part of the backlash comes from Lively, all on her own, answering these questions the way she’s chosen to.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blake Lively’s <em>It Ends With Us</em> press tour fits a pattern of bad interviews she’s had&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When actors have these moments where they seemingly stop acting like fun, good people, it often causes civilians to question whether said celebrity has always been like this or if they’re exhibiting some uncharacteristic behavior. Lively rose to fame playing the rich, carefree Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, and in many ways that character’s glamorous but selfish image has combined with her own. In her film hiatus, she’s been known more for her relationships than anything else — with Reynolds but perhaps more notably with <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2024/08/14/entertainment/blake-lively-gushes-over-best-friend-taylor-swift-amid-it-ends-with-us-drama/\">Taylor Swift</a>. This popularity perhaps contributes to, as one commenter put it, a “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/entertainment/reporter-calls-out-blake-lively-for-uncomfortable-interview/\">mean girl</a>” vibe. Unfortunately for Lively and her image, she’s done some rather off-putting interviews that have been easy to find. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of those interactions is a <em>Café Society </em>press junket on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2-2RBi1qzY\">YouTube with the title</a> “The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.” Journalist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Flaawsometalk\">Kjersti Flaa</a> uploaded her 2016 clip with Lively on August 10, right in the middle of this kerfuffle. In it, Flaa congratulates Lively on her pregnancy which Lively takes passive-aggressive offense to and responds by “congratulating” the not-pregnant Flaa on her own “bump.” (Prior to her interaction with Flaa, Lively had confirmed her pregnancy to the press.) After Lively’s quip, she and co-star Parker Posey barely make eye contact with Flaa, and Lively continues to dismiss or react aggressively to Flaa’s questions about the movie, almost pretending as if Flaa weren’t in the room. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2165608556.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Blake Lively with Ryan Reynolds and Reynolds’s&lt;em&gt; Deadpool &amp; Wolverine &lt;/em&gt;co-star Hugh Jackman at a&lt;em&gt; It Ends With Us&lt;/em&gt; screening. Lively has conducted her press tour from the movie separately from co-star Justin Baldoni. | Cindy Ord/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Cindy Ord/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During that same press tour, Lively also said that <em>Café Society</em> director Woody Allen was good, actually. At the time, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572/\">Ronan Farrow</a> had recently written a column in the Hollywood Reporter criticizing the movie industry’s response to his sister Dylan Farrow’s sex abuse allegations against their father. Lively, when asked about Allen, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/blake-lively-says-woody-allen-is-empowering-to-women-in-new-interview-290662/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20could%20%5Bonly%5D%20know,is%20he's%20empowering%20to%20women.%E2%80%9D\">said</a>: “I could [only] know my experience. And my experience with Woody is [that] he’s empowering to women.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Going back further, critics found Lively’s first foray and faux pas into lifestyle branding. Back in 2014, Lively created a digital lifestyle and e-commerce site called Preserve. One of the first spreads was titled “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6969341/blake-lively-preserve-slavery-antebellum\">The Allure of the Antebellum</a>,” putting the site’s name in, let’s say, a certain light. The shoot was a romanticized version of the pre-Civil War South, and failed to address the reality that these cute outfits were anchored in a time of slavery. It’s also worth noting that Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds got married on a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-apologize-plantation-themed-wedding-n1235770\">South Carolina plantation in 2012</a> (and later apologized), which may contextualize Lively’s fascination with antebellum aesthetics — though the actor was born and grew up in Los Angeles. (Reynolds, for his part, is famously from Canada.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lively’s Preserve <a href=\"https://www.gawkerarchives.com/blake-lively-finally-deletes-her-antebellum-obsessed-li-1733782406\">lasted about one year</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not difficult to connect the dots between Lively praising Woody Allen being good to women, Lively being palpably mean to a journalist, and Lively glossing over the egregious trauma and pain of slavery with the blithe way she’s behaving on the <em>It Ends With US </em>promotional circuit. While being famous and having every word you say recorded, especially ones that you regret, is not an easy job, this behavior fits a pattern that Lively has shown before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A more telling frame for this messy kerfuffle might be recognizing that Lively and her husband have become more and more interested in the business side of their acting careers, perhaps even more than the acting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to Lively’s hair care line, soda line, and seemingly imminent fashion foray, Reynolds has invested in — and made himself the face of — more than a few companies. He has an ownership stake in telecom company <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rRpYZrNxQc\">Mint Mobile</a>, the Welsh soccer club <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/ryan-reynolds-complicated-relationship-father-29738505\">Wrexham</a>, and had, until recently, a similar stake in <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ryan-reynolds-made-over-450-222854697.html\">Aviation Gin</a>. He’s even the CEO of a marketing company, aptly called <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2022/03/15/ryan-reynolds-on-how-mntn-and-maximum-effort-are-changing-the-advertising-world-as-we-know-it/\">Maximum Effort</a>. Lively and Reynolds are arguably more talented at selling their lifestyle and their names than they are at acting. To many people, drinking the same booze as Ryan Reynolds or having the same hair as Blake Lively is more desirable than watching a Ryan Reynolds or Blake Lively movie. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When movies are so clearly secondary to their personal brand, as we’ve seen with Lively and <em>It Ends With Us</em>, their films become commercials, avenues to further promote their brands and themselves.

Not once. Not twice. Many times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are lots of reasons for that. For one thing, traveling is stressful. I feel time pressure to make it to my gate quickly and social pressure not to hold up long lines. (This alone makes it feel like I’m not truly consenting to the face scans so much as being coerced into them.) Plus, I’m always getting “randomly selected” for additional screenings, maybe because of my Middle Eastern background. So I get nervous about doing anything that might lead to extra delays or interrogations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the main reason I haven’t declined airport face scans is actually very simple: I had no idea I could opt out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It turns out that saying no is not only doable, but <a href=\"https://keepbeyond.com/optout/\">surprisingly easy</a> —&nbsp;at least in theory. Everyone, regardless of citizenship, can opt out when it comes to domestic flights in the US. (For international flights, US citizens can opt out but foreign nationals have to participate in face scanning, <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/about/congressional-resources/testimony/statement-record-assessing-cbps-use-facial-recognition-technology\">with some exceptions</a>.) Simply stand away from the camera or keep your face covered with a mask, present your ID, and say, “I opt out of biometrics. I want the standard verification process.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In theory, an officer is then supposed to manually look over your ID and compare it to your face, as they used to do before facial recognition. But in practice, there have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/11/tsa-airport-security-facial-recognition/\">reports of passengers —&nbsp;even a senator — facing resistance or intimidation</a> when they try to go this route.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are also supposed to have clear signs informing passengers of the right to opt out. But at many airports, you have to look really, really hard to spot that message. Be prepared to crane your neck at an unnatural angle or squint at a very small font!</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is why the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit that sheds light on AI harms, launched a campaign this month called <a href=\"https://www.ajl.org/campaigns/fly\">“Freedom Flyers”</a> to raise awareness of your right to opt out. The timing is perfect: The TSA <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/4738416-transportation-security-administration-record-air-travel-day/\">recorded</a> an all-time record day for air travel on June 23, with nearly 3 million people screened at the country’s airports as summer vacation season picked up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now is the ideal time to make sure you know your rights when you pass through airport security —&nbsp;and understand exactly what’s at stake. The implications go way beyond air travel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How facial recognition works at the airport</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the US, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/facial-recognition-tsa-airport-security-privacy-7b97462591c49184d1cb19cda9c95211\">over 80 airports</a> are currently piloting facial recognition technology. The TSA’s goal is to roll out the tech in all of the more than 430 airports that it covers, <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf\">arguing</a> that this kind of automation would reduce “friction” at airports —&nbsp;meaning, presumably, how long it takes passengers to move through security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That should raise some eyebrows, because there are known risks with this AI technology, from the possibility that your face data will be <a href=\"https://www.oversight.gov/report/dhs/review-cbps-major-cybersecurity-incident-during-2019-biometric-pilot\">stolen due to breaches</a> to the chance that you’ll be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html\">misidentified as a criminal suspect — and jailed</a>. Neither of these are hypothetical scenarios; the former has happened due to CBP system vulnerabilities and the latter has happened at the hands of police. And then, of course, there’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence\">AI bias</a>; facial recognition tech is known to disproportionately <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender\">misidentify people of color</a>. (A CBP spokesperson insisted that the agency’s facial comparison algorithm “shows virtually no measurable differential performance in results based on demographic factors.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as dangerous as face recognition can be if it goes wrong, a greater concern could be what happens if it’s seen to work as intended. When I asked <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23365558/future-perfect-50-ai-joy-buolamwini-founder-algorithmic-justice-league\">Joy Buolamwini</a>, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, what worries her about the use of this tech in airports, she said, “The big one for me is normalizing surveillance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Buolamwini argued that airport face recognition is a way of acclimating the public to having more and more sensitive information taken. “I see this on a longer trajectory,” she said. “And they’ve shown you the trajectory.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She was referring to <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf\">a roadmap released in 2018 by the TSA</a>. It distinguishes between two types of facial recognition: There’s one-to-one matching, where the TSA compares the photo in your passport with the photo they take of you at the airport, to make sure that the photos match. (If you ever use your face to unlock your iPhone, this is the kind of facial recognition you’re using.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s one-to-many matching, where your image is compared with images of others. One-to-many matching is already in use by CBP and airline partners in that they compare a passenger’s photo to a database of government documents (like US passports) for verification, TSA press secretary Carter Langston told me by email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A particularly worrisome form of one-to-many matching is live biometrics. “Live biometrics is the <em>Minority Report</em> kind of thing —&nbsp;where you’re just walking around and they can identify you,” Buolamwini said. And if everyone’s face becomes fair game for live biometrics, your likeness could one day be checked against a criminal database any time you walk through a drug store or show up at a protest, which may <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance\">create a dangerous chilling effect</a> across society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TSA’s own 2018 roadmap says they aim to use “live biometrics” in the future. However, Langston disputed Buolamwini’s interpretation of that term. “That interpretation of TSA’s use case is nothing that I have heard anyone involved in the program indicate. TSA’s use case is and continues to be about identity verification,” he told me.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, Buolamwini said, “You might hear people say ‘Oh, we’re only doing one-to-one matching. You show us your ID, you show us your face, and we delete the data.’” But, she stressed, the full story is more complicated.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do airports really delete your photo after taking it?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first thing to know is that if you’re not a US citizen, you have no guarantee that your photo will be deleted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In fact, <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Sep/CPE%20Final%20Report%20Traveler%20Verification%20Service%2020220815%20Final_%20Redacted_0.pdf\">according to CBP documents</a>, “Facial images for in-scope [noncitizen] travelers are also transmitted to the Department’s Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART). All biometrics of in-scope travelers are transmitted to IDENT/HART as encounters and are retained for 75 years in support of immigration, border management, and law enforcement activities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That means your photo could end up in the database for the rest of your life. What’s more, CBP <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp056-tvs-february2021.pdf\">notes</a> that “CBP may share information with federal, state, and local authorities, which may be authorized to use the information for purposes beyond the scope of CBP’s mission.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re a US citizen, you might breathe a bit easier upon reading on the CBP <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics/biometric-privacy-policy\">website</a>, “CBP retains U.S. citizen photos for no more than 12 hours after identity verification, and only for continuity of operations purposes.” But even so, Buolamwini says, there’s reason to wonder whether all your data is really deleted after those 12 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you submit to facial recognition, the tech analyzes a photo of your face and creates what’s called a “face print” or “face template.” This is not an image —&nbsp;it comes in the form of a series of numbers. You can think of it as your face’s metadata.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem is, even if airports do delete your photo, that does not necessarily mean they’re deleting your face print. And that face print is the real informational gold. Researchers have shown that <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338413\">they can reconstruct an image of your actual face</a> as long as they’ve got the face print.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I asked CBP what happens to that precious series of numbers. A CBP spokesperson did not answer the question about whether face prints get deleted in time for publication. After we published this story, the CBP spokesperson said that “CBP does not store or share the templates generated during the matching process, for either US citizens or non-citizens.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you’ve already let airports scan your face, is there a point in saying no next time?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maybe you’re in the same situation as me. Maybe you’ve already let airports scan your face. And maybe you’re wondering whether saying no in the future will make any difference, given that your face data is probably already in a database —&nbsp;or two —&nbsp;or three. (Separate from TSA, your individual airline may also scan your face instead of your boarding pass before letting you on the plane, though airlines <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/you-can-say-no-to-face-scans-for-airplane-boarding\">say</a> you can opt out for domestic flights.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Buolamwini’s opinion? It’s definitely still worth declining the face scan next time you fly. “Every opt-out opportunity is a way to vote for your biometric rights,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve already seen that when there’s enough of a public outcry, it can lead to deletion of face data. After Facebook’s facial recognition system sparked a class-action lawsuit, government investigations, and public furor, the company ended up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/technology/facebook-facial-recognition.html\">deleting the face prints of more than a billion users</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Face purges can and do happen,” Buolamwini said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Remember, the TSA’s stated reason for rolling out facial recognition in airports is to minimize friction. If you’re unhappy about the use of the tech, you can consider generating more friction next time you fly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, July 19, 2:30 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published July 17 and has been updated with new comment from US Customs and Border Protection.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) is generally known for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/8/21/23831121/housing-yimbys-affordable-rent-unions-california\">his</a> relentless <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/19/17135678/sb-827-cars-california-transit-trains-buses\">bills</a> on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/7/18125644/scott-wiener-sb-50-california-housing\">housing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/news/mayor-breed-and-senator-wiener-announce-state-legislation-shut-down-sale-stolen-goods-san\">public safety</a>, a legislative record that made him one of the tech industry’s favorite legislators. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But his introduction of the “Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models” bill, <a href=\"https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047\">also known as SB 1047</a>, which requires companies training “frontier models” that cost more than $100 million to do safety testing and be able to shut off their models in the event of a safety incident, has inspired fury from that same industry, with VC heavyweights Andreessen-Horowitz and Y Combinator <a href=\"https://www.transformernews.ai/p/a16z-y-combinator-big-tech-sb1047-lobbying\">publicly condemning</a> the bill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I spoke with Wiener this week about SB 1047 and its critics; our conversation is below (condensed for length and clarity).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Kelsey Piper: I wanted to present you with challenges to SB 1047 I’ve heard and give you a chance to answer them. I think one category of concern here is that the bill would prohibit using a model publicly, or making it available for public use, if it poses an unreasonable risk of critical harm. </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s an unreasonable risk? Who decides what’s reasonable?&nbsp; A lot of Silicon Valley is very regulator-skeptical, so they don’t trust that discretion will be used and not abused.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Sen. Scott Wiener: </strong>To me, SB 1047 is a light-touch bill in a lot of ways. It’s a serious bill, it’s a big bill. I think it’s an impactful bill, but it’s not hardcore. The bill doesn’t require a license. There are people including some CEOs who <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/should-ai-development-require-license-chatgpts-creator-thinks-so-experts-disagree\">have said</a> there should be a licensure requirement. I rejected that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are people who think <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/7/24062374/ai-openai-anthropic-deepmind-legal-liability-gabriel-weil\">there should be strict liability</a>. That’s the rule for most product liability. I rejected that.&nbsp;[AI companies] do not have to get permission from an agency to release the [model]. They have to do the safety testing they all say they are currently doing or intend to do. And if that safety testing reveals a significant risk — and we define those risks as being catastrophic — then you have to put mitigations in place. Not to eliminate the risk but to try to reduce it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are already legal standards today&nbsp;that if a developer releases a model and then that model ends up being used in a way that harms someone or something, you can be sued and it’ll probably be a negligence standard about whether you acted reasonably. It’s much, much broader than the liability that we create in the bill. In the bill, only the Attorney General can sue, whereas under tort law anybody can sue. Model developers are already subject to potential liability that’s much broader than this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Yes, I’ve seen some objections to the bill that seem to revolve around misunderstandings of tort law, like people <a href=\"https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1798753608974139779\">saying</a>,&nbsp; “This would be like making the makers of engines liable for car accidents.”</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And they are. If someone crashes a car and there was something about the engine design that contributed to that collision, then the engine maker can be sued. It would have to be proven that they did something negligent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve talked to startup founders about it and VCs and folks from the large tech companies, and I’ve never heard a rebuttal to the reality that liability exists today and the liability that exists today is profoundly broader.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We definitely hear contradictions. Some people who were <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355212/ai-artificial-intelligence-1047-bill-safety-liability\">opposing</a> it were saying “this is all science fiction, anyone focused on safety is part of a cult, it’s not real, the capabilities are so limited.” Of course that’s not true. These are powerful models with huge potential to make the world a better place. I’m really excited for AI. I’m not a doomer in any respect. And then they say, “We can’t possibly be liable if these catastrophes happen.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1e0ts13/the_perils_of_californias_sb_1047_a_threat_to/\">Another challenge</a> to the bill is that&nbsp;open source developers have benefited a lot from Meta putting [the generously licensed, sometimes called open source&nbsp;AI model] Llama out there, and they’re understandably scared that this bill will make Meta less willing to do releases in the future, out of a fear of liability. Of course, if a model is genuinely extremely dangerous, no one wants it released. But the worry is that the concerns might just make companies way too conservative.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In terms of open source, including and not limited to Llama, I’ve taken the critiques from the open source community really, really seriously. We interacted with people in the open source community and we made amendments in direct response to the open source community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The shutdown provision requirement [a provision in the bill that requires model developers to have the capability to enact a full shutdown of a covered model, to be able to “unplug it” if things go south] was very high on the list of what person after person was concerned about.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We made an amendment making it crystal clear that once the model is not in your possession, you are not responsible for being able to shut it down. Open source folks who open source a model are not responsible for being able to shut it down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then the other thing we did was make an amendment about folks who were fine-tuning. If you make more than minimal changes to the model, or significant changes to the model, then at some point it effectively becomes a new model and the original developer is no longer liable. And there are a few other smaller amendments but those are the big ones we made in direct response to the open source community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Another challenge I’ve heard is: Why are you focusing on this and not all of California’s more pressing problems?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you work on any issue, you hear people say, “Don’t you have more important things to work on?” Yeah, I work <a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/san-francisco-housing-approval-times-plummet-senator-scott-wieners-landmark-housing-law-takes\">incessantly on housing</a>. I work on <a href=\"https://www.calbhbc.org/uploads/5/8/5/3/58536227/sb_855_-_fact_sheet_and_background_info.pdf\">mental health and addiction treatment</a>. I work incessantly on <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/scott-wiener-speed-governors-pedestrian-safety-california-bills-streets-safer/14356386/\">public safety</a>. I have an <a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senate-passes-senator-wiener-bills-crack-down-car-break-ins\">auto break-ins bill</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/news/mayor-breed-and-senator-wiener-announce-state-legislation-shut-down-sale-stolen-goods-san\">bill on people selling stolen goods on the streets</a>.&nbsp;And I’m also working on a bill to make sure we both foster AI innovation and do it in a responsible way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a policymaker, I’ve been very pro-tech. I’m a supporter of our tech environment, which is often under attack. I’ve <a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-net-neutrality-law-upheld-federal-appeals-court\">supported</a> California’s net neutrality law that fosters an open and free internet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But I have also seen with technology that we fail to get ahead of what are sometimes very obvious problems. We did that with data privacy. We finally got a data privacy law here in California — and for the record, the opposition to that said all of the same things, that it’ll destroy innovation, that no one will want to work here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My goal here is to create tons of space for innovation and at the same time promote responsible deployment and training and release of these models. This argument that this is going to squash innovation, that it’s going to push companies out of California — again, we hear that with pretty much every bill. But I think it’s important to understand this bill doesn&#8217;t just apply to people who develop their models in California, it applies to everyone who does business in California. So you can be in Miami, but unless you’re going to disconnect from California — and you’re not — you have to do this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I wanted to talk about one of the interesting elements of the debate over this bill, which is the fact it’s wildly popular everywhere except in Silicon Valley. It <a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/bipartisan-vote-senate-passes-senator-wieners-landmark-ai-safety-and-innovation-bill\">passed</a> the state senate 32-1, with bipartisan approval. <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/65ea6ad22e449b11a1df46b0/t/6694cb31c6758b310ba372f2/1721027377736/SB+1047+poll+memo.pdf\">77 percent of Californians are in favor</a> according to one poll, more than half strongly in favor.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>But the people who hate it, they’re all in San Francisco. How did this end up being your bill?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In some ways I’m the best author for this bill, representing San Francisco, because I’m surrounded and immersed in AI. The origin story of this bill was that I started talking with a bunch of front-line AI technologists, startup founders. This was early 2023, and I started having a series of salons and dinners with AI folks. And some of these ideas started forming. So in a way I’m the best author for it because I have access to unbelievably brilliant folks in tech. In another way I’m the worst author because I have folks in San Francisco who are not happy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>There’s something I struggle with as a reporter, which is conveying to people who aren’t in San Francisco, who aren’t in those conversations, that AI is something really, really big, really high stakes.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s very exciting. Because when you start trying to envision — could we have a cure for cancer? Could we have highly effective treatments for a broad range of viruses? Could we have breakthroughs in clean energy that no one ever envisioned? So many exciting possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But with every powerful technology comes risk. [This bill] is not about eliminating risk. Life is about risk. But how do we make sure that&nbsp;at least our eyes are wide open? That we understand that risk and that if there’s a way to reduce risk, we take it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s all we’re asking with this bill, and I think the vast majority of people will support that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect\"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup\"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

This tradition was popularized in America by influential figures like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both adorned their estates with grass lawns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But grass lawns remained accessible only to the wealthy who could afford their own home. This all shifted in the mid-20th century with the explosion of the American suburbs, where tens of millions of families purchased new homes that often had their very own green grass lawns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Grass lawns, though, require a lot of time and resources to maintain.

Students whose families make less than $175,000 will also qualify for free room and board. Nearly two-thirds of Hopkins’s current and entering students will be eligible for assistance under the new program, according to the school. Some of the money will also support financial aid for students in the Hopkins public health and nursing programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s part of a recent pattern of philanthropic intervention to make medical school, which <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-medical-school\">costs $236,000 on average</a>, more affordable. Earlier this year, Ruth Gottesman, a former professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City and the widow of a Wall Street investor, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/free-medical-school-tuition-ruth-gottesman-11eec429784776027161bcd1b6ea1905\">announced</a> she would make a $1 billion donation to Einstein to make school free to all students pursuing a medical degree. Billionaire Kenneth Langone and his wife Elaine have given multiple donations to New York University’s medical schools, including <a href=\"https://observer.com/2023/07/all-nyu-medical-schools-are-tuition-free-after-ken-langones-200m-donation/\">a $200 million sum last year</a>, to help provide free tuition to all students there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But a review of early outcomes from NYU’s free tuition program found that it was doing very little to get more of its graduates into communities with the most need. “Unfortunately, on training primary care physicians or sending graduates to underserved areas, tuition-free medical school gets an F,” the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Ezekiel Emanuel and Matthew Guido <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/22/free-medical-school-tuition-primary-care-doctor-shortage/\">wrote</a> in April.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A real fix to America’s health care access crisis would require investing directly in those underserved communities and equipping their hospitals with the resources to train the next generation of physicians. To appreciate why, we have to better understand the problem that actually needs to be solved.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The real doctor shortage</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have been hearing about the doctor shortage for the decade-plus that I have been covering health care. But the problem is more complex than it sounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you hear there is a shortage of physicians, you probably think: Okay, I get it, America doesn’t have enough doctors overall. Right?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That question in and of itself is not decided,” <a href=\"https://www.chwsny.org/about-us/center-staff/gaetano-forte/\">Gaetano Forte</a>, assistant director of SUNY Albany’s Center for Health Workforce Studies, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US does have significantly fewer <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/how-prepared-is-the-us-to-respond-to-covid-19-relative-to-other-countries/#healthcare-workforce-and-providers\">doctors per capita</a> than some other wealthy nations, such as Germany and Sweden. But America’s physician-to-patient ratio is actually about the same as other developed countries — Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, France — that still generally <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&amp;tableId=tbl2&amp;pii=S0140-6736%2818%2930994-2\">rank better</a> on measures of health care quality than the US does. So aggregate numbers alone are not enough to explain the access problems that patients face, and experts disagree over whether we need to boost the overall supply of providers in the short term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bigger problem is misallocation in the US physician workforce, Coffman told me last year. We know that we don’t have enough doctors in certain important specialties: primary care, obstetrics, and psychiatry, for example. We also don’t have nearly enough providers in a broad swath of specialties practicing in rural and other low-income communities. Between 2010 and 2017, while large urban counties <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775404#:~:text=From%202010%20to%202017%2C%20the,rural%20counties%20(59.7%20%5BIQR%2C\">added 10 doctors per 100,000 people on average</a>, rural counties lost three. As a result, metro regions had 125 doctors per 100,00 patients, while rural areas had 60.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">America is <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/primary-care-health-professional-shortage-areas-hpsas/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">littered with doctor deserts</a>, areas where there are not enough primary care providers, much less specialists or hospital-level services. The federal government <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/out-here-its-just-me/2019/09/28/fa1df9b6-deef-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html\">estimates</a> that 80 percent of rural Americans live in medically underserved communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the long term, the US will undoubtedly need more doctors in rural and urban areas alike. Groups like the Association of American Medical Colleges continue to <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/media/75231/download?attachment\">project</a> long-term workforce shortages, as boomer-generation doctors reach retirement age and the population of seniors requiring medical care swells.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why the doctor shortage is so hard to fix</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It would be nice if simply paying for new doctors to go to school in Baltimore or New York City led to more physicians practicing in small towns of the Midwest or poor neighborhoods in other big cities. But America’s doctors don’t work like that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Physicians tend to practice in communities <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/attracting-next-generation-physicians-rural-medicine#:~:text=Medical%20students%20who%20grow%20up,them%20to%20take%20up%20medicine.\">similar in density and socioeconomic status to where they grew up</a>. Over the years, some federal policies have tried to change that behavior — such as by repaying a new doctor’s medical school debts if they practice in a underserved community for a certain period of time — but&nbsp;the efforts have yielded <a href=\"https://academyhealth.org/sites/default/files/Rural_Workforce_RER_Final.pdf\">limited results</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Making medical school free faces the same problem: Unless you change the pool of new doctors, the benefits to underserved communities are likely to be marginal. Coffman contrasted Bloomberg’s gift to Johns Hopkins with a hypothetical donation to a historically Black college or university, given that Black communities have <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/05/02/black-americans-cardiology-deserts-heart-disease/\">striking gaps in their access to health care</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If your goal is, ‘I wanna see more Hopkins students come out of Hopkins without a lot of debt,’ [Bloomberg’s gift] is excellent. If your goal is ‘Across the whole country, I want to address the problem of the maldistribution of physicians by geography, by specialty, I want more folks from historically underrepresented groups,’ I would choose other institutions,” Coffman told me. “In general, one of the challenges of relying on philanthropy, particularly philanthropy in the form of very well-off individuals donating from their own personal wealth, is that these are individuals like Mr. Bloomberg who have their own priorities and understandably their own attachments to particular institutions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">State and local policymakers have explored setting up their own programs that recruit students directly from underserved communities. In California, <a href=\"https://meded.ucsf.edu/ucsf-san-joaquin-valley-prime-sjv-prime\">a UC San Francisco program in the San Joaquin Valley</a> is guaranteeing medical school admission to students from low-income areas, in the hopes that they will return to their communities or similar ones to practice after they graduate. But those efforts are necessarily small; some early returns have been promising, but their long-term impact is still undetermined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Research has also consistently found that most doctors <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2013/1115/p704.html#:~:text=2009%20data%20from%20the%20American,program%20(see%20accompanying%20figure).\">tend to practice near where they completed their residencies</a>, the post-graduation period of supervised, hands-on work experience. Almost all residencies — <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-329\">98 percent</a> —&nbsp;are in large academic medical centers located in urban areas, like Johns Hopkins. There are some good reasons for that: Those facilities tend to be well-staffed, have experienced mentors, and see high caseloads that allow doctors in training to get a lot of experience quickly. But this system has left much of the country scrambling to find doctors to work in their communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That is the result of deliberate policy choices. Medicare <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10960#:~:text=Medicare%20GME%20payments%20cover%20Medicare's,physician%20salaries%2C%20and%20administrative%20costs.\">funds</a> most medical residencies in the US, and it has not meaningfully changed its funding structure since the 1990s, even as the maldistribution of the health care workforce has gotten worse. For example, the program does not pay for hospitals to set up their graduate residency programs, something large hospital systems are better equipped to do than undercapitalized rural hospitals that have a greater need for new doctors. Some large hospital systems even <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/hehs-97-77r\">fund</a> their own residencies alongside Medicare-funded slots because having residents is good business for them: They get a lot of young, cheap doctors who nevertheless get to bill for services like any other white coat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Absent congressional action to expand them, the number of residency slots is limited. That makes the large academic centers, which are enormously influential with lawmakers, deeply invested in maintaining their hold on the medical training pipeline. More funding to help rural hospitals set up their own residency programs and more slots earmarked for rural facilities or understaffed specialties could help draw more young doctors to underserved areas — but sweeping reform is unlikely anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Absent a systemic overhaul of the medical profession, the Bloomberg money may be better than nothing. Some young doctors do <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/medical-school-debt-new-doctors-working-in-underserved-areas/\">say</a> that the high debts they carry from medical school discourage them from practicing in less wealthy areas. Maybe a few of the scholarship recipients will decide to practice in an underserved community, providing much-needed help to its residents. For those people, the former NYC mayor will have made a tremendous gift indeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in the long term, we need “a multi-pronged approach” to fix the medical pipeline outside of well-funded and centrally located programs like Hopkins, Coffman said. We need to recruit and support medical students who come from the underserved areas in Wisconsin and Wyoming and Tennessee, as well as New York and California. We need far more equally distributed residency programs. We need to make family medicine and pediatrics as appealing to young doctors as the more glamorous and lucrative specialties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These will be difficult and potentially expensive problems to solve. But it is necessary work. In the meantime, Bloomberg’s billion, and other donations like it, may be at best a Band-Aid on a broken system.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

A well-off person in the 18th and 19th centuries might go for a horse ride in the park or take a <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/what-was-grand-tour\">Grand Tour</a> through Europe; in the Gilded Age, they might go away to a socialite’s weeklong house party in <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2014/07/entertaining-tips-from-edith-wharton-whose-summer-home-the-mount-was-in-lenox-massachusetts.html\">Newport</a> in the dog days of summer. Meanwhile the working class, well, worked. It’s only in relatively recent decades that a vast world of affordable relaxation and entertainment opened up to people of all classes, whether that meant going out to eat or taking a trip — which became more accessible as commercial flights <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/history-of-flight-costs\">got a lot cheaper</a> in the late 1970s. Only in the mid to late 20th century did the idea of a family summer vacation become a symbol of the good life that the American middle class could enjoy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s still true, but something has changed in the last few years. The budget vacation is a crappier experience than it used to be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As with everything else in an inflationary economy, it’s more expensive to travel now than it was in 2019. But it’s not just about higher prices; there’s a growing divide in how the haves and have-nots jet around — maybe in part because more affluent travelers are increasingly willing to shell out extra money for maximum comfort. Today, if you have money to throw around on vacation, you’re spoiled for choices that unlock shorter wait times or better, roomier plane seats. Meanwhile, if you’re on a tight budget, your vacation is likely to feel especially overpriced for how shabby the experience is.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Getting less for more money</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether or not something has gotten “too expensive” is relative to a lot of factors — like how much money you personally have, how fast prices have risen, how much value the product or service brings you, and even how much the cost of other things in the economy have gone up. The reality is that travel prices haven’t soared quite as much as other sectors — they’re up by about 10 percent since 2019, which is a lot lower than the inflation we’ve seen in, say, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/23641875/food-grocery-inflation-prices-billionaires\">food prices</a>. “General prices are up about 23 percent over that same time period,” says Sally French, a travel expert at NerdWallet, which has been tracking <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/travel-price-tracker\">travel inflation</a> since 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to NerdWallet, flights are actually 6.3 percent cheaper than they were in June 2019. But other subcategories of travel have bounced up: Hotel prices are up 11.6 percent, rental car prices are up 33 percent, the price of entertainment experiences such as movies, theaters, and concerts are up 21.4 percent, and dining out is almost 30 percent higher. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One reason people may feel that travel prices are at all-time highs, according to French, may be because they’re still trying to book trips fairly <a href=\"https://media.hopper.com/research/2023-travel-trends-report\">last-minute</a> — which was relatively cheap to do during the height of the pandemic, when demand was way down. It is not cheap to do that anymore. Another possibility is “recency bias,” says French. In early 2021, the average inflation-adjusted fare out of Atlanta, for example, was $298.52, according to the <a href=\"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/averagefare/\">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>. As of early 2024, it was $417.79. Our set point for what a flight should cost might still be stuck in 2021. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s the bang-for-your-buck to consider. Base fares have fallen since 2019 — as in, what you might see before checking a bag — but more airlines have been adding bag fees as well as <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/airline-checked-baggage-fees-2024\">raising existing ones</a>. These extras, called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23410970/flight-fees-airlines-frontier-spirit-baggage-pick-seat\">“ancillary fees,”</a> have been making up an ever-larger share of airlines’ revenues, jumping way up around 2022 and last year amounting to <a href=\"https://ideaworkscompany.com/airline-ancillary-revenue-reaches-record-117-9-billion-worldwide-for-2023-press-release/\">nearly $118 billion</a> globally, a record high for the industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are seeing a trend of what we call ‘unbundling airfares,’” says French.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Low-cost (think Southwest, JetBlue) and ultra low-cost (Frontier, Spirit) airlines long ago unbundled everything in their fares in order to offer the cheapest, most spartan experience possible to travelers on a tight budget. Then they charged ancillary fees to a smaller portion of their passengers to make a profit. But since the late aughts, a growing number of full-service airlines — including all major US carriers except Southwest — have also unbundled what’s included in a basic plane ticket, blurring the distinction between full-service and low-cost carriers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In other words, fliers today are paying a slightly lower base fare for a worse flying experience compared to the bygone years when a full-service airline ticket included checked bags and seat selection — the travel industry’s version of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231003-skimpflation-an-even-sneakier-form-of-shrinkflation\">skimpflation</a>. Though airlines make a lot of money from extra fees, according to a recent <a href=\"https://business.yougov.com/content/48634-extra-leg-room-or-adult-only-zone-what-in-flight-upgrades-are-travelers-likely-to-pay-for\">YouGov survey</a>, most consumers claim that they probably wouldn’t consider paying for any flight extras — the most tempting was choosing their own seat, the least was being in an “adult-only zone” on the plane. Only about 16 percent of US travelers said they would pay for extra baggage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not just the experience of flying that feels lousier, either. Many hotel chains have reduced their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/travel/hotels-end-daily-cleaning.html\">daily housekeeping services</a>, leading to grousing about cleanliness — a factor arguably more important to travelers post-pandemic. Hotel resort fees have become <a href=\"https://www.hoteldive.com/news/hotel-junk-fees-legislation/702259/\">more common</a>, too. The average price of booking an Airbnb has <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/airbnb-rate-surge/\">soared since 2019</a>, including the <a href=\"https://www.airdna.co/blog/airbnb-cleaning-fees-what-hosts-need-to-know\">cleaning fees</a> that often come with a short-term rental. Listings without exorbitant cleaning fees might be saddled with a long list of chores guests should complete before they leave: loading the laundry, taking out the trash, putting fresh sheets on the bed — the stuff you take a vacation to get away from. Once you’ve arrived at your destination and are ready to see the sights, you’ll likely be paying more than travelers once did for <a href=\"https://skift.com/2023/08/14/tourist-attractions-and-experiences-see-big-price-jumps/\">tourist attractions</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23872087/disney-world-scale-economics-orlando-vacation\">Disney World</a>, for example, used to offer a service where all guests could skip the line at their favorite ride by making a reservation. Now doing so requires an <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/travel/2021/10/disney-world-replaces-free-fastpass-system-with-pay-to-ride-genie-and-lightning-lane-and-fans-are-not-happy.html\">extra purchase</a> beyond your admission ticket. TSA PreCheck lines, which cost $78 for five years, are also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/22/travel/tsa-precheck-clear-airport-security/index.html\">getting longer</a>, making it less valuable to pay for the skip-the-line service. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The premiumization of travel</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, people with money to burn now have more opportunities than ever to be upsold. Maybe you can’t afford the first-class cabin, but what about <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-everyone-is-suddenly-flying-premium-economy\">premium economy</a>? Or <a href=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/article/this-new-airline-ticket-lets-you-book-business-class-seats-for-cheaper-price\">basic business</a>? Or <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2023/05/10/100-per-hour-for-bunk-beds-in-long-haul-economy-starting-2024/\">$100 per hour</a> to rent a bed during a long-haul flight? Frontier lets you pay to keep the middle seat open. Why not pay the $500 annual fee on a credit card that will get you in the door of a new airport lounge, which in 2024 has become an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/06/airport-lounges-access-chase-amex/678206/\">inexplicably luxe space</a> occupying <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/look-ahead-delta-debut-premium-lounges-and-more-2024\">tens of thousands of square feet</a>?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What this shows is that travelers are willing to trade up,” says Henry Harteveldt, president of the travel industry market firm Atmosphere Research Group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“We all know there’s no God in economy”</p><cite>henry harteveldt</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you have the money, why wouldn’t you? “We all know that coach sucks, we all know there’s no God in economy,” says Harteveldt. By stripping away services into disparate add-ons, airlines have ensured that basic economy is a dismal experience, which in turn makes it more likely for travelers with discretionary income to justify <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/travel-industry-wants-everyone-go-premium-price-rcna132871\">spending more for comfort and sanity</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">People are willing to spend more extravagantly than ever for luxury travel, too. Carl Junior, a senior luxury travel curator at Scenset, an agency that creates custom luxury travel itineraries for wealthy clients, says there’s been an uptick in the number of people interested in its service since the pandemic  — particularly intergenerational families looking to take a big trip together. Such custom itineraries often range between $10,000 to $100,000, sometimes more. “They definitely are willing to spend a lot more just for that ease and comfort of travel,” Junior says. The pandemic shook up people’s priorities; those who can afford to want all-out, once-in-a-lifetime trips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Private jet travel has <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90973020/more-people-are-flying-in-private-jets-and-its-ruining-air-travel-for-the-rest-of-us\">soared since the pandemic</a>, and while cruises are in high demand overall right now, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/travelers-ready-set-sail-cruises-record-levels-next-year-2023-12-04\">luxury cruises</a> have seen an especially huge bump in bookings. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/21/luxury-hotels-are-having-a-glorious-moment\">High-end hotels</a> are seeing faster revenue growth than mid-range and budget hotels; more are opening up to meet demand, which means luxury lodgings are making up a higher share of total available hotel rooms. Data from CoStar, a commercial real estate data company, shows that luxury hotel occupancy in 2024 was slightly higher than this time last year, while occupancy of budget hotels was <a href=\"https://skift.com/2024/06/25/u-s-hotel-performance-split-luxury-hotels-rise-as-low-end-brands-slump/\">3.4 percent lower</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The summer vacation is out of reach for some</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Summer is the most popular time to travel, but in a recent <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/americans-ca-no-longer-afford-vacation-1920045\">Newsweek survey</a>, nearly 45 percent of respondents said they’re not taking any trips this season, with about half of that group citing cost as the reason. The results echo other surveys showing that Americans are <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1449117/consumers-spent-less-travel-dining-out-united-states/\">pulling back</a> <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/transportation/2024-summer-leisure-travel-trends.html\">on travel spending</a>. The profile of someone who does travel over the summer has become slightly more affluent, too: According to Deloitte, in 2023 about 31 percent of Americans who made a summer trip were people with an income under $50,000. In 2024, this group makes up just 19 percent of travelers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The average income of the leisure traveler today is about $95,000, according to research from Atmosphere. The average income of the budget airline traveler, in contrast, is $79,000 — which is higher than the $73,000 to $74,000 range it was a few years ago. “There definitely is a group of people who are not flying as much, or perhaps at all, because right now their budgets simply don’t allow them to do so,” says Harteveldt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Income has always been tied to the ability to travel. While most Americans have flown by air at least once in their life, college graduates — who typically earn a lot more money than people with a high school diploma — are vastly more likely to have visited <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/08/12/most-americans-have-traveled-abroad-although-differences-among-demographic-groups-are-large/\">multiple foreign countries</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/316376/air-travel-frequency-us-by-income/\">Statista survey in 2015</a> showed that almost one-fifth of households earning more than $80,000 per year were frequent air travelers, while just 3 percent of those making less than $40,000 said the same. Around one-third of the lowest-income group said they had never flown, compared to just 7 percent of the highest-income group. Another <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/668013/international-vacation-frequency-of-us-adults-by-income/\">2017 survey</a> showed that the majority of those making under $35,ooo had never taken an international vacation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, traveling well is available in more flavors and increments, but that also means there’s more of a chasm than ever between upgraded vacationers and those who can only afford the bare-bones fare, if that. The ceiling of travel experience is higher, and the floor is lower. There are few places that make class divides more apparent than the airport.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Look at the way that solidarity ear bandages became <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cldy39vpv4qo\">the RNC’s must-have fashion accessory</a>, or how long the audience managed to put up big cheers during his historically long and rambling acceptance speech on Thursday night.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond Trump worship, the RNC has been billed as proof that the populist takeover of the Republican Party is complete. On issues like trade, immigration, and foreign alliances, this analysis is surely correct; the Trumpian insurgency has gone head-to-head with the party old guard and defeated them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet elements of the old Republican Party remain thoroughly in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike Europe’s far-right populist parties, the GOP remains unyieldingly opposed to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361417/jd-vance-rnc-trump-vice-president-economy-business\">welfare state and progressive taxation</a>. It remains <a href=\"https://prospect.org/health/2024-07-11-trump-gop-abortion-womens-rights/\">committed to banning abortion</a>, an issue where its actions at the state level speak for themselves. It remains <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361417/jd-vance-rnc-trump-vice-president-economy-business\">deeply hostile to unions</a>; vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance, allegedly the avatar of the party’s pro-worker populism, has a <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/jd-vance\">0 percent score from the AFL-CIO</a>. On foreign policy, it is by no means strictly isolationist: it seeks to ramp up military spending and aggressively confront China even as it tears down both military alliances and the American-led global trade regime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ideologically, the GOP is a mess, a political party constructed less out of one cogent worldview than an assemblage of different parts, a zombie given life by the lightning of Donald John Trump. It is Frankenstein’s party. And while Trump and his loyalists are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360843/republican-national-convention-trump-night-one-project-2025\">clearly our Shelleyian monster’s head</a>, they do not (yet) have full control over all its limbs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump coalition is so new that it has yet to produce an equilibrium, a stable set of policy commitments that will endure as long as it aligns. It basically works by Trump getting his way on issues he really cares about — like democracy, trade, and immigration — while others claim what they can when they can claim it. The monied class is still calling the shots on taxes and regulation; the social conservatives are still in the driver’s seat when it comes to issues like abortion and LGBT rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can see this at work in documents like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360843/republican-national-convention-trump-night-one-project-2025\">RNC platform and Project 2025</a>, which together help us understand the GOP’s ambitions going forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the most notable policies in them, like Project 2025’s proposal to end the Justice Department’s independence or the platform’s call for “the largest Deportation Program in history,” is pure Trump (right down to the random capitalization).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in issue areas where other elements of the right prevail, things sound a bit more old Republican. Project 2025’s chapter on the EPA is about as <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/inside-the-project-2025-plan-to-gut-climate-regs/\">old-school business friendly as it gets</a>; the GOP platform promises to “slash Regulations” and “pursue additional Tax Cuts.” Project 2025 calls on the next president to “rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When there’s tension between Trump’s instincts and the old Republican agenda, the result is not always clear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On trade, Trump has simply won; the issue is central enough to his political identity that his protectionism has become party orthodoxy. But on abortion, where Trump wants the party to moderate, signals are more mixed. He succeeded in, for example, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/republicans-abortion-party-platform-trump-rnc-5561e857c5501df9864ab8ca666d8bc5\">taking a call for a national abortion ban out of the GOP platform</a> — but banning abortion remains central to the party identity. Both Vance and Project 2025 support using <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained\">an obscure 1873 law to ban the distribution of mifepristone</a>, the abortion pill, by mail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Partly, this confused state of affairs is a product of Trump’s own personality. The conservative writer <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/18/trump-second-term-agenda-project-2025/\">Ramesh Ponnuru argues</a>, correctly, that he simply doesn’t have the character necessary to run a strict and doctrinal ideological movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s not just that he lacks the discipline and focus to carry out an objective, although he does lack both, or that flatterers easily manipulate him, although they do. It’s also that his objectives are malleable to start with,” Ponnuru argues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But partly, it’s a result of coalitional politics — how the American right has always worked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Post-World War II American conservatism was a “three-legged stool” formed of three groups: free market libertarians, social conservatives, and foreign policy hawks. These groups often disagreed with each other on matters of both principle and policy. Hence an ideology contradiction: a “small government” conservatism that aimed to build the world’s largest army and police consenting adults in their homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was nothing natural about this alliance, no reflecting of an enduring and transhistorical American tradition. “Movement conservatism,” as it was called, was a movement — one built, like any other political faction, by people molded by a specific time and place (Cold War America) in response to its particular challenges. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moreover, movement conservatism <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/6/23144343/end-of-conservatism-roe\">was not the entirety of the American right</a>. In his recent book <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300260977/taking-america-back/\"><em>Taking America Back</em></a>, historian David Austin Walsh argues that respectable conservatives actually depended on the radical fringe for their success. Extremist groups like the John Birch Society, which saw a communist plot behind every bush, worked in tandem with the mainstream conservatives to fight the liberals —&nbsp;what Walsh calls a right-wing “popular front.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The American right was thus an alliance on top of an alliance: the three-legged stool, itself already unwieldy, acting in concert with a fringe right willing to go to dark places where mainstream conservatism dared not tread.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, the power relationship has flipped: The far right is now the senior partner setting the tone in Washington, with the fusionists following its lead. But the coalition remains a coalition, and it will act accordingly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s just one problem. The vice president was never in charge of the border. That job belongs to Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, and to Xavier Becerra, the secretary of health and human services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, a combination of right-wing spin, media fascination during Harris’s early tenure, miscommunication from the White House, and growing migrant surges during the Biden presidency have all made that label stick. Now, it stands as one of the more serious challenges Harris faces, whether she’s the vice presidential or presidential nominee.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Where the “border czar” label began</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Referring to Harris as the&nbsp;“border czar” isn’t new. Right-wing media, anti-immigrant activists, and Republican politicians have been using the label for the vice president <a href=\"https://cis.org/Arthur/What-Border-Czar-Kamala-Harris-Doing-Border-Crisis\">for years</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It has its roots in March 2021, when Biden announced that he would be giving Harris essentially the same assignment he got during his own vice presidency: coordinating diplomatic relationships to address the “root causes” of migration into the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’ve asked her, the VP, today — because she’s the most qualified person to do it — to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help — are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,” Biden said during a White House meeting on migration on March 24, 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea behind this approach is a long-term strategy: Border surges were just one symptom of deeper economic, diplomatic, and security problems these countries face that cause people to make the trek north. The assignment was a bit cursed from the start —&nbsp;a “politically treacherous job with little short-term payoff,” as <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-02-16/essential-politics-kamala-harris-vp-portfolio-migration-voting-rights-essential-politics\">it was described</a> by the Los Angeles Times — because any benefits from addressing these root causes would obviously take time to appear. Meanwhile, the border saw more legal as well as illegal crossings every month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Senior White House officials who briefed reporters before the announcement emphasized at the time that this was a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/24/kamala-harris-immigration-border-surge-477810\">diplomatic assignment</a>: a two-pronged approach to build diplomatic ties with these countries and to oversee investment and implementation of foreign aid to these countries to address infrastructure, grow business, and strengthen civil society.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the start, though, media coverage and the White House’s communication about the role were muddled. Headlines described Harris as the “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/24/kamala-harris-immigration-border-surge-477810\">point person on immigration</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9444413/Kamala-Harris-not-visited-Mexico-border-taking-charge-migrant-crisis.html\">placed in charge of migration crisis</a>,” while senior officials <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/confusion-clouds-harris-immigration-role-n1263671\">later said</a> Harris would “oversee a whole-of-government approach” to dealing with migration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The White House’s communications team spent much of that early time trying to clarify the assignment, but as migrant border crossings continued to rise, much of the press and the public’s attention became focused on why Harris and the administration were not more focused on addressing short-term problems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adding to the mess were Harris’s own missteps. She was widely criticized in the press for being defensive during her first <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/kamala-harris-foreign-trip/index.html\">international trips</a> to Mexico and Guatemala in June 2021, and by immigrant rights activists for a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/07/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-giammattei-of-guatemalain-joint-press-conference/\">speech</a> in which she urged “folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come.” She also evaded questions about why neither she nor Biden had been to the southern border when she was talking about the border abroad, leading to criticism by Republicans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then came a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/557282-vp-harris-not-discounting-concerns-about-events-at-us-border-during/\">widely derided interview</a> with NBC News’ Lester Holt during that trip, in which she appeared to mock Holt’s question about why she hadn’t visited the southern border if she was working to try to stem the flow of migration north. “At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” Harris told Holt. “We’ve been to the border. So this whole thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Holt pointed out that she hadn’t, she seemed to discount the question, replying that she hadn’t “been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t &#8230; understand the point that you’re making. I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was a significant moment in the context of Harris’s criticism: During this first year of the Biden-Harris term, Harris and her office were facing intense media scrutiny over the VP’s role, ability to communicate to the public, and her office’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/18/politics/ashley-etienne-kamala-harris/index.html\">internal</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/politics/symone-sanders-leaving-white-house-harris/index.html\">strife</a>. Questions <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html\">swirled</a> in the press about whether Harris was plugged into Biden’s inner circle, whether she had a discernible portfolio of assignments, and whether her team was equipped to help her perform her duties if they were at odds with the president’s staff or leaving her office entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On top of all this, Harris got another doomed assignment: to lobby for <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/15/harris-voting-rights-push-527186\">voting-rights reforms</a> in a tied Senate, where Biden and House Democrats’ legislative proposals could not pass a filibuster.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Border crossings would continue to surge over the next three years, further fueling criticism of Harris. As my colleague Nicole Narea <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum\">has explained</a>, the nature of these immigration surges began to change, too, making Harris’s “root causes” work even more difficult:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under the Trump administration, most migrants arriving at the southern border were from Central America’s “Northern Triangle”: Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In the last few years, however, the number of migrants coming from those countries has been eclipsed by those coming from South America — particularly Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua — and the Caribbean, including Haiti and Cuba. They have been driven out by recent compounding political and economic crises and natural disasters in their home countries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans and conservative commentators had a field day with all of this, picking on immigration as a key line of attack during the 2022 midterms. They introduced legislation tying Harris to the term “border czar,” introducing a “<a href=\"https://jackson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=348\">Border Czar Accountability Act</a>” and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hres253/BILLS-118hres253ih.pdf\">resolutions</a> calling on Harris to be stripped of the assignment. They spent hours on cable news and in Congress talking about the Guatemala trip and the Holt interview. They ran ads during the midterms about immigration, tying Biden and Harris to the border “crisis.” <br><br>Ultimately, they managed to blur the line between the assignment Harris got and the worsening conditions at the southern border.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why Republicans are zeroing in on this attack now</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Republican National Convention has now offered a preview of how this line of attack will be used against Harris as the general election nears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Searches for the term have spiked recently, per Google Trends <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=border%20czar&amp;hl=en\">data</a>, similarly to how they spiked when Harris was first given the root-causes assignment, before the 2022 midterm elections, and during previous moments of news coverage about the border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Former presidential candidate Nikki Haley previewed on Tuesday night how Republicans plan to harness the&nbsp;confusion: “Kamala had one job. One job. And that was to fix the border,” she said. “Now imagine her in charge of the entire country.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other speakers this week have referenced “border czar Kamala Harris” being responsible for “encourag[ing] millions of illegals to invade America &#8230; and put[ting] the welfare of illegals over their own citizens,” as the Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno put it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even the Trump campaign’s chief has <a href=\"https://x.com/SmithInAmerica/status/1813978601609724108\">acknowledged</a> this is their best line of attack against the VP.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The White House and the Biden campaign, meanwhile, don’t seem to have a robust answer to these attacks, calling them “lies” and “smears” while pointing to the vice president’s diplomatic work over the last few years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s been less media and White House attention paid to the actual assignment she was given, but the administration has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/25/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-new-initiatives-to-strengthen-the-u-s-guatemala-relationship-and-address-the-root-causes-of-migration-from-guatemala/\">routinely</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/19/report-on-the-u-s-strategy-for-addressing-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america/\">provided</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/06/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-the-central-america-forward-launch-event/\">updates</a> on the “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/25/fact-sheet-update-on-the-u-s-strategy-for-addressing-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america-3/\">Root Causes Strategy</a>.” She only visited Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico once during the first year of the assignments, though she did hold <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/07/statement-from-senior-advisor-and-chief-spokesperson-symone-sanders-on-vice-president-kamala-harriss-virtual-bilateral-meeting-with-president-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-of-mexico/\">virtual</a> and <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/readout-vice-president-kamala-harriss-meeting-with-mexican-president-andres-manuel-lopez\">in</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORCyY2b5mgo\">-person</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/statement-by-senior-advisor-and-chief-spokesperson-symone-sanders-on-vice-president-kamala-harriss-virtual-bilateral-meeting-with-president-alejandro-giammattei-of-guatemala/\">meetings</a> with heads of state from the region. Still, it doesn’t seem as though Central America or Mexico has been an actual focus for the vice president, especially since the midterm elections and the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A White House official pointed me to the visits and roundtables Harris has held on this assignment, citing $5.2 billion of investments Harris has announced in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to expand internet access and combat corruption. A Biden campaign official, meanwhile, pointed to the attempts the White House made in 2021 to clarify Harris’s assignment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As I’ve written before, Republicans’ attacks on the Biden administration’s immigration efforts <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop\">aren’t going to go away</a> anytime soon. The American public’s mood on immigration and the border has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift\">soured dramatically</a> in the last two years, and the specifics of Harris’s original assignment may not matter to voters who just want less immigration, period. As long as the public continues its anti-immigration tilt, it seems likely the “border czar” nickname will be here to stay.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The president spoke in public far less often than his predecessors. He repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/02/03/biden-turns-down-super-bowl-interview-for-second-straight-year/\">turned down Super Bowl interviews</a>, rare opportunities to convey his message to a massive national audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This limited calendar set off alarm bells <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html\">among some pundits</a>. Still, it was possible to imagine that the White House team was unduly risk-averse. Biden’s age was undoubtedly a liability, and his rhetorical chops significantly diminished, but maybe he was still okay. Given widespread <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/02/16/senior-democrats-joe-biden-old-00083129\">doubts about his vice president’s electability</a>, unifying behind Biden was plausibly the party’s best bet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until it wasn’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers\">disastrous debate performance</a> broke through Democrats’ collective denial. The simplest explanation had been the correct one: The White House had been hiding Biden from the public because he had something to hide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was no precedent for the challenge this posed to the Democratic Party, and there was no straightforward mechanism for resolving it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For weeks, Democratic leaders floundered in search of a consensual path forward. Some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360812/democrats-replace-biden-trump-shooting\">entertained blindly following Biden</a> into the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After some delay, however, party leaders prioritized their constituents’ interests in victory over their own desire to avoid blame or interpersonal conflict. Over the past 24 hours, it has become clear that the Democrats are in array.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Wednesday, ABC News <a href=\"https://x.com/jonkarl/status/1813713397437104272\">revealed</a> that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had personally told Biden last Saturday that he could best serve the party by getting out of the race. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/17/jeffries-schumer-biden-hurting-democrats/\">told him the same</a>. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/nancy-pelosi-biden-conversation/index.html\">told</a> the president that polling showed he could not beat former President Donald Trump and that staying in the race would destroy Democrats’ prospects of winning back control of the House.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the president refused to take this advice, all three Democratic leaders evidently let word of their views leak. When confronted with reports of their private conversations with Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and Jeffries all pointedly refused to deny the accuracy of such news stories.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understand the push to replace Biden</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President Joe Biden has come under mounting pressure from Democrats to reconsider his 2024 reelection bid.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358652/biden-drop-out-debate-harris-convention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Should Biden drop out?

That event had initially been scheduled when it looked as though waiting until the Democratic National Convention in late August to officially nominate a candidate would deprive the Democratic nominee of access to the ballot in Ohio. But the DNC persisted with plans for a roll call <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360917/biden-trump-harris-dnc-delegates\">even after Ohio passed a law resolving that issue</a>. The virtual nomination process therefore came to be seen as a tool for Biden to run out the clock and foist himself upon a mutinous party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Schumer and other top Democrats implored the DNC to postpone the roll call, which is now scheduled for the first week in August.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, on Thursday, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/obama-says-biden-must-consider-viability/\">reported</a> that former President Barack Obama had “told allies in recent days that President Biden’s path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy.” When asked about this revelation, a spokesman for Obama declined to deny it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This concerted pressure campaign from blue America’s most powerful political and economic actors appears to be paying dividends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/dnc-biden-nomination.html\">reported</a> Wednesday that Biden has “become more receptive in the last several days to hearing arguments about why he should drop his re-election bid,” and “been willing to listen to rundowns of new and worrying polling data and has asked questions about how Vice President Kamala Harris could win.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/18/president-biden-drop-out-election-democrats\">Axios</a> reported that several “top Democrats privately tell us the rising pressure of party congressional leaders and close friends will persuade President Biden to decide to drop out of the presidential race, as soon as this weekend.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether Biden does, in fact, step aside remains to be seen. But whatever the president does from here, the Democratic Party as an institution has done its part. Congressional leaders cannot drag Biden kicking and screaming from the campaign trail, but they are doing just about everything in their power to depose him and give their party a better chance of keeping Trump and his allies out of power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360812/democrats-replace-biden-trump-shooting\">critical</a> of the Democratic leadership’s apparent complacency in recent weeks, but there is no question that Biden’s decline put them in a genuinely difficult position. American political parties are weak and disorganized. Power is much less centralized within national leadership than it is in most parliamentary democracies. And unlike parliamentary parties, Democratic congressional caucuses cannot remove politically damaged presidents through a vote of no confidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Removing a presidential nominee — against their will, after they have already won an overwhelming majority of primary votes — is a task for which American parties have no manual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, to mount a concerted campaign to push Biden to the sidelines, Democratic leaders had to be willing to stick their necks out, without the protection of any legitimizing precedent. It was entirely plausible that they might lack the will to do this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, the president did not bend in the face of his fellow Democrats’ doubts and attacked those calling for his exit as “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/06/30/us-news/biden-campaign-rips-bedwetting-brigade-in-blast-touts-poll-pegging-him-stronger-than-other-dems/\">bedwetters</a>” and anti-democratic “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/08/joe-biden-morning-joe-interview-2024-00166784\">elites</a>.” Meanwhile, few in the party had much confidence in the electability of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat best positioned to inherit the nomination should Biden step aside. And although Biden lost support in national public polls following his debate performance, Trump’s advantage <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\">stayed below 3 percentage points</a> in polling averages. Harris has been performing slightly better than Biden in polls against Trump, but the difference is fairly marginal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, for self-interested, risk-averse politicians, it would have been tempting to conclude that the party was going to lose no matter what they did, and it would be better to let Biden take the blame than claim ownership of Harris’s inevitable loss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rejecting such fatalism required both commitment to the best interests of the party writ large and a modicum of sophistication in political analysis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris does appear most likely to inherit the Democratic nomination, should Biden step aside. And it’s true that she does not currently look like an especially formidable candidate. But her <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">disapproval rating</a> is lower than <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/\">Biden’s</a>. Voters’ views of her are less fixed. She therefore offers a higher upside. And when you are heading toward near-certain defeat with a candidate who’s been losing in swing-state polls for months — and is physically incapable of communicating effectively with the public — it’s better to roll the dice on a candidate with a higher ceiling, even if she has a potentially lower floor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, if Democratic leaders believe that the party could consolidate around a stronger standard-bearer — perhaps, one with a proven record of winning office in a swing state — they should work toward achieving that outcome.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In any event, persisting with Biden would be profoundly damaging for the Democratic Party. It would force many Democrats to repeatedly tell a lie, and one that an <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/30/poll-biden-mental-age-debate/74262195007/\">overwhelming majority of voters</a> recognize as such: that Biden is clearly fit to serve another four years as president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/dnc-biden-nomination.html\">Times</a>, one recent internal Democratic poll indicated “that voters are deeply distrustful of elected officials who vouch for the president’s mental capacity and endorse him.” Whatever one makes of Harris’s odds, avoiding tainting down-ballot Democrats’ perceived integrity in the eyes of swing voters is grounds enough for making the switch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is still conceivable — if doubtful — that Biden will refuse to step down. At this point, his persistence will tell us more about his personal pathologies than those of his party.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Faced with an unprecedented political crisis, Democratic leaders unified behind a coherent strategy to advance the party’s best interests, in defiance of a president who struggled to recognize the unsustainability of his position. With Biden’s belated help, and further strategic ruthlessness, they will give their coalition a fighting chance to win in November. The Democrats are in array.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s a barrage of deals that few can refuse, made even sweeter by Amazon’s same-day, one-day, or two-day delivery service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unsurprisingly, it’s an incredibly profitable day for Amazon. Last Prime Day, the company saw <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/prime-day-shopping-numbers/index.html\">$12.7 billion</a> in sales and <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/7/first-day-of-prime-day-was-the-single-largest-sales-day-ever-on-amazon-helping-make-this-the-biggest-prime-day-event-ever\">over 375 million items purchased</a>, the largest numbers it’s seen since Prime Day launched nearly 10 years ago in 2015. Adobe Analytics, an organization that studies e-commerce data, predicted that this year’s sale will be another record-breaker, with a forecast of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-sales-hit-record-14-billion-data-firm-says-2024-07-15/\">$14 billion dollars</a> in sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Amazon’s <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/7/amazons-10th-prime-day-event-offers-deep-discounts-and-millions-of-deals-from-top-brands-exclusively-for-prime-members\">self-proclaimed customer celebration</a> comes at a cost. While Prime members can purchase goods with the ease of a few clicks year-round, getting those millions of products to arrive at their doorsteps in just a day or two is far more intensive — and even dangerous, as <a href=\"https://thesoc.org/what-we-do/same-day-injury-amazon-fails-to-deliver-safe-jobs/\">research</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/16/bernie-sanders-amazon-investigation/\">investigations</a> into the company show — for the warehouse workers and delivery drivers that Amazon employs and relies on. The speed and scale is worse on Prime Day, when even more consumers are buying things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Workers have long been vocal about the risks they face on the job to keep up with consumer demands. On July 15, the eve of Prime Day, a group of former and current Amazon workers <a href=\"https://x.com/warehouse_life/status/1812915104805232652\">showed up to the corporation’s New York City office</a> to deliver stories from workers about injuries and deaths on the job and to request a meeting with the vice president of Amazon’s Global Workplace Health and Safety, Sarah Rhoads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speakers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LifeInWarehouses/videos/1199344564846918?notif_id=1721059868993828&amp;notif_t=live_video_schedule_viewer&amp;ref=notif\">shared</a> their experiences of getting hurt, being overworked, and being denied workers’ compensation. One of the banners held up by workers read, “Same-day delivery, lifetime of injury.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It shouldn’t shock anyone that working in a warehouse for long hours can be grueling, tiresome work. But the frequency at which Amazon workers are hurt on the job — with injuries ranging from musculoskeletal disorders developed from <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/hazardous-by-design-after-pandemic-boom-amazon-faces-safety-reckoning/\">repetitive, uncomfortable movements and heavy lifting</a> to <a href=\"https://prismreports.org/2023/11/06/amazon-workers-injuries/\">broken bones</a> — is not the industry standard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Prime Day’s pressure on workers</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kat Cole, a worker at Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, and an organizer with the Democratic Reform Caucus of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), says that regardless of what time of year it is, working a shift at one of Amazon’s warehouses is difficult. But during the week of the Prime Day sales, the pressure is up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You have people breathing down your neck,” Cole told Vox. That increased volume of work puts stress on workers and leads to more injuries, she added. She’s no stranger to injuries herself, even outside of Prime Day and other big sales weeks. “I go home with at least one huge black and blue bruise on my legs, at least once a week.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161655440.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.737892056687,100,78.524215886627\" alt=\"A person wearing a yellow safety vest scans an apple-branded package in a warehouse.\" title=\"A person wearing a yellow safety vest scans an apple-branded package in a warehouse.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A worker prepares an Apple iPad package at an Amazon same-day delivery fulfillment center on Prime Day, in the Bronx, New York City, on July 16, 2024. | Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She says her coworkers have suffered from a variety of injuries and illnesses while on the job: concussions, slipped discs, a sprained wrist, a broken ankle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Luke Cianciotto, an Amazon delivery driver in the northern Chicago area, says the increased workload doesn’t just include more deliveries. To accommodate for the influx of work on Prime Day, he says more drivers are hired leading up to it, and more veteran drivers are tasked with training them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What ends up happening is you put these drivers on the road, setting them up for failure,” Cianciotto told Vox. “They do a bad job. And they don’t deserve that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Cianciotto and his fellow delivery drivers have been on <a href=\"https://teamster.org/2024/06/illinois-amazon-drivers-strike-over-unfair-labor-practices/\">strike for the last three weeks</a>, his experience with Prime Day in the past includes drivers working late into the night, delivering hundreds upon hundreds of packages that fill their vans “wall to wall, floor to ceiling.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On an average week for full-time Amazon warehouse employees, shifts can be anywhere between 10 to 12 hours. Cole said that during weeks with increased consumer demand from events like Prime Day, it’s common for Amazon to schedule “mandatory extra time” — additional hours or days added on to workers’ shifts to assist with these surges, on top of this already demanding schedule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Prime Day being in the middle of July, some Amazon employees aren’t just working under extra pressure — they’re <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections\">working through severe heat, too</a>, with temperatures rising as high as 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the warehouse. At the JFK8 facility, Cole and her fellow union organizers have taken it upon themselves to hand out Gatorade and ice pops to her coworkers before they start their shifts. Cole says Amazon will put up signs reminding people that the company cares and to take breaks. Amazon will also try to “lighten the mood,” Cole says, with novelties like DJs or offering lemonade. But she says that’s not what workers need.<br><br>“They need the warehouse to be cooler, they need safer working conditions, they need to know that they can take these breaks when they need them without penalty or retaliation,” Cole said. “That’s what we need.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a statement to Vox, Amazon said its heat mitigation practices “meets or exceeds state requirements and federal guidance” and included a link to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-amazon-keeps-employees-and-drivers-safe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">heat prevention measures</a>. (Note: While the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) provides <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">guidance on heat</a>, there is currently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">no enforceable federal workplace</a> standard to protect workers from heat specifically, nor is there a workplace heat illness prevention requirement in <a href=\"https://nynow.wmht.org/blogs/politics/new-york-lags-behind-setting-worker-protections-for-extreme-heat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York</a>, where the JFK8 warehouse is located.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Shipping may be free, but the labor behind it comes at a price</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In today’s market, companies are competing with Amazon by offering their <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/360028/amazon-prime-day-2024-target-walmart-temu\">own version of Prime Day sales</a> and rapid delivery dates. But even with growing competition from the likes of Target and Walmart, Amazon is still one of the leaders in the pack of e-commerce giants — and that includes leading in workplace injuries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April 2021, the company published <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders\">a letter from then-CEO Jeff Bezos</a> about its commitment to being “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.” Just a month later, the company <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2021/5/from-body-mechanics-to-mindfulness-amazon-launches-employee-designed-health-and-safety-program-called-workingwell-across-u-s-operations\">announced</a> its health and safety program called WorkingWell, with a goal to cut its recordable incident rate (RIR) — or how often injuries or illness occur in the workplace per 100 full-time employees&nbsp;— in half by 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the announcement was made, the RIR was 7.6 per 100 full-time employees, according to Amazon’s most recent <a href=\"https://cdn-safety.aboutamazon.com/ea/c3/d72d03394d0db22e336048031ec8/amazon-safety-report-2022-v41.pdf\">annual safety report</a>. Amazon would need to reduce its incident rate by at least 10 percent each year in order to slash the RIR by half. In 2022, the RIR was 6.7, a reduction of 11.8 percent from the previous year, appearing to be on track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But one <a href=\"https://thesoc.org/what-we-do/same-day-injury-amazon-fails-to-deliver-safe-jobs/\">report</a> released this past May from <a href=\"https://thesoc.org/\">the Strategic Organizing Center</a> (SOC), a coalition of labor unions, challenges Amazon’s self-report. In its analysis of data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the center found that in 2022, there were 6.9 injuries for every 100 full-time employees, compared to 7.9 injuries in 2021. That’s an injury reduction of 12.7 percent in Amazon facilities, which includes warehouses, logistics, and delivery facilities. While these numbers are slightly different from the ones found in Amazon’s safety report, that’s still a notable decrease. But in 2023, SOC found in its report that those numbers only fell to 6.5 injuries per 100 full-time employees — a reduction of 5.8 percent, just a little over half of what it needs to average each year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">SOC researchers also noted that while these numbers fell from 2021 to 2023, injuries that required workers to be reassigned to lighter duties increased, while injuries that necessitated losing time at work decreased. There are two ways to interpret this: one being that Amazon has taken steps to meaningfully reduce severe injuries that would require an absence from work. The other possibility is that Amazon has shifted workers into lighter duties to keep them working when they should be resting and recovering from their injuries, which is misleading and puts workers at risk of injuring themselves again.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/final_workplace_injuries.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,21.425411105376,100,57.149177789249\" alt=\"Chart titled &quot;workplace injuries reported at Amazon facilities,&quot; showing a sharp increase in light duty cases and a decrease in lost time cases.\" title=\"Chart titled &quot;workplace injuries reported at Amazon facilities,&quot; showing a sharp increase in light duty cases and a decrease in lost time cases.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latter is what SOC has claimed Amazon is doing. Amazon’s own reasoning is not too far from this assertion: In its 2022 annual safety report, the company said that one of the main drivers of reducing the number of injuries that required time away from work was its “Return to Work” program, allowing workers to “continue to work while recovering from work-related injuries or illnesses.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cole&nbsp;— who was born with only one hand and uses a prosthetic arm — has experienced the push back to work soon after an injury. Once during a shift, she injured her hand and went to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-first-aid-clinics-push-injured-employees-to-keep-working/\">AmCare</a>, Amazon’s in-house first aid clinic. “I was in a lot of pain,” Cole said. After wrapping her hand up, management told her to return back to work. “I said, ‘Listen, I have one hand. I live with this hand. And it’s injured right now. I’m not going back on the floor to injure it further.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The SOC report also found that there were more than 38,300 recordable injuries at Amazon facilities in 2023 alone, with 94 percent of the injuries identified by SOC as serious — meaning employees were either placed on lighter work duties or forced to miss work entirely. It also found that Amazon’s serious injury rate was more than twice as high as non-Amazon warehouses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Injuries become much more common during events like Prime Day and other big sales, too. The week of Prime Day 2023, there were 1,066 recorded cases of serious injuries at Amazon facilities, according to the SOC report — the highest number of injuries recorded all year, and far above the average of 691 injuries per week. Those cases represented a 48 percent increase in injuries from the previous week, and were followed closely by cases recorded on Cyber Monday (1,015 serious injuries) and Prime Big Deals Day (898 serious injuries).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In an email to Vox, Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel called the SOC report “misleading,” emphasizing that the switch-up between rates and raw numbers builds a “false narrative” and that the report should start at 2019, which would indicate a reduction to injuries by 28 percent.  “The fact is, there are far more people working in the buildings during these times and more total hours worked by those employees,” she wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee launched a yearlong investigation into Amazon’s labor practices. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/16/bernie-sanders-amazon-investigation/\">the Washington Post</a>, an interim report, led by committee chair <a href=\"https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/senator-bernie-sanders-help-committee-dangers-injuries-warehouses-amazon-prime-day-518713/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/senator-bernie-sanders-help-committee-dangers-injuries-warehouses-amazon-prime-day-518713/\">Senator Bernie Sanders</a>, found that nearly 45 out of 100 employees were injured during the week of Prime Day in 2019, and injuries peaked again during other holiday sales.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon, which had cooperated with the investigation, pushed back on Senator Sanders’s preliminary report via an email to Vox, saying it “ignores our progress and paints a one-sided, false narrative using only a fraction of the information we’ve provided.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The HELP Committee is not the only federal investigation that’s found Amazon to have troubling safety issues. From January 2023 to August 2023, <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region2/08032023\">several investigations</a> from OSHA found that Amazon <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/01182023\">exposed</a> workers to well-known <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/02232023-0\">ergonomic hazards</a>, like lifting packages up and down constantly, handling heavy items, and bending and twisting in awkward positions, all for hours at a time. “Amazon’s operating methods are creating hazardous work conditions and processes, leading to serious worker injuries,&#8221; said assistant secretary for occupational safety and health Doug Parker in a February 2023 <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/02012023\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">OSHA also found that when Amazon workers were injured, the company failed to provide treatment. In one news release from OSHA, the agency <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/04282023\">wrote</a> that “at least six employees with head injuries and four with back injuries did not receive timely, necessary medical care.” Amazon disagreed with OSHA’s characterizations and appealed them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Amazon Labor Union (ALU), which has won only one election with the workers of Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, has made safe working conditions one of its primary goals in a first contract. However, Amazon still refuses to recognize the union and, in turn, has made no movement on its side to bargaining a collective agreement. There’s also been <a href=\"https://labornotes.org/2023/07/reform-caucus-rises-sues-elections-amazon-labor-union\">conflict</a> within the union on how to best bring Amazon to the bargaining table and organize other warehouses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in June, the ALU <a href=\"https://labornotes.org/2024/06/amazon-workers-affiliate-teamsters-next-electing-top-officers\">voted to affiliate</a> with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — a powerful union with resources that could help change the tides for the workers of JFK8 and other Amazon facilities.

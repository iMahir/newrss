Former President <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380818/trump-rally-puerto-rico-tony-hinchcliffe-groypers\">Donald Trump and his supporters</a> have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-enemies-from-within-5c4a34776469a55e71d3ba4d4e68cf62\">attacked opponents in increasingly vicious terms</a>. There have already been incidents of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381520/2024-election-violence-trump-loses-extremism-civil-war\">political violence</a> — including multiple alleged arsons targeting ballot boxes and a terrorism arrest in Arizona after the windows were repeatedly shot out of a Democratic Party office — and polling suggests voters are worried about more post-election violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are serious stakes to the election, including democracy issues and abortion rights — but the intense, vitriolic polarization we’re experiencing now is largely based on our <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/10/27/snf-agora-poll-september-2024/\">perceptions about each other</a>, according to research from Johns Hopkins University professor Lilliana Mason. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mason, a professor of political science at the university’s Stavros Niarchos Foundation’s Agora Institute, says this type of division, which she calls affective polarization, doesn’t require us to have wildly different policy disagreements to hate each other. Instead, she told Vox, “it’s based on feelings,” as well as misunderstandings about which groups, and what kind of people, are on the other side.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Through a series of surveys and experiments over four years, Mason and Nathan Kalmoe, a political communication professor at Louisiana State University, studied the origins of extreme partisanship among ordinary Americans for the 2022 book, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo163195227.html\"><em>Radical American Partisanship</em></a><em>. </em>Mason and Kalmoe found that around 40 percent of Americans surveyed were willing to use dehumanizing language about the other party — a metric she says can be a precursor to even more serious political violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King spoke with Mason to understand how the American electorate got to this point and how we can get back to a more civil politics<em>.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<iframe frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP7443558362\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You&#8217;ve written two books that seem relevant here. Tell me the names of your books.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first book is <em><a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo27527354.html\">Uncivil Agreement How Politics Became Our Identity</a></em>. And the second book is <em>Radical American Partisanship</em>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two main parties in the United States, Democrats and Republicans; as a researcher, what do you know about what we think about the other group that is incorrect?</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everything! We all overestimate the extent to which people in the other party are extreme in terms of the policies. We also overestimate the degree to which the party is made up of groups that we kind of think of as like the stereotypical groups associated with the party. So, Republicans think that the Democratic Party is majority Black. It&#8217;s not. Democrats think that the Republican Party is majority wealthy people who make over $250,000 a year. It&#8217;s actually like 2 percent. And so we tend to assume that the stereotypical group that we think of when we think of that party, we tend to assume that that makes up the whole party and we&#8217;re all wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And in fact, political scientists and sociologists have done experiments where we correct people&#8217;s misperceptions and it actually makes them hate the other party less because they hadn&#8217;t realized that the party wasn&#8217;t made up of maybe people they didn&#8217;t like or wasn&#8217;t made up of people who are really extreme in their policy preferences. We are overestimating the extent to which the other party is made up of people that we assume we would really dislike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How do you define partisanship?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The classic understanding of partisanship is just which party you vote for based on your assessments of politics. But more recently, we&#8217;re starting to think of partisanship as a social identity, meaning it&#8217;s a psychological connection to the other people that are in the party and feeling like what happens to our party impacts our own sense of self-esteem and self-worth. The traditional view is thinking of choosing who to vote for like a banker chooses an investment. And really what we&#8217;re doing today is more like sports fans cheering on our team.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s partisanship. What is polarization?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So polarization can also be two things. It can be more than that, actually. But the classic understanding of polarization was that we are disagreeing about issues. So Democrats are really liberal and Republicans are really conservative on all of these different issues. But increasingly, what we&#8217;re finding now is that our polarization is partly about that, but it&#8217;s also about how we feel about each other. So Democrats and Republicans really don&#8217;t like one another, and we call that affective polarization. So it&#8217;s based on feelings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And really the important thing about understanding the effect of polarization is that it doesn&#8217;t require us to disagree in order to hate each other. We use theories from social psychology about why any groups don&#8217;t like each other to explain why Democrats and Republicans don&#8217;t like each other, and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily require that they disagree on, you know, marginal tax rates.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Does the data really say that people of different parties dislike or even hate each other?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah. In fact, in my first book, I asked people how would they feel if their child married somebody from the other party or how would they feel if someone from the other party moved in next door to them. And those types of questions — people really don&#8217;t like the idea of their child marrying somebody from the other party. They don&#8217;t really want to have social contact with people from the other party. And that type of feeling isn&#8217;t entirely rooted in disagreement. So people who have really moderate policy preferences can still really dislike people from the other party. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the second book, we started to ask more extreme questions. So we asked, “Do you think people on the other party are not just wrong for politics, they&#8217;re downright evil?” Or even, “Do they deserve to be treated like humans because they behave like animals?” So a dehumanization question, which is kind of the most extreme of the questions, and we are finding that about 50 percent of partisans are willing to say that their partisan opponents are evil, and between 20 to 40 percent are even willing to dehumanize people in the other party. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We started asking this question in 2017. The reason we asked the question is because this is the type of thing that we measure in other countries, if there&#8217;s a mass violence event. This type of attitude exists beforehand. It doesn&#8217;t always lead to violence, but whenever there is mass violence, you have to have these dehumanizing and vilifying attitudes present beforehand, because otherwise it&#8217;s really hard to harm another human being and still feel like a morally good person. And really, the only way to do that is to think that they are a threat to you, that they&#8217;re evil and that they&#8217;re subhuman. And so when we see genocide in other places, for example, these attitudes exist before before the violence occurs. And what we wanted to know was, did these attitudes exist in the American electorate? And no one had really asked that question before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tell me about what kind of polarization we&#8217;re seeing these days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what we&#8217;re seeing is mostly affective polarization. So it&#8217;s basically the type of polarization that means that we don&#8217;t like one another. And if you think about human groups throughout all of human history, there are plenty of reasons that two human groups don&#8217;t like one another. Humans hate one another for all kinds of reasons. And it&#8217;s very much that type of visceral dislike and distrust that any two social groups can have against each other that we&#8217;re observing in the Democratic and Republican parties right now.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disagreeing on policy seems to me quite normal; thinking that a person in the other party is evil seems a bit less normal to me. What is this rooted in, this affective polarization? Where did this come from? </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of this animosity between Democrats and Republicans has come out of a trend over the last many decades of not only our partisan identities being the thing that we fight over during elections, but also all of these other identities. And since the 1960s, our racial identities, our religious identities, all other cultural, even geographic identities have moved into alignment with our party identities. So what happens is that when we&#8217;re thinking about politics and who wins and who loses, we&#8217;re not just thinking my party wins or my party loses. We&#8217;re thinking, “If my party wins, then my racial group wins and my religious group wins.” And all of these other parts of my identity are winners and it feels really good and vice versa. “If my party loses, all these different parts of my identity are also losing,” and that feels really, really terrible. So the stakes get a lot higher when we think about our electoral choices and who is in control of our government as reflective of who we are as a human being. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Noel King</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would like to not live in this version of America. There&#8217;s an election to cover. How do we, in all seriousness, fix this problem?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Lilliana Mason</h4>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We&#8217;ve tried a number of interventions in our surveys, so we&#8217;ll embed an experiment in the survey to try to see if we can make people less violent or less approving of violence. And one thing that we found that basically always works is to have them read a quote from a leader. So in our experiments, we use Biden or Trump, a quote that just says something like, “violence is never acceptable. That&#8217;s just not how we do things here.” And people who read that quote are less likely to approve of political violence than those who&#8217;ve read nothing in a control condition. So simply reading a sentence from a leader can get people to kind of step back from this aggressive stance. We need to get something back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the things I think that the last few years have done — and I think Trump as a candidate in particular — is really break the norms of what&#8217;s acceptable behavior in American politics and in American society. The idea that we can use racist and misogynistic language against our fellow citizens, the idea that we can tell lies and not be punished for it; you know, a lot of the things that our politics is characterized by right now are things that 20 years ago would not have ever been allowed on the political stage. And there are plenty of Democrats and Republicans that just remember a different time. And what worries me is that young people don&#8217;t. So we&#8217;re increasingly in this world where young people don&#8217;t know that it was nicer, more diplomatic, and so I hope that we can pay attention to the norms that have been broken because the only way to enforce a norm is for people around you, when you break the norm, to tell you to stop it. Laws are enforced with law enforcement. Norms are enforced with us, with people. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the reason that shame is such a powerful emotion, is because it&#8217;s the way that we enforce norms. To the extent that together as a community, if we see somebody behaving in a way that we think of as unacceptable, that we as a community can say to them, “That&#8217;s beyond the pale, that&#8217;s that you just crossed the line. I&#8217;m not accepting that kind of behavior.” And we haven&#8217;t been doing that to each other in many years, I think. But to the extent that we can kind of remember what it&#8217;s like to be normal people and treat each other like we&#8217;re part of a community together and that we&#8217;re part of the same society, that&#8217;s something that we all can do on our own.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

She rolls her eyes. “Guilty guilty guilty on all these charges,” she says. “The New York Post lady was there, just looking so smug.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stewart, now 83, pauses reflectively. “She’s dead now,” she adds. “Thank goodness. Nobody has to put up with all that crap that she was writing all the time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The past few years have seen a small boom in documentaries about the many wronged women of the ’90s and 2000s: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22276585/framing-britney-spears-us-weekly-perez-hilton-daniel-ramos\"><em>Framing Britney Spears</em></a>; <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23585077/pamela-a-love-story-netflix-anderson-documentary\"><em>Pamela, a Love Story</em></a>; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/television/lorena-bobbitt-documentary-jordan-peele.html\"><em>Lorena</em></a>. <em>Martha, </em>directed by R.J. Cutler, is a different animal. It is not an apologia for its subject. It does not suggest that the public and its obsession with her foibles and legal troubles ruined her life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Martha Stewart does not admit to ever having her life ruined. Martha Stewart disdains self-pity. Martha Stewart refuses to be a victim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Some people revel in this self-pity, etc., etc.,” Stewart remarks to the camera, when asked to reminisce about her divorce from the husband she describes as “a piece of shit” for having cheated. (Her own affairs, she explains to the camera <a href=\"https://x.com/netflix/status/1844415230631346531\">in a now-viral clip</a>, don’t count because her husband didn’t know about them.) She herself is different, she continues: “I just don’t.” She wouldn’t know how to wallow.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@philstarlife/video/7424823134383131922\" data-video-id=\"7424823134383131922\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@philstarlife\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@philstarlife?refer=embed\">@philstarlife</a> <p>American businesswoman Martha Stewart revealed that she cheated on her now ex-husband Andy in the trailer of Netflix documentary Martha.

She is exactly the mean perfectionist control freak all the tabloids used to claim she was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>What a perfectionist, what a control freak, what a mean lady.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cutler, who conducts the documentary&#8217;s single talking-head interview with its subject, interlaces it with plenty of archival footage. (In a neat touch, all the other interviews for the film are audio-only, so that Stewart’s face is the only one&nbsp;we see in the present.) As the interview evolves, Cutler seems to revel in needling Stewart. He repeatedly asks her the kinds of questions she clearly finds annoying —&nbsp;personal questions on subjects that deal with moments where she perceives herself as having failed. He pauses mid-interview, leaving her to sigh heavily as she waits for the questions to keep going. He brings out her Martha-ness, her irritability, her impatience, her dislike at being at someone else’s mercy, under circumstances that are not precisely under her control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those are all the things that used to make people hate Martha Stewart. What a perfectionist, what a control freak, what a mean lady. In <em>Martha</em>, they become the thing that makes her the most likable. They are human flaws, messy and endearing, in a woman who has worked for decades to try to make herself appear perfect.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stewart traces her perfectionism back to her upbringing. She was born in 1941, just on the far side of the Depression, to parents who couldn’t afford to feed their family. They set their six children to work tending the garden and beat them when they made mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her father was exacting, an alcoholic whose fine tweed suits and leather shoes had to be pressed and shined just so. Stewart’s face lights up when she says she was the only one he trusted to tend to them, but she allows that the man himself was “mean, mean, mean.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She got out of that house every chance she saw: first by modeling as a teenager, then by going to college, then by marrying publishing executive Andrew Stewart. Characteristically, once she was married, Stewart tackled every ambition with ferocious discipline and took each failure as a personal crisis. She spent years as a successful stockbroker until one of her recommendations tanked, at which point she quit finance and moved her family to the farthest suburbs of Connecticut so she could remodel a house that was falling apart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eventually, Stewart parlayed her highly refined skills at homemaking and party-hosting into a career as an upscale caterer for her well-heeled friends. From catering came the lifestyle guide <em>Entertaining</em> in 1982, and then more books, and then a magazine, and then a TV show. By the 1990s, Stewart was the center of a multimedia empire, the embodiment of a massively lucrative brand that was all centered on a lifestyle so elevated that no one besides Stewart herself could ever possibly achieve it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Martha Stewart thought snow peas individually stuffed with cream cheese made an elegant dinner party side. Martha Stewart modeled her fruit bowl displays off the paintings of the Italian Renaissance. Martha Stewart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/29/meet-the-cleanfluencers-the-online-gurus-who-like-things-nice-and-tidy\">like the cleaning influencers of today</a>, wanted to store her laundry detergent in an aesthetically pleasing container.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All this could be a lot to swallow, both when Stewart was coming up and now. It&#8217;s easy to roll your eyes and wonder who has the time and energy to think that much about their laundry room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p> “She got under men’s hair,” Paglia says, “this idea that you could be a homemaking expert who’s a bitch.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Martha Stewart is a lot more interesting, it turns out, when she is presented to you not as someone you should aspire to be like but as a very strange and specific psychological case study.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cutler presents Stewart to the audience as a portrait of a perfectionist scrabbling madly for something, anything, to mold in her own image, and then lashing out furiously at anyone she perceives as getting in her way. You don’t necessarily want to be her, but there’s something so compelling about watching her twist herself around to become this impossible-to-please empress of all she beholds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One piece of archival footage shows Stewart lambasting an employee behind the scenes for using a paring knife to cut an orange for Easter brunch. “Well, isn’t that a stupid knife?” Stewart says impatiently, her tone sharp enough to cut the orange with voice alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In voiceover, the critic Camille Paglia explains the phenomenon that we’re watching. “She got under men’s hair,” Paglia says, “this idea that you could be a homemaking expert who’s a bitch.”</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-528812654.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.172323571838,100,79.655352856324\" alt=\"Martha Stewart, beaming, carries a tray of brioche sandwiches through the glass doors of the Stock Exchange.

She was a woman with power <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22350286/2000s-pop-culture-misogyny-britney-spears-janet-jackson-whitney-houston-monica-lewinsky\">in a moment misogynistic enough to humiliate powerful woman</a>; a woman who made art and business out of home life in a moment <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/kwmx72/that_damn_donna_reed_discussion/\">just feminist enough to understand a focus on the home as regressive</a>; a woman viciously committed to perfection in a moment that craved <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2022/2/10/22926619/introducing-just-like-us-the-tabloids-that-changed-america\">tabloid-friendly mess</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was the fundamental paradox of Martha Stewart. On the one hand, she built her brand on presenting a vision of the home so exactingly idealized it was impossible for anyone to live up to it. She romanticized the domestic sphere that women had spent so many decades trying to escape. She was regressive, surely, a ’50s throwback who deserved to be mocked and ignored.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Stewart used all that domestic acumen to make herself the first female self-made billionaire in the world. She took homemaking seriously as an aesthetic pursuit when the rest of the culture was minimizing it as unimportant women’s work. She had power and she had swagger and she knew it, and it put a target on her back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/02/21/martha-stewart-profile-joan-didion\">When Joan Didion wrote about Martha Stewart</a> for the New Yorker in 2000, she noted that there was something telling about the way all those Martha Stewart parody books that flourished in the era were so bizarrely sexualized. The parodies, Didion wrote, were “too broad, misogynistic in a cartoon way (stripping Martha to her underwear has been a reliable motif of countless on-line parodies), curiously nervous (‘Keeping Razors Circumcision-Sharp’ is one feature in ‘Martha Stuart’s Better Than You at Entertaining’), oddly uncomfortable, a little too intent on marginalizing a rather considerable number of women by making light of their situations and their aspirations.” There was a vengeful, humiliating edge to all of it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that power, however, took quite a beating when Stewart was arrested for insider trading in 2002.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2004, Stewart was found “guilty guilty guilty,” not of fraud but of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal investigators. She allegedly took an illicit tip from her stockbroker, perhaps in the same spirit with which she decided that her affairs didn’t count as infidelity. (The chief prosecutor against her was James Comey, of whom Stewart says in <em>Martha</em>, “Those prosecutors should have been put in a Cuisinart and turned on high.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Martha</em>, Cutler lingers in detail on Stewart’s trial and her time in jail. In his hands, the media circus around her conviction becomes a portrait of what it is like for a woman who built her whole identity on her sense of control to find herself rendered completely powerless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In archival footage of the period between her trial and her sentencing, Stewart explained her preparations for her sentencing to an interviewer in a chipper Snow White voice, as though explaining how to fold a fitted sheet. “Well, you know, you go to the dentist. You go to the gynecologist,” she said. “You just make sure you’re in as best shape as you possibly can to let your body and your mind take whatever comes!” In the diary she kept in prison, she instructed herself sternly to learn something new every day: the control freak doing her best to reap something of value from even the worst of experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Martha_n_00_22_37_12.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"A blonde woman in her 30s stands in the center of a cluttered wood-paneled kitchen.

The scandal that came with it, though, forced her to rebuild everything. She lost control of her fiercely guarded brand, lost her TV show, and lost what she estimates to be about $1 billion. Her first project after her release, the flashy NBC talk show <em>The Martha Stewart Show</em>, she dismisses now as a failure despite its seven seasons on the air: She wasn’t, she says, able to control it the way she wanted to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eventually, Stewart managed to rebuild herself as a sort of ironic celebrity. She’s built a clever brand for herself now as the nice grandma who knows everything there is to know about rose gardens but also has done hard time and <a href=\"https://people.com/food/martha-stewart-snoop-dogg-friendship-timeline/\">is friends with Snoop</a>. (Endearingly, their relationship appears to be both authentic and organic —&nbsp;they were seated next to each other on Comedy Central’s roast of Justin Bieber and apparently hit it off.) She’s not a billionaire anymore, but she’s made herself relevant to the public again while apparently refusing to change her own behavior or personality in any meaningful way. She still wants power, and she is still grabbing for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Stewart managed to rebuild herself as a sort of ironic celebrity. </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Didion’s essay, she suggests, in a passage Stewart describes as “very insightful” in the documentary, that it’s Stewart’s power that is attractive to her audience, not her unreachable exactitude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The dreams and the fears into which Martha Stewart taps are not of ‘feminine’ domesticity,” Didion writes, “but of female power, of the woman who sits down at the table with the men and, still in her apron, walks away with the chips.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What <em>Martha</em> suggests is different from Didion’s idea. It offers us a Martha Stewart who is attractive not because she played and won, but because she played so hard each and every time,&nbsp;even when she lost.

Each removed piece makes the base more wobbly; each block put back on top makes it more unbalanced until it eventually topples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This, I’d argue, is basically how we should be thinking about the stakes of the 2024 election for American democracy: an already-rickety tower of state would be at risk of falling in on itself entirely, with catastrophic results for those who live under its shelter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We live in an era where democracies <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/magazine/democracy-elections-game.html\">once considered “consolidated”</a> — meaning so secure that that they couldn’t collapse into authoritarianism —&nbsp;have started to buckle and even collapse. As recently as 2010, Hungary was considered one of the post-Communist world’s great democratic success stories; today, it is now understood to be the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump\">European Union’s only autocracy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hungarian democracy did not die of natural causes. It was murdered by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who seized control of nearly every aspect of state power and twisted it into tools. Not just the obvious things, like Hungary’s public broadcaster and judiciary, but other areas —&nbsp;like its tax administration and the offices regulating higher education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bit by bit, piece by piece, Orbán —&nbsp;whose support Trump regularly touts — subtly took a democracy and replaced it with something different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this, he was a trailblazer, creating a blueprint of going from democracy to autocracy that has been followed, to varying degrees of success, by leaders in countries as diverse as Brazil, India, Israel, and Poland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The central question of this election is whether voters will grant former President Donald Trump the power to resume his efforts to place the United States on this list.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A predictable crisis</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s statements and policy documents like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">Project 2025</a> amount to a systematic Orbánist program for turning the government into an extension of his personal will. Their most fundamental proposal, a revival of Trump’s never-implemented Schedule F order, would permit the firing of <a href=\"https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/what-mandate-for-leadership-says\">upward of 50,000 career civil servants</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the kind of thing that’s easy to dismiss as so much insider Washington drama, but the stakes are sky-high: Beyond hindering the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">basic functions of government</a> that millions of people depend on, politicizing the civil service is a critical step toward consolidating the power needed to build an autocracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Democratic collapse nowadays isn’t a matter of abolishing elections and declaring oneself dictator, but rather stealthily hollowing out a democratic system so it’s harder and harder for the opposition to win. This strategy requires full control over the state and the bureaucracy: That means having the right staff in the right places who can use their power to erode democracy’s core functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and his team have plans to do just that. They have discussed everything from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">prosecuting local election administrators</a> to using regulatory authority for “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election\">retribution” against corporations that cross him</a> — all steps that would depend, crucially, on replacing nonpartisan civil servants who would resist such orders with loyalists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How far Washington would travel down the Budapest road is very hard to say. It would depend on a variety of factors that are difficult to foresee, ranging from the competence of Trump’s chosen appointees to the degree of resistance he faces from the judiciary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even if there’s a reasonable chance that the worst case might be avoided, the danger remains serious. With specific plans for autocratization already in place, and a recent grant of criminal immunity from the Supreme Court, there’s every reason to treat a second Trump term as an extinction-level threat to American democracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This assault on democracy didn’t come out of nowhere. My recent book on democracy, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94\"><em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>, argues that rising political antagonism in America is a perennial outgrowth of its defining conflict over race and national identity — with the current round of conflict sparked largely (albeit not entirely) by backlash to Barack Obama’s 2008 victory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sense among some Americans that they were losing their country to something new, defined by a more diverse population and a more equal social hierarchy, made the idea of a strongman who could roll back change quite appealing to a significant chunk of the American population. These voters had come to constitute a plurality, if not an outright majority, of Republican primary voters — creating the conditions for Trump to rise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2016, Trump seized on this reactionary discontent and married it to a whole-scale agenda of backlash against the current political order. His policies and political rhetoric — on everything from immigration to gender to trade to foreign policy — were calculated to deepen America’s divisions and mainstream ideas once consigned to the fringes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As potent as this politics proved, it’s likely Trump never really expected it to take him all the way to the White House. He had done very little transition work — nothing like Project 2025 existed. His team was scrambling from the second the contest was called in their favor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president himself was unfamiliar with how American democracy worked and largely uninterested in learning the details. So in his first term, he haphazardly yanked at its foundations — flagrantly assailing basic democratic norms of conduct and installing an incoherent policy process that made it very difficult to rely on any expectation of neutral, stable governance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The results? Rising tensions between citizens and declining faith in government institutions, in part because government had become legitimately less reliable. There were several near-miss crises — people forget how close we were to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/18/16733560/north-korea-war\">nuclear war with North Korea in 2017</a> — and then two very real ones: a <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr570631\">botched pandemic response</a> and a democracy-shaking riot at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When critics warn about Trump&#8217;s threat, the constant rejoinder is that democracy already survived four years of Trump in office. In fact, democracy did not emerge unscathed from Trump&#8217;s first term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, perhaps more importantly, there are many reasons to believe that a second Trump term would be far more dangerous than the first&nbsp;— starting with the degree of authoritarian preparation that’s already gone into it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A toddler grown into a saboteur</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the first Trump term was akin to the random destruction of a toddler, a second would be more like the deliberate demolition of a saboteur. With the benefit of four years of governing experience and four more years of planning, Trump and his team have concluded that the problem with their first game of Jenga was that they simply did not remove enough of democracy’s blocks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do not think that, over the course of four more years, Trump could use these plans to successfully build a fascist state that would jail critics and install himself in power indefinitely. This is in part because of the size and complexity of the American state, and in part because that’s not really the kind of authoritarianism that works in democracies nowadays.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But over the course of those years, he could yank out so many of American democracy’s basic building blocks that the system really could be pushed to the brink of collapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He could quite plausibly create a political environment that tilts electoral contests (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377729/kamala-harris-supreme-court-electoral-college-senate-constitution\">even more</a>) in the GOP’s favor —&nbsp;accelerating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/magazine/democracy-elections-game.html\">dangerous and destabilizing partisan conflict</a> over the very rules of the political game. He could compromise media outlets, especially <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-what-a-second-trump-term-could-mean-for-media-and-technology-policies/\">government</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/donald-trump-weaponizes-non-endorsements-from-the-washington-post-and-los-angeles-times-1.7092891\">billionaire-owned ones</a>. He could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights\">wreck the government’s ability to perform basic tasks</a>, ranging from managing pollution to safely storing nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The damage could be immediately catastrophic in ways we saw in the first term: political violence and mass death (from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23677654/trump-foreign-policy-revisionist-history-dove-anti-imperial\">war</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health\">crank-controlled public health system</a>, or any number of other things). But even if the very worst-case scenarios were avoided, the structural damage to the tower of American democracy could be long-lasting&nbsp;— undoing the complex and mutually supporting processes that work to keep democracy alive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When government reliably and neutrally delivers core services, people tend to have more faith in all of its functions — including running fair elections. When they have more faith in elections, they tend to trust them more as a means of resolving major policy disagreements. When they trust election outcomes, they tend to grant a baseline level of legitimacy to the government that follows, making it easier for it to reliably and neutrally deliver core services. The steady house of democracy is built by the gluing together of these functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">John Rawls, the greatest political philosopher of the 20th century, described this as a long process of trust-building that starts with a basic faith in democratic ideals. When people of all political stripes basically believe in the system, he argues, they start acting inside its rules — giving others more confidence that they too can follow the rules without being cheated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Gradually, as the success of political cooperation continues, citizens gain increasing trust and confidence in one another,” Rawls writes in his book <em>Political Liberalism</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A second Trump term risks replacing Rawls’s virtuous cycle with a vicious one. As Trump degrades government, following the Orbánist playbook with at least some success, much of the public would justifiably lose their already-battered faith in the American system of government. And whether it could long survive such a disaster is anyone’s guess.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Genser was unanimous, and mailed-in Pennsylvania ballots won’t be tossed out. | Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Friday evening, the Supreme Court ruled it would leave in place a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that made it marginally easier for certain voters in the state to cast a ballot. The Republican Party had asked the justices to block that decision; doing so would have likely <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">disenfranchised thousands of voters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that won’t happen. The Court’s decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a408_3f14.pdf\"><em>Republican National Committee v. Genser</em></a> was unanimous, although Justice Samuel Alito wrote a statement indicating that he and Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch are only ruling against the GOP on narrow procedural grounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem at the heart of the case was that Pennsylvania law is unusually strict regarding how mailed ballots must be returned by voters. They must be stuffed in two envelopes, and if the inner envelope is missing, the ballot is void. The state supreme court decision at issue in <em>Genser</em> ruled that voters who cast such a voided ballot can still vote if they show up on Election Day and cast a provisional ballot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The case was closely watched because the presidential race is <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/pennsylvania/\">expected to be tight</a>, and it is likely that the decision will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">impact several thousand voters</a>. Also, Democrats <a href=\"https://x.com/iapolls2022/status/1852210212880429503?s=61&amp;t=TQlk4x44ENcfSu3Y1ke6ew\">tend to vote by mail more often than Republicans</a>. So, if the presidential election is indeed very close and it all comes down to Pennsylvania — and if mail-in ballots do favor Democrats this year — a victory for the GOP in <em>Genser</em> could have flipped the result and put Donald Trump back in the White House.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A win for the GOP could have scrambled future elections, too. The GOP’s legal arguments relied on a radical theory known as the “independent state legislature doctrine,” which the Supreme Court has rejected many times, but which all but one of the Court’s Republican members have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">expressed sympathy toward in the past</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you want a full explainer on this doctrine, you can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/380170/supreme-court-pennsylvania-election-republican-genser\">read my preview of the <em>Genser </em>case here</a>. But the important thing to know about it is that it takes power over elections away from state courts and places it in the hands of state legislatures, in a manner that could completely scramble how the US currently holds elections. A brief filed by an array of admirals, generals, and service secretaries warned that the doctrine “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/243970/20221026122043996_Ret.%20Admirals%20AmicusBrief%20-%20Moore%20v.%20Harper.pdf\">undermines election integrity and exacerbates both domestic and foreign threats to national security</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the Court was asked to play with some very dangerous magic in <em>Genser</em> and, to their credit, all nine justices refused this request.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The decision should also give a small degree of comfort to Democrats, who’ve had good reason to wonder if this Court — which has a 6-3 Republican majority — can be trusted to referee a close election after its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship\"><em>Trump v. United States </em>immunity decision</a>, in which the justices declared Trump was allowed to commit many crimes as president.

Lopez believes that her work spurred meaningful policing reforms, both in Ferguson and nationwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as soon as Trump took over, things started changing fast. Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-rolls-back-civil-rights-efforts-federal-government\">sharply restricted the use of consent decrees</a> — the legal tool Lopez and her colleagues used to force change in Ferguson. Lopez, who had left the Justice Department in 2017 to take a teaching job at Georgetown, could only watch from the outside as the work she took pride in was ground to a halt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, she is sounding the alarm: Whatever the dangers of a first Trump term were, the risks of a second dwarf them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If Trump is elected, I would like to look back five years from now and say, ‘Oh, we were really alarmist,’” she told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“But I do worry that it’s actually going to be far worse.”</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many, many people have warned that Trump is a threat to American democracy. Many others have argued that these warnings are politically inert, that focusing on abstract concepts like “democracy” and “the rule of law” removes political debate from the concrete concerns people want addressed by government. Do people struggling to pay the bills have time to care about such matters of principle?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet in reality, the two things are inseparable. Trump’s plan to turn the government into a tool of his own personal will would have extraordinary consequences for Americans’ everyday lives. It would disrupt, or potentially even devastate, core functions of government that we’ve long taken for granted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division is a case in point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Founded by the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the Division is tasked with enforcing federal law regarding anti-discrimination and civil equality. This is a mammoth responsibility, covering areas of law that shape the fundamental experience of American democracy. Its attorneys launch hate crimes prosecutions, investigate discrimination in employment and housing, and sue states when their voting rules run afoul of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Trump returns to power, the department could easily be turned from a tool for protecting civil rights into a means of undoing them. Trump and his allies have laid out fairly specific plans for doing just that — plans that, if enacted, would mean a far more radical and methodical transformation of the federal rights civil apparatus than what we saw in Trump’s shambolic first term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The department’s Voting Section&nbsp;— which played a critical role in defending the integrity of the 2020 election —&nbsp;would be twisted,&nbsp;its attorneys replaced with cronies working to validate Trump’s lies and shield Republican-controlled states from federal scrutiny. Its anti-discrimination litigators would be tasked with investigating “anti-white” discrimination, effectively turning the Civil Rights Act on the minority citizens it was written to defend. And Lopez’s former colleagues working on policing would not only let abusive cops skate, but potentially even investigate local law enforcement Trump believed weren’t aggressive enough toward alleged criminals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can see here that a second Trump administration would likely mean the inversion of the traditional purpose of federal civil rights law. Its guardrails against authoritarianism, discrimination, and abuse of power will be twisted toward advancing them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it’s just one of many ways in which Trump’s pursuit of power at any cost would have tangible and direct consequences for ordinary Americans’ lives.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump’s plan to invert the Civil Rights Division, explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has vowed to use a second term to enact “retribution” against his enemies.&nbsp; The Justice Department, and specifically the current Civil Rights Division staff, are at the top of the list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the end of Trump’s first term, he issued an executive order creating a new classification for civil service jobs — called Schedule F — that would have allowed him <a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/\">to fire as many as 50,000 civil servants</a> and replace them with handpicked allies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Trump left office before his team could implement Schedule F, he has promised to reissue the order “<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-president-trumps-plan-to-dismantle-the-deep-state-and-return-power-to-the-american-people\">immediately</a>” upon returning to office. In anticipation, his allies have compiled <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2024/09/trumps-second-term-agenda-breaking-bureaucracy/399533/\">long lists</a> of civil servants they’d like to fire and loyalists they’d like to put in their place — preparations that have led one expert on federal administration to conclude that 50,000 firings is now “<a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/\">probably a floor rather than a ceiling.</a>”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s allies have focused on the Civil Rights Division as one of their chief targets for Schedule F and other power grabs. <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">Project 2025</a> — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/373485/project-2025-abortion-ban-trump-comstock-mifepristone\">widely seen</a> as the chief planning document for a Trump second term <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/project-2025.html\">despite the campaign’s disavowals</a> — has an explicit, detailed plan for taking it over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The document calls on the next Republican president to “reorganize and refocus” the division, aiming to make it into “the vanguard” of the administration’s crusade against “an unholy alliance of special interests, radicals in government, and the far Left.” It is one of three Department of Justice divisions singled out in the document’s call for “a vast expansion of the number of [political] appointees” overseeing and directing its conduct.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is all part of a broader plan for eroding the Justice Department’s traditional independence. While the attorney general is appointed by the president, their staff is given wide leeway to follow the law rather than the president’s dictates. Political personnel are strictly prohibited from interfering with specific investigations and cases. That’s why the current Justice Department could pursue <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/354842/hunter-biden-guilty-politics-david-weiss\">a case against Hunter Biden</a> with no fear of retaliation from his father.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and top deputies have declared their intent to change this.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/AP24214674291537.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Trump stands next to a man behind a podium\" title=\"Trump stands next to a man behind a podium\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Then-President Donald Trump listens as acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russel Vought speaks during an event on &quot;transparency in Federal guidance and enforcement&quot; in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, October 9, 2019. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\" data-portal-copyright=\"Evan Vucci/AP Photo\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The notion of an independent agency — whether that&#8217;s a flat-out independent agency like the FCC or an agency that has parts of it that view itself as independent, like the Department of Justice — we&#8217;re planting a flag and saying we reject that notion completely,” Russ Vought, a key second-term Trump planner, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1192432628\">said in a 2023 interview</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you put these three proposals together — seeding the Civil Rights Division with Trump political appointees, using Schedule F to replace career prosecutors with ideological allies, and ending department independence — the full picture becomes clear. If Trump has his way, a second term means a Civil Rights Division operating not as a (relatively) neutral division dedicated to enforcing civil rights law, but as a tool of the Trump agenda in all the areas it covers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is very threatening for government employees and obviously offensive to the notion of a neutral civil service. But what would this mean for most Americans in practice? What does it matter, really, if one bureaucrat is swapped out for another?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Election law politicized</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On November 9, 2020, Attorney General Bill Barr directed the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s allegations of fraud in the just-concluded presidential election.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The probe, announced after the election had been called for Joe Biden, was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/politics/william-barr-voting-irregularities/index.html\">controversial inside the Department</a>. It raised fears that Barr, no stranger to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/fact-check-echoing-trump-barr-misleads-voter-fraud-attack-expanded-n1240144\">conspiracy theories about voter fraud</a>, was trying to validate Trump’s claims of a stolen election.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet the professional probe, staffed by veteran investigators in the Civil Rights Division and elsewhere, found no evidence of mass fraud. On November 23, Barr told Trump the investigation was “<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf\">not panning out</a>.” The neutral, competent investigation gave the attorney general the ammunition he needed to stand up to the president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now imagine if things were different, if these career investigators had been Schedule F’d out, replaced instead with Trump-aligned attorneys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What if they had come to Barr and said that, actually, the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118\">bogus statistical arguments</a> that the election was stolen had merit? What would he have done then? How would reports of such findings, however bogus, influence the rest of the country — including Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an example that illustrates the importance of the Civil Rights Division.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The American system is unusual, in global terms, by granting most power over election administration to state and local authorities. While this system makes it hard for the federal government to rig elections, it makes it comparatively easy for state-level officials to cheat and discriminate (Jim Crow being the signature example).</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2138366391.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.749025795501,100,76.501948408999\" alt=\"Black and white photo of Black people in a long line outside a small rural building labeled “the sugar shack.”\" title=\"Black and white photo of Black people in a long line outside a small rural building labeled “the sugar shack.”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Following the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, people line up to vote — many for the first time — at the Sugar Shack store, Peachtree, Alabama, May 3, 1966. | National Archives of Fort Worth/PhotoQuest/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"National Archives of Fort Worth/PhotoQuest/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Civil Rights Division’s election work is one of the primary checks on such abuses. It protects the right to vote, enforcing laws like the Voting Rights Act. It also works to protect the sanctity of the results after elections, identifying and investigating allegations of illegal conduct by state and local administrators during the voting process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its main area of responsibility is allegations of discrimination, but it also regularly cooperates with other divisions in investigating other kinds of allegations like voting fraud (as happened in November 2020). While the Supreme Court has significantly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/28/23978226/supreme-court-trump-judges-voting-rights-act-arkansas-rose-secretary\">weakened the Voting Rights Act</a>, the Civil Rights Division is still able to bring cases that matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a second Trump term, this work could be turned on its head. Instead of trying to stop abuses at the state and local level, they might at best ignore them — and at worst try to force local officials to engage in them</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The chapter of Project 2025 on the Justice Department, authored by former Trump DOJ official Gene Hamilton, sketches out how this would work in detail. It argues that Kathy Boockvar, who was Pennsylvania’s secretary of state in 2020, “should have been (and still should be) investigated and prosecuted” under a post-Civil War law called the Klan Act — designed, as you might guess, to break the first incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Boockvar’s crime, per Hamilton, was issuing a legal interpretation designed to address the unprecedented increase in mail-in ballots during the pandemic. She issued guidance to counties that if a provisional mail-in ballot were “spoiled” — meaning rendered defective through, for example, damage during the shipping process — that voters would have an opportunity to correct them. Hamilton calls this a “conspiracy against rights,” a crime laid out in the Klan Act.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When I spoke to <a href=\"https://newsroom.lmu.edu/expert-profile/levitt-justin/\">Justin Levitt</a>, an election law expert and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division, he told me “it’s difficult to convey how crazy” such a case would be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Pennsylvania rule is, in his mind, a very reasonable interpretation of a constitutional obligation to avoid disenfranchising people over minor ballot issues. Even if Boockvar’s interpretation were dubious, nothing in the Klan Act suggests that the DOJ would be empowered to prosecute her for it (as the law simply doesn’t cover good-faith mistakes by elected officials trying to count more ballots).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I know an awful lot of federal prosecutors [and] I don’t know one who would bring this case,” he tells me.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1229479862.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.794243288056,100,78.411513423888\" alt=\"Protesters in an urban street carry signs that read “Count every vote.“\" title=\"Protesters in an urban street carry signs that read “Count every vote.“\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Demonstrators at a protest in front of the Philadelphia Convention Center during the 2020 presidential election, November 5, 2020. | Jennifer Huxta/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jennifer Huxta/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hence why Schedule F is so important. It’s almost certain that no experienced Justice Department prosecutor would bring this case, be they Democrat or Republican, because they would recognize it’s an absurd reading of the law. But if Trump can put the Division under his thumb, inserting cronies in oversight positions and firing a huge swath of the career staff, he can get people like Hamilton in a position to do what they want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://csde.washington.edu/affiliates/jake-grumbach/\">Jake Grumbach</a>, a political scientist who studies state-level voting laws, tells me that such politically motivated prosecutions of state officials is “the most dangerous thing” the Justice Department can do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even the threat of a civil rights investigation can scare state-level administrators into compliance with what the feds want. A weaponized Justice Department would mean these officials would feel significant pressure to twist their election administration systems into whatever contorted shape Trump was calling for at the moment — with potentially devastating consequences for electoral fairness.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Civil wrongs</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While voting rights law is an especially significant area of the Civil Rights Division’s work, it’s far from the only one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Civil Rights Division’s raison d’etre, the entire point of it being a separate and distinct component of the federal government, is to enforce the modern consensus that discrimination on the basis of identity is a pervasive and systematic problem that requires significant federal resources to address.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and his closest allies believe something more like the opposite, that federal civil rights law isn’t a solution to the problem of discrimination against minorities but an agent of discrimination against whites, men, and Christians. As such, they aim to flip the entire civil rights code on its head by&nbsp;using the Civil Rights Division as “the vanguard,” in Hamilton’s language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Anything [in law] can be weaponized,” says Kristy Parker, a former Civil Rights Division attorney who worked on policing. “That’s the problem.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the last Trump administration ended, top Trump aide Stephen Miller has worked with Hamilton at a new law firm — America First Legal — that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/politics/stephen-miller-america-first-legal.html\">focuses on “anti-white” discrimination</a> in employment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">America First filed a suit that successfully blocked a pandemic-era program to distribute financial aid to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/554361-federal-judge-says-biden-restaurant-fund-discriminated-against-white-male/\">minority- and woman-owned restaurants</a>. It sued the NFL over the Rooney Rule, which requires that teams interview at least one nonwhite candidate for high-level coaching vacancies, and it went after <a href=\"https://aflegal.org/litigation/fasorp-v-northwestern-university/\">Northwestern University</a> for allegedly prioritizing hires of minority and non-male faculty members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April, Axios’ Alex Thompson reported that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/04/01/trump-reverse-racism-civil-rights\">America First was “laying legal groundwork”</a> for a full-court press against “anti-white racism” in the event that Trump retakes control of the Civil Rights Division.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is something that Hamilton explicitly calls for in his Project 2025 chapter. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Civil Rights Division should spend its first year under the next Administration using the full force of federal prosecutorial resources to investigate and prosecute all state and local governments, institutions of higher education, corporations, and any other private employers who are engaged in discrimination in violation of constitutional and legal requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In reality, what Hamilton calls “discrimination” are actually efforts to address discrimination. There is overwhelming evidence that American society continues to <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/pager/files/annualreview_discrimination.pdf\">allocate resources unfairly on the basis of race</a>. Without affirmative steps to rectify this situation, entrenched inequalities like the racial gap will never disappear. What Trump and his team call “anti-white discrimination” are efforts to close gaps between groups, not open them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump team aims to invert federal oversight over local prosecutors in a similar fashion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2023, the campaign released a policy video in which <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-president-trump-announces-plan-to-end-crime-and-restore-law-and-order\">Trump vows to task the Civil Rights Division</a> with investigating “progressive prosecutors.” The basic argument is that these prosecutors, who see part of their mission as reducing the effects of mass incarceration on the Black community, are effectively engaging in race-based discrimination in favor of Black offenders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I will direct the DOJ to open civil rights investigations into radical left prosecutor’s offices, such as those in Chicago, LA, and San Francisco, to determine whether they have illegally engaged in race-based enforcement of the law,” Trump said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much like the attempt to prosecute Boockvar, trying to jail “progressive prosecutors” is not something the department’s professional staff would ordinarily contemplate doing. Even if Trump succeeded in replacing them via Schedule F, it’s hard to imagine any such investigation yielding charges that could stand up in court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the fact that such investigations would almost certainly fail to yield charges <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/185487/trump-maga-legal-war-slow-burn-authoritarianism\">does not make them harmless</a>. Even spurious investigations entail coercive measures — like subpoenas, searches, and audits&nbsp;— that can make it difficult for “progressive prosecutors” to do their jobs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also a political aspect to the threat, as many of Trump’s proposed targets are in elected posts. Elected officials are generally responsive to threats to their reelection chances,&nbsp;and being a target of a DOJ civil rights probe looks really bad to prospective voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/30/21281041/trump-justice-department-consent-decrees-jeff-sessions-police-violence-abuse\">Consent decrees</a>, the mechanism Lopez used to deal with bias in Ferguson, are one of the most powerful tools available to federal prosecutors for addressing bias in policing&nbsp;— and another target in a second Trump term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The process begins with a fact-finding investigation, uncovering evidence of systematic use-of-force problems and/or racial discrimination. The next stage involves lengthy negotiations with police departments that culminate in a tangible and enforceable set of reform benchmarks for the department. If the benchmarks aren’t being met to the Civil Rights Division’s satisfaction, its attorneys can haul cops in front of a judge and demand answers.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/AP119714094153.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.514716612012,100,76.970566775976\" alt=\"The back of a man who holds both hands up while police in riot gear approach him\" title=\"The back of a man who holds both hands up while police in riot gear approach him\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Police wearing riot gear and pointing guns approach a man with his hands raised in Ferguson, Missouri, August 11, 2014. | Jeff Roberson/AP Photo\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jeff Roberson/AP Photo\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The previous Trump administration limited their use going forward, but a second one might roll them back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Obama administration negotiated a historic number of consent decrees, but these are approaching their negotiated sunset dates. The Biden administration has tried to bargain with departments for extensions, as well as implement new ones, but police departments have been dragging their feet. Lopez believes they are anticipating the possibility of a Trump victory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Almost any jurisdiction that is currently negotiating a consent decree is going to wait to see what happens in November,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If this delaying tactic works and Trump’s Civil Rights Division vacates consent decrees across the board, Lopez warns of aggressive police being unleashed across the country. Trump’s wild rhetoric about policing — his recent statement that cops should be permitted “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/29/trump-violent-day-policing-crime-00181619\">one really violent day</a>” to combat crime — would further encourage abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The attorneys tasked with limiting police abuses would, in a second Trump administration, be responsible for encouraging them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A government “for the people” —&nbsp;for now</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As important as the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division is, it is far from the totality of government work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Justice Department has eight other litigating departments beyond the Civil Rights Division, where attorneys prosecute everyone from terrorists to tax cheats. It has five separate police agencies, including the FBI and US Marshals Service. It oversees all federal prisons and studies federal criminal convictions to see if any merit presidential pardons. It has nine separate grantmaking authorities, which provide funding for local authorities supporting everything from assisting sex trafficking victims to encouraging innovation in <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/topics/community-violence-intervention/resources\">local alternatives to policing</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2172231777.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A US flag on a pole flies in front of a federal building\" title=\"A US flag on a pole flies in front of a federal building\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A US flag flies in front of the Department of Justice (DOJ) headquarters building on September 15, 2024, in Washington, DC. | J.

There are also important agencies separate from the department structure, like the CIA and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of them perform critical work that contributes to the standard of living Americans have come to take for granted. This work depends on experienced, dedicated civil servants who know how to do the job, and all of it could be disrupted by Trump’s plans to give their jobs to partisan hacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every day, the EPA works to monitor and address pollution poisoning our rivers and drinkable water. The Bureau of Labor Statistics churns out job numbers and other reports that the Fed and other places depend on to make good economic policy. US Citizenship and Immigration Services helps keep families together, approving permanent residency and citizenship applications for foreign spouses of American citizens. The Department of Energy manages America’s nuclear weapons and power plants, making sure we don’t experience a Fukushima or Chernobyl-level disaster.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now imagine the people who know how to do this routine stuff are either thrown out of office or put under the thumbs of political commissars. That’s the danger here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump and his team have laid out their plans in detail, in official statements proposing a revival of Schedule F and semi-official documents like Project 2025. Even if you agree with many of their policy ideas, they need to be implemented competently and lawfully in order to work. Throughout history, in the United States and elsewhere, the imposition of political control on a civil service has been a recipe for incompetence and anti-democratic abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The United States has a democratic government:&nbsp;a deeply flawed one, but one by the people and for the people. Trump’s plan is to make it for him and his alone, and he has a decent chance of succeeding if elected. We often take our <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/\">relatively novel form of government</a> for granted; if we lose it, we’ll miss it when it’s gone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, November 1, 5:45 pm ET: </strong>This story misstated the timing of Christy Lopez’s decision to leave the Justice Department.

The mega-billionaire has put more than <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/g-s1-28591/elon-musk-donald-trump-america-pac-fec\">$75 million</a> toward electing the former president, turned America’s most politically influential social media platform <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/10/30/study-shows-elon-musk-tweets-pro-trump-appear-x-users-feeds-within-2-sessions/\">into a vehicle for right-wing propaganda</a>, orchestrated <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-america-pac-blitz-canvassing-michigan-uhaul/\">a (shambolic) get-out-the-vote effort,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWSXmMiWTJ0\">repeatedly appeared</a> beside Trump on the campaign trail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, as the race enters the homestretch, Musk is trying to clinch Trump’s victory with a bracing closing argument: If our side wins, you will experience severe economic pain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If elected, Trump has vowed to put <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-elon-musk-government-efficiency-commission-e831ed5dc2f6a56999e1a70bb0a4eaeb\">Musk in charge of a “government efficiency commission,”</a> which would identify supposedly wasteful programs that should be eliminated or slashed. During a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/\">telephone town hall</a> last Friday, Musk said his commission’s work would “necessarily involve some temporary hardship.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Days later, Musk suggested that this budget cutting — combined with Trump’s mass deportation plan — would cause a market-crashing economic “storm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On his social media platform, X (a.k.a. Twitter), an anonymous user <a href=\"https://x.com/AaronBlake/status/1851287697907744953\">posted Tuesday</a> that, “If Trump succeeds in forcing through mass deportations, combined with Elon hacking away at the government, firing people and reducing the deficit &#8211; there will be an initial severe overreaction in the economy…Market will tumble. But when the storm passes and everyone realizes we are on sounder footing, there will be a rapid recovery to a healthier, sustainable economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk replied, “Sounds about right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is one of the more truthful arguments that Musk has made for Trump’s election, which is to say, only half of it is false. If Trump delivers on his stated plans, Americans will indeed suffer material hardship. But such deprivation would neither be necessary for — nor conducive to — achieving a healthier or more sustainable economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Already, US retailers are saying that they will <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/\">increase prices if Trump is elected</a> in order to offset the impact of his 10 percent universal tariff on imports. And contrary to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/politics/trump-us-business-tariffs-taxes/index.html\">Trump’s suggestion</a>, those painful price hikes would not yield a stronger US manufacturing industry in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s plans for mass deportation, meanwhile, would trigger severe labor shortages in the construction and agricultural sectors, rendering food and housing more expensive. And these immediate disruptions would not raise American wages in the long run, but rather, make the economy less productive, and Medicare and Social Security more difficult to sustain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk’s plans for slashing federal spending would be similarly calamitous. He has offered few details about his vision for downsizing Uncle Sam, but recently suggested that the federal government’s $6.75 trillion budget should be cut by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/\">at least $2 trillion</a>. Austerity on that scale would disrupt myriad government services on which Democrats and Republicans rely, while threatening to throw the US economy into severe recession. And there is little basis for believing that an economic paradise would rise from such ruins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Trump’s tariffs would raise consumer prices without aiding the broader economy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first component of the joint Trump-Musk economic vision is a sweeping tariff regime. Trump has promised to impose a 10 percent to 20 percent <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/20/trump-tariffs-election.html\">universal tariff on all imports</a>, and an at least <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/04/trump-floats-more-than-60percent-tariffs-on-chinese-imports.html\">60 percent tariff</a> on imports from China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He claims that the cost of these duties would be borne by foreign producers. The theory behind that claim (to the extent that Trump has one) is that overseas companies would feel compelled to fully offset the impact of the tariff for US consumers: Since their goods would face a 10 percent sales tax in the US — while the goods of their American competitors would face no tax — exporters would cut the prices of their goods by 10 percent, and accept lower profit margins, in order to maintain their products’ competitiveness on the US market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this idea is dubious in theory, and patently false in practice. For one thing, there are many products and commodities that cannot be produced in the United States. Putting a 10 percent tariff on Colombian coffee beans will not make it possible to grow coffee at scale in the US. A Colombian Arabica exporter would therefore have no incentive to lower their prices in response to Trump’s tariff, for fear of getting outcompeted by nonexistent US rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another even larger problem for Trump’s theory is that American manufacturers cannot produce many of their wares without foreign-made components. Putting a tariff on all imports therefore increases domestic firms’ cost of production. And many American companies are already telling investors and the public that they will raise prices in order to offset that increase in costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,” the CEO of AutoZone, an American auto parts retailer, recently said on <a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/motors/12788723/autozone-price-hikes-trump-tariffs/\">an earnings call</a>. “We’ll generally raise prices ahead of — we know what the tariffs will be — we generally raise prices ahead of that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/\">Washington Post</a> reported, Columbia Sportswear and Stanley Black &amp; Decker have announced similar plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For these reasons, among others, <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-macroeconomic-and-price-estimates-tariffs-under-both-non-retaliation-and-retaliation\">Yale’s Budget Lab estimates that Trump’s tariffs</a> would raise consumer prices by as much as 5.1 percent, or $7,600 per household (in 2023 dollars).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Critically, this immediate pain for US consumers would not translate into durable gains for America’s manufacturers. To the contrary, Trump’s tariffs would likely hurt American exporters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As already mentioned, his tariff would raise input costs for American producers. And that would render such manufacturers less competitive in the global market, leading them to lose market share.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, the small-bore tariffs that Trump applied during his first term demonstrated this problem. Economists at the University of California San Diego, the Census Bureau, and the Federal Reserve studied the<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3514349\"> impacts of Trump’s tariffs</a> on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and various Chinese goods. They found that American exporters who were most exposed to tariffs on their inputs saw lower export growth in 2019 than exporters who were unaffected by the duties. And the impacts would likely be significantly larger for a universal tariff that raised the cost of every foreign input to the production process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, Trump’s tariff would run afoul of America’s obligations under various free trade agreements. And other nations would respond by imposing retaliatory tariffs on American-made goods. Again, Trump’s far more modest experiments with protectionism in his first term illustrated the problem. As America’s trade partners imposed retaliatory duties on US agricultural products, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/102980/err-304.pdf\">American farmers suffered a $27 billion loss</a> in exports between mid-2018 and the end of 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Further, a <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf\">2019 Federal Reserve analysis</a> found that US manufacturers exposed to tariffs saw relative reductions in employment as the harms of higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs outweighed the benefits of protection from import competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, Trump’s tariffs would make life more expensive for consumers in the short term, and American manufacturing less competitive in the long run.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Deporting undocumented immigrants en masse would make America poorer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump also plans to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373479/stephen-miller-mass-deportation-camps-trump-agenda\">deport undocumented immigrants</a>, including law-abiding workers who’ve long lived in the US. In addition to the human suffering mass deportations would cause, such a plan would impose immediate economic pain with no compensating long-term benefit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rapidly removing millions of undocumented workers from the economy would devastate the agricultural and construction sectors, where such immigrants make up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/trump-deportation-plan-economic-disaster\">roughly one-third and one-quarter of the workforce</a>, respectively. This would render both food and housing more scarce, and thus more expensive (at least in the immediate term).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The disappearance of millions of working-age people who pay Social Security and Medicare taxes would also <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/mass_deportation_report_0.pdf\">expedite the insolvency of those programs.</a> As the American population ages over the next five years, it will need to add <a href=\"https://www.protectedincome.org/news/labor-day-peak-65-trades-hit-hardest/#:~:text=Washington%2C%20D.C.%2C%20August%2027%2C,of%20Peak%20Baby%20Boomer%20retirements.\">240,000 workers each month</a> to keep pace with retirements, according to a recent study. Trump’s program would make this virtually impossible to achieve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s supporters argue that these harms will be offset in the long run by huge wage gains for native-born Americans, who will no longer need to compete with undocumented workers for jobs. But this is a fallacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">American workers’ bargaining power is determined by the balance between the demand for labor in the economy and the supply of workers. When employers have a high appetite for labor but a limited pool of applicants, workers can secure better pay and conditions. This economic circumstance is commonly described as a “tight labor market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mass deportation would reduce the supply of workers in the US economy. But it would also reduce <em>demand</em> for American labor: Immigrants are human beings who purchase goods and services in order to survive and enjoy themselves. Consequently, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants wouldn’t necessarily make labor markets tighter. And in any event, such a destructive policy is unnecessary for creating a favorable environment for US workers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s more than possible to simultaneously generate a tighter labor market and grow the population of workers through immigration. In fact, this just occurred: In 2022 and 2023, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/what-effects-will-recent-surge-immigration-have-household-growth\">6 million people immigrated</a> to the US. Over that same period, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\">unemployment fell</a> to historic lows, while <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/a-2023-census-data-preview-household-incomes-likely-rose-because-of-a-strong-labor-market-and-falling-inflation/\">wages rose</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/29/low-income-wages-employment-00097135\">pay inequality fell</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was not an aberrant outcome. As economics blogger Noah Smith notes, economists have studied the <a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-immigration-doesnt-reduce-wages\">economic effects of myriad immigration waves</a>, and tend to find no negative impact on native-born workers’ wages or employment prospects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, immigrants tend to increase an economy’s labor efficiency. This is because immigrant workers are <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/immigrants-contribute-greatly-to-us-economy-despite-administrations-public-charge-rule\">far more willing to move</a> in response to shifting economic conditions than native workers who have deep roots in particular US communities. Immigrants are therefore uniquely effective at filling shortages in local labor markets. By plugging these holes, they render other workers in those places more productive. The Harvard economist <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2001/01/2001a_bpea_borjas.pdf\">George Borjas has estimated that such productivity gains</a> generate between $5 billion and $10 billion of economic value for native-born workers each year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, Trump’s immigration plans would make US consumers poorer in the near term, while reducing the size and productivity of the American economy on a longer time horizon.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Gutting air safety, meat inspections, and food stamps will not make the economy healthier</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, Musk’s fiscal plans — which Trump supposedly intends to implement (at least, according to Musk) — would severely disrupt the provision of government services and increase unemployment, while hurting the economy’s long-term growth prospects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/\">asked Musk,</a> “How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted, $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This was evidently a reference to the 2024 US federal budget, which is actually $6.75 trillion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think we can do at least $2 trillion,” Musk replied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This proposal is so radical it has attracted criticism from fiscal conservatives who support the broad goal of cutting federal spending. Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the right-wing Manhattan Institute, told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/\">Washington Post</a> this week, “The idea that one can cut $2 trillion in wasteful and unnecessary programs is absolutely absurd.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reason is simple. According to government watchdogs, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/federal-government-made-236-billion-improper-payments-last-fiscal-year\">actual waste and fraud amounts to</a> less than $300 billion a year. Shaving $2 trillion off the federal budget would therefore require draconian cuts to many popular federal programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Were Trump to implement Musk’s vision while simultaneously honoring his promise to avoid cutting entitlements and the GOP’s commitment to avoiding defense spending cuts, then he would need to slash all other government programs by 80 percent. That would involve gutting all social services for low-income Americans, food inspections, air safety, health insurance subsidies, and infrastructure investments, among countless other things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This would abruptly and massively reduce demand in the US economy, potentially triggering a recession.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is little reason to expect such severe and haphazard spending cuts to benefit the economy in the long term. After all, government investments in <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4705468#:~:text=Findings%3A%20The%20results%20indicate%20a,but%20still%20significant%20positive%20effect.\">education</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/the-potential-macroeconomic-benefits-from-increasing-infrastructure-investment/\">infrastructure</a> often increase the economy’s growth potential — slashing funding for such programs could impair America’s economic performance in the coming decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The best argument for Trump’s economic agenda is that he might not act on it</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk is correct to say that Trump’s plans would impose hardship on the American people. But he’s wrong to describe such difficulties as temporary. If Trump and Musk get their way, America’s consumers will pay higher prices, its manufacturers will sell fewer exports, its agricultural industry will fall into chaos, its workforce will become less productive, its federal government will struggle to provide basic services, and its long-term economic growth potential will fall.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s supporters might reasonably argue that none of this should trouble us, since he rarely fulfills his campaign promises and will surely back away from his economically ruinous agenda once in office. But “don’t worry, our candidate is a huge liar” does not strike me as a much better message than “prepare for temporary hardship.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Discussion of violence among right-wing extremists has also already <a href=\"https://globalextremism.org/post/online-chatter-election-contains-signs-for-violence/\">spiked online</a>, and unlike Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump has refused to say that he would concede.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has, however, employed violent rhetoric himself. On Thursday, Trump lambasted former Rep. Liz Cheney, an outspoken Republican critic of the former president who he described as a “radical war hawk.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay?” he said at a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/politics/donald-trump-liz-cheney-war-hawk-battle/index.html\">campaign event in Arizona</a>. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The polls show a <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\">tight race</a> between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting that this time, as in 2020, the results may be decided by narrow margins in a few battleground states. Trump has been priming Republican voters to reject the results if he comes up short, making <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/trump-voter-fraud-claims-pennsylvania/index.html\">unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in Pennsylvania</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-noncitizen-voter-fraud-fact-check/\">noncitizens voting on a widespread basis</a>. Billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk has also set up a platform on his social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, for users to &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5165523/voting-election-conspiracy-theories-social-media\">share potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities</a> you see while voting in the 2024 election.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those tactics seem to be working. If Trump loses, about a quarter of Republicans said they think he should do whatever it takes to ensure he becomes president anyway, according to a <a href=\"https://www.prri.org/research/one-leader-under-god-the-connection-between-authoritarianism-and-christian-nationalism-in-america/?preview=true\">September PRRI poll</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That may include resorting to violence. Among Republicans who don’t believe Biden’s win in 2020 was legitimate, almost one-third said in an <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/08/07/snf-agora-poll-july-2024/\">August poll</a> by the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University that they expected “a lot” or “a great deal” of political violence after the November election. More <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/30/voters-fear-violence-trump-loss/\">recent polls</a> have found similar results, including an October <a href=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/many-voters-are-worried-about-the-electoral-process-and-transition-of-power/\">AP-NORC poll</a> that found 27 percent of Republicans, and 42 percent of voters overall, “extremely” or “very” worried about post-election violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this has put law enforcement and national security officials on high alert about political violence in the days before and after the election. Earlier this month, a joint Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FBI intelligence <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-violence-domestic-extremists-fbi-dhs-bulletin/\">bulletin</a> said that domestic extremists &#8220;pose a threat of violence to a range of targets directly and indirectly associated with elections through at least the presidential inauguration&#8221; on January 20.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What kind of political violence might break out?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some incidents of political violence have already been recorded in the runup to Election Day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ballots in mailboxes and drop boxes in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-marty-walsh-boston-elections-crime-3d9dd32292187df91d73cb153b9c0a73\">Massachusetts,</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ballots-damaged-usps-mailbox-fire-phoenix-rcna177067\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ballot-boxes-set-fire-portland-vancouver-rcna177611\">Washington, and Oregon</a> have been damaged in suspected arson. DHS warned this might happen, based on its monitoring of comments made online in domestic violent extremist circles. In a series of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/4957125-domestic-violent-extremists-2024-election/\">security bulletins</a> in the last few months, the agency noted, “Some threat actors may perceive ballot drop boxes as ‘soft targets’ because they are more accessible” and that some of these actors had discussed a variety of methods for damaging them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A man was also <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2024/10/29/grand-jury-indicts-man-accused-of-shooting-at-democratic-party-office/75924391007/\">indicted on terrorism and gun charges</a> for allegedly shooting at the Democratic National Committee’s offices in Phoenix on three occasions since September.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Things might only get worse from here. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco has <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2024-09-24/deputy-ag-u-s-faces-unprecedented-level-of-political-threats\">warned</a> that the US is “facing an unprecedented level of, and increase in, threats of violence against public officials.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/4957125-domestic-violent-extremists-2024-election/\">DHS bulletins</a>, there is a “heightened risk” that domestic violent extremists could “attempt to initiate civil war.” That kind of chatter has become increasingly common in online spaces <a href=\"https://globalextremism.org/post/online-chatter-election-contains-signs-for-violence/\">frequented by right-wing extremist groups</a>. That said, the DHS noted that the prosecutions of those involved in the January 6 insurrection and hesitation about potential false flag operations designed to entrap them could serve as deterrents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Law enforcement officials across the country are bracing for the possibility of escalation, particularly in Democratic population centers. For instance, Detroit’s election headquarters have reportedly been reinforced with bulletproof glass and will be protected by armed guards after Trump supporters tried to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/legal/michigan-still-counting-votes-angry-poll-watchers-barred-in-detroit-trump-sues-idUSKBN27K2AL/\">interrupt ballot counting</a> by chanting “Stop the count” and banging on the windows in 2020. Philadelphia election staff will <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-swing-states-officials-brace-conspiracy-theories-violence-2024-10-30/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Daily-Briefing&amp;utm_term=103024&amp;user_email=38572e447ae2b3a943d6423dd3d8ad89c2e154a588929a92468b7914f3f4e88f&amp;lctg=66464e6f30f1bc62c305003b\">count ballots in a warehouse</a> encircled by a fence with barbed wire, miles from the downtown area where protesters gathered in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, however, these preparations might not be enough to quell domestic violent extremist activity when Republican leaders are encouraging skepticism about the integrity of the election and are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/speaker-johnson-appears-to-confirm-a-secret-election-plan-with-trump\">making secret plans</a> to assure a second Trump term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Being aware of the potential for violence and damage to the institutions we rely upon is important,” retired Gen. Joseph Votel, an executive board member of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement. “But it is insufficient in the face of legislative acts that are open to broad interpretation, strong political rhetoric that dominates the public information space, and imperfect individuals acting in accordance with their oaths.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, November 1, 10:55 am ET:</strong> This story was originally published on October 31 and has been updated with Trump’s comments about Cheney.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Clary/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apple just put AI in millions of people’s pockets. The company is rolling out what it calls <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-intelligence-is-available-today-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac/\">Apple Intelligence</a> this week, bringing some basic text generation and image editing features to iPhone, iPad, and Mac users <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115#:~:text=To%20get%20started%20with%20Apple,though%20wait%20times%20can%20vary.\">who opt in</a>. I’ve been testing these tools through the developer beta version of the software for a couple months now, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/370836/apple-intelligence-iphone-16-ios-update-siri\">they’re pretty mediocre</a>. But this is only the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Generative AI, once a parlor trick for the tech-obsessed, is fast becoming the main event for major software releases. As Apple pushes its version of the technology, Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/\">is building AI into its Android operating system</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/357247/why-are-ai-search-engines-so-bad\">forcing everyone to look at AI Overviews</a> at the top of virtually every Google Search. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205701/openai-searchgpt-ai-search-engine-google-perplexity-rival\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24282017/meta-ai-powered-search-engine-report\">Meta</a> are building their own AI-powered search engines, while the startup <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a> already has one. <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/10/21/new-autonomous-agents-scale-your-team-like-never-before/\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/22/anthropic-announces-ai-agents-for-complex-tasks-racing-openai.html\">Anthropic</a> recently announced new, super-powerful AI agents that can complete complex tasks much like humans would. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While some companies have had generative AI products out in the wild for over a year, the arrival of Apple Intelligence marks an inflection point for the mainstreaming of the technology. Apple Intelligence is only available on the latest Apple devices, but over half the phones in the United States <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/dont-blame-apple-for-the-us-smartphone-market-blame-the-us-carriers\">are iPhones</a>. As people upgrade, millions more can tap into the new technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re not already using AI, you probably will be soon — whether you like it or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We&#8217;re getting AI, especially generative AI, shoved down our throats with little to no transparency, and honestly, the opt-out mechanisms are either nonexistent or complicated,” said Sasha Luccioni, AI researcher and climate lead at Hugging Face, a platform for sharing AI and machine learning tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If that fills you with dread, it’s understandable. Maybe you feel bad participating in the race <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll\">to build a superintelligent AI</a> nobody asked for. You may feel complicit for using <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/openai-copyright-law.html\">AI models trained on copyrighted material</a> without paying the creators. You probably feel just plain bad about the flood of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/378855/ai-slop-fall-autumn-inspiration-vibes-pinterest\">AI slop that’s ruining the internet</a> even if you did not personally create the slop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s the climate consequences of it all. AI, in its many shapes and forms, requires a lot of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising\">energy and water to work</a>. A <em>lot</em>. That might make you feel downright guilty about using AI.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AI’s big energy appetite</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a chance Apple Intelligence is more guilt-free than the other big AI options as far as energy is concerned. Apple says it keeps the processing for certain AI features, like GenMoji and Image Playground, entirely on your device. That means less reliance on energy-intensive data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t know exactly how much energy AI uses at these data centers. Using data from a recent Microsoft Research study, Shaolei Ren, an engineering professor at the University of California Riverside, came up with this: Asking ChatGPT to write two 200-word emails uses roughly the same amount of energy as a Tesla Model 3 would need to drive one mile. Because they generate so much heat, the processors that generated those emails would also require <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/18/energy-ai-use-electricity-water-data-centers/\">about four half-liter bottles of water</a> to cool down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The consequences of such energy profligacy become clearer if you scale up. The amount of electricity used by data centers, where AI processing largely takes place, is <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand\">predicted to grow by 160 percent</a> by the end of the decade, and carbon dioxide emissions could more than double as a result, according to Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, the amount of water needed will also spike, so much so that by 2027, AI’s thirst <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271\">could be equal to half the annual water withdrawal of the United Kingdom</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These are all estimates based on limited data because the tech companies building AI systems, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, do not share exactly how much energy or water their models use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We&#8217;re just looking at the black box because we have absolutely no idea of the energy consumption for interacting with the large language models,” Ren said. He compared the situation to searching for flights on Google and being able <a href=\"https://support.google.com/travel/answer/9671620?hl=en\">to see the carbon emissions for each leg</a>. “But when it comes to these large language models, there&#8217;s absolutely none, zero, no information.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lack of transparency about AI’s energy demands also runs counter to these tech companies’ sustainability promises. There’s good reason to believe that AI is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/browns-take-ai-threatens-tech-companies-climate-commitments-3c6c1883\">leading directly to those promises being broken</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Due to increases in data center energy usage, Google saw its greenhouse gas emissions <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/google-s-emissions-shot-up-48-over-five-years-due-to-ai?sref=qYiz2hd0\">increase by 48 percent</a> from 2019 to 2023, despite a pledge to cut emissions by 50 percent from its 2019 levels <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/net-zero-carbon/\">by 2030</a>. The company <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-08/google-is-no-longer-claiming-to-be-carbon-neutral?sref=qYiz2hd0\">no longer claims to be carbon neutral</a>. Microsoft similarly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/browns-take-ai-threatens-tech-companies-climate-commitments-3c6c1883\">saw a 29 percent jump in emissions</a> from 2020 to 2023. While Microsoft has promised to be carbon negative by 2030, it <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-wrestles-with-rising-emissions-from-ai-ahead-of-its-2030-net-zero-goal-b53d4cf4\">is now openly struggling</a> with ways to make that happen while keeping pace with AI innovation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What the AI dealers aren’t telling us</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is what an arms race looks like. It’s worth pointing out here that all energy usages started to spike around the time that OpenAI knocked the world’s socks off with its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/technology/chatgpt-ai-twitter.html\">surprise release of ChatGPT</a> in November 2022. The chatbot <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948386/chatgpt-active-user-count-openai-developer-conference\">became the fastest-growing app ever</a>, capturing 100 million users <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\">in two months</a> and kick-starting the AI gold rush in Silicon Valley. Now, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/16/generative-ai-startups-get-40percent-of-all-vc-investment-in-cloud-accel.html#:~:text=Generative%20artificial%20intelligence%20startups%20are,the%20startup%20at%20$157%20billion.\">40 percent of all venture capital money</a> in cloud computing goes to generative AI companies. OpenAI itself announced a $6.6 billion funding round in early October — the <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/openai-raises-record--6-6-billion-investors-back-its-ai-dominance\">largest venture capital round of all time</a> — giving it a $157 billion valuation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With such staggering amounts of money at play, it’s perhaps no surprise that energy efficiency takes a back seat to growth and innovation. Companies like OpenAI want the models that power their AI technology to get bigger so they can get better and outperform competitors. And the bigger the model, the greater the energy demand — at least for now. Over time, it’s likely that performance will get more efficient thanks to advances in chip technology, data center cooling, and engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Because the innovation happened so quickly around when ChatGPT burst onto the scene, you would expect, initially, for the efficiency to be at its lowest point,” Josh Parker, head of sustainability at chipmaker Nvidia, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, the most energy-intensive products are now what companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta are pushing the hardest. Those include real-time chatbots, voice assistants, and search engines. These features <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption\">enlist larger models and require more advanced chips</a> to work at the same time to reduce latency, or lag. Put simply, they have to do a lot of hard math problems all at once and very quickly. That’s why it takes as much electricity as it does to run a Tesla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apple, however, seems to present itself as an exception. As part of its promise to protect user privacy, the company says it handles as many Apple Intelligence tasks as it can on your device without sending queries to data centers. That means when you opt in to Apple Intelligence, you download a small generative AI model that can handle pretty simple tasks on your phone. Your iPhone battery, unlike a grid-connected cloud data center, has a limited amount of power, which forces Apple Intelligence to handle these tasks with some efficiency. Maybe on-device AI is the guilt-free version of the future after all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The problem, of course, is that we don’t know exactly how Apple Intelligence works. But there is some insight you can gain: You can actually access a log of your activity on Apple Intelligence by going to Settings and then Privacy and Security. There, you’ll see an option to export an Apple Intelligence Report. Unless you’re a developer, the file you download will be hard to read, since it’s full of code, but it does technically reveal <a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2024/10/29/check-writing-tools-using-air/\">which tasks are handled on your device</a> and which ones get sent up to Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, giving them a bigger carbon footprint. Apple also says its servers run on 100 percent renewable energy, part of the company’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apples_Product_Use_Electricity_Strategy.pdf\">broader commitment to be carbon neutral</a> by the end of the decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So again, if you’re feeling dread or guilt about AI in your life, that’s understandable. It is clear that this technology, in its current state, consumes vast and increasing amounts of energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and worsening human-caused climate change. It is also true that you might not have a choice, as big tech companies make generative AI more foundational to their products. You can opt out of Apple Intelligence or never opt in. But you’ll find it’s more difficult, if not impossible, to opt out of AI products from Google, Meta, and Microsoft. (If you want to try, here’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/31/opt-out-ai-training-meta-chatgpt/\">a helpful guide</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a reason to feel guilty,” Luccioni said. “But I do think there&#8217;s a reason — as with climate change in general — to ask for more information, to ask for accountability on behalf of the companies that are selling us this stuff.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If AI is supposed to solve all our problems or destroy us all <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/2024/3/3/24083523/artificial-intelligence-ai-doomsday-panic-extinction-climate-change-utopia-tech-bros-silicon-valley\">or both</a>, it would be nice to know the details.

active involvement from intelligent and strategic people whose mission is to reduce — if not eliminate — federal regulation of businesses, including animal-using businesses that already get a light touch” from regulators, <a href=\"https://www.vermontlaw.edu/faculty/winders-delcianna\">Delcianna Winders</a>, director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told me. (Disclosure: Last summer, I attended a media fellowship program at Vermont Law and Graduate School.) And while most federal regulatory employees in agencies like the US Department of Agriculture are civil servants, Trump has promised to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy\">reclassify</a> them as political appointees so he can fire and replace them with loyalists to advance his deregulatory agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, some of the people high up in Trump’s orbit, despite their reactionary views on other social issues, have indicated relatively pro-animal welfare or anti-factory farming beliefs. Some in a second term could wind up in positions to advance animals’ interests, like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/29/lara-trump-pet-problem-238906\">Lara Trump</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/should-conservatives-care-about-animal-cruelty-lewis/id1679444703?i=1000666907585\">Vivek Ramaswamy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/blogs/ag-policy-blog/blog-post/2024/04/02/rfk-jrs-plan-weaponize-regulators\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> — though Kennedy could do <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health\">plenty of damage</a> to human beings if put in a position of authority on health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether they’ll use their influence to help animals in a second Trump term is unknown to unlikely. But there’s a sliver of precedent they could build on, as Trump’s first term wasn’t all bad for animals. For example, his Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Secretary Andrew Wheeler sought to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-wheeler-signs-memo-reduce-animal-testing-awards-425-million-advance\">significantly reduce</a> animal testing with the goal of replacing most of it with alternative methods by 2035, and other federal agencies cut back on <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/no-more-kitten-slaughterhouse-government-halts-deadly-cat-experiments-n990011\">kitten</a>, <a href=\"https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-to-conduct-in-depth-internal-review-of-existing-canine-research-projects/\">dog</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/health/fda-monkeys-nicotine.html\">monkey testing</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/wcw_nih.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,7.7517575041737,100,84.496484991653\" alt=\"A monkey in a cage.\" title=\"A monkey in a cage.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The death of Moby (pictured) and three other squirrel monkeys used in a nicotine addiction study resulted in the shuttering of the research in 2018 and prompted the agency to build a council to oversee its animal studies. | US Food and Drug Administration/White Coat Waste\" data-portal-copyright=\"US Food and Drug Administration/White Coat Waste\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And for all the very real differences between President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the truth is that when it comes to animal welfare, there’s not much daylight between the parties. President Joe Biden’s EPA last year <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/trump-put-epa-on-course-to-end-animal-testing-bide/\">reversed</a> the Trump EPA’s animal testing phase-out, while his Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork\">sided with the pork industry</a> in a Supreme Court case over a landmark California law that banned locking pigs in tiny cages. Biden’s US Fish and Wildlife Service recently sought to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gray-wolves-protections-biden-trump-81084b1bba499d444950f8294880c524\">revive</a> a Trump-era rule that eliminates protections for gray wolves after environmental groups had successfully sued to stop it. Minnesota Gov. and Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/373954/tim-walz-piglet-factory-farming-climate\">as I wrote previously</a>, also has a long, cozy relationship with the factory farm industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That animal protection remains a politically homeless cause was further underscored elsewhere in Tuesday’s election, as animal issues <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/377096/sonoma-county-denver-factory-farming-slaughterhouse-ban-ballot-measures\">on the ballot</a> in state and local jurisdictions across the US lost resoundingly, illustrating that voters may not be ready for more ambitious animal welfare laws.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Animals lost big at the ballot box&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Denver, 64 percent of voters <a href=\"https://denverite.com/2024/11/05/denver-2024-general-election-updates/\">rejected</a> a ballot measure to <a href=\"https://denverite.com/2024/11/05/denver-ballot-measure-309-results-2024-elections/\">ban slaughterhouses</a>, which would have closed the largest lamb slaughterhouse in the US. A recently released <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/\">investigation</a> of the facility, conducted by an animal rights group, documented injured lambs that are unable to walk being kicked and pushed toward slaughter; lambs hanging upside down on the slaughter line and still thrashing after their throats were slit; employees laughing and spanking animals; and the alleged use of “Judas sheep” — adult sheep used to lead lambs to slaughter.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Graphic Video Animal Rights Advocates Say Comes From Denver Lamb Slaughterhouse\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_rOBd_OtvLg?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fifty-eight percent of Denverites also voted against a ban on the <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2024/11/05/denver-initiated-ordinance-308-309-election-results/\">sale of fur</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite the losses, Pro-Animal Future, the group behind the Denver ballot measures, celebrated the fact that more than a third of the city’s voters were willing to vote for a far-reaching measure as banning slaughterhouses — even as the campaign was outspent 6-to-1 by a coalition of national and state meat industry groups, restaurants, and labor unions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;This was a bold campaign, and no one said changing the status quo was going to be easy,&#8221; Pro-Animal Future spokesperson Olivia Hammond said in a press release. &#8220;Over 100,000 meat eaters voted for a world without slaughterhouses, and that&#8217;s a foundation we&#8217;ll continue building on. Voters aren&#8217;t used to seeing animal rights on the ballot, and we are paving the way with this campaign.&#8221;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/A-volunteer-with-Pro-Animal-Future-sits-beside-a-sheep-at-Broken-Shovels-Sanctuary.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A person sitting in a large pen with goats wears a T-shirt with the slogan “No more factory farms.”\" title=\"A person sitting in a large pen with goats wears a T-shirt with the slogan “No more factory farms.”\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A volunteer with the ballot measure to ban slaughterhouses in Denver city limits spends time with rescued animals at Broken Shovels Sanctuary in Commerce City, Colorado. | Pro-Animal Future\" data-portal-copyright=\"Pro-Animal Future\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The CEO of the lamb slaughterhouse called supporters of the ban “<a href=\"https://denverite.com/2024/11/05/denver-ballot-measure-309-results-2024-elections/\">losers</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the state level, meanwhile, with three-quarters of the votes counted, Coloradans <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-election-results-maps-live-vote-count-2024/\">voted 55.5 to 44.5</a> against a prohibition on <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/11/05/proposition-127-big-cat-hunting-ban-results/\">trophy hunting</a> mountain lions, lynx, and bobcats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And in Sonoma County, California, where nearly <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/california-2024-election-results-map-shows-county-by-county-live-count/\">75 percent</a> of voters cast ballots for Harris, only <a href=\"https://www.ktvu.com/election/sonoma-county-election-results-2024\">15 percent</a> supported Measure J, an initiative to phase out large factory farms, which would’ve closed as many as <a href=\"https://norcalpublicmedia.org/2024110696713/news-feed/measure-j-loses\">21 operations</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“While the opportunity to alleviate animal suffering and move our society in a better direction fell short today, we&#8217;ve always known that this will take time and we trust that people are going to get there,” the Coalition to End Factory Farming campaign, which advocated for Measure J, said in a statement. The campaign was outspent 8-to-1 by the measure’s opposition, which was funded by large meat and dairy companies and trade groups. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Florida, with more than 95 of votes counted, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-florida.html#I\">67 percent</a> of voters supported an amendment to enshrine a constitutional right to hunt and fish. Florida law already protects both of these activities, and <a href=\"https://www.everglades.org/vote-no-on-amendment-2/\">environmental advocates argue</a> that the measure’s vague language could enable hunters to use more violent methods of trapping and killing wildlife. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While voters have in the past overwhelmingly supported <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/10/9/23393017/supreme-court-pork-pigs-prop-12-california-animal-welfare\">bans on tiny cages</a> for farmed animals (I worked on one of these in <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2016/11/08/question-three-animal-confinement-results\">Massachusetts in 2016</a> when I worked for the Humane Society of the US), the proposed outright bans on factory farms and slaughterhouses in Sonoma County and Denver were too much even for some of the bluest parts of the country. The rejection of the fur sales ban in Denver came as more of a surprise, considering that voters in nearby Boulder <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/11/12/humane-clothing-act-boulder/\">passed</a> one in 2021. California’s legislature, along with localities in Massachusetts, Michigan, and Florida, have also banned fur (though not via ballot initiatives).&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/WAM26923.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.678370919471,100,78.643258161058\" alt=\"Female breeding pigs confined in gestation crates\" title=\"Female breeding pigs confined in gestation crates\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Female breeding pigs confined in gestation crates. Voters in numerous states have banned the crates via ballot measures. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The agricultural measures faced criticism from both the agricultural industry and some fellow anti-factory farming advocates, who argued that they’d just <a href=\"https://cornbeltconfidential.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-local-cafo-bans\">displace</a> meat production elsewhere. They likely faced cultural headwinds, too, given that Denver is in a state proud of its ranching industry, and Sonoma County — an area with both higher-welfare organic farms and conventional factory farms — takes pride in its farming heritage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some critics of the Sonoma County ballot measure argued that, despite its good intentions, it was poorly crafted and went far ahead of where voters stand on the issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dena Jones, a former farm animal program director at the nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute, told Vox the Denver slaughterhouse and Sonoma County factory farm bans were “ill-advised.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I found it very hard to believe in either case that either one of those could be successful,” she said, “and I thought the backlash might make it more of a loss than a gain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever the shortcomings of these ballot measures, the fierce opposition they faced in blue strongholds highlights how resistant Democratic voters can be to more ambitious meat industry reforms, even though meat production heavily contributes to issues central to progressives’ agenda: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf\">climate change</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws\">environmental pollution</a>, and <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2024/10/23/the-fate-of-denvers-last-slaughterhouse-is-on-the-ballot/\">labor exploitation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to prevent animal cruelty, whoever’s in office</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The losses should come as a sobering moment for the animal rights movement. Voters have been able to stomach modest reforms, like bans on cages for farm animals, which ask little of them besides slightly higher prices for meat and eggs. The economic effects of such measures are also diffused throughout entire industries, as opposed to one city or county — or in the case of Denver, a single slaughterhouse — which may make voters more fearful of impacts to their local communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These dynamics ought to weigh heavily into how activists plan future ballot measures. Currently, animal rights groups in Oregon are collecting signatures for a <a href=\"https://www.yesonip28.org/\">2026 ballot initiative</a> that would dramatically curtail — if not outright eliminate — animal farming, animal testing, and other business activities that rely on animals in the state. That’s an unpopular proposition to everyone but the most strident vegans, though the theory behind the ballot measure is noteworthy: It works by removing many of the sweeping exemptions carved into Oregon’s anti-animal cruelty laws for agriculture and other animal-using industries, thereby revealing how these businesses depend on legalized animal abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As to how animal advocates should approach the next Trump administration, Jones said, the prospects for new federal animal welfare legislation or regulations are dim. But there are opportunities to improve enforcement of the few federal laws that do protect animals, like the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and the Animal Welfare Act. These are primarily enforced by civil servants, not political appointees, so enforcement would be less politically charged than lobbying for new policies altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I&#8217;ve done policy work for animals for 30 years,” said Jones, “and it is possible to make progress for animals” in both Republican and Democrat administrations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that progress will be harder to forge if Trump follows through on his vow to mass fire civil servants and replace them with sycophants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jones also challenges animal advocates to view their issues from a conservative mindset to better appeal to both parties. Anti-animal testing nonprofit White Coat Waste has <a href=\"https://www.theamericansaga.com/p/how-republicans-and-democrats-are\">found success</a> — like the phasing out of some cruel animal studies — by working with both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. The group advocates for reductions in animal testing on the basis of not just compassion for animals, but also conservative values like reducing taxpayer waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You need to look at issues where the interest of the agency, the industry, and animal protection or environmental protection overlap,” said Jones. “There always are some.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It marks conservatives&#8217; latest effort to push local governments toward tougher and less discretionary enforcement of outdoor homelessness. Its success with voters suggests openness to more aggressive enforcement of public camping as cities grapple with their recently affirmed powers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The measure will create a new system allowing property owners to recoup expenses like security cameras, cleaning services, and protective fencing when cities demonstrate a &#8220;pattern or practice&#8221; of not enforcing laws against camping, loitering, or public drug use. (To claim the refund, property owners must prove that lax enforcement reduced their property values or led to costs related to addressing public &#8220;nuisance&#8221; issues.) Those refunds would come directly from money that cities get from the state, effectively penalizing local governments that don&#8217;t crack down on encampments. Individuals will be allowed to submit one claim per year, for up to 10 years.<br><br>Proponents, led by the conservative Goldwater Institute, promoted the measure as a way to prevent another crisis like &#8220;The Zone.&#8221; Opponents, however, argue it will divert already scarce resources from shelters, public services, and law enforcement, ultimately diminishing cities&#8217; ability to tackle homelessness on a broader scale.<br><br>“Ever heard the saying, ‘the beatings will continue until morale improves?’” asked two local leaders in <a href=\"https://apps.azsos.gov/election/BallotMeasures/2024/Prop_312_Against_Arguments.pdf\">arguments submitted to Arizona’s secretary of state</a>. “Why would we try to force cities to do something they can&#8217;t do, then punish them for not being able to do it?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Arizona voters approved a harmful, counterproductive, and shortsighted ballot initiative that will make homelessness worse,” said Jesse Rabinowitz,&nbsp; the campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center. “Proposition 312 fails to address the lack of affordable housing that causes homelessness, burdens local governments, and will drive up legal costs that will be passed on to taxpayers.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The initiative will take effect as Arizona faces one of the nation&#8217;s most severe <a href=\"https://azbigmedia.com/real-estate/affordable-housing-crisis-in-arizona-heres-what-analysis-shows/\">affordable housing shortages</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.commonsenseinstituteus.org/arizona/research/housing-and-our-community/homelessness-spending-in-arizona\">some 14,000 people</a> experiencing homelessness on any given night.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The voters sent a clear message this election cycle: they demand their tax dollars be used to enforce the law and address rampant homelessness,” Goldwater President and CEO Victor Riches <a href=\"https://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/prop-312-victory-relief-is-here-for-arizonans-paying-the-price-for-homeless-crisis/\">said in a statement</a> Wednesday morning. “Now that Prop 312 is law, business and property owners will not be left holding the bag when municipalities refuse to do their job.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conservatives want clearing homeless tent encampments to be non-negotiable</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Arizona measure represents conservatives&#8217; most ambitious attempt yet to remove local discretion from homeless enforcement. While the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling in June cleared the way for more uninhibited camping bans, local officials are still left with significant flexibility over whether and how to clear encampments. For advocates frustrated with what they see as progressive cities&#8217; reluctance to act, Proposition 312&#8217;s tax refund mechanism offers a template for forcing their hands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;Many cities have used legal uncertainty as an excuse — they throw up their hands and say, &#8216;Our hands are tied,'&#8221; Ilan Wurman, a law professor who helped craft early lawsuits against Phoenix over &#8220;The Zone,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing\">told me this summer</a>. &#8220;The Supreme Court took that argument away, but it still doesn&#8217;t require them to do anything. That&#8217;s why we need tools … to ensure enforcement actually happens.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The push for non-discretionary enforcement has been gaining momentum. Florida recently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/375765/florida-homelessness-hurricane-helene-encampment-disaster-fema-housing-crisis-storm\">enacted a law allowing</a> residents and businesses to sue cities that don&#8217;t clear encampments, and Missouri now permits <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2023/01/17/advocates-providers-scramble-as-missouris-new-homelessness-law-goes-into-effect/\">its attorney general to take legal action</a> against local governments that fail to enforce camping bans. Arizona&#8217;s approach of targeting municipal budgets marks a new addition to these litigation-based strategies. Wurman, who recently filed a new <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25119695/fieldwork-et-al-v-city-of-berkeley-street-camp-lawsuit.pdf\">public nuisance lawsuit in Berkeley, California</a> over tent encampments, told me Prop 312 will “certainly help put pressure on cities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Cicero Institute, an Austin-based conservative think tank known for helping cities and states draft public camping bans and advocating for a shift away from the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23504323/housing-first-homelessness-houston-homes\">bipartisan &#8220;Housing First&#8221; approach to homelessness</a>, voiced its support for Proposition 312 on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Cicero Institute supports community-approach solutions to homelessness that balance the needs of unhoused individuals with the rights of their housed neighbors,” Stefani Buhajla, the director of communications, told Vox. “Proposition 312 offers a mechanism for citizens to hold municipalities accountable when they fail to ensure public safety or leave vulnerable people to life on the streets.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But critics, including law enforcement leaders, warn the approach could backfire. &#8220;I think they really want to force the hand of government to do what they want. But you cannot arrest away homelessness,&#8221; Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/25/arizona-prop-312-unhoused-ballot-measure\">told the Marshall Project last month</a>, noting that jails are already straining to provide mental health and addiction resources. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Joe and Debbie Faillace, two business owners who worked in downtown Phoenix, say the spiraling homelessness crisis forced them to sell their sandwich shop. The couple applauded the passage of Prop 312, saying it “gives us hope that not only will the city of Phoenix not allow another ‘Zone’ to happen, but that even [if] it does, the government will have to compensate small businesses like ours for failing to protect our rights.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What comes next</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The measure now sets up a complex implementation challenge for Arizona cities, which must balance their reduced discretion against practical and legal constraints. The initiative&#8217;s language leaves key questions unanswered: What constitutes a &#8220;pattern&#8221; of non-enforcement? Which expenses qualify as reasonable? How will cities prove they&#8217;re adequately enforcing the law?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-04-24/homeless-encampments-arizona-california-ballot-november-election\">told the LA Times</a> that the effects of the proposal could range from minimal “to devastating to our budget.” Even processing the claims will consume city resources, she added – resources that might otherwise go toward expanding shelter capacity or funding outreach workers. Gallego <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/2024/11/06/kate-gallego-reelected-phoenix-mayor-defeats-matt-evans/\">was reelected</a> on Tuesday night.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The city&#8217;s experience clearing &#8220;The Zone&#8221; offers a preview of the balancing act ahead. When Phoenix finally dismantled the encampment last year, it did <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/us/phoenix-homeless-camp-the-zone.html\">so block by block over several months</a>, offering indoor alternatives and storage for belongings. That systematic approach helped the city avoid legal challenges over property rights, but similar caution or delay could now expose Phoenix to tax refund claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As other states watch Arizona&#8217;s experiment unfold, the measure&#8217;s impact may extend far beyond managing encampments. The initiative represents a fundamental shift in how cities approach homelessness policy — leveraging public budgets, rather than court orders or state laws, to compel enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even the measure&#8217;s supporters acknowledge that enforcement alone won&#8217;t solve the underlying crisis. Arizona has one of the nation&#8217;s most severe shortages of affordable housing, with only Nevada having fewer affordable units per capita for extremely low-income renters, <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap?utm_source=NLIHC+All+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=9b96f4c7b4-report_042122&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e090383b5e-9b96f4c7b4-293444466&amp;ct=t(report_042122)\">according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Arizona must focus on the true solution to homelessness — housing and optional services — not punishing people who sleep outside because they have nowhere else to go,” said Rabinowitz, of the National Homelessness Law Center. “As similar anti-homeless bills spread across the country, we demand that our elected officials not only reject these simple-minded and backward half measures and focus on what works: housing, not handcuffs.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "In a key test of public attitudes toward homelessness after the Supreme Court greenlit broader camping bans this past summer, Arizona voters approved a measure that will allow property owners to claim tax refunds if their local governments fail to clear out encampments.

It was all pretty on-brand for the billionaire, who has become one of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters and a one-man misinformation machine.<strong> </strong>When it was clear early Wednesday morning that Trump would win the presidency, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854045379408326909\">told his followers</a>: “You are the media now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A statement like that would have been laughable even a month ago, when estimates showed that X, formerly Twitter, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/business/elon-musk-twitter-x-fidelity/index.html#:~:text=And%20it%20represents%20a%20staggering,%2444%20billion%20that%20Musk%20paid.\">had dropped nearly 80 percent in value</a> since Musk purchased the platform for $44 billion in 2022. Until its transformation into X, the platform was regarded by some as a once-vibrant place on the internet that Musk utterly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/29/character-limit-how-elon-musk-destroyed-twitter-review-kate-conger-ryan-mac\">destroyed</a>. But after Musk <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html\">spent at least $119 million</a> to get Trump elected and turned his platform <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/technology/elon-musk-x-election.html?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20241104&amp;instance_id=138603&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=27132078&amp;segment_id=182153&amp;user_id=22aa1351f691b042384fa3531e08c414\">into a MAGA megaphone</a> — and then Trump won — the social media site’s real value is starting to take new shape.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From the day his Twitter purchase went through, Musk <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html\">vowed</a> to make free speech central to the platform’s future. He purged the company’s trust and safety staff, setting a precedent that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-trust-safety-industry/\">other social media companies followed</a>. Since then, however, Musk has been willing to let authoritarian regimes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235213/x-brazil-suppression-speech-elon-musk-india-turkey\">dictate how X will work</a> in their countries. In the United States, more free speech on X meant more misinformation and an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/\">embrace of right-wing politics</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">X is certainly not the biggest social media platform, but as other major platforms <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html\">continue to shy away from policing content</a> and Trump heads back to the White House, X certainly looks more influential than it did last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You might not like this. Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html\">buying the platform</a> in 2022, Musk has helped turn X into an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/wrong-claims-by-musk-us-election-got-2-billion-views-x-2024-report-says-2024-11-04/\">epicenter of election misinformation</a>. With 203 million followers, Musk has the biggest reach on X and is the platform’s <a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2024/'\">most prominent pusher of anti-immigrant conspiracy theories</a> and right-wing propaganda. At Musk’s request last year, X <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/yes-elon-musk-created-a-special-system/\">changed the site’s algorithm</a> to put his posts in more people’s feeds — posts that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/technology/elon-musk-x-election.html\">urged people not to trust the outcome of the election</a>. The nonprofit <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/about/\">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a> estimates that Musk’s misleading posts about the election have been viewed <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/media/elon-musk-election-x-misinformation-trump-harris/index.html\">more than 2 billion times</a> this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gone are the warning labels that Twitter <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/9/10/21430895/twitter-voter-suppression-policies-trump-civic-integrity\">once used</a> to flag false or misleading information. Musk replaced that system with a crowd-sourced fact-checking program called Community Notes. He called it “the best source of truth on the internet.” Unfortunately, the new system <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/30/elon-musk-x-fact-check-community-notes-misinformation/\">doesn’t work very well</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2182521573.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729549760201,100,78.540900479598\" alt=\"Elon Musk and Melania Trump stand with Musk’s young son at a Trump rally.

It’s not exactly a coordinated effort by Musk’s lieutenants to push your views to the right. It’s just how X is designed these days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s way too soon to tell just how big a role X played in Trump’s reelection. We also don’t know what, if anything, Musk will do differently with the platform as he eyes <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-adopt-musks-proposal-government-efficiency-commission-wsj-reports-2024-09-05/\">some sort of role</a> in the new administration. You can count on continuing to question everything you see on social media, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The problem will get worse because there are no guardrails in place right now,” said Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “All the trends are moving in the wrong direction.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, thanks to the apathy of social media platforms <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/17/ai-fake-news-misinformation/\">and the rise of AI</a>, lying on the internet <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/353958/online-lies-invisible-rulers-book-successful-misinformation\">has never been easier</a>. And if you’re on X, it’s part of the appeal.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The right will continue to rule X</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Leading up to the election, opinions on the fate of X were grim. There were <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/\">plenty</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dpj485nno\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/musk-election-misinformation-x-officials-twitter-voting-rcna176938\">reports</a> on the dangers of election misinformation on the platform or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285681/x-elon-musk-everything-app-bank-fail\">Musk’s broken promises</a> about what X would do by now. Bloomberg columnist Dave Lee argued that the platform was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-08-14/musk-s-x-reeks-of-failing-social-network-syndrome?sref=qYiz2hd0\">simply failing</a>, losing users and relevance. That seems less likely now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite <a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/twitter-x-usage-sees-sharp-decline/\">rumors of its demise</a>, X is still quite big. X told advertisers as recently as September that it has <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/x-claims-to-advertisers-that-it-has-a-reach-of-570-million-monthly-active-users/\">over 570 million monthly active users</a>, dwarfing right-wing platforms like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/technology/truth-social-right-wing-apps.html\">Truth Social</a> and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/02/why-rumble-is-the-only-successful-right-wing-social-platform.html\">Rumble</a>, whose users are in the hundreds of thousands. It is also much bigger than platforms <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12613\">like Mastodon and Blue Sky</a>, which progressives fled to after Musk bought Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Meta recently said its Twitter-replacement platform, Threads, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/threads-users-how-many-meta-twitter-instagram-2024-11\">has 275 million monthly active users</a>. A big difference between the two? Meta <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/9/24067742/instagram-threads-meta-political-content-recommended-feeds\">limits</a> the amount of political content you see on Threads. It looks like people are either staying on X or flocking to it for unfiltered politics news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Political news on Twitter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/09/our-study-found-little-evidence-that-twitter-is-biased-against-conservative-opinion-leaders/\">used to be marginal</a>, where celebrities were the main draw. The celebrities <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shonda-rhimes-celebrities-leave-twitter-elon-musk-takeover-social-media-2022-10\">have left</a>, and now X is the most popular major social media platform for keeping up with politics, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/06/12/how-americans-navigate-politics-on-tiktok-x-facebook-and-instagram/\">Pew survey</a> published in June. There has also been a major partisan shift. Democrats historically dominated political discussion on the platform, but X has become <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/\">dominated by right-wing voices</a> in just the last couple of years. Posts from Republicans are far more likely to go viral on X, and once-popular Democrat accounts have seen their audiences disintegrate, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/29/elon-musk-x-republican-democrat-twitter-election/\">a recent Washington Post investigation</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2176089209.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Elon Musk, onstage with Trump at a rally, jumps in the sir with his arms over his head.\" title=\"Elon Musk, onstage with Trump at a rally, jumps in the sir with his arms over his head.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Elon Musk jumped onstage at an  October 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and became a meme in the process. | Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans have also changed their minds about the platform’s impact on democracy. While Twitter was once <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/release/the-cover-up-big-tech-the-swamp-and-mainstream-media-coordinated-to-censor-americans-free-speech-%EF%BF%BC/'\">framed</a> as the platform that censored conservative voices, X has become the right’s favorite place for freedom. Only 17 percent of Republicans thought Twitter was good for democracy in 2021, but 53 percent said X was good for democracy in 2024, according to the Pew study.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Democratic users are much more likely to think people getting harassed is a major problem on the platform, and on the flip side, Republicans who post about politics are especially likely to do so because their views feel welcome there,” Colleen McClain, one of the authors of the Pew study, told me this week. McClain added that “in recent years, we haven&#8217;t seen any mass exodus or flocking to or from X in our data, either overall or by party.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of this should come as a huge surprise if you’ve spent any time on X. But the partisan split took on new dimensions leading up to this year’s election, if only because the Republicans who felt like their voices were heard on X also felt heard at the ballot box.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their guy won, and maybe <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-far-right-supporters-violent-memes/\">the weird, violent memes on X</a> helped.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Elon Musk is just getting started</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t know if X will grow or change — or just stay its same problematic self — as Trump prepares to take office again. We do know Musk isn’t done with politics. Musk was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html\">at Trump’s side</a> at Mar-a-Lago as the results rolled in on election night, and there’s good reason to believe we’ll see the SpaceX owner in DC soon enough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As far as politics go, Musk says <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/06/elon-musk-trump-victory/\">he’s not done funding political races</a>. In a livestream on X, Musk said his America PAC would “keep going after this election, and prepare for the midterms and any intermediate elections.” Trump, meanwhile, said in his victory speech, “We have a new star. A star is born — Elon!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In September, Trump <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/trump-vows-15-corporate-tax-and-taps-musk-for-federal-audit?sref=qYiz2hd0\">promised Musk a role</a> heading up a task force to review federal expenditures, one that would make “drastic reforms” to the federal government. This makes sense because Musk had been the one who pitched the idea for such a task force to the president-elect. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-musk-secretary-of-cost-cutting-1235132825/\">suggested a new job title</a>, “Secretary of Cost Cutting,” while Musk suggested he&#8217;d be head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which does not exist and whose acronym is a reference to <a href=\"https://dogecoin.com/\">a dog-themed cryptocurrency</a>. Musk later said at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally that he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/what-trump-election-means-for-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-spacex?sref=qYiz2hd0\">wanted to cut $2 trillion</a> from the federal budget, which would be very difficult.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s easy, however, to see how Musk’s many companies <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/06/2024/elon-musk-is-techs-big-winner-in-the-us-election\">stand to benefit immensely</a> from a close relationship with the Trump administration. SpaceX is already one of NASA’s primary contractors, pulling in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-for-iss-reentry-destruction.html\">hundreds of millions</a> if not <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/nasa-awards-spacex-more-crew-flights-to-space-station/\">several billions of dollars</a> with every contract. Musk’s contact with Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187\">reportedly put these contracts in jeopardy</a>, although knowing what we know about <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-putin-talked-many-7-2021-new-book-claims-rcna174528\">Trump’s affinity</a> for the Russian autocrat, the president-elect might not mind this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tesla also stands to benefit, which explains why the company’s stock soared after Trump’s victory was secured. The EV company wants to roll out a massive fleet of robotaxis, a tall order that comes with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-promises-paid-robotaxis-next-year-significant-hurdles-remain-2024-10-24/\">significant regulatory challenges</a>. Tesla’s self-driving car program in general has faced pushback from federal authorities, including a recently announced <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/business/tesla-self-driving-investigation.html\">investigation into the system</a>. Regulatory approval and investigations can be easier, of course, if you bankrolled the president’s final push to reelection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk’s bet on developing artificial general intelligence, xAI, can also look forward to more cooperation from the federal government. The second Trump administration could pave the way for xAI to get access to cheap energy, especially as it faces heat <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/musks-xai-operating-gas-turbines-without-permits-data-center-environmental-group-2024-08-28/\">for running gas generators without permits</a> to power its data center in Memphis.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1244262469.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.8035109331691,100,92.392978133662\" alt=\"Elon Musk carries a bathroom sink into Twitter headquarters.\" title=\"Elon Musk carries a bathroom sink into Twitter headquarters.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The image of Elon Musk carrying a sink won laughs online but did not endear the billionaire to his new employees at Twitter. | Twitter/AFP/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Twitter/AFP/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On top of these lucrative potential deals, the idea that X might win new relevance and influence must feel like a bonus to Musk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For its right-wing users, though, X is finally the digital town square they were promised so many months ago. It seems like just yesterday, Musk was carrying a sink into Twitter’s headquarters on his first day as the company’s owner. (“Let that sink in” is supposed to be the joke there.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Musk paid tribute to that post on X just after midnight on election night.

At times, Trump’s methods <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta\">strained US relationships</a>, and made the US the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/25/17900980/un-trump-laughed-at\">target of ridicule</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He was clear throughout his campaign that a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance\">second term would feature the same approach</a>, threatening to impose sweeping <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trumps-new-tariff-proposal-could-cost-americans-78-bln-annual-spending-nrf-study-2024-11-04/\">new tariffs</a> (even on allies), suggesting changes to how the US works with NATO, and promising a <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/41800\">rapid end to the war in Ukraine</a>.&nbsp;Ahead of his election, reports suggested <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gr90jnxjvo\">some US allies were worried</a> about a Trump win. Now that he is headed back to the White House, world leaders from across the political spectrum have had a range of reactions from firm enthusiasm, to muted optimism, to silence. Here’s what they’ve had to say.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A range of responses in conflict zones</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to offer Trump hearty congratulations for his “historic” return to the presidency. Trump’s win “offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1854070348926328965\">Netanyahu wrote on the social media site X</a>. “This is a huge victory!”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Netanyahu and Trump enjoyed a close relationship during Trump’s first term, and they have much in common; they are both nationalists, and have both faced significant legal obstacles to their leadership. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected\">Trump is a convicted felon</a>, and Netanyahu has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/world/netanyahu-corruption-trial-resumes/index.html\">thus far successfully avoided conviction on corruption charges</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As president, Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a symbolic move that tacitly affirmed the contested city as Israel’s, and pushed Arab countries to normalize ties with Israel through the Abraham Accords. Under a second Trump administration, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-rightist-government-celebrates-trump-claims-victory-2024-11-06/\">support for Israel and Netanyahu is likely to increase</a>; though he has called for a conclusion to the war in Gaza (which the Biden administration has financially and diplomatically supported) he has also given Netanyahu a green light to “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/trump-netanyahu-support-gaza-lebanon/\">do what you have to do</a>” in Gaza and implied <a href=\"https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossneakpeek&amp;stream=top\">he no longer believes in a two-state solution</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump does not have the same warm relationship with Palestinian leaders, who were more measured in their statements. Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/president-abbas-congratulates-president-trump-winning-us-presidential?fid=537046&amp;nid=405861&amp;topic=Israel%2527s%2520war%2520on%2520Gaza\">congratulated Trump in a statement</a>, saying, “we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.” Hamas leaders were much more circumspect, saying, “Our position on the new US administration depends on its positions and practical behavior towards our Palestinian people, their legitimate rights and their just cause.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ukraine also has deep military ties to the US at the moment; the US has been Ukraine’s largest security backer by far as the country continues its nearly three-year-long fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1854073411904938032\">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> offered his congratulations and made clear his hopes for the second Trump term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Measured, but optimistic responses from allies</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other allies, particularly in Europe, offered a range of cautiously optimistic responses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4976102-nato-mark-rutte-donald-trump-2024-election-win/\">NATO’s new chief Mark Rutte</a> said he would work alongside Trump to “advance peace through strength through NATO.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s attitude toward the alliance —&nbsp;as with international affairs more broadly —&nbsp;is highly transactional. In his first term, he regularly disparaged the security alliance, complained that European nations were not contributing enough financially, and pulled nearly a third of US troops out of Germany at the end of his presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Trump&#8217;s criticism all along has been that America&#8217;s friends, partners, and allies free ride on its security guarantee and steal jobs from the United States,” <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/expert/james-m-lindsay\">James M. Lindsay</a>, a senior fellow in US foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">European leaders like centrist French President Emmanuel Macron, center-left British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and right-wing Italian President Giorgia Meloni all congratulated Trump and expressed their desire to enhance the trans-Atlantic partnership under a second term, as did European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, those desires may be tested by a tariff plan Trump has floated. He’s expressed a willingness to enact tariffs of as much as 20 percent from most trading partners, including friendly nations. Anticipating a Trump victory, European Union leaders have tried to <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-war-donald-trump-elections-triumphs-board-tariffs-transatlantic-relations/\">prepare by proposing retaliatory tariffs on US imports</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/worlds-largest-trade-and-investment-relationship-hangs-balance\">US is the EU’s largest trading partner</a>, and the bloc’s economy took a hit when Trump imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum during his first term.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>US adversaries stay silent</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">US adversaries China and Russia have had less to say about Trump’s victory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Trump has praised in the past, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-medvedev-says-trump-presidency-would-be-blow-ukraine-2024-11-06/\">has not publicly congratulated Trump</a>, nor has <a href=\"https://fortune.com/asia/2024/11/06/china-says-it-hopes-for-peaceful-coexistence-with-u-s-as-trump-clinches-win/\">Chinese President Xi Jinping</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-medvedev-says-trump-presidency-would-be-blow-ukraine-2024-11-06/\">suggested on Wednesday that</a> official congratulations weren’t likely to be forthcoming, saying, “we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state,” referring to US support for Ukraine. Trump has said that he would bring a stop to Russia’s war in Ukraine within a 24-hour period, without discussing how that would be possible. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though there are some indications that Russia and Ukraine might come to the negotiating table, Peskov was circumspect about the US’s role in making that happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have repeatedly said that the US is able to contribute to the end of this conflict,” he said.&nbsp;“Will this happen, and if so, how &#8230; we will see after January,” when Trump takes office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Xi has not publicly congratulated Trump either. Trump <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/september/ustr-finalizes-tariffs-200\">slapped China with massive tariffs in 2018</a>, and threatened 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports during a second term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/news/china-says-hopes-for-peaceful-coexistence-with-us-as-trump-on-brink-of-victory-673c3d3f\">Mao Ning said during a Wednesday press conference</a>. When asked if Xi would call Trump to congratulate him on the win, she said the ministry would “handle related matters in accordance with usual practice” following the official announcement of election results. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

However, one key factor may have been voters’ widespread dissatisfaction with the economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Enduring pessimism about the US economy has puzzled political analysts, given that most <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-kamala-harris-policies-how-strong-is-the-economy-election/\">major indicators suggest it is strong</a> and that the US has recovered <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-recovery-from-covid-19-in-international-comparison/#:~:text=A%20combination%20of%20unprecedented%20fiscal,now%20entering%20its%20fourth%20year.\">better than other countries</a> from a pandemic-induced slump. Inflation has <a href=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-\">come down significantly</a> from its peak in June 2022, slowing price hikes for basic goods. The Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates, making borrowing money cheaper. The economy has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/us-gdp-economy-third-quarter-2024-59bf100b\">continued to grow at a solid rate</a>. Unemployment <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2023/02/news-unemployment-its-lowest-level-54-years\">dipped to its lowest level in 54 years</a> in 2023 and stayed within a desirable range.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On paper, everything looked great. But in <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx\">poll</a> after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/elections/trump-harris-economy-poll.html\">poll</a> ahead of the election, voters signaled concern for the economy and ranked inflation as their top issue. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/exit-polls-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X04.ZwKX.5orIonRhVE1e&amp;smid=url-share\">rough, preliminary voting data</a> available in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-exit-poll-voters-express-concern-democracy-economy-rcna178602\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-exit-poll-voters-express-concern-democracy-economy-rcna178602\">exit polling</a> showed the same trend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the heart of that disconnect might be elements that broad economic indicators often struggle to capture: Despite a “strong economy,” many Americans continued to feel the burden of higher prices, struggled to find work, and took on more debt. And the Election Day results suggest they blamed Democrats — specifically President Joe Biden and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris — for those problems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s what the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23815490/joe-biden-economy-bidenomics-jobs-inflation-2024-election\">rosy portraits of the economy embraced by Democrats</a> may have missed.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>There was a real inflation backlash</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though inflation is now down to 2.4 percent from its post-pandemic high of 9.1 percent, it’s been clear for months that Americans are still hurting financially and psychologically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wage growth has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/economy/inflation-wages-pay-salaries.html#:~:text=The%20various%20data%20sources%20agree,for%20more%20than%20two%20years.\">caught up with inflation</a> on average. But wage gains haven’t been uniform: The lowest-paid workers saw some of the biggest gains, particularly in the leisure and hospitality sectors, but other industries, from advertising to chemical manufacturing, saw their wages decline relative to inflation. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/x7ic1-overall-wage-growth-has-outpaced-inflation-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.639724417981,100,70.720551164037\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicole Narea/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even if workers received raises that outpaced inflation, that doesn’t help with sticker shock. Research has shown that consumers have an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/business/inflation-reference-price-food.html\">internalized “reference price”</a> — a conception of what constitutes a fair price for a good they routinely purchase. If that imagined price doesn’t match up with reality, consumers feel short-changed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though a person’s reference price can change, it usually does so slowly, following the normal pace of inflation (roughly 2 percent per year). Consumers haven’t had much time to adjust amid rapid inflation in recent years. That causes them to overestimate inflation: An August YouGov poll found that most <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50358-kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-election-democratic-convention-inflation-israel-hamas-russia-ukraine-august-17-20-2024-economist-yougov-poll\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50358-kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-election-democratic-convention-inflation-israel-hamas-russia-ukraine-august-17-20-2024-economist-yougov-poll\">consumers think inflation is significantly higher</a> than it actually is. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Consumers also often <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2022/04/18/clearing-up-common-misconceptions-about-inflation/\">misunderstand how inflation works</a>. The important thing to know is that it only goes one way: When inflation decreases, that just means that prices are increasing less quickly, not that they are going down. (That can happen, though rarely.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prices going down, a phenomenon known as deflation, would be a potentially worrying signal about the health of the economy. If consumers pay less for a good, that can translate to less money to pay the workers who produce and distribute it, leading to less consumer spending overall and slower economic growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The job market is tougher</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The days of the pandemic-era “Great Resignation”— when employers struggled to hire and workers had their pick of jobs and the ability to demand higher wages — are well and truly over. The unemployment rate has ticked up in recent months to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html\">4.1 percent</a>, and job growth has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html\">slowed to levels not seen since 2020</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is still within the realm of what economists would consider low unemployment. But the top-line rate doesn’t tell the full story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, people are <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/october-jobs-report-release-today/card/americans-are-staying-unemployed-longer-mqIm7uv9DpczwYkLDdfQ\">staying unemployed for longer</a>: 1.6 million Americans were unemployed for a period of at least 27 weeks in October, compared to just 1.3 million the same month last year.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/vKk9Y-more-people-are-facing-long-term-unemployment.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.809066478228,100,66.381867043544\" alt=\"Chart showing the number of people who remained unemployed for 27 weeks or more over the last 8 years.\" title=\"Chart showing the number of people who remained unemployed for 27 weeks or more over the last 8 years.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicole Narea/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many workers may also find themselves underemployed, stuck in part-time work or a job that doesn’t require their training or qualifications. This is especially true for recent college graduates, over half of whom were underemployed a year after graduation, according to a <a href=\"https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/research/underemployment\">February report</a> by the Burning Glass Institute and the Strada Institute for the Future of Work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some industries are also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html\">cutting jobs</a>. That includes jobs in manufacturing and temporary help services, which have decreased by 577,000 since March 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The overall unemployment rate doesn’t really reflect these nuances, which suggest Americans’ work lives may not be as rosy as the top-line number makes them appear.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Americans have less money and are taking on more debt</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After a brief spike in savings rates during the pandemic due to a series of stimulus checks, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT\">Americans are now saving less</a> than they were pre-pandemic. This creates a cycle where Americans have less money, so they borrow more. Because interest rates have been high, borrowing has become more expensive, leaving them with even less money.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/mZ2kM-americans-are-saving-less-after-the-pandemic.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.907343884777,100,62.185312230447\" alt=\"Chart showing a decrease in savings rates following the pandemic. \" title=\"Chart showing a decrease in savings rates following the pandemic. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Nicole Narea/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans are pulling from their now-depleted savings and amassing debt on credit cards and other revolving credit plans in which consumers can repeatedly borrow money up to a set limit and repay in installments. The total amount of credit card debt in the US reached an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-have-your-credit-card-debt-forgiven-this-november/\">all-time high of $1.14 trillion</a> as of October, with individuals owing an average of $8,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Credit card delinquency rates have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS\">gone up</a>. Young adults in particular, many of whom are also struggling with high <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/student-loan-debt\">student loan debt</a>, are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/credit-card-balances-jump-to-new-1point13-trillion-record-at-end-of-2023.html\">increasingly falling behind on their credit card payments</a>. At some point, something has to give.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This might be part of the reason many Americans still yearn for the economy under Trump in 2019, when they had more cash on hand and weren’t staring down so much debt.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

My younger kid, who is 2, does not know what an election is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is, of course, a privilege to be oblivious to national events, a privilege not every child has — the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/\">millions of children</a> who live with unauthorized immigrant parents, for example, could be very deeply affected by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies\">Trump’s “mass deportation” plan</a> if he’s able to follow through with it. And the outcome of the election will impact the future of all children, in the US and around the world, through its effects on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/379450/election-2024-climate-stakes-presidential-race\">climate change</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/381636/trump-2024-democracy-threat-orban-second-term\">American democracy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/380060/trump-world-risks-war\">foreign policy</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ll be talking to my kids in the months and years ahead about all these issues. If you’re looking to start having more conversations with the kids in your life about elections and democratic participation, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/381410/kids-teens-politics-election-misinformation\">Vox’s Allie Volpe has tips</a> on how to do that. I especially like her advice to teach children about civic engagement, something that can be easier to do on a local level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My older kid wrote (okay, he dictated) to New York City Mayor Eric Adams earlier this year to protest proposed cuts to library budgets, and Adams eventually reversed those cuts, thanks in no small part to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/nyc-libraries-funding-restored/index.html\">more than 174,000 letters</a> he received from concerned New Yorkers. It was a hopeful moment in what has been (at least for adults) a year of enormous <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/even-better/379814/election-anxiety-stress-coping-strategies-control-community\">political</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/381475/elections-donald-trump-kamala-harris-anxiety-progress-voting\">stress</a>. I think my kid felt he could have a real impact on our city, however small (his campaign to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/354457/new-york-congestion-pricing-traffic-big-mistake\">reinstate congestion pricing</a> has yet to bear similar fruit).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids’ lives are often hyperlocal — they are affected most by their families, their schools, their immediate communities. In a way, though, that’s true of all of us — my colleague Marina Bolotnikova recently noted that her technique for managing election anxiety was to “realize how much my quality of life has to do more with state/local policy than national elections and adjust my attention accordingly.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As we all process the results of this week’s election, I’ll be thinking about what my family and I can do on a local scale, and what so many are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/nyregion/migrant-family-gofundme.html\">already doing</a>, no matter who’s in the White House. I also want to hear from you — have the kids in your life been asking about the election? How are they feeling? How are you talking to them about what’s going on, and about the future? What’s bringing you hope and fear right now?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:anna.north@vox.com\">anna.north@vox.com</a>, and I’ll be back next week.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I’m reading</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2024/11/nj-students-vote-mock-election-president-senator-members-house-representatives/\">Thousands of New Jersey students</a> voted in this year’s <a href=\"https://njmockelection.org/\">New Jersey Mock Election</a>, a project to teach kids about being an informed voter. “We realized how the citizens of America determine our leadership. It’s really amazing,” one eighth-grader <a href=\"https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2024/11/nj-students-vote-mock-election-president-senator-members-house-representatives/\">told NJ Spotlight News</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As kids’ school lunch accounts <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/life/379082/school-tracking-apps-grades-google-classroom-classdojo\">move online</a>, payment processors are charging families fees just to put money into their accounts. Now the USDA is <a href=\"https://www.k12dive.com/news/usda-school-meal-junk-fees-ban-reduced-price-meals/731741/\">moving to ban those fees</a> — but not until the 2027–28 school year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kids are <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2024/11/chat-gen-alpha-teens-slang-twitch-streamers.html\">calling each other “chat.”</a> Also, “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/life/369953/skibidi-tweens-gen-alpha-brainrot-ipad-kids\">Ohio</a>” is over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My younger kid keeps demanding repeat readings of what he calls “raccoon” — actually <a href=\"https://penguinrandomhouselibrary.com/book/?isbn=9780803739475\"><em>Secret Pizza Party</em></a><em>, </em>by the team who brought you <a href=\"https://www.dragonslovetacos.com/\"><em>Dragons Love Tacos</em></a>. <em>SPP</em> is about a raccoon who dresses up like a human to steal pizza, and then there’s a party, and everyone is wearing masks for some reason. Honestly, I don’t understand this one.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From my inbox</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A Texas reader wrote in that he brought his 7-year-old son to the polls this year. “The biggest deal to him was the election workers who made a big deal about a ‘future voter’ being there,” he said. “Kids generally like getting stickers but he seemed particularly pleased with this one.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“My wife took our youngest daughter this week,” he added. “She seemed similarly pleased with the sticker and the big highlight was her loudly chanting, ‘Washington for president! I want Washington for president!’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an unorthodox suggestion, but one apparently shared by several voters who <a href=\"https://www.wric.com/news/u-s-world/write-ins-hardly-win-but-these-characters-celeb-and-non-candidates-are-popular-options/\">wrote in “George Washington” on their 2020 ballots</a>; other write-in candidates included Mickey Mouse, the Hulk, and “giant meteor.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters on Tuesday, “We identified the source, and it was from Russia.” Polling sites in the swing states of Michigan and Arizona <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/pollls-voting-bomb-threats.html\">also received threats</a>, though it’s unclear if these was part of the same campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other officials have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/pollls-voting-bomb-threats.html\">suggested</a> that someone could have been spoofing Russian email addresses, and the Russian government was quick to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-denies-it-was-behind-us-bomb-hoaxes-or-incendiary-devices-planes-2024-11-06/\">deny any involvement</a>. The US intelligence community <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russia-pushing-election-fraud-lies-swing-states-us-intelligence-community-says/400814/?oref=d1-homepage-top-story&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20November%2006%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief\">had warned prior</a> to the election that the Russian government was promoting disinformation via social media in the US in order to “undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences.” US authorities say the Russian government had been behind smear attacks targeting Democratic <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5161376/russia-tim-walz-video-disinformation\">vice presidential candidate Tim Walz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/russia-and-iran-ramping-up-influence-campaigns-targeting-us-voters-federal-agencies-say\">false allegations of voter fraud</a>, among other examples of disinformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As anyone following American politics over the past decade knows, the Russian government has tried to meddle in US campaigns before. As was the case in the past two elections, the Russian government <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-centers/2024-elections-fpc/30-day-election-security-update-from-intelligence-community\">was believed to prefer Trump</a>, who speaks frequently of his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and has been critical of both NATO and US support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This time, though, it ultimately may not have mattered that much. Though Russian disinformation was widely spread, including by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-shared-tenet-content-thought-part-russian-plot-rcna171520\">X owner and Trump backer Elon Musk</a>, nothing the Kremlin allegedly orchestrated in this election cycle appears to have had anywhere near the political impact of the hacking of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-the-russians-hacked-the-dnc-and-passed-its-emails-to-wikileaks/2018/07/13/af19a828-86c3-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html\">Democratic National Committee in 2016</a>, which US intelligence agencies also believe Russia orchestrated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist and analyst who has written several books on Russia’s security services, says this year’s campaign targeting the US election differed from past efforts. It was also different from recent alleged campaigns of fraud to help Moscow’s preferred candidates in elections in the former Soviet states of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/nx-s1-5175108/accusation-of-kremlin-inspired-election-fraud-sparks-protests-in-country-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7w9dglzzlo\">Moldova</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The goal was not actually to change the results of the election,” Soldatov told Vox. “It was about posturing, about reminding Americans what’s at stake, and sending a message about what might happen if America continues its support for Ukraine.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though the election is over, Russia’s efforts to transmit this message are not, and they ultimately might take forms that are more violent and destructive than empty bomb threats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Out of the gray zone and into the blue</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Two days before the election, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-plot-us-planes-incendiary-devices-de3b8c0a\">Wall Street Journal<em> </em>reported</a> that Western security services believed two incendiary devices seized on board planes in Europe over the summer were a test run for a Russian operation to start fires on US-bound planes. The devices detonated without injuries at logistics hubs in Germany and the UK, but the head of Poland’s intelligence agency said, “I’m not sure the political leaders of Russia are aware of the consequences if one of these packages exploded, causing a mass casualty event.” The Russian government has denied involvement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This follows a campaign of arson and sabotage across Europe that intelligence officials say demonstrates an increasing recklessness on the part of the Kremlin. As the head of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/13/vladimir-putins-spies-are-plotting-global-chaos\">Britain’s foreign intelligence service MI6 put i</a>t, “Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral, frankly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/olympics/362512/olympics-paris-isis-russia-terrorism-security\">In recent months</a>, Russian agents have been accused of plotting sabotage attacks against US and German military targets, arson attacks in the UK and Lithuania, and the attempted assassination of a major German defense contractor, among other plots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, Soldatov said this campaign goes beyond anything the KGB has attempted in Europe or the United States during the Cold War and should be seen as an attempt by Moscow to raise the costs of Western support for Ukraine, an effort that is separate from but complementary to Putin’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin\">periodic threats to use nuclear weapons</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“People sometimes think the only way Russia can escalate is with nuclear weapons,” Soldatov said. “But what we’ve seen in 2024 is that there are actually many more ways to escalate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disinformation and sabotage are the kinds of tactics often referred to as “gray zone” or “hybrid” warfare: inflicting costs on an adversary while maintaining plausible deniability. The aim here is to cause just enough damage to get the point across without leaving an opening for an all-out military war. But that line is a narrow one, and some officials say Russia’s behavior is pushing the gray zone’s limits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the NATO summit in Washington in July, Lithuania’s foreign minister <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/olympics/362512/olympics-paris-isis-russia-terrorism-security\">said on a panel</a>, “I’m not sure it can be called hybrid events or gray zone events any longer. It’s quite clear that [these are] terrorist attacks by a hostile neighboring country against NATO countries.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Moscow gets its man</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, after all, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/trump-election-ukraine-war-russia-intl/index.html\">promised</a> to immediately end the war in Ukraine, presumably by pressuring Kyiv to accede to at least some of Moscow’s demands. Could the Kremlin dial back the campaign now that its preferred candidate is returning to the White House? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s possible. Russian leaders reacted with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37928171\">open jubilation to Trump’s victory in 2016</a> but were largely disappointed with <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/us-election-russia-reaction-trump-biden-putin/30922669.html\">his administration</a>, which, for all his kind words for Putin, also saw a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/on-the-record-the-u-s-administrations-actions-on-russia/\">raft of new sanctions</a> against Moscow and the sale of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-approves-sale-anti-tank-weapons-ukraine/story?id=65989898\">anti-tank weapons to Ukraine</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moscow is being much more cautious this time around. In a <a href=\"https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1979574/\">statement Wednesday responding</a> to Trump’s victory, the Russian foreign ministry credited him with countering the “globalist” course of America’s current administration. It also added, “We have no illusions about the president-elect, who is well known in Russia &#8230; the US ruling political elite adheres to anti-Russia principles and the policy of ‘containing Moscow.’ This line does not depend on changes in America’s domestic political barometer.”   </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the risks of engaging in gray zone tactics is that you can’t always be sure how your opponent will react, and it’s difficult to know when a red line is finally crossed. Trump, for one, has prided himself on his unpredictability. Like everyone else after what happened on Tuesday, Putin is likely waiting to see what comes next.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

While that doesn’t translate to policy, it does show that the markets are betting that the private prison industry will likely flourish under the next Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This kind of market behavior is to be expected, since investors <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/spencerykwon/files/extreme_news_overreaction.pdf\">often overreact</a> to news events. But even if today’s movement is a temporary price spike, that doesn’t change the fact that the company itself has been betting on a Trump presidency to make a fortune. GEO Group’s spending on its lobbying efforts <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/07/private-prison-giant-geo-group-ramps-up-lobbying-on-immigrant-surveillance/\">peaked during the Trump administration</a>, and slowed down after President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-prisons-coronavirus-pandemic-c8c246f00695f37ef2afb1dd3a5f115e\">announced</a> that he would phase out the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) contracts with private prisons. The company had <a href=\"https://www.context.news/surveillance/trump-election-win-could-fuel-us-private-prison-boom\">also donated to Trump’s inauguration</a> in 2017 and even hosted one of its annual events at one of his properties. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This time around, GEO Group’s PAC <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/private-prison-behemoth-is-first-corporation-to-max-out-to-trump/\">maxed out on its contributions</a> to Trump’s campaign and gave a pro-Trump super PAC a $500,000 contribution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reason is obvious: The company views a second Trump term as a boon to its business, which relies on government contracts. And since Trump is planning a mass deportation campaign, that would likely mean the federal government will arrest and detain more migrants. In a recent earnings call with its investors, GEO Group&nbsp; executives <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/31/trump-deportation-company-profits/75732590007/\">suggested</a> that if Trump won, his policies could bolster the amount of money being sent to its detention facilities that have contracts with ICE.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Trump liked to tout <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-first-step-act-and-whats-happening-it\">his bipartisan criminal justice reform bill</a>, which was enacted in 2018, signs like today’s market response to his victory show that private, for-profit prisons are expecting to see big returns when he returns to the White House. That’s an alarming reality because conditions in private prisons, including <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/geo-group-centurion-covid-19/\">ones run by GEO Group</a>, tend to be worse than in federal facilities, as <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/e1606.pdf\">a 2016 DOJ report pointed out</a>. The problem was so bad that in 2016, the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/08/18/justice-department-says-it-will-end-use-of-private-prisons/?postshare=9221471534255226\">announced it would phase out</a> contracts with private prisons after the DOJ determined that they were less safe for inmates than federally run facilities. (Trump swiftly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-prisons/u-s-reverses-obama-era-move-to-phase-out-private-prisons-idUSKBN1622NN/\">reversed that policy</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The markets don’t always predict policy. But when it comes to where investors are putting their money and who private prison companies like GEO Group supported for president, the bet they are making is clear: A second Trump term is lucrative if you’re in the business of incarcerating people. It’s a pretty good bet.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Or, put another way, Republican Senate candidates are doing worse than Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In recent years, the outcome of a state’s US Senate race has increasingly matched the outcome of its simultaneous presidential race. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/17/13666192/voting-congress-presidency\">Ticket-splitting</a> has decreased in our era of polarization and partisanship. The vast majority of people voting for a presidential candidate also vote for their party’s Senate candidate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But not everyone does that. And there’s still some variation in how much better or worse Senate candidates do compared to the top of the ticket. Looking at that variation can provide clues about what sorts of candidates overperform (even if they don’t actually win).</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP2548082156\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It can also help shape our understanding of national trends. Was there a nationwide backlash against all Democrats? Or was the backlash mostly limited to the presidential candidate?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, Republican Senate candidates overperformed Trump in <a href=\"https://x.com/awprokop/status/1324406190533738497\">most swing states</a>, suggesting that Trump was a drag on the GOP. This year, Democratic Senate candidates overperformed Harris in almost every key race — though often it wasn’t by enough for Democrats to win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s how the Senate candidates in key races performed compared to Harris. The counts aren’t yet finalized so the margins are subject to change, but this is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/\">how things looked</a> as of early Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nebraska</strong>: Independent Dan Osborn’s vote share is about 7 points higher than Harris, but he lost.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Montana</strong>: Sen. Jon Tester’s vote share is also about 7 points higher than Harris. He also lost.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ohio:</strong> Sen. Sherrod Brown’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris. He lost.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Arizona</strong>: Rep. Ruben Gallego’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris and he’s currently leading even though Harris seems on track to lose there.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Texas</strong>: Rep. Colin Allred’s vote share is about 3 points higher than Harris, but he failed to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nevada</strong>: Sen. Jacky Rosen’s vote share was about 2 points higher than Harris. Her race is too close to call.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wisconsin: </strong>Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s vote share was less than 1 point higher than Harris’s, but Baldwin defeated her challenger, Eric Hovde, while Harris lost the state.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Michigan and Pennsylvania</strong>: Both Democratic Senate candidates in these states (Rep. Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Sen. Bob Casey) have vote shares about 1 point higher than Harris’s. Neither race has been called.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pattern was also evident in less competitive races like Minnesota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Virginia, where Democratic Senate candidates outperformed Harris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One notable exception to Tuesday’s down-ballot overperformance trend was Florida, where Debbie Mucarsel-Powell did about the same as Harris (and lost). There’s also Maryland, where Angela Alsobrooks won but did significantly worse than Harris — but that has an obvious explanation in that the state’s popular former governor, Larry Hogan, was the Republican Senate nominee (though his popularity wasn’t enough to power him to a win in an otherwise blue state).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So why were there so many voters casting their ballots for Trump and Democratic Senate candidates?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some might argue for racism or sexism explaining Harris’s struggles, but I’d note that several of the Democratic candidates who overperformed Harris were nonwhite or female. Others might argue that she was a uniquely flawed candidate or campaigner, but President Joe Biden was on track to do much worse if he’d stayed in the race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My suspicion is that Harris’s electoral struggles were more about Biden’s unpopularity and her association with his administration than any newfound love of the American public for the Republican Party generally. (This is also reflected in the House of Representatives contest currently looking <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html\">somewhat close</a> and in Democratic success at the state level in <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/11/06/nc-democrats-break-gop-legislative-supermajority\">places like North Carolina</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Call them the “I don’t like Republicans much, but the economy was better under Trump” voters. Biden lost them, and Harris failed to get them back.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"How Trump’s second term will be different\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gK6MD_8S01o?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Vice President Kamala Harris performed worse than President Joe Biden did in 2020 nearly everywhere: in big cities and rural areas, in blue states and red ones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of the conventional explanations for why a campaign fails —&nbsp;things like messaging choices, or whether candidates campaigned enough in the right places — <a href=\"https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/\">cannot account for such a sweeping shift</a>. Such factors matter on the margins and among specific demographic groups, but Harris received a decisive, across-the-board rebuke.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To explain what truly happened, we need to look at global trends as a point of comparison. And when we do, a clear picture emerges: What happened on Tuesday is part of a worldwide wave of anti-incumbent sentiment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">2024 was the largest year of elections in global history; more people voted this year than ever before. And across the world, voters told the party in power —&nbsp;regardless of their ideology or history — that it was time for a change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We saw this anti-incumbent wave in elections in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/359363/uk-french-election-results-2024-britain-england-france-biden\">United Kingdom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-its-majority-this-weeks-election-mmegi-newspaper-2024-11-01/\">Botswana</a>; in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353785/india-election-2024-modi-bjp\">India</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/north-macedonia-parliament-approves-new-nationalist-dominated-government-2024-06-23/\">North Macedonia</a>; and in <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-koreas-2024-general-election-results-and-implications\">South Korea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355328/south-africa-apartheid-cyril-ramaphosa-anc-jacob-zuma-mk-elecitons-parliament\">South Africa</a>. It continued a global trend begun in the previous year, when voters in <a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/poland-democracy-wins/\">Poland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/17/24003970/argentina-president-javier-milei\">Argentina</a> opted to move on from current leadership. The handful of 2024 exceptions to this general rule look like true outliers: The incumbent party’s victory in Mexico, for example, came after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-democracy-polarization-unhappy-719d47908aca0b421ff3b9bef33e350c\">20 straight defeats for incumbents across Latin America</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given Trump’s victory, we can confidently say the United States is not exceptional. Three different <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2024-exit-polls-fears-american-democracy-economic-discontent/story?id=115529546\">exit polls</a> found that at least <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/exit-poll-results-72-americans-unhappy-way-us-going-1980904\">70 percent</a> of Americans were <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/election-exit-poll-seven-in-10-voters-say-us-going-in-wrong-direction/\">dissatisfied</a> with the country’s current direction, and they took it out on the current ruling party. (While exit polls are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/exit-polls-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X04.ZwKX.5orIonRhVE1e&amp;smid=url-share\">based on preliminary, rather than comprehensive, data</a> sets, it is notable that so many polls appear to be picking up on the same trend.) Trump registered as the change candidate despite being a former president himself, and the voters rewarded him accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once we start thinking about the US election result as part of a global trend, rather than an isolated event, we can start to make a little more sense of what just happened here.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP2548082156\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why you can’t understand Trump’s victory without the global trend</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Reading the American press today, you see a lot of focus on granular campaign choices. Did Harris lose because she <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14048557/Democratic-Party-blame-game-Kamala-Harris-election-loss-Joe-Biden-Tim-Walz.html\">picked the wrong vice president</a>? Emphasized <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/380750/harris-trump-closing-message-fascism-democracy-authoritarianism\">the wrong issues</a>? Targeted <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/11/harris-trump-election-messaging-populism-elites\">the wrong kinds of voters</a>? Appeared on <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/debug/kamala-harris-election-loss-joe-rogan-podcast/\">the wrong kind of media</a>?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps one of these theories will prove to have merit. We don’t have enough data yet to be sure. But if the story were fundamentally about messaging or targeting, you’d expect her to improve on Biden’s total in some places and do worse in others. The problem is that none of them on their own can explain a truly uniform shift across the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can’t explain Harris’s defeat in terms of losses with the white working class when she also seems to have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198\">done worse than Biden with nonwhite workers and college graduates based on early data</a>. You can&#8217;t focus primarily on her stance on Gaza alienating Arab and Muslim voters when her margin of defeat was far larger than the defections in that group. Ditto with Latinos, and every other subgroup that postmortems are beginning to focus on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Uniform swings call for uniform explanations. And the most plausible one, given global context, is anti-incumbency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The central plot lines of the [2024 election] are already clear, and not that dissimilar from four years ago,” the political scientist <a href=\"https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/\">John Sides writes at Good Authority</a>. “In 2020, an unpopular incumbent lost reelection. In 2024, an unpopular incumbent’s party lost reelection.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such an explanation makes more sense than a pure focus on ideology. In fact, the global context suggests that a Republican president likely would have also performed poorly if they were in office. While some right-wing insurgents have performed well in the past two years, most notably Javier Milei in Argentina, right-wing incumbents have often underperformed —&nbsp;with ruling conservative parties in Britain, India, and Poland all suffering notable setbacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If we are indeed seeing America fall in line with the global pattern, it clarifies some of what just happened. But it also raises a new, difficult question: Why are people so<em> </em>dissatisfied with their governments at this particular point in time?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One credible answer is inflation. Countries around the world experienced rising prices after the Covid-19 pandemic and attendant global supply chain disruptions, and <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/06/two-studies-explore-americans-perception-of-inflation/\">voters hate inflation</a>. Even though the inflation rate has gone down in quite a few places, including the United States, prices remain much higher than they were prior to the pandemic. People remember the low prices they’ve lost, and they are hurting —&nbsp;hurting enough that they see <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/3-reasons-bidens-strong-economy-is-unpopular.html\">an otherwise-booming economy as a failure</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As much sense as the inflation story makes, it remains an unproven one. We’ll need a lot more evidence, including detailed data on the US election that isn’t available yet, to be sure whether it’s right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But we can be fairly confident, given reams of polling data showing Americans were dissatisfied with the country’s direction, that a desire for a change in leadership played at least some role in Trump’s return to power — part of a global trend away from stability and toward upheaval, however chaotic or even dangerous it will prove to be.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

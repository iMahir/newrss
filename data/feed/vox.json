Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,” Biden wrote in a post on X, <a href=\"https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933\">formerly known as Twitter.</a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best… <a href=\"https://t.co/x8DnvuImJV\">pic.twitter.com/x8DnvuImJV</a></p>&mdash; Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 21, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That endorsement puts Harris in a prime position to assume her party’s presidential nomination ahead of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024\">wide field of other potential choices</a>, including<strong> </strong>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though Democrats have a deep bench of talent, perhaps no one makes as much sense to replace Biden as Harris, who’s already in a role designed to take over for a president unable to continue their duties — and who now has his backing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As VP, she’s steeped in the policy work of this administration, and has extensive experience in the White House that she could bring to the job. And she could well be an energizing candidate for many Democratic voters as the first Black and South Asian woman to have the party’s presidential nomination, and as a younger, charismatic alternative to the 78-year-old Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. Logistically, it would also be fairly easy to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-biden-fundraising-election-campaign-donations-5709f07420b4f138caa884361653368e#\">transfer Biden’s $91 million in campaign funds to Harris</a> (and more difficult to hand that money over to someone else).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, Harris has real vulnerabilities — which have been evident during her tenure as VP and as a 2020 presidential candidate — that could potentially bog her down in the general election. Notably, <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article289792134.html\">her favorability ratings have sometimes lagged Biden’s</a> while she’s been vice president, and a common critique she faces is that she hasn’t been able to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html\">carve out a distinct lane for herself</a>. When she ran for the presidency in 2020, she fielded similar issues, leaving people confused about what she stood for. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taken together, there’s plenty of evidence that Harris could be a strong nominee. Notably, though, there are also some key challenges she’ll have to overcome. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The case for Kamala Harris taking over for Biden</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the Democratic nominee, Harris would have some version of the incumbency advantage as the sitting vice president. Though there are important caveats, as detailed by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/23562688/joe-biden-2024-presidential-election-polls-democrats\">my colleague Andrew Prokop</a>, roughly two of three incumbents have won reelection. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As part of that advantage, Harris would be able to tout her role in the Biden administration’s wins — like the Inflation Reduction Act, which will help lower prescription drug costs and invest in climate initiatives, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes historic funding for bridges and roads. She’d be able to point, too, to the experience she’s garnered as vice president and how it’s prepared her to become commander-in-chief.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a strategy Biden himself successfully employed in 2020, when he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/16/20863343/joe-biden-barack-obama-2020-democratic-presidential-primary\">linked himself to the Obama administration’s achievements</a> — and emphasized how <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/26/remarks-vice-president-joe-biden-foreign-policy-camapaign-event\">he was often the “last one in the room”</a> when key decisions were being made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When you think about all these legislative pieces that were passed in Congress, the vice president was part of the conversations with the president, with the Cabinet, whether it was the infrastructure bill, or the IRA, or the CHIPS bill,” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/27/23655248/kamala-harris-vice-president-approval-criticism\">former Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who’s worked alongside Harris, previously told Vox</a>. That experience, in itself, is significant and invaluable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understand the push to replace Biden</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President Joe Biden has come under mounting pressure from Democrats to reconsider his reelection bid.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358652/biden-drop-out-debate-harris-convention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Should Biden drop out?

During the 2022 midterm elections, protecting reproductive rights was a central policy for many voters, and a decisive one that helped boost Democrats. Harris’s defense of abortion access is a point that would allow her to paint a sharp contrast with Trump, who has taken credit for <em>Roe</em>’s demise and argued that abortion should be decided on a state-by-state basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the experience she has in the White House, Harris also brings legislative expertise from her four years in the Senate, and background on criminal justice reform from her time as attorney general in California. Although some of her tenure as vice president has been plagued with communications missteps, she’d previously been known for her viral moments questioning Trump appointees as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and made a big splash in 2019 during a debate confrontation of Biden over his past stance on busing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris could infuse the ticket with new energy as well. Numerous polls have found that majorities of Americans didn&#8217;t want Biden on the ballot, including a <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/contest-for-president-still-up-for-grabs/\">July 2024 PBS News/NPR/Marist</a> survey placing that number at 56 percent, and wanted to see <a href=\"https://wapo.st/469LlsL\">options other than Biden or Trump</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris is well-positioned to be that alternative. At 59, she’s decades younger than both the current nominees. And she’s also emblematic of both an increasingly diverse Democratic Party and country, making her a candidate who could be especially motivating for key voting constituencies including Black women. (<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/kamala-harris-favorability\">In a July 2024 YouGov poll,</a> Harris’s favorability numbers were at 41 percent with adults overall, and 69 percent among Black respondents.) That could bode well for better turnout and enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“She’s the second Black woman elected to the Senate, which in a state like California is no small feat,” says University of Maryland public policy professor <a href=\"https://spp.umd.edu/our-community/faculty-staff/niambi-carter\">Niambi Carter</a>. “So she’s shown that she can get voters, white, Black, Latino, and others, to come to the polls.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts note, too, that bypassing Harris for another candidate — especially a white one — could run the risk of fracturing support from Black voters and other key Democratic constituencies, says <a href=\"https://split-ticket.org/author/lakshyajain97/\">Lakshya Jain</a>, the CEO of electoral analysis site Split Ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think there would be significant voter backlash,” Jain told Vox. “It would rupture the party and create negative news cycles for quite a while, and the eventual nominee would emerge quite wounded and with a massive amount of ground to make up among Black voters.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, on the logistics front, Harris would be able to make the transition more seamlessly because she could inherit Biden’s fundraising apparatus and campaign staff, as former White House press secretary <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNUhvweM/\">Jen Psaki explained in a TikTok post</a>. “Structurally, she could just move the campaign staff, she could move all their resources over,” Psaki noted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jenpsaki/video/7390544135414959391\" data-video-id=\"7390544135414959391\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@jenpsaki\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jenpsaki?refer=embed\">@jenpsaki</a> <p>Kamala has been floated as the obvious pick to replace Biden, here are her strengths and weaknesses <a title=\"msnbc\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/msnbc?refer=embed\">#msnbc</a> <a title=\"biden\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/biden?refer=embed\">#biden</a> <a title=\"harris\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/harris?refer=embed\">#harris</a> <a title=\"trump\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trump?refer=embed\">#trump</a> <a title=\"election2024\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/election2024?refer=embed\">#election2024</a> @MSNBC </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - TheRealPsaki\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7390544158873750303?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; TheRealPsaki</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Harris</strong>’s vulnerabilities, briefly explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For all the strengths she’d bring as a nominee, there have also been issues Harris has struggled with as vice president, and as a presidential candidate in 2020. And those could haunt her should she be Democrats’ 2024 pick.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably, while she’s remained liked by a number of Democratic constituencies, her overall favorability and approval numbers haven’t been the strongest. As a <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">FiveThirtyEight aggregation</a> found, Biden has 37 percent approval from all US voters, while Harris has <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">38 percent</a>. And she’d be seen as a continuation of the Biden administration, meaning she could be simply viewed as “more of the same” by voters who aren’t happy with the policies or positions it’s represented. Per surveys from this past year, voters are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/podcasts/the-daily/trump-biden-poll.html\">interested in change</a> and have expressed discontent with the status quo.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris also hasn’t always defined herself — and what she stands for — that clearly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, that was evident in how she sought to adopt both progressive and moderate policy stances, seemingly losing members of both constituencies. She’s especially struggled with the left and its often younger voters: Despite her self-described position as a progressive prosecutor, she was called out by grassroots progressives  during the 2019 campaign for actions she’d taken on truancy as well as wrongful convictions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This same overarching issue has emerged in her vice presidency, when some critics have argued that she hasn’t established what issues she owns or been clear about what she’s been able to achieve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">White House officials have previously highlighted her extensive work on foreign policy, immigration, voting rights, and reproductive rights. That’s a broad portfolio, and staffers who’ve worked with her have described the catch-22 that it can feel like Harris faces: if she chose solely to work on one issue, for example, she risks getting pigeonholed. If she works more broadly, as she has opted to do, she’s criticized for not being dedicated to just one area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And while she’s been an effective communicator in a number of high-profile cases ranging from her questioning of former Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions to a major speech she gave on the 50th anniversary of <em>Roe</em>, she’s also been pilloried for statements that have been commonly derided as sounding like “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/12/20/news/kamala-harris-serves-up-another-word-salad-as-discusses-most-election-of-our-lifetime/\">word salad</a>.” Those remarks have prompted some to wonder if she’d be able to be a strong enough messenger for Democrats during this pivotal time. (Others online have embraced some of these remarks including, famously, by making <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">memes about her coconut tree and venn diagram</a> comments.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her record with staff has been scrutinized by reporters, too, due to the turnover that’s taken place in her office across the roles she’s held, raising questions about her management style. Stories emerged about her <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-staffers-toxic-office-culture-dysfunction-2021-7\">attorney general</a> office and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/30/kamala-harris-office-dissent-497290\">her VP office</a> detailing what some staffers describe as a difficult work environment that stemmed from the top. Such reports fuel concerns about what leadership would look like in a Harris White House, though her office is far from the only one to have <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-turnover-in-the-biden-administration/#:~:text=President%20Biden's%20%E2%80%9CA%2DTeam%E2%80%9D,Biden's%20Cabinet%20turnover%20is%2013%25.\">seen turnover</a> in these roles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And latent sexism and racism among voters is a key worry some Democrats have raised. “I don&#8217;t know that a lot of people want to admit this, [but] I think there are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with a Black woman being the president,” says Carter. Candidates of color and women, including former President Barack Obama, have long had to navigate such biases &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna24284188\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna24284188\">and electability concerns</a> &#8212; though he was ultimately able to win in spite of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, these dynamics indicate that a Harris nomination, like any other, would come with both pros and cons. In the difficult situation that Democrats find themselves in, Harris’s strengths could well outweigh her vulnerabilities — if she can address them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, July 21, 3 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on July 13 and has been updated with news of Biden’s endorsement of Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Biden’s decision comes after weeks of public and private <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361597/biden-drop-out-democrats-obama-pelosi-schumer\">entreaties from Democrats</a> who have concluded that he is unlikely to defeat former President Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moments later, Biden released <a href=\"https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933\">another statement endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris</a> to take his spot atop the ticket.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made,” the statement said. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What is clear is that the presidential contest is entering uncharted territory for the modern era. Since the rise of the modern nomination process in the 1970s, no winner of the primaries has quit the race before the convention. And no major-party nominee has entered the race so close to November.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s worth pausing to appreciate just what a dramatic turn of events this has been. It was just a few short months ago that President Biden <a href=\"https://6abc.com/2024-super-tuesday-states-primary-results/14492343/\">sailed through</a> the primary season with barely any opposition. But now, his party support has collapsed under him to the point where he effectively can’t continue his campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The catalyst for this collapse was Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/358652/biden-drop-out-debate-harris-convention\">June 27 debate performance</a>, which will surely now go down as the most catastrophic general election debate in US presidential history. But what the debate actually did was supercharge concerns about Biden’s electoral prospects, stamina, health, and capacity that have long simmered below the surface of Democratic politics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The doubts about Biden did not begin with the debate, but the debate suddenly made them impossible to ignore — and spurred the party to take action.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What will happen next, though, is far from clear. Some Democrats profess to believe that Biden was a uniquely flawed nominee because of his age, and that a different nominee could perform much better against the <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/\">unpopular Trump</a>. But others are more pessimistic, suspecting that the party faces deeper electoral problems and that any replacement nominee is going to have a very tough road ahead.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biden plowed ahead with his campaign despite party doubts. The debate made those doubts impossible to ignore.</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the start of Biden’s first term, many in the political world questioned whether he would run for a second term, for two reasons: One is his age, since he’s already the oldest US president ever and would be 82 by Inauguration Day. The other is his bad polling numbers; his job approval has been dismal <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">since late 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Biden doesn’t ever appear to have seriously considered not running. He said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-reelection-2024/2021/11/20/0779469c-4947-11ec-95dc-5f2a96e00fa3_story.html\">from the start</a> of his term that he intended to run again, and when Democrats’ midterm election performance was better than many expected, it seemed to bolster his case that he could. So he made his reelection campaign official <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/1145679856/biden-president-announcement-2024-running-reelection\">in April 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All the party’s rising stars opted against launching a risky primary challenge to an incumbent president — doing otherwise would have earned them intense criticism in the party for dividing Democrats and damaging Biden’s chances in the general election. So Biden easily fended off challenges from the likes of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) and author Marianne Williamson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But doubts remained. Biden skeptics raised eyebrows at his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/media/biden-skipping-super-bowl-interview/index.html\">skipping the president’s</a> traditional pre-Super Bowl interview, at his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/us/politics/biden-public-appearances-media.html\">reluctance</a> to do press conferences, and at a special counsel report’s claims that he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/8/24066529/biden-special-counsel-report-memory\">seemed to have</a> a poor memory. In February, New York Times columnist (and Vox co-founder) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html\">Ezra Klein caused a stir</a> by writing that Democrats should choose a different nominee at the convention, because Biden did not seem up for the rigors of the campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, Biden gave a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/07/biden-state-of-the-union-2024/\">reasonably spirited performance</a> at his State of the Union address in March, temporarily putting those concerns to rest. But it did not improve his polls — by then, he’d consistently trailed Trump nationally and in almost every swing state <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden\">for months</a>. He looked on track for defeat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/us/politics/trump-biden-debate-june.html\">reportedly why</a> Biden’s team made the surprising proposal to debate Trump so early, a very unusual move. The hope was that Biden could, with a vigorous performance, reset the race, refocus attention on Trump, and address concerns about his age again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The opposite happened: Biden’s halting performance put a spotlight on his capacity to campaign (and serve another four years) that never went away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He lost the media first.&nbsp;In the hours after the debate, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc\">various</a> liberal <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/opinion/joe-biden-drop-out.html\">commentators</a> called on him <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html\">to quit</a> the race. Mainstream journalists, sensing scandal and a cover-up, intensely focused on reporting out <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/359024/biden-age-leaks-lapses-polls\">Biden’s true condition</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, Biden hoped that he could keep the party on board by doing a flurry of interviews and public events, showing the debate was a one-off. Some of these went <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360124/biden-dropout-defections-obama-pelosi\">reasonably well</a>, others <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/video/biden-youtube-complex-interview-tapper-lead-digvid\">less so</a>. But his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/biden-fundraising.html\">fundraising plummeted</a>, and the public and private pressure from Democrats urging him to step aside <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/biden-democrats-campaign.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">just kept increasing</a> — until Biden finally saw the writing on the wall.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The big question going forward: Are Democrats’ electoral problems just about Biden?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what happens next?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Obviously, much will depend on who the nominee is, and so far, we don&#8217;t know how that will be determined. The Democratic convention will take place the week of August 19.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But there’s another big underlying question that we don’t yet know the answer to. Namely, how much are Democrats’ electoral woes about Joe Biden himself — and how much reflect deeper problems for the party as a whole?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some argue that Democrats are doing fine, and that it’s only Biden that’s been the problem; that voters have soured on the president because of his age or perceived incapacity to serve another four years, and because Trump remains flawed and unpopular, and another Democratic nominee would likely beat him. For instance, Democratic Senate incumbents <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/briefing/biden-vs-the-democratic-party.html\">are polling significantly better</a> than Biden. That implies to some that with a different name at the top of the ticket, the party would be in great shape.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Others argue that Democrats’ problems will likely outlast Biden. Unhappiness with inflation under Biden, as well as unfolding foreign tumult<strong>,</strong> may have convinced voters that Trump wasn’t so bad after all. Public opinion on <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/the-changes-in-vibes-why-did-they-happen.html\">key issues</a> has moved right. And there <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-whitmer\">isn’t</a> much <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-newsom\">polling</a> showing any possible Democratic <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris\">alternative</a> beating Trump.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of these pessimists still believe it was worth pushing out Biden since he had little prospect of turning things around, but they emphasize that any replacement would be the underdog and face a very tough road ahead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All we know for sure now is that Democrats have decided to roll the dice, ditching their unpopular nominee in hopes of improving their odds in a contest they were on track to lose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But there are still many unknowns about the future of the Democratic ticket. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past weeks, amid speculation about Biden&#8217;s future on the ticket, two debates have played out. The first big question is whether Harris will be President Joe Biden’s replacement, or if <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024\">another Democratic politician</a>, like Govs. Gretchen Whitmer (MI), Josh Shapiro (PA), or Gavin Newsom (CA) would do better. The <em>other</em> question circulating among pundits, pollsters, journalists, strategists, and regular folks is whether Harris would be a stronger presidential contender than Biden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We can answer this question in a few ways: looking at data on her prospects, her recent performance on the campaign trail, and her past candidacies. Each of these paths give us limited answers, but to borrow a phrase from former Defense Secretary <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/rumsfeld-dead-words-known-unknowns/2021/07/01/831175c2-d9df-11eb-bb9e-70fda8c37057_story.html\">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, we can still identify a few “known unknowns” that make the future a bit more divinable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">Coconut-pilled</a> backers of a Kamala Harris presidential campaign argue that Harris runs about even or even better than Biden does against former President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/\">in polling</a>; they point to Harris’s performance on the campaign trail so far, making the case against Trump and the American right’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">plans in Project 2025</a>; and at a base level, they argue that she has been tested on the national stage, while other alternative candidates have not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Critics of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/25/20697783/khive-twitter-kamala-harris-2020-candidate-doug-hive\">KHive</a> — as the online superfans of the vice president call themselves — and the VP argue that Harris is still really unpopular with the American public. They argue that the polls don’t actually show that much of an advantage for Harris in battleground states or with the popular vote; they point to her failed 2019 presidential campaign and her tepid vice presidential tenure as proof she’s not a particularly good candidate or politician and would likely run an uneven campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They also argue that Biden’s flaws and foibles are already built into the electorate’s mind, while the chaos and uncertainty of swapping in Harris would expose the Democrats to even more risks (like how voters react to a woman of color as a nominee).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The debate was the roiling undercurrent of the will-he-or-won’t-he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361597/biden-drop-out-democrats-obama-pelosi-schumer\">drama over Biden</a> these last few weeks. How it resolves now that he is off the ticket could have enduring ramifications for both the Democratic Party and the country. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The upsides to swapping in Harris</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris backers have plenty to point to in the aftermath of June’s presidential debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the obvious stuff: Harris is younger, can actually string sentences together, and has already been campaigning against Trump this year. These points were once again demonstrated this week —&nbsp;while Biden was forced to recover from Covid at his home in Delaware during the week of the Republican National Convention, Harris was on the trail with North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What the data says: </strong>First, a caveat: comparing polling of reality to a hypothetical match-up is always a bit treacherous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What we can say from head-to-head polling of Harris is that the general trend has gotten a lot better for her. A year ago <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024\">she was underperforming Biden in head-to-head polling against Trump</a> in a variety of surveys. Closer to the debate and right after, she began to perform about evenly. And more recently, in July, a few polls comparing Biden and Harris against Trump in battleground states and nationally have shown Harris even with Biden or slightly ahead of him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first sign of this change came from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/cnn-poll-post-debate/index.html\">CNN’s first post-debate poll</a>, finding the vice president trailing Trump by 2 percentage points (within the margin of error) while Biden trailed by 6 points. And in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/538/kamala-harris-stronger-candidate-biden/story?id=111656941\">FiveThirtyEight’s</a> polls-only post-debate comparison of Harris and Biden vs. Trump, Harris performs slightly better than the president in battleground states <em>— </em>though not in all of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recent polling from Pennsylvania and Virginia also shows more positive signs for the vice president: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/pennsylvania-virginia-polls-biden-trump.html\">New York Times/Siena College</a> polls this month show that while Harris still trails Trump by 1 point in Pennsylvania, that’s a smaller gap than the 3 points that put Trump ahead of Biden there. Both of these results are within the polling’s margin of error, making the race in the state essentially tied. In Virginia, meanwhile, Harris’s lead over Trump is 2 points larger than the lead Biden has over the former president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And a post-assassination attempt <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/race-presidency-remains-unchanged-wake-assassination-attempt-trump\">national poll from Reuters/Ipsos</a> shows a statistically tied presidential contest for either Biden or Harris against Trump.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under the hood, however, Harris backers can find an additional data point in their column: <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2024-07/Reuters%20Ipsos%20Post%20Trump%20Assasionation%20Attempt%20Poll%20Topline.pdf\">69 percent of respondents think Biden is too old</a>; Harris doesn’t face that concern. And Biden is more unpopular than Harris, something that is consistently true: As of July 18, Biden has a net -17.7 <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">approval</a> rating in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate. Harris’s <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/\">disapproval</a> is at 11.8. And in RealClearPolitics’ average of favorability ratings, Biden (<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/joe-biden\">-16.3</a>) is also more unpopular than Harris (<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris\">-14.9</a>)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What the campaign trail shows: </strong>Harris backers can point to the vice president’s performance on the road this year and argue that she has evolved as a politician since her presidential run in 2019, and especially since the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> in 2022 —&nbsp;when she became the White House’s go-to surrogate and messenger on reproductive rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She has dominated that issue, both in official visits to states where abortion and reproductive rights have been under threat, and also during campaign swings this year that have seen her become more willing to talk about the <a href=\"https://abc7.com/kamala-harris-friend-high-school-canada/7846815/\">personal experiences</a> that pushed her to become a sex crimes prosecutor and be able to connect with voters in a way Biden can’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, she has been playing up that past as a prosecutor — something she was not able to do during her last national campaign against fellow Democrats. “Prosecuting the case against Donald Trump” is now a go-to part of her stump speeches, both in talking about his and his party’s record on abortion and in talking about Trump’s convictions and indictments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the top of the ticket, she would be able to zero in on this approach against an unpopular Republican candidate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What history tells us: </strong>Before her doomed 2020 presidential bid, Harris had a successful electoral record in California: winning statewide races by tacking to the center or simply pointing out how weird or abnormal her opponents were.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Running as a center-left politician was part of her bid during her first statewide race in California — for attorney general —&nbsp;since she was facing a popular moderate Republican during a red-wave year in 2010, and she was viewed as a liberal Bay Area district attorney. She opposed right-wing positions on gay marriage and immigration enforcement, and cast her opponent as an extremist, while also attacking him for not prosecuting more cases, including sex crimes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Her 2016 Senate campaign, meanwhile, showed how she’s able to remain on message and be disciplined —&nbsp;winning support from the Democratic establishment, consistently holding a fundraising advantage, and showing that her Democrat opponent was not a serious candidate. There wasn’t much of a policy difference between Harris and her opponent, former Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley, but she was still able to deliver a landslide win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even her 2020 campaign shows that she’s a pragmatic thinker — not necessarily tied to a specific ideology that influences the way she would approach issues. She fumbled on policy, and couldn’t make a distinctive, proactive case to the Democratic base in the primary, but she doesn’t have to do that now. Even during this cycle, she has shown moments of pragmatism, too — her position on the war in Gaza, for example, put her to the left of Biden on the issue —&nbsp;but she has found ways to speak to young progressives and voters critical of Israel’s approach while still representing the president.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The risks of swapping in Harris</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What the data says: </strong>The major problem in comparing these Harris figures to Biden’s actual standing against Trump is that Biden’s numbers factor in every negative thing that he and his campaign have endured so far. Biden backers would point to the fact that opinions of Harris could still change for the worse as her theoretical campaign becomes not so theoretical anymore, and that her performing about as evenly as Biden against Trump is not that great of a sign when there is more uncertainty about how Harris would even campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On that front, they point to the fact that Harris’s favorability numbers are not that different from Biden’s, and could still get worse. In recent polls, she performs worse than Biden in battleground states like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2024/07/18/so-you-wanted-some-harris-polling-00169524\">Michigan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-swing-state-poll-donald-trump-1927199\">Arizona, and Nevada</a> — losing those states would likely doom a Democratic candidate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And she doesn’t necessarily do significantly better than Biden when looking at how subgroups of voters feel: She wins the same share of Black voters as Biden in head-to-head matchups with Trump in battleground states, <a href=\"https://split-ticket.org/2024/07/17/we-polled-black-voters-heres-what-we-found/\">per Split-Ticket.org’s polling</a>, and does slightly worse than Biden <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-biden-stronger-weaker-trump-nbc-news-poll-rcna161520\">among white voters</a>, who still make up the majority of voters in swing states and nationally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What the campaign trail shows: </strong>Taking the Kamala-critical position on the data as is — that there’s essentially no difference according to polls in how Harris performs against Trump than Biden — you are justified in being worried about what the campaign trail might look like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris has only recently, since 2022, been active on the campaign trail, in part because she’s not the most naturally gifted campaigner or communicator. She has found the issues she excels at championing, but that’s only after going through a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html\">rocky</a> first <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60061473\">year</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/11/kamala-harris-first-six-months-vice-president-joe-biden\">vice president</a> when her office saw a variety of staff departures, infighting, and missteps in message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She received media training during that first year in order to get better at talking about the president’s agenda, but still struggled to define her portfolio —&nbsp;facing intense criticism on immigration and the border when that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc\">wasn’t even her original assignment</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-kamala-harris.html\">Reporters</a> who have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html\">covering</a> her tenure point out that she seems most at home when she’s having more roundtable-style conversations, not necessarily in one-on-one interviews or while giving stump speeches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Harris critics also point out that she will struggle to convince voters to see her as a legitimate candidate given biases against her because of her race, her gender, and the general idea that she’s not that plugged into the White House inner circle or aware of the day-to-day business of running the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then come the memes. While the genre of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive\">Kamala Harris memes</a> has been exploding in popularity recently because of the chaos over Biden’s own candidacy, those jokes start from a kernel of truth: Harris is an awkward communicator. She’s prone to gaffes, to awkward jokes, to tortured analogies or stories, and is generally perceived as easy to mock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What history tells us</strong>: Harris critics also have plenty to point to when criticizing her electoral history. Her toughest race was her first race, for California attorney general, when she was the worst-performing statewide Democratic candidate on the ballot, winning her seat by about <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/elections/2010/results/california.html?ref=politics\">1 percentage point</a>.<strong> </strong>Read that again. She nearly lost to a Republican in California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the context that this was a red-wave year — the 2020 midterm elections were terrible for Democrats. But in California, she essentially had united Democratic support for her campaign, and still came close to failure — while every other Democratic candidate on the ticket performed significantly better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She cruised to victory during the 2016 Senate race in part because the whole contest was “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/2016-california-senate-harris-sanchez-jungle-open-primary-reform-214429/\">uninspiring</a>,” and neither Harris nor her opponent were able to excite voters during most of the campaign because Harris’s victory was assumed from the start. She also faced an easy, flawed candidate in that race: a wacky US representative <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uuyTggFWYc\">who famously “dabbed”</a> on stage during a debate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And her 2020 presidential contest showed what happens when a candidate lacks clarity about her campaign and reasons for running. She struggled to define herself, and her position on the ideological spectrum, relative to her Democratic rivals. She could not run a disciplined campaign — two rival camps within her operation <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/359620/kamala-harris-2020-president-campaign-2024-failure-lesson\">pulled the campaign in different directions</a> for much of the primary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This record shows the legitimate reasons to question whether Harris would be able to make a proactive case for herself —&nbsp;not just a negative case against Trump. She faces the struggle of convincing voters not to blame her for the unpopular results of the Biden-Harris administration, while still thinking of her as presidential material.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s one edge the governors and senators who have been talked about as potential alternatives to Biden have: They wouldn’t carry the same baggage from the Biden administration. Harris will likely be seen as tied to Biden’s legacy,&nbsp;which stands as another reason to look elsewhere.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

More than 100 million adults in the US went from having no legal access to the drug to being able to waltz into their local dispensary, buy some weed, and take it home to get as stoned as they please. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/about/people/k/kilmer_beau.html\">Beau Kilmer</a>, co-director of the RAND <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/well-being/justice-policy/centers/dprc.html\">Drug Policy Research Center</a>, sees the same kind of early activity in state psychedelic policy, including budding <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/23-0004%20%28Psilocybin%202024%29.pdf\">legislation</a> to legalize sales, that he saw in cannabis right before the wave of legalizing commercial sales took off. While the medicinal use of psychedelics gains more attention and as <a href=\"https://reason.org/commentary/state-psychedelics-legalization-and-policy-roundup-march-2024/\">states allocate funds</a> toward research, the prospect of retail psychedelics has quietly landed on our doorstep. “State policymakers, whether they like it or not, are going to start confronting these conversations,” said Kilmer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And yet, public conversation about how a retail psychedelic market might actually work has been all but nonexistent. So far, most debate over how to expand legal access to psychedelics has focused on segmented approaches like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult\">therapy</a>, religious <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/psychedelic-drugs-church-religion.html\">exemptions</a>, or supervised <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html\">retreat centers</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even in a world with all these models firmly in place, plus more general drug <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/ungass2016/Contributions/Civil/DrugPolicyAlliance/DPA_Fact_Sheet_Approaches_to_Decriminalization_Feb2015_1.pdf\">decriminalization</a> across the board, there would still be plenty of people who would not be able to access psychedelics. Not everyone will or can get a prescription for their psychedelic of choice. Most people won’t be able to afford supervised programs, which run for a minimum of about <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.omniagroupashland.com/services/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1720806618065068&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vro1ey5aTfX4ZW6YD4cLK\">$1,800</a> for a single, low-dose session in Oregon’s state program, or thousands more in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveller.com/article/the-rise-of-psychedelic-retreats\">luxury retreats</a> abroad. Neither will everyone want to join a literal church in order to get religious exemption. And for anyone who doesn’t happen to have a friend who knows a guy who grows mushrooms and wants to share, decriminalizing psychedelics won’t do much to expand access on its own, either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If ending psychedelic prohibition means all adults should have reasonable access, retail sales —&nbsp;being able to simply buy the drugs from a store —&nbsp;could help fill the gaps. But it’s easy to understand why even ardent psychedelic advocates might balk at the idea. Psychedelics do <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0293349\">come with risks</a>, and more access means more exposure to those risks, which is an area where <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23954347/psychedelics-bad-trips-ketamine-mdma-psilocybin-lsd-risks\">psychedelic research is lacking</a>. Plus, there’s a real concern among advocates that if psychedelic legalization moves too quickly, or too imprudently, one wrong step can plunge the whole project back into prohibition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because it’s so easy to imagine how commercializing psychedelics could go awry, blithely selling powerful experiences that can run what seems like an infinite spectrum from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism\">revelation</a> to <a href=\"https://bulletin.hds.harvard.edu/a-theological-reckoning-with-bad-trips/\">terror</a> is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/opinion/sunday/drug-legalization-mdma-psilocybin.html\">often dismissed</a>. But our options are not limited to either the worst forms of commercialization — what some see <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html\">already playing out</a> with cannabis — or continuing in the restrictive legacy of prohibition. There is a very wide terrain of possibilities for how to design a retail market for psychedelics that can both broaden access while retaining some regulation and safety measures. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This uncharted terrain was the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2825-1.html\">recent report published by RAND</a> —&nbsp;a think tank whose research has had <a href=\"https://asteriskmag.com/issues/06/when-rand-made-magic-in-santa-monica\">major influence</a> on government policy since its inception as a branch of the US Air Force in 1948. Of all places, I did not expect a think tank that still works closely with the government to be advancing the conversation around how to sell psychedelics to people outside of therapy clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">RAND’s report joins Transform Drug Policy Foundation’s “<a href=\"https://transformdrugs.org/publications/how-to-regulate-psychedelics\">How to Regulate Psychedelics</a>,” published late last year, as some of the first major pieces of policy research to begin mapping the possible policy options for designing a retail psychedelics market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The federal government currently has multiple options when it comes to the supply of psychedelics, but it does not have unlimited time,” the report states. Legislation for retail psychedelics is already getting off the ground in some states, like the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/23-0004%20%28Psilocybin%202024%29.pdf\">California Psilocybin Initiative</a>. “Now is the time for US federal policymakers to decide whether they want psilocybin and other psychedelic substances to follow in the footsteps of the for-profit cannabis model.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Psychedelic therapy isn’t enough to put an end to the restrictive legacy of prohibition. And while it’s easy enough to say that psychedelics should never have been fully outlawed, as they were in 1970, thinking through how to make them legal and accessible for everyone is to confront a thicket of questions that we’ve only just begun to grapple with.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The varieties of retail psychedelics</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So if we’re going to consider the retail sale of psychedelics, how can we go about it without, you know, plunging society into a psychedelic nightmare fueled by abundant corner-store mushrooms, Juul-branded DMT vape pens in young people’s innocent hands, and flooded emergency rooms with no idea how to help people whose perceptions of the world have melted into an all-consuming, pulsating void?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Kilmer explained that the logistics of retail psychedelics fall into one of two categories: supply architectures and design considerations. Supply architectures come first. Who gets to sell psychedelics? The RAND report lays out a taxonomy of options, including sales by a government authority, sales by nonprofits, sales by for-benefit corporations, and full-on for-profit sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this view, the most modest step in retail would be letting the government have a monopoly on distribution. That’s how many US states <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-01-16/end-of-prohibition-gave-states-a-new-job-regulating-liquor\">handled</a> the end of alcohol prohibition in the 1930s (and some states still do). It’s also how a number of Canadian <a href=\"https://mjbizdaily.com/canadian-cannabis-stores-by-provinces-territories/\">provinces</a>, like Quebec and Nova Scotia, do cannabis sales today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A government monopoly on psychedelic sales has a few benefits. A single government supplier would make monitoring product safety easier (as in, no MDMA <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8282667/\">laced with fentanyl</a>, which is increasingly a problem on the black market, or sketchy mushroom chocolates that <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024\">actually make you sick</a>). The absence of retail competition would mean the incentives for irresponsible marketing that pushes psychedelics onto new consumers — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-marijuana-business-4245bb958368e1863d7ac9b639886790\">a problem</a> with the cannabis market — would be turned way down. I do not imagine the government would erect billboards advertising their LSD products. (In the 1950s, for instance, they kept pretty quiet about their LSD experiments for <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/95mkultra.pdf\">mind control and military uses</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, giving the government the sole power to legally sell psychedelics after President Nixon’s government drove them underground in the first place would be an irony to behold. And RAND’s report noted that even in the cannabis legalization realm, the idea of sticking to state-run stores didn’t gain much traction in the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One step further would be legalizing sales through only certain types of organizations, like non-profits or for-benefit corporations. For example, when New York handed out its <a href=\"https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/the-trusted-professional/article/nonprofits-awarded-cannabis-dispensary-licenses-include-three-based-in-nyc-112222\">first wave of retail licenses</a> for cannabis, they went to either non-profits or equity applicants (mostly people with past cannabis-related convictions). By concentrating retail licenses with organizations that have goals other than profit, some of the potential excesses of commercializing psychedelics, from excessive marketing to skirting regulations in search of more revenue, could potentially be counterbalanced by emphases on public health or equity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Applying a bit more restriction, some countries, like Uruguay, Spain, and now <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/germanys-parliament-votes-to-legalize-limited-marijuana-possession-and-allow-cannabis-clubs\">Germany</a>, have allowed a non-profit collective model for cannabis that could be adapted for psychedelics, through what are known as “<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149291823001297\">social clubs</a>.” These provide on-site locations where members can purchase and use drugs with varying degrees of community and peer support built in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And finally, the approach that now dominates cannabis in the US: for-profit sales. In theory, a for-profit approach could benefit consumers by enlisting competition to push prices down. But it also creates an incentive for companies to push against regulations in search of a financial edge, while both advertising and innovating to seek out as many new customers as possible. THC gummies are one thing, but LSD-infused ring pops? Psilocybin bubble tea? This leads down a slippery slope that makes even advocates uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although cannabis parallels are abundant, there are major differences when thinking about following the same model for psychedelics. Kilmer explained that retail cannabis was driven by two major motivations: to reduce arrests and generate state tax revenue. But he thinks that neither will really factor into psychedelic policy reform. Both the number of arrests and the amount of revenue associated with psychedelics (according to RAND’s survey of psilocybin users) are far less than with cannabis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And he expects the actual market dynamics to have at least three major differences, too. First, he thinks psychedelic consumers will be far less sensitive to changes in price than cannabis. Cannabis users can always turn to its robust black market if they balk at the price of a blunt, but someone hunting for LSD will likely have a harder time. Second, the question of supervised use is basically non-existent with cannabis, which is essentially consumed much like alcohol, but is a big part of psychedelic use, where even recreational consumers may want to keep someone around to watch over them. And third, while many people use cannabis frequently, RAND’s survey data found that infrequent users drive the psychedelic market as it exists today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among any of the supply architectures, success or failure will come down to the massive list of design considerations. Who gets to manufacture (or grow) the drugs, and how can we ensure quality control? How should we regulate the packaging of retail psychedelic products? How can we effectively communicate informed consent? What strategies for public education can help create models of responsible use? What kinds of advertising are acceptable? Should doses be restricted at all? What kind of harm reduction information should come with purchases?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I could go on for a very long time with these sorts of questions, which will need more than two lengthy think tank reports to navigate. The reports from Transform and RAND have at least started the important work of taking them seriously, rather than turning away at the first depiction of psychedelic capitalism gone awry. But we’ll need much more data and analysis to make sense of what prudent steps forward might actually look like. “Once I really started digging in and crunching the numbers, I realized that a lot of the data we need just doesn’t exist,” said Kilmer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And with retail legislation already in the works, we’ll need it fast.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">New York proposes a potentially reasonable way forward: psychedelic permits</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Advocates for psychedelics access have been hearing that “we need to wait for more data” for quite some time. And in many cases where psychedelics could help, like for people <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/15/24156372/psychedelics-chronic-pain-cluster-headache-medicine-lsd-psilocybin\">suffering from debilitating chronic pain</a> or PTSD, every day spent waiting is another day in pain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Which is part of what makes <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/A10375#:~:text=Allows%20the%20growth%2C%20cultivation%2C%20and%20regulated%20adult%20use%20of%20psilocybin,and%20the%20licensure%20of%20cultivators.\">the bill</a> introduced in May by New York State Representative Amy Paulin, who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, so interesting. It offers a way forward that doesn’t require waiting for policymakers to figure out how to whip up and regulate an entire retail market before offering access. The other part is that among the options for actually stepping into retail psychedelics, it strikes me as by far the most reasonable approach to balancing expanding access while keeping an emphasis on safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bill would essentially take our approach to driving licenses, and adapt it for psychedelics. People 18 and up would have to go through a health screening, take an educational course, and pass a test, after which they’d receive a permit to buy psychedelics (in this bill’s case, only psilocybin) from licensed vendors. They could then take the drugs home and use as they please. They could also then grow the mushrooms at home, and share them with other permitted adults.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whereas approaches outlined in Transform and RAND’s reports focus on licensing the <em>supply</em> of psychedelics, the permit model adds another layer of protection by focusing on who’s licensed to purchase and consume them. There will be, no doubt, people upset by the idea of requiring a government permit to purchase or consume psychedelics. But the same is required of other activities that pose a reasonable threat to oneself and others, like driving. If the alternative is no retail access whatsoever, let them holler.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bill tries to fill in some of the missing logistics around how to actually pull this off, specifying that licensed mushroom cultivators could sell psilocybin directly to permit holders via a system managed by the Department of Health, which would also oversee the content of the permit course. Of course, questions abound. What will the health screenings screen for? Should permitting include a guided trip as an experiential component? How will permit holders be connected with support services, should something go wrong? What goes into becoming a licensed cultivator? </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, an approach that requires licensing at each step of the commercial journey, from production to distribution to consumption, builds in plenty of opportunities for regulation, while still filling the gaps in supply left by therapy, supervised programs, or religious exemptions. And by requiring permits for consumers, it leans deeper into harm reduction than the for-profit cannabis model that is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html\">coming under increasing criticism</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no approach to retail psychedelics that’s without risk. But cars killed <a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813561\">nearly 41,000</a> Americans last year alone, and we keep licensing people to use those. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Obviously, there are a number of concerns, especially if you were to unleash a commercial industry,” said Kilmer. “But at the end of the day, you can have the best empirical evidence out there with minimal uncertainty, and a lot of it still just comes down to the values and risk preferences for the people making decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

I hadn’t been ghosted, scorned, or broken up with either. In fact, I’m happily married to a man who rolls his eyes at the Hallmark holiday but knows how to woo me: namely, via wings and beer, which we’d savored the night before, along with a variety show of sorts at our friend’s Brooklyn loft. On the surface, the night had been just right. But my gut told a different story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It reminded me that, the day prior, I’d been reporting a mental health story that had seeped deep into my psyche. I’d felt misunderstood by a relative when I’d tried to open up about it. I’d cried during the show’s opening musical act because, well, I’m a sap. </p>\n\n<p>So come February 15, I — surely along with plenty of others for a variety of reasons — awoke to an emotional hangover, or that groggy, queasy feeling that lingers after a heavy conversation, therapy session, or even dark movie. While not an official medical term, the “condition” is quite common, and makes sense from a physiological and psychological perspective, experts told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Our reactions [to the outside world] are driven by our internal world, and our internal world is influenced by what happened yesterday,” <a href=\"https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/lila-davachi\">Lila Davachi, PhD</a>, a psychology professor at Columbia University who’s studied how emotions affect memories, said. “We’re not just blank slates every morning.”  </p>\n\n<p>I felt better already. Here’s what else I learned about why we might experience emotional hangovers, who’s most vulnerable, and whether there’s anything we can do to prevent — or pacify — them. Spoiler alert: Water and rest are tried-and-true hangover cures, even if you’re sober. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Defining the emotional hangover&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Different people have different definitions of emotional hangovers. Perhaps most prominently, <a href=\"https://drjudithorloff.com/9-strategies-to-cure-emotional-hangovers/\">Judith Orloff, MD,</a> a psychiatrist and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Empaths-Survival-Guide-Strategies-Sensitive/dp/1622036573\"><em>The Empath’s Survival Guide</em></a>, describes it as “an energetic residue” left over from an interaction with an “energy vampire,” or someone who, intentionally or not, saps your mental and emotional energy. </p>\n\n<p>“Toxic emotions can linger long afterward, which make you feel exhausted, beset with brain fog, or ill,” she writes.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, it wasn’t any particular person from whom I needed to recover, but rather a set of mildly emotionally fatiguing circumstances that didn’t subside simply because the sun had risen again. (Importantly, I’m not talking about the emotional aftermath of world-rocking life events like the death of a loved one, which is more aptly categorized as grief — and better appreciated as something that will and should take time to nurse.)</p>\n\n<p>I’ve had emotional hangovers after finishing haunting books, receiving hate mail from readers, and getting into disagreements with my spouse.</p>\n\n<p>“The day after something that’s really intense, it’s natural to feel lingering feelings of sadness or shame,” <a href=\"https://meganbruneau.com/\">Megan Bruneau</a>, a therapist and coach, says. The concept reminds her of “vulnerability hangovers,” or uncomfortable feelings like anxiety and regret that can arise after sharing deep emotions, needs, or desires, according to mental health website <a href=\"https://www.choosingtherapy.com/vulnerability-hangover/\">Choosing Therapy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Per Orloff, frequent emotional hangovers are most common among empaths, highly sensitive people, and those with social anxiety disorder. In other words, when your emotional antenna is highly attuned to others’ thoughts and behaviors, minor social blips become amplified. What’s a breeze on others’ radars is a gust on yours.  </p>\n\n<p>This perspective resonates with Abby Schaeffer, a 33-year-old flight attendant based in New York City. “I feel emotions really deeply — when I get into a fight with someone, I am torn up about it. My partner, by contrast, is like, ‘Well they’re wrong, so whatever,’” she said. “For people like me, emotional hangovers are a thing because you spend so much energy just processing the event.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The brain and body during an emotional hangover&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>While a hangover-hangover is well-understood as a mix of dehydration, poor quality sleep, and other physical consequences of too much booze, the mechanisms behind emotional hangovers are a little more medically elusive. But experts have some theories.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For one, during an emotional experience — say, a confrontation with a slacking colleague — your fight-or-flight system is activated, leading stress hormones like cortisol, norepinephrine, and adrenaline to surge through the body. When the moment passes and your body settles into a “rest and digest” state, you might feel especially worn down. “When we’re repairing after the stress response, it’s tiring,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The feeling could also reflect the mental tug-of-war between your amygdala, the part of your brain that’s processing your emotions, and your prefrontal cortex, or the part of your brain that’s trying to temper them with logic and decisions. “It’s mentally exhausting to be managing your feelings of anger and anxiety, and trying to be non-reactive,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some research also shows that highly emotional events light up the brain in certain ways — and that light doesn’t switch off as soon as the event ends. In her <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4468\">2016 study</a> in the journal <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, Davachi and colleagues measured people’s brain activity while viewing both emotional and neutral images. They found that the brain states associated with the emotional experiences lingered 20 to 30 minutes later, sharpening the participants’ memory of subsequent non-emotional images.</p>\n\n<p>It shows that, unlike a video recording, “we’re much more complicated in how we’re viewing, perceiving, and remembering the world,” Davachi says.  </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, emotional moments can corrupt our attention — shining the light on happy-looking couples after a fight with your partner, or causing you to misinterpret your friend’s silence after an awkward encounter with a different pal. By ruminating on negative feelings, you’re (often unintentionally) delaying your recovery.   </p>\n\n<p>“Your perception is being heightened toward the things that are relevant to that person or that trauma, but you might actually be suppressing everything else,” Davachi says. “And that’s maladaptive too, because if good stuff is happening to you too, like you get a nice note in the mail, you’re going to not let that improve your mood the way that it should.”</p>\n\n<p>Your emotional hangover might not be so complicated: Maybe you just failed to breathe deeply, or drink enough water, or eat well while engrossed in a tragic movie. Your sleep could have been more fitful too. “When we’re stressed, we tend to not take care of ourselves as well,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, emotional hangovers are yet another indication that our bodies and minds are connected, <a href=\"https://chronicillnessandjoy.com/bio.html\">Kristen Guest</a>, a licensed social worker, says. “Our bodies are definitely going to feel it if our mind is overpowered or overstimulated. Nothing just happens in a silo.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your emotional hangover first-aid kit&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Emotional hangovers aren’t inherently bad; they’re human. They might mean you need to set better boundaries or improve communication or practice sitting with uncomfortable emotions and conflict. If you find the feelings are frequent and disruptive, you might need to do something more drastic, like quit a job or break up with a friend. Consider abstinence from the figurative substance that’s no longer serving you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“It’s good to receive those signals in some cases, <em>and</em> we need to train our brains and our bodies to respond in different ways,” Guest says. She recommends drinking lots of water and journaling to help you notice patterns in what, where, and who tends to sap you emotionally. “It’s important to take time for reflection,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Working through it with a therapist can be immensely helpful too, <a href=\"https://emilysarahhein.com/\">Emily Hein</a>, a writer and social work student, has found. She’s learned, for example, that an outsize reaction to her current partner’s comment might be related to something a former partner said. </p>\n\n<p>“We tend to lump all of these things together and it’s really hard to be like, ‘No, let’s just approach this particular situation as it is,’” she says. “It’s definitely a push-pull between your mind and your body, and knowing that you’re safe while also validating that it’s okay for your brain to not feel like it’s safe. Your brain is pulling evidence from things that did happen.” </p>\n\n<p>For her, watching a show, playing a video game, or taking a walk can all put helpful space between the event and her reaction. Like a margarita-induced hangover, time heals, Schaeffer has also found. “Just be kind to yourself the next day,” she says. “That’s the rule I follow.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It is at this precise moment that I finally start to believe the whispers I’ve heard online and from fellow fans: that for once, the American version of <em>Love Island</em> is more entertaining than its British counterpart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Love Island</em> is a dating game show in which sexy singles in tiny swimsuits are marooned in a villa in Mallorca and must compete to couple up with each other or risk getting “dumped.” The show has been synonymous with summertime in UK tabloids and water cooler conversations since it first aired in 2015. Six nights per week from June to August, viewers tune in to watch the couples fight and flirt, periodically voting on their favorite contestants. At the grand finale, the most voted-for couple wins a £50,000 prize. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The American version, now in its sixth season, follows pretty much the same formula (instead of Mallorca, it takes place in Fiji, and the prize is $100,000), though it historically never quite managed to capture the magic and messiness of the original, where contestants in a rainbow of distinct British and Irish accents befriend, betray, and literally bone each other on camera.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2161125826.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Two young men sit talking on a balcony .\" title=\"Two young men sit talking on a balcony .\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Aaron and Rob, this season&#039;s bromance. | NBC Universal\" data-portal-copyright=\"NBC Universal\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But despite middling reviews in previous years, season 6 of <em>Love Island USA </em>has finally cracked the code. The show is currently the No. 1 reality series in the US across all streaming platforms, according to Nielsen, and Peacock’s most-watched series by far, gaining twice as many views as last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Luminate, an entertainment data tracking company, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/love-island-usa-luminate-streaming-ratings-1236072771/\">reports that</a> <em>Love Island USA</em> was the most-watched streaming original series in the US during the second week of July, with 919 million minutes watched, a 257 percent increase from the week it debuted (in a fairly distant second place was <em>The Bear,</em> at 630 million minutes). To be clear, much of this is due to the sheer number of hours available to stream (this season will have around 35 episodes, and previous UK seasons have had nearly 50), but in order to consume 35 hours of television, you’ve got to be pretty invested.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Simon Thomas, the show’s executive producer, points to the charismatic cast as the main reason for this season’s success. “They’re the most ridiculously good-looking group that we’ve probably ever had, and they’re all vulnerable and fun and friendly, like we always want,” tells me. “But there was something about them that you almost couldn’t put your finger on. It’s magic and we’re making a potion, and maybe you get it right.” It’s an alchemy that few reality shows are able to replicate in an era in which many have lost their shock and voyeurism value: With every brilliant <em>Real Housewives</em> cast or compelling <em>Bachelor </em>lead are a million more that end up forgotten in the streaming wasteland. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2159725205.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Two young Black women in bikinis dance by a pool.\" title=\"Two young Black women in bikinis dance by a pool.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Serena and JaNa are two fan favorites. | NBC Universal\" data-portal-copyright=\"NBC Universal\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Early seasons of <em>Love Island USA</em> may have struggled in part due to the prudishness of both American values and its laws: Federal broadcasting regulations ban the airing of certain sex acts and swear words on TV, while British reality shows have long featured un-bleeped curses and full-frontal nudity (I’m begging anyone who has not yet had the pleasure to go watch the UK’s <em>Naked Attraction, </em>which the American mind could simply not comprehend).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is also due to the cultural differences of the Islanders: In 2019, one producer <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-glorious-depravity-of-the-british-love-island\">told the New Yorker</a> that “the American contestants were uniformly chaste and polite, their speech sanitized psychobabble cultivated to convey self-awareness, depth, and respect for women.” In contrast, UK Islanders have usually been much more forthcoming about the sex they’re having with each other, openly calling each other “slags,” and frequently discussing whether or not the men are giving them “fanny flutters,” which an American woman <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/recaps/bachelor-in-paradise-season-7-episode-8/\">might translate to “vagina dance.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/tv/2022/10/20/23414603/love-island-uk-popularity-explained\">The Ringer explained</a> at the series’ outset that it could never live up to the original because of Americans’ unwillingness to laugh at themselves. American tastes also tend toward self-serious dating shows like <em>The Bachelor, </em>with its demand that contestants be “here for the right reasons,” i.e. to find love, not fame. <em>Love Island</em> turns the American inclination toward piety and earnestness on its head, acknowledging that, in fact, absolutely nobody is here for the right reasons. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Absolutely nobody is here for the right reasons</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among other things, this season finally replicates the fun of showcasing a buffet of regional accents: Pittsburgher Kaylor doesn’t pronounce her L’s, so words like “told” and “single” sound like “toed” and “singoh.” Professional snake wrangler and <a href=\"https://x.com/morganpw/status/1811570022604513385\">overall wearer</a> Rob’s Alabama twang would come out stronger if he ever sat up fully or spoke louder than a grunt. And Calabasas-based Leah speaks with such a slow SoCal drawl that she sounds like she’s been shot with a poisoned dart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They’ve also sprinkled in a few foreigners, like Liv, an Aussie, Miguel from London, and, most notably, southern England’s Aaron, who has the energy of a rabbit on Red Bull, is best known for having a, er, prominent<em> </em>arc on series two of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/24042839/traitors-season-2-us-review-spoilers\"><em>The Traitors UK</em></a>, and inexplicably, as the internet has noted, has the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/aaron-girl-doll-teeth\">mouth of an American Girl doll</a>. Hilariously, the American Islanders have even started using some of the British slang introduced to the US from the original <em>Love Island: </em>This season, you’ll have the rather uncanny experience of hearing Americans use phrases like “mugged off,” “fit,” “turning heads,” “fanny flutters,” and referring to grilled cheese as “toasties.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then there’s the draw of its new host, <em>Vanderpump Rules’</em> Ariana Madix, who shot to mainstream fame last year after her partner of a decade was caught having an affair with another <em>Vanderpump</em> cast mate, creating the maelstrom that would forever be known as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/6/2/23745691/scandoval-vanderpump-rules-reunion-episode-2-ariana-madix\">Scandoval</a>. “Normally the saying in TV is ‘followers don’t follow.’ It’s not enough to book someone who’s got 10 million followers,” Thomas explains. “But Ariana, they would follow her to the moon and back. People care about her in a way I’ve never seen. Her personal story mixes really well with the show.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2157494096.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Ariana Madix in a gold gown on the Love Island USA set.\" title=\"Ariana Madix in a gold gown on the Love Island USA set.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Host Ariana Madix chats with the Islanders. | NBC Universal\" data-portal-copyright=\"NBC Universal\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While this season hasn’t featured many of the genuine love stories that spark sporadically on the island, it has been just as fun to watch friendships form, like the bromance between Rob and Aaron and the sisterhood among the women. Black women, who’ve <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/love-island-needs-black-women_uk_611e3728e4b0c69681055fb2\">long been sidelined on <em>Love Island</em></a>, also take a starring role this season in the form of the loveable, princessy JaNa and the spunky Serena, both of whom have seemed to find strong connections in the villa. They and the other women have stuck up for each other in difficult moments and during challenges when the men show themselves to be sexist. One challenge early in the season revealed each Islander’s “body count,” — that is, how many people they’d had sex with. The contestants were also asked how many “bodies” they thought were too many for the opposite gender. When one man, who claimed that he’d had sex with 150 women, said 10 men was too many for a woman, the girls called him out, and he was dumped shortly after. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“For me, that lines right up with the very sex-positive, pro-sex approach that we take on the show,” says Thomas. “Which is to say, we’re not coupling you up to get married, like some sort of puritanical goal of like, if you’re having fun in the sun, you must get married at the end of it. That’s not the purpose of this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though <em>Love Island USA</em> is now exclusively on streaming and therefore isn’t beholden to federal broadcasting regulations, Thomas says they’re still careful about how much they show — and it’s still less than the UK version. “We watched a cut the other day of a couple having sex, and my thought was, ‘This is too much. It doesn’t add to the story to see this.’ The audience should know they’re having sex, but you do it in a more playful way, where you see a little rustle of a blanket, you hear a giggle. It’s not rocket science.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s Thong City in there, which we never could have done on the network”</p><cite>— Simon Thomas</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The swimsuits, however, are sexier than ever: When the show was originally airing on CBS, he says, the contestants weren’t allowed to wear thong bikinis. “We’re bums out all the time now. It’s Thong City in there, which we never could have done on the network.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That <em>Love Island</em> is silly and campy; that there are jiggling bottoms in thongs; that at any moment you are at risk of hearing a dark piano version of Kylie Minogue’s “Can’t Get You Out of My Head,” and that it is emphatically not meant to end with a man down on one knee feels like a much-needed evolution in American reality TV, which, after two decades of perfecting the form, is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/3/17/24101977/messy-legal-drama-bravo-explained-rachel-leviss-leah-mcsweeney\">in a transitional period</a>. Former cast members of series like<em> Love Is Blind</em> and the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bravo-lawsuits-leah-mcsweeney-caroline-manzo-brandi-glanville-explained-2024-3#:~:text=In%20January%202024%2C%20Caroline%20Manzo,Media%20(a%20production%20company%20behind\"><em>Real Housewives</em></a> are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5021949/emmily-nussbaum-reality-tv-cue-the-sun#:~:text=One%20suit%2C%20which%20has%20been,false%20imprisonment%20and%20sexual%20assault.\">suing production companies</a> for labor violations, pushing alcohol consumption, and turning a blind eye to sexual harassment and assault. <em>Love Island</em> has never been perfect, either; the UK version has seen two former cast members and one host commit suicide after enduring relentless public scrutiny, though new measures have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/22/love-island-and-the-concerns-about-psychological-distress-that-wont-go-away\">attempted to address contestants’ mental health</a>. Even in that turbulent landscape, <em>Love Island USA</em> is trying to recapture something that&#8217;s been missing from American reality TV and that the UK version excelled at: fun for its own sake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans have always had a complicated relationship to hedonism, our first colonists having been shipped away from the British Empire for being literal Puritans. It only took 400-odd years, but perhaps a truly great season of <em>Love Island USA,</em> coupled with a violent desire to escape the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">depressing drip of political news</a>, has finally encouraged us to revel in the basest forms of entertainment.

Bradley, we’re being told, can do it all: the beautiful prose with the serious ideas and the smoldering romance. Plus time travel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s most impressive is that <em>The Ministry of Time</em> pretty much lives up to the promises of the cover. The love story is tense and sexy. The sentences unroll smooth and elegant. The exploration of how colonialism rewires our brains is sophisticated and compelling. And the time travel and its after-effects are pretty fascinating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the world of <em>The Ministry of Time</em>, the British government has discovered the technology for time travel. To test it, they’ve plucked people out of history right when they would have died. Our unnamed narrator is a government bureaucrat assigned to help a Victorian explorer adjust to life in the 21st century. They fall in love, of course, but it’s a lot more complicated than that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read if you</em>:<em> </em>like Diana Wynne Jones, Graham Greene wartime spy novels, the first season of <em>Sleepy Hollow</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fhenry-henry-allen-bratton%2F20223706%3Fean%3D9781961884021\"><em>Henry Henry</em></a> by Allen Bratton</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Shakespeare’s <em>Henry IV</em>, dissolute Prince Hal has a curious soliloquy. Hal, we know, will grow up to be beloved King Henry V, one of the great warrior kings of England —&nbsp;but right now he’s frittering away his youth on partying and pissing off his dad. But that’s okay, Hal explains to the audience, because he’s being bad on purpose. Later, when he becomes good, his goodness will be all the more impressive because of his past debauchery.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the tension of the three plays that make up the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriad#Three-play_Henriad\">Henriad</a> —&nbsp;Hal’s story — comes from the ambiguity of how seriously you should take Hal’s soliloquy, because his plan doesn’t make all that much sense. It is, however, extremely Catholic, all knotted up around the problems of guilt and pleasure and atonement. That’s an idea debut novelist Allen Bratton fully grasps and explores in <em>Henry Henry</em>, a queer contemporary retelling of the Henriad that leaves behind questions of kingship and England to focus on the issue of Hal’s soul.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Henry Henry</em>, Hal is one of England’s rare Catholic aristocrats, tormented both by his gayness and by his fraught relationship with his father. He smothers his anguish in dissolute and bitchy debauchery, but he can’t help hating and admiring in equal measure Henry Percy Hotspur, the man Hal’s father wants him to be. The results are gorgeous, sexy, funny, and sad, and Bratton renders them all while taking a palpable pleasure in language that will warm a Shakespearean’s heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read if you:</em> know the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Crispin%27s_Day_Speech\">St. Crispin’s Day speech</a> by heart, have opinions on <em>The Hollow Crown</em>, just want a satisfying queer romance.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fpractice-rosalind-brown%2F20374769%3Fean%3D9780374613013\"><em>Practice</em></a> by Rosalind Brown</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The debut novel from Rosalind Brown tells the deceptively simple story of Oxford undergraduate Annabel as she takes a day to labor over an essay on Shakespeare’s sonnets. Shades of <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>! (Annabel is a Woolf fan.) In Brown’s precise, elegant prose, we watch Annabel go through the carefully plotted rituals of her day: mint tea upon awakening, which builds to coffee after sufficient examination of the sonnets; a long walk through the town to wake up her mind; the habitual defecation after a too-heavy lunch in the dining hall. All the while, she thinks through her relationship with her older lover, and whether or not she should allow him to disturb the monastic solitude of her work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a deep satisfaction in reading about the details of Annabel’s day —&nbsp;the discipline of the well-chosen activities fighting against the natural sleepy indolence of the mind, and the clear pleasure Annabel takes in exercising her thoughts. Most impressive is Brown’s depiction of having an ongoing fantasy that stretches out for years and that you slip into and out of at odd moments of the day. Annabel is deeply immersed in an imagined romance between two men she has invented, and she flits through scenes of their life as she gets bored or distracted. It&nbsp;rings deeply true to life, in a way I have never quite seen an author conjure before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read accompanied by</em>: a piece of very crisp toast, lightly buttered, and a cup of deep amber Darjeeling tea to savor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fgreat-expectations-vinson-cunningham%2F20028586%3Fean%3D9780593448236\">Great Expectations</a></em> by Vinson Cunningham</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Great-Expectations.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.307347839006,100,35.385304321987\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/em&gt; (not that one) by Vinson Cunningham | Hogarth\" data-portal-copyright=\"Hogarth\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Great Expectations</em> is the first novel by New Yorker cultural critic Vinson Cunningham, who displays an admirable hubris in his decision to give his book one of the best-known titles in the English corpus. Loosely based on Cunningham’s experience working on the first Obama presidential campaign in 2008, it takes place almost entirely within the presidential campaign of a figure Cunningham will call only “the Senator” or “the Candidate.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">David, Cunningham’s protagonist, is a college dropout and single dad who feels aimless. Desperate, he parlays his high school reputation for brilliance into a job working with the campaign everyone is talking about: the first-term senator who may just become America’s first Black president.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cunningham seeds his narrative with the kind of inside baseball shop talk that political junkies will adore. He relishes little details like where campaign staffers sleep while they’re in the field; how they learn to watch the faces of the crowd when the Candidate speaks so they know who to ask for checks at the end; how they remind benefit attendees to follow “airplane rules” as they make their way through metal detectors to get close to the Candidate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">David sketches out this minutiae not because he’s interested in politics, exactly, but because he’s interested in small and telling grace notes. He likes to notice the way a preacher holds his microphone, or the way wealthy Black donors call Martha’s Vineyard “the island.” This is a novel of manners, where the signifiers of class and aesthetics take on enormous weight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In part, Cunningham suggests, that’s because at the dawn of the Obama era, it felt as though everything might symbolize something else. Pop culture could mean politics and politics could mean pop culture. Your taste in music could speak to your ethics. One man’s political victory might mean the end of American racism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the drama of the novel is the way David is at first seduced by these ideas and then discards them. The whole way through, Cunningham’s sentences are so perfectly balanced you feel you could rap them with a stick and they would ring like crystal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read alongside</em>: Henry James’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-bostonians-henry-james/6767782?ean=9780140437669\"><em>The Bostonians</em></a>, the true 19th-century analogue to this novel.

Then, it was Tenochtitlán, the seat of the emperor Moctezuma and the Aztec empire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Spanish plan to sack the city. Moctezuma plans to steal their horses, the sole technological improvement the Spanish seem to have on the lavish Aztec way of life. Over the course of the novel, people sneak around the various sumptuous palaces, nibbling at hallucinogens and trying to figure out if today is the day they’ll be beheaded, tortured, or ritually executed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet despite the bloodiness of the setting, this is a playful and witty book. Enrigue is interested in how people in dangerous proximity to power manage their lives and their own status. He is interested, also, in the arbitrary flow of history, of how easily <em>this</em> moment might have become <em>that</em> one instead. His prose is hallucinatory, kaleidoscopic. As Moctezuma trips on magic mushrooms, he sees Enrigue writing <em>You Dreamed of Empires</em> and hears T. Rex’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlRx_Ky7A6c\">Monolith</a>.” I promise, it all makes sense in context.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read accompanied by</em>: thick, rich mole and the smokiest mezcal you can find.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-hunter-tana-french%2F20155404%3Fean%3D9780593493434\"><em>The Hunter</em></a> by Tana French</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tana French developed a cult following writing rich, chewy literary thrillers, full of propulsive pacing and murder mysteries so carefully thought out they doubled as character studies for the detectives who investigated them. French built her name on her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/27/20978200/tana-french-dublin-murder-series\">Dublin Murder Squad series</a>, which focused on a crew of Irish detectives and their fraught, vexed relationships with their partners in crime-solving. That ended in 2016, and her most recent books (2020’s <em>The Searcher</em> in addition to <em>The Hunter</em>) have begun to form their own series, all about parents and children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The parent and child in question here aren’t technically related. Cal is a Chicago cop who’s moved to the tiny Irish village of Ardnakelty to live out his retirement. Trey is a half-feral teenage girl from the wrong side of town whose father Johnny walked out and whose older brother is missing. In <em>The Searcher</em>, she gets Cal to go looking for the brother. By the time <em>The Hunter</em> rolls around, the whole town understands that Cal has unofficially adopted Trey —&nbsp;which makes matters difficult when Johnny returns to get the locals to buy into a new get-rich-quick scheme he’s cooked up. (<em>The Hunter</em> does not really make sense if you have not read <em>The Searcher</em>, although it’s by and large a more consistent novel than its predecessor.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Cal struggles to find a way to protect a girl over whom he has no legal rights, Trey and Johnny redevelop their own wary, mercenary relationship. The great question of this book is what parents and children owe to each other, and what such a bond should look like. French, as is her wont, offers us no easy answers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read if you like</em>: Ishiguro’s <em>Klara and the Sun</em>, ambiguously supernatural influences, elaborate scheming.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fall-fours-miranda-july%2F20578438%3Fean%3D9780593190265\"><em>All Fours</em></a> by Miranda July</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What a strange and satisfying novel <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/356053/miranda-july-all-fours-idea-of-you-age-gap-menopause\"><em>All Fours</em></a> is. It concerns an unnamed narrator, a performance artist who, upon coming into a windfall of $20,000, plans to blow it all on a cross-country road trip to New York and a lavish hotel room. Instead, she ends up at a crummy motel in the first suburb she comes across, spending all her new money on redecorating the motel room to her precise specifications: pink, with Louis Vuitton furniture, botanical wallpaper, tonka bean-scented diffusers, and an antique pink quilt on the bed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The motel room starts as a place in which the narrator can conduct a steamy but sexless affair with a younger man. Over the course of the novel, it becomes a place for her to work, to commune with her friends, to be fully herself. <em>All Fours</em> is a quirky-smart dissection of women, aging, desire, and marriage all in one. What are the chances?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read if you</em>: would like to paint your Room of Your Own a tasteful shade of pink; really felt Fleabag when she said her greatest fear was losing the currency of youth.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-practice-the-horizon-and-the-chain-sofia-samatar%2F20001588%3Fean%3D9781250881809\"><em>The Practice, the Horizon, and the Chain</em></a> by Sofia Samatar</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/9781250881809.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,33.641468061083,100,32.717063877833\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Practice, the Horizon, and the Chain&lt;/em&gt;, by Sofia Samatar | Tordotcom\" data-portal-copyright=\"Tordotcom\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This novella is an elegant and thoughtful take on Ursula K. Le Guin’s famous “<a href=\"https://shsdavisapes.pbworks.com/f/Omelas.pdf\">The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas</a>.” Le Guin’s short story imagines a beautiful paradise that is made to function because of a single child who is being tortured in a basement. Samatar’s novella imagines a fleet of spaceships powered by an underclass held in chains below decks, and a professor who develops a scholarship program to bring one of the boys in chains to the world above.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The allegory Samatar develops in this world is rich and compelling, but what strikes me most about the world she’s built is how fully she’s imagined its physical details. When the boy comes up to the upper levels for the first time in his life, he’s untethered from the chain that attaches him to everyone below deck. Without their counterbalancing weight, he has to relearn how to walk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What a quietly devastating detail. What a completely imagined world Samatar has built in these slight pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read accompanied by:</em> A small and exquisite bowl of fish soup, something like bouillabaisse scented with saffron, and a glass of good chilled white wine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fcommitted-a-meditation-on-grief-madness-and-meaning-suzanne-scanlon%2F20272661%3Fean%3D9780593469101\"><em>Committed: On Meaning and Madwomen</em></a> by Suzanne Scanlon</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Toward the end of <em>Committed</em>, Suzanne Scanlon’s layered and lovely new book that is part memoir, part literary history, the author recalls recounting her medical history to a new psychiatrist. She mentions that in her early 20s, she spent three years in the New York State Psychiatric Institute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new psychiatrist protests: Such a thing couldn’t possibly have happened. Everyone knows that you don’t keep mental patients hospitalized for so long. It makes them worse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes, Scanlon replies, she knows. She lived through it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scanlon checked herself into the hospital as a 20-year-old college student in 1992 after a suicide attempt. The place was a panopticon: dorms and common spaces radiating out in spokes from a central nurse’s station, where a portrait of Freud kept a watchful eye over all the patients. Fresh air and exercise weren’t considered part of the treatment plan; patients stayed inside all day, smoking and watching television.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the hospital, Scanlon’s doctors, she writes, “needed me to get better and instead I got better at being sick.” She craved their attention and care, and she learned to perform her illness in ways her doctors found legible and diagnosable. She would later learn that the hospital was in the midst of a debate over what to do with people like Scanlon. It was the dawn of the SSRI era, and doctors were torn. Should depression be treated like a chemical imbalance? Or was Freudian talk therapy the only true cure?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scanlon’s treatment plans swung uneasily from one to the other as conflicting models ruled the day at the hospital. When she finally got out, it wasn’t because she was deemed cured or even better. It was because the state stopped funding inpatient therapy for that long.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the end, what was most healing to Scanlon was the vast body of writing by and about women and madness and hospitalization: Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf and Audre Lorde and Marguerite Duras. It’s through reading and rereading their work that she’s able to find a skeleton of meaning regarding what happened to her in the years she lived in the hospital —&nbsp;and a way of thinking about her own identity that doesn’t require a fixed idea of selfhood.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read equipped with</em>: pen and paper to take notes of all the books Scanlon talks about that you’ll want to read by the time she’s done with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flong-island-colm-toibin%2F20696246%3Fean%3D9781476785110\"><em>Long Island</em></a> by Colm Tóibín</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/long-island-9781476785110_hr.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.655364571848,100,34.689270856305\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Long Island&lt;/em&gt; by Colm Tóibín | Scribner Book Company\" data-portal-copyright=\"Scribner Book Company\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2009, Colm Tóibín published <em>Brooklyn</em>, a quietly stunning portrait of how young Eilis Lacey makes her way from her small Irish town of Enniscorthy to America in the 1950s. With <em>Long Island</em>, he picks up Eilis’s story again in the 1970s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eilis is middle-aged now, and a mother, settled with her husband Tony in a cul-de-sac populated entirely by his extended Italian American family on Long Island. Eilis sometimes finds herself isolated in this large clan of in-laws, and fights multiple pitched battles of wills against Tony’s mother. Still, she’s largely content with her life —&nbsp;until she learns that Tony has slept with someone else, his mistress is pregnant, and the plan is to leave the baby with Eilis and Tony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The baby will not pass the threshold,” Eilis tells Tony, who doesn’t dare to disagree with her face-to-face but won’t acquiesce either. So Eilis packs up her things and goes back to Enniscorthy for the first time in 20 years. If the baby is in her house when she returns, she decides, she simply won’t move back in with Tony. But once in Enniscorthy, she finds that she can’t quite turn her back on her past as easily as she’d like to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tóibín’s genius is the quietness of his worlds. His characters always exist at a slight remove from their own actions, unable to quite see why they’re making the choices they’ve made, try as they might to analyze and rationalize after the fact. With Eilis’s return home, he’s given us a portrait of middle-aged regrets, handled so lightly that he makes it look easy. It’s not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Read far away from</em>: your phone, so that you don’t end up texting your high school sweetheart in a book-drunk daze.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

J.D. Vance at the Republican National Convention this past week. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the stranger narratives to emerge from the Republican National Convention this past week is the reception of Usha Vance. Usha is married to Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, former President Donald Trump’s pick for vice president. Should Trump and Vance win in November, Usha will be the second lady of the United States. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Viewers noted that Usha’s heritage and identity — Usha’s parents are South Asian immigrants and she’s of Indian descent — appear to be at odds with her husband’s and the larger party’s politics, specifically the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23484314/trump-fuentes-ye-dinner-white-nationalism-supremacy\">implicitly racist and explicitly xenophobic parts</a>. Usha introduced herself and her husband at the convention on Wednesday, after speakers spent most of the previous day hammering home <a href=\"https://x.com/Young25Tim/status/1813732725091922330\">anti-immigrant rhetoric</a>, some dipping into extremist fear-mongering and accusing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop\">immigrants of rape and murder</a>. Despite previously <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian\">insulting Trump</a>, her husband’s political stance has, of late, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/jd-vance-abortion-immigration-issues.html\">closely resembled the former president’s</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-deport-20-million-immigrants-reduce-home-prices-rents-2024-7\">anti-immigrant</a> sentiment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While she spoke, the audience waved “mass deportation” signs — ostensibly not directly at her but in support of the general anti-immigration stance of the Republican platform. Perhaps it’s not surprising that far-right Republicans have begun <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/rnc-convention-usha-vance-maga-attacks/\">attacking Usha</a> and denigrating her and her husband’s mixed-race family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The perceived conflict between Usha’s background and Republican politics has created another reaction, too, one steeped in a particular stripe of sexism: that Usha is somehow a victim or reluctant participant in, if not a hostage to, her husband’s political ambitions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some political reporters have started to “read” her body language, surmising that she’s “<a href=\"https://x.com/jbendery/status/1814136365329641709\">uneasy</a>” or unwilling to be in this position. <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/who-is-jd-vances-wife-usha-and-why-isnt-she-raring-to-become-second-lady\">The Daily Beast</a> took one moment of Usha looking at her husband during the convention, and came to the conclusion that this was a woman trapped: stuck in love with a man who made a Faustian bargain with Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“But then the smile faded and at other moments she appeared fatigued and had a ‘What am I doing here?’ look,” the Daily Beast’s Michael Daly wrote. He added, “And when he and Usha gazed at each other there was a spark of what appeared to be true love, even in MAGAland. Then she had a look that made you hope that the heart will prove to be enough when your husband has sold his soul.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From mannerism analysis to the musings about love in a hopeless place to the “poor Usha” projection, it all assumes that Usha Vance ultimately disapproves of her husband’s political ideologies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Usha is not a shrinking violet nor a political babe in the woods: she graduated from Yale Law School, just like her husband, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/usha-vance-attorney-jd-vance-wife-vp-63406da4f6739546391ed7797fc1fef2\">clerked</a> for conservative judges like Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, when he was still an appeals court judge, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/style/usha-vance-jd-vance.html\">then</a> for Chief Justice John Roberts. Later, she worked as a trial lawyer at a white-shoe law firm. As of 2022, she was registered as a Republican in Ohio, where her husband ran for Senate.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2162463444.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A sea of white people, many wearing cowboy hats and US flag shirts, wave signs that read &quot;Mass deportation now.&quot;\" title=\"A sea of white people, many wearing cowboy hats and US flag shirts, wave signs that read &quot;Mass deportation now.&quot;\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The crowd that Usha Vance, a daughter of South Asian immigrants, was speaking to at the Republican National Convention. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Alex Wong/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If that “silently disapproving wife” trope sounds familiar, it’s because political reporters and commentators <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/on-pitying-melania/514409/\">portrayed former first lady Melania Trump</a> in a similar fashion. Some even went so far as positing a fantasy that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/21/jimmy-kimmel-melania-trump-late-night-tv\">secretly hates him</a>. It wasn’t until recordings of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21497443/melania-trump-recording-tapes\">Melania</a> downplaying the separation of migrant families at the border leaked in 2020 that the myth of Melania being an unwilling partner to her husband was shattered. Still, some continue to <a href=\"https://okmagazine.com/p/donald-trump-ridiculed-wife-melania-avoid-kissing-lips-rnc/\">perpetuate that idea</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Former second lady Karen Pence was often <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/matthew-tully/2014/12/04/tully-karen-pence-discusses-political-parenting-liberal-daughter/19890425/\">quoted</a> as being apolitical and non-influential when it came to her husband’s politics too, as he served in Congress and as governor of Indiana. It created the impression that she was some kind of spiritual bystander. But when he was picked by Trump, her facade dropped and she was revealed to be one of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/karen-pence-is-the-vice-presidents-prayer-warrior-gut-check-and-shield/2017/03/28/3d7a26ce-0a01-11e7-8884-96e6a6713f4b_story.html\">biggest Trump supporters</a> in the former veep’s inner circle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether it’s people <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/31/opinions/heidi-cruz-deserves-better-donald-trump-hossain/index.html\">feeling awful for Heidi Cruz</a>, insisting that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/tiffany-trump-wedding/index.html\">Tiffany Trump is not close</a> to her family even though she keeps appearing at big events, hoping against all odds about <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/08/why-liberals-shouldn-t-like-laura-bush.html\">Laura Bush’s beliefs</a>, or speculating about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/06/is-there-a-hidden-hillary-clinton-vote-among-women/\">secret Hillary voters</a> in Trumpland, there’s an inclination to distance Republican women from the Republican men they support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Data about mixed political marriage isn’t extensive, but according to <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/marriages-between-democrats-and-republicans-are-extremely-rare#:~:text=Today%2C%20only%2021%25%20of%20marriages,compared%20because%20of%20different%20methods.\">an analysis</a> of Deseret News and Brigham Young University’s <a href=\"https://media.deseret.com/media/misc/pdf/afs/2023-american-family-survey.pdf?_gl=1*2d9gns*_ga*MTYwNjc2NjcxNC4xNzIxNDIxNDUx*_ga_YNRPD2MVFD*MTcyMTQyMTQ1MS4xLjEuMTcyMTQyMjQ5Ni41NS4wLjA.\">2023 American Family Survey</a>, only 21 percent of marriages are politically mixed and roughly just 4 percent are between Democrats and Republicans. People don’t tend to marry people whose political beliefs stray too far from their own. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The left-leaning rationalization about Usha Vance and her ilk is a type of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/15/13571478/trump-president-sexual-assault-sexism-misogyny-won\">benevolent sexism</a>, the idea that women are naturally the kinder, gentler sex, in need of protection and unwilling to voice their true opinions. On the surface, the act doesn’t seem overtly malicious — hence the “benevolence.” But ascribing these traits to women undercuts their autonomy and attempts to exonerate them from their own choices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Usha’s case, any look that could be interpreted as dismay — when in reality it could be fatigue, or even simply a lack of media training — is a signal to some that she’s a damsel in distress. Certainly a woman with her education and resume would be very capable of divorcing a husband she fully disagrees with. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only person who knows what Usha’s true intentions are or how she really feels about her husband and his politics is Usha Vance herself. She could very well share some of the sentiments of the benevolently sexist narrative that’s been created about her. She could also be sitting on those reservations for her own private reasons, from love to ambition and anything in between. The more likely possibility, though, is that she does not disagree with J.D. Vance. A completely reasonable thing to assume is that his politics are her politics, even if that’s hard for some to accept. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the political vitriol she’s already facing from her husband’s own party, that does paint a complicated picture. To some, that’s why she’ll always need saving — even if it’s in the form of melodramatic fanfic.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

You need to ensure you give yourself enough time to get to the airport, and, once there, you have to contend with potentially long lines at bag drop and security. Without fail, you either have too much time or no time at all at the gate before boarding. Aside from timing, many of the conditions around air travel are out of the passenger’s control, including flight cancellations and delays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the United States, just under 20 percent of flights have been delayed in 2024, according to the US Department of Transportation’s <a href=\"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/homedrillchart.asp\">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>. And on Friday, more <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/travel/tech-outage-us-airlines-ground-stops.html\">than 2,400 flights were canceled</a> across the country and thousands more delayed <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/361740/crowdstrike-outage-windows\">as a massive tech outage</a> touching multiple industries caused chaos in airports.<strong> </strong>Stranded at the airport, frustrated passengers may feel out of options. But you do have a few cards in your hand: reschedule, refund, request, or wait it out. Here are some answers to help you make a plan should you find yourself waiting out a delayed or canceled flight.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What causes flight delays and cancellations?</h2>\n\n<p>The DOT’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics <a href=\"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp\">tracks the causes of flight delays</a>. For the past few years, air carrier delays and airplanes arriving late have been the <a href=\"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E\">most common reasons</a> for flight delays. A <a href=\"https://aspm.faa.gov/aspmhelp/index/Types_of_Delay.html\">carrier delay includes</a> circumstances like cleaning the airplane, damage to the plane, waiting for connecting passengers or crew to arrive, fueling, and maintenance — all of which are controllable by the airline.</p>\n\n<p>The second-most common cause for a flight delay was the aircraft arriving late — which can be caused by weather. In 2021, weather accounted for <a href=\"https://www.bts.gov/content/weathers-share-delay-percent-total-delay-minutes-year\">26 percent</a> of total delays that year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The causes for <a href=\"https://www.bts.gov/topics/airlines-and-airports/understanding-reporting-causes-flight-delays-and-cancellations\">flight cancellations are the same as delays</a>: air carrier, extreme weather, National Aviation System issues (like non-extreme weather, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control), and security (like needing to evacuate, or reboard because of a security breach or long lines at security).</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3933799602\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I have an upcoming flight. What can I do to prepare?</h2>\n\n<p>Before you leave for the airport, make sure you’ve signed up for text alerts and downloaded the airline’s app (turn on its notifications) or the <a href=\"https://flightaware.com/mobile/\">FlightAware</a> app to get real-time flight information. If your flight is delayed or canceled well in advance, you can make adjusted plans from the comfort of a hotel or loved one’s home instead of the chaos of the airport.</p>\n\n<p>Take a few photos of your luggage so that if it gets lost down the line, you can provide an accurate description of what it looks like. Travel expert Gary Leff of the travel blog <a href=\"https://viewfromthewing.com/\">View from the Wing</a> also recommends putting an Apple AirTag in your luggage so you can track your suitcase’s exact location, whether it’s halfway across the country or at baggage claim.</p>\n\n<p>Familiarize yourself with the services your airline provides in the event of a delay or cancellation so you know how to advocate for yourself and other passengers. The DOT’s <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard\">Airline Customer Service Dashboard</a> details various amenities airlines have committed to providing should a flight be canceled for reasons the airline can control, like maintenance or crew problems, but not weather. These services include rebooking your ticket for free on the same airline (or a partner airline) or a meal voucher for delays longer than three hours.</p>\n\n<p>Your credit card might also offer trip delay coverage or baggage delay coverage where the cost of your hotel, meals, and expenses are reimbursed. Chase Sapphire Reserve, the Platinum Card from American Express, and Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card are among the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/cards-with-trip-delay-reimbursement/\">credit cards offering these protections</a>, but check your credit card contract for exact details.</p>\n\n<p>Some airlines, like <a href=\"https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/change-fee.html\">United</a> and <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/us/en/travel-planning-center/change-or-cancel-your-trip/cancel-change-requirements\">Delta</a>, don’t have change fees for economy tickets and above, so you can change your flight for free if a delay is stretching on longer than you’d like and there’s a more convenient flight on the same air carrier. Check with your airline to make sure you’re not paying extra if you do try to change your flight.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My flight is perpetually delayed. I need to get out of this airport.</h2>\n\n<p>For delays that extend overnight due to controllable issues, many airlines — including American, Delta, Spirit, Southwest, and United — offer complimentary hotel accommodations, per the DOT Airline Customer Service Dashboard. Many of these airlines provide free transportation to the hotel, too. Extreme weather doesn’t fall under the “controllable” reasons an airline would offer these services, but if you’re stuck due to a weather delay, it’s still worth asking.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers dealing with <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds\">“significant” delays are entitled to a full refund</a> should they choose not to travel. The DOT hasn’t defined what constitutes a “significant” delay, but rather decides on a case-by-case basis taking into account the length of the delay and the length of the flight. Under normal circumstances, refunds are issued fairly quickly, Leff says.</p>\n\n<p>For airlines that won’t cover hotel stays and meals, go to the baggage service office in baggage claim and ask about the <a href=\"https://www.smartertravel.com/stuck-at-the-airport-request-a-hotel-distressed-traveler-rate/\">distressed traveler rate</a>, Leff says. “When the airline is not paying for the hotel, they may have discounts available on hotels through their own negotiated rates, and the hotels provide that discount because they want the business from the airline,” he explains. “So you may get a better rate than if you were booking directly yourself. It’s not a publicly available rate.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My flight was canceled. What now?</h2>\n\n<p>Regardless of the reason for cancellation, every passenger is <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds\">entitled to a full refund</a> should they choose not to rebook.</p>\n\n<p>For delays and cancellations, Leff says the best course of action is to avoid long lines at the airline counter at the airport. “Standing in hours and hours-long lines is probably not going to get you information that’s even going to be useful,” he says. But do exhaust all of your options: Try calling, getting in touch via social media, chatting through the mobile app or with staff at the club level, looking at other flight options on other airlines, or plotting a route via train or bus. “You are best off looking at flight options yourself as though you were buying anew, knowing that with a canceled flight you’ll get your money back, and then you have at least the option to submit to Southwest receipts for some level of reimbursement,” Leff says of passengers dealing with that particular situation.</p>\n\n<p>Just remember the airline staff, on the phone and at the airport, are not responsible for your travel headaches and are not the people on whom to unleash your frustrations. Be nice.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I finally landed. Where’s my luggage?</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes passengers get separated from their luggage, leaving people without clothes and toiletries in a new location. When your bags don’t make it to your destination, speak with a member of airport staff immediately. They may have paperwork for you to fill out describing the physical attributes of your suitcase and its contents. Hopefully, the airport can locate and deliver your bag to you in a timely manner. (Before you depart, make sure there are no irreplaceable items, like keys, or things you’ll need immediately, like medication, in your checked luggage.)</p>\n\n<p>The most an airline can pay a passenger for permanently lost luggage <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights#Baggage\">is $3,800</a> for domestic flights. Again, airlines may reimburse you for items you needed to purchase while your suitcase was missing, so keep receipts.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to air travel, there are many factors that can, and at some point, will, go awry. Have a plan (and a backup plan), know what expenses airlines will cover, and try to anticipate potential headaches.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, July 19, 2024:</strong> This piece was originally published on December 28, 2022, and has been updated to include news about July 2024’s tech outage and ensuing flight delays and cancellations, along with more recent data on delays.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/even-better\"><em>Even Better</em></a><em> is here to offer deeply sourced, actionable advice for helping you live a better life.
